local , and long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , such as structured ground states @xcite , solitons @xcite , and roton - maxon spectra @xcite . \n dipolar condensates have recently been realized with atoms of @xmath1cr @xcite , @xmath0dy @xcite and @xmath2er @xcite . \n furthermore , there has been vast progress in the realization of a condensate with polar molecules with an electric dipole moment @xcite . \n two examples for the recent study of effects due to the ddi have been the experimental investigation of the collapse dynamics @xcite and the inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud @xcite of a dipolar @xmath1cr bec . in the former case \n the scattering length was ramped down below the collapse threshold and absorption images were made after the collapse and explosion of the condensate . \n the density distribution inherited the d - wave symmetry @xmath3 of the ddi . in the latter case \n the dipolar forces were shown to inhibit the inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud , which usually occurs during a time of flight . \n an exhaustive review of the physics of dipolar quantum gases has recently been given by lahaye _ \n _ @xcite and baranov _ et al . \n _ @xcite .    in this paper \n , we use the extended gross - pitaevskii equation to calculate the dynamics of a condensate , which yields an accurate description for sufficiently low temperatures and reads    @xmath4    with @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the number of particles , @xmath7 is the dipole length , and @xmath8 denotes the scattering length . \n the dipoles are aligned along the @xmath9-axis , such that @xmath10 is the angle between the @xmath9-axis and the vector @xmath11 . \n this form implies that all lengths are scaled in units of @xmath12 and all energies in units of @xmath13 . \n the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 control the strength of the scattering and the dipole interaction , respectively , and are assumed to be independently adjustable . \n the ratio @xmath16 is a measure for the importance of the dipole interaction . \n the strength of short - ranged interactions , which can be described by a fermi - like contact interaction , can be controlled by means of a feshbach - resonance @xcite . \n an external magnetic field changes the coupling between a bound state and a state of an incoming particle and allows for the control of the scattering length . \n this can be used to increase @xmath17 and therefore to enhance the dipolar character of the condensate . \n however , since feshbach - resonances reduce the lifetime of a condensate , one prefers the realization of condensates with larger magnetic moments . \n of all the above mentioned species with permanent magnetic dipole moments , @xmath0dy stands out with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the bohr magneton . \n our results can be scaled and are therefore valid for all dipolar systems . \n however , we are in particular interested in a condensate with @xmath0dy , which means that in the following all parameters are adjusted to fit the needs of a condensate with this species . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first fully numerical three - dimensional study for a realistic set of parameters close to those in actual experimental setups . \n we emphasize that our calculations do not depend on any further simplifications or restrictions beyond the use of a mean - field ansatz .    in the next section \n we give a short introduction to our numerical method and present our results with respect to expansion dynamics , structured ground states and a self - induced josephson junction . \n we solve the gross - pitaevskii equation numerically exact on a grid by means of the split - operator method using the imaginary- and real - time evolution . \n this yields a series of fourier transforms , which we evaluate with a highly parallelized algorithm using the cuda - architecture of nvidia . a more detailed overview is given in @xcite . for the calculation of stability and phase diagrams \n we start with a simple gaussian for a set of parameters far away from the stability border . \n this border is given by the maximum value ( in this paper either the angle of rotation @xmath20 or the number of particles @xmath6 ) for which the imaginary - time evolution converges and a stationary ground state exists . \n after the calculation of the ground state , we use this wave function as the initial wave function for the calculation of the next set of parameters , where we keep the aspect ratio or @xmath17 constant until we reach the stability border . since our computational ressources allow for a very small step size \n , we can make very precise predictions with respect to stability and phase diagrams . \n one possible setup for the experimental investigation of dipolar signatures in condensates is to tilt the polarization axis with respect to the external confinement by means of an external magnetic field and investigate its expansion dynamics . \n the influence of the ddi should manifest itself in a deviation of the expansion dynamics as compared to a condensate which is strongly dominated by isotropic short - ranged interactions . \n the most clear evidence would be a tof ( time of flight ) sequence in which the direction of the largest width of the cloud coincides with the polarization axis , regardless of the initial confinement . in this paper \n we study the equivalent scenario , where we rotate the external trap and the dipoles remain permanently aligned in @xmath9-direction . \n a tilt of the polarization axis clockwise in the @xmath21-plane corresponds to a rotation of the trap anti - clockwise along the @xmath22-direction . \n the corresponding transformation of the coordinates reads    @xmath23    fig . \n [ fig : expansion ] shows absorption images of three tof sequences with @xmath24 and different rotation angles @xmath20 . for absorption images in the @xmath22- and @xmath9-direction \n we integrate @xmath25 along the @xmath22- and @xmath9-axis , respectively . \n the first seqence at the top shows a tof for initial harmonic trapping with @xmath26 hz and @xmath27 , where we have used the trapping parameters from @xcite . since an anisotropic confinement yields an anisotropic momentum distribution \n , we see an inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud . \n the tof does not show any signature of the dipole - dipole interaction since the dynamics of the condensate is dominated almost entirely by the anisotropic momentum distribution . \n therefore in the middle panels we reduce the aspect ratio of the trap and adjust the confinement to @xmath28 hz and @xmath29 . for this setup \n the dynamics of the condensate is in stark contrast to the tof above since the expansion seems to be governed by the direction of the strongest initial confinement and the polarization axis . \n this can be cleary seen by the fact , that the direction of smallest width for 0 ms is not the direction which dominates the tof , as is the case for the sequence above . \n therefore this expansion dynamics strikes a balance between the direction that is given by the anisotropic momentum distribution and the polarization direction which is energetically preferable . \n the last tof shows absorption images in @xmath9-direction for @xmath26 hz and @xmath30 . \n here we see a blood - cell structured condensate where the density peak is away from the center @xcite , which occurs about 6 ms after the release from the trap ( for better visibility see fig . \n [ fig:1d_absorption_image ] ) . \n note that the initial density distribution in the @xmath31-plane is given by a gaussian . \n therefore the structured state is not an artifact from the stationary ground state but rather a product of the expansion dynamics . \n the crucial parameter for the experimental oberservation of structured states is the visibility    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    with @xmath34 as the maximum value and @xmath35 as the value in the center of the plane . \n the visibility @xmath36 should be at least at about 0.1 to allow for a high - contrast imaging of the density distribution . \n it turns out that for all angles @xmath20 the visibility is smaller than this benchmark . for the smallest angle @xmath30 \n we find @xmath37 , whereas for @xmath38 the corresponding visibility is @xmath39 . \n additionaly , as can be seen in fig . \n [ fig:1d_absorption_image ] , where we depict the quantities    @xmath40    the rotation of the external confinement destroys the rotational symmetry in the @xmath31-plane and leads to a saddle - shaped structured state . \n the small value of @xmath36 during the expansion dynamics suggests that such structured states can only be seen if modern imaging systems are further improved or systems with very large dipolar moments such as polar molecules are used . \n structured states are not only a feature of dynamical processes , but do occur as stationary ground states as well . in this section \n we investigate where in the parameter space these structured states occur and if their visibility is large enough to satisfy the above mentioned criterion of @xmath41 . \n [ fig : stability_visibility ] depicts the stability border for four different values of @xmath17 and a phase diagram of the visibility of structured ground states for @xmath42 with respect to the angle of rotation @xmath20 and the aspect ratio of the trap @xmath43 with @xmath44 hz , and @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 particles . \n an increase of the angle of rotation or a reduction of the aspect ratio results in more dipoles in the attractive head - to - tail configuration , and thus destabilizes the condensate . \n these parameters are therefore crucial for the stability properties of a dipolar condensate and can be used to investigate its stability borders . \n experimentally one would prefer to change the axis of polarization as opposed to the aspect ratio of the trap since this axis can be easily controlled by an external magnetic field . \n as one would expect , smaller values of @xmath17 , which correspond to a condensate less dominated by the ddi , stabilize the condensate against larger angles of rotation and smaller aspect ratios . \n structured states can be found in the vicinity of the border of stability . \n here we find a broad strip in which @xmath47 . for low values of @xmath20 , these structures resemble the blood - cell - like structured condensates ( in the plane @xmath48 polarization axis ) which also occur during the tof ( see fig .  [ \n fig : expansion ] ) . \n the spatial size of the structures is limited by the external confinement . here \n the diameter of the ring @xmath49 1 @xmath50 m . \n this should be sufficient for an experimental observation . \n one fascinating feature of dipolar condensates is the possibility of a self - induced josephson junction , where the effective potential consisting of the external confinement and the dipolar potential has the form of a double well . \n these systems show well known phenomena such as josephson oscillations or running phase modes @xcite . in this subsection \n we are again interested in stability borders , now with respect to the number of particles @xmath6 , the angle of rotation @xmath20 , and @xmath17 . \n the self - induced josephson junction can be realized by adding a toroidal potential to the external confinement . \n the external potential then reads    @xmath51    with @xmath52 ( 2.5 @xmath50k ) and @xmath53 ( 5 @xmath50 m ) . for @xmath30 the gaussian potential is in the @xmath31-plane and therefore perpendicular to the axis of polarization . \n this is the most stable configuration of the toroidal confinement since most of the dipoles are in the repulsive side - by - side configuration and arranged in a circle . \n if we rotate the trap until we attain @xmath54 , the axis of polarization and the gaussian potential will be in the same plane and we obtain the anisotropic density distribution which corresponds to a double - well potential . \n [ fig : stability_josephson ] depicts the stability diagrams with respect to the number of particles @xmath6 and @xmath17 as well as the angle of rotation @xmath20 and @xmath17 . for the first diagram we have chosen @xmath54 and @xmath55 hz and depict the stability diagram for four different values of @xmath56 . \n as can be seen , self - induced josephson junctions can not be realized with large numbers of @xmath0dy particles . \n but it is possible to increase the number of particles by reducing the harmonic confinement @xmath56 . this leads to more dipoles in the repulsive side - by - side configuration and thus stabilizes the condensate . a more effective way of stabilizing the condensate is to choose a smaller angle of rotation . \n for the stability diagram with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath17 we have chosen three different values for the number of particles and @xmath57 hz . \n we see again that reducing the number of particles stabilizes the condensate , and also that the reduction of @xmath20 allows for a greater amount of particles in the condensate . \n the calculation of stability diagrams allows for the search of new quantum states along the stability border of the self - induced josephson junction . \n indeed , we find a new stationary state whose density distribution corresponds to the macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) state known from double - well potentials @xcite , in which only one well is occupied . \n we find this state in a small strip along the stability border in fig . \n [ fig : stability_josephson ] a ) for @xmath58 . fig . \n [ fig : mqst ] depicts the one- and two - dimensional absorption images in @xmath59-direction of this state , where @xmath60 is calculated analogously to . \n this state is robust with respect to small experimental imperfections like small perturbations in the horizontality of the toroidal trap . \n indeed , the whole trap , as well as exclusively , the toroidal trap , may be rotated by several degrees without destroying this mqst - like state . \n further imperfections like gradients in the magnetic field may affect in which well the particles of the condensate accumulate , but we do not expect any further consequences due to the small magnitude of the gradient ( usually @xmath61 1 gauss / cm ) . \n nonetheless , the effect of small gradients upon the accumulation of the particles can be investigated by aligning the dipoles parallel to the @xmath22-axis . \n note that disturbances in general can result in a shift of the stability diagram , thus slightly changing the parameters where structured states are expected to appear . \n signatures of this mqst - like state can also be observed in the dynamics of josephson junctions , where a large initial imbalance in the occupation of the wells can not be periodically compensated and is therefore dominated by the self trapping in one well . \n this results in a running phase mode , where the creation of vortex - antivortex pairs in regions of small density is responsible for a phase shift @xcite . \n we have presented a series of stability and phase diagrams with respect to parameters which are of great importance for the experimental investigation of a dipolar bec . \n our results are valid for all dipolar systems , but we have adjusted all parameters to fit the needs of a condensate with @xmath0dy . \n we studied the expansion dynamics of a dipolar condensate and found two sorts of dipolar signatures occurring during tof sequences : the effects of the ddi are noticeable in that the width of the spatially expanding cloud is not only governed by the anisotropic momentum distribution but also by the direction of the polarization axis . in addition , \n structured states occur during the tof . \n the analysis of stability diagrams shows that structured ground states can be found along the stability border and that their visibility is large enough for modern imaging systems . \n we have shown that the realization of a self - induced josephson junction with @xmath0dy is restricted to a rather small amount of particles . however , \n this can be compensated by a rotation of the external confinement or the polarization axis . \n finally , the analysis of the stability diagram shows that large values of @xmath17 allow for a macroscopic quantum self - trapping state . \n further investigations should include the determination of the scattering length @xmath8 of @xmath0dy , which can be accomplished by a comparison of experimentally measured and theoretically calculated in - trap radii and stability diagrams . \n our results should therefore stimulate experimental efforts to study dipolar becs . \n we thank holger kadau , thomas maier , matthias schmitt and tilman pfau for valuable discussions . \n 22ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.98.030406 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1103/physreva.80.063601 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.95.200404 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.85.023630 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.86.053611 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.77.061601 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase    10.1103/physrevlett.108.210401 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1021/cr2003568 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1103/revmodphys.82.1225 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1038/32354 [ * * , ( ) ] ,   @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 5946552762, "RequestID": "e03aa06fd2e079d4fd88f42ce9e73875cbd360e2", "TotalTokens": 4252}

2 . \n can we identify the reddening mechanisms contributing to each agn ? \n we have low resolution optical spectra of an unbiased subsample of the phfs . \n this subsample was divided into three equal colour bins based on the b - k colours of the objects : blue ( b - k @xmath8 3 ) , intermediate ( 3 @xmath8 b - k @xmath8 4.4 ) and red ( b - k @xmath0 4.4 ) . \n a composite spectrum of the objects in each bin was made ( see @xcite for a description of the technique used ) . \n the results are plotted in figure 1 . \n it should be noted that the continuum has been normalised to the same slope for each bin to compare the emission line properties over the range of colours . \n the lbqs composite spectrum is also shown as a comparison with an optically selected sample @xcite . \n there are clear differences between the different composites . \n the width of h@xmath9 line decreases as redness increases and o(3727 ) is only seen in the red composite . \n the mg(2800 ) line is also quite broad in the blue and intermediate composites , and much narrower in the red composite . \n further analysis of the spectra in the red bin shows there are two different types of spectra in this bin : ( 1 ) low redshift galaxy - type spectra , and ( 2 ) higher redshift quasar spectra . \n several very red objects in the parkes sample seem to appear red owing to a large contribution from a galactic component . \n the 4000  break in the spectrum of the galactic light reduces the amount of light in the blue filter giving a b - k colour which is quite red . \n these objects are at low redshifts and are generally resolved . \n masci @xcite has fitted an evolved elliptical galaxy sed to the phfs spectra , showing that these objects have a high proportion of galactic light in their spectra . \n these objects also have the steepest radio spectrum with values of @xmath10 . \n the composite spectrum of these resolved sources is fairly typical of a galaxy with no h@xmath9 emission . \n the second group of red objects in the sample are higher redshift quasar / seyfert - type objects . \n they show the strong emission lines characteristic of quasars and have flatter radio spectral indices . whiting et al . \n @xcite have modelled the reddening by synchrotron emission using broad band seds . \n they show that these objects tend to have a strong component of synchrotron emission which is responsible for their red continuum . \n these quasars would be missed in a traditional blue - selected quasar sample . \n the composite of these unresolved sources has a completely different shape , with narrow permitted emission lines at civ(1549 ) , ciii](1909 ) and mgii(2798 ) superimposed on a fairly smooth continuum . \n thus it appears that the red agn have relatively narrow emission lines . \n a fuller description of these results will appear in oshlack et al . \n in examining the spectra from the parkes sample we have identified a nls1 candidate , pks 2004 - 447 ( figure 2 ) . \n one model for nls1s suggests they are agn oriented towards us , so that the doppler broadening of a disk - like broad line region would naturally produce narrower emission lines @xcite . \n an extremely radio - loud nls1 could provide an independent test of such physical models of nls1s , and agn unification in general . \n a low resolution spectrum of this source shows an h@xmath9 width of @xmath112000 km  s@xmath12 . \n there is some indication of fe emission on the blueward side of h@xmath9 and the source has been detected at x - ray energies @xcite . \n this object is extremely radio - loud with a radio to optical flux ratio ( r ) exceeding 7000 . \n the colour of pks 2004 - 447 is very red , in contrast with the previously discovered radio - loud nls1 , rgb j0044 + 193 which was quite blue @xcite . \n the radio spectrum of pks 2004 - 447 is also quite steep , with recent measurements of the ( contemporaneous ) radio spectral index giving @xmath13 , consistent with radio indices of radio - quiet nls1s ( moran , these proceedings ) . a higher resolution spectrum of pks 2004 - 447 will be obtained , to confirm its identity .", "StartTimeOffset": 11121677478, "RequestID": "fe32fbc30a6c45d2db0efaf934289d467bae8627", "TotalTokens": 1491}
{"ContextTokens": 3839, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "for over a century @xcite , electrical transport in metallic powders has generated interest @xcite . \n these powders have fascinating properties , such as extreme sensitivity to electromagnetic waves , highly nonlinear @xmath2@xmath3 characteristics , hysteresis , and @xmath4 noise , for which fully satisfactory explanations are still lacking . the experiments presented here were motivated by the work of kamarinos _ \n @xcite on compressed copper powders . \n these authors observed an insulating - to - conducting transition at rather low pressure - dependent voltages , associated with strong @xmath4 noise . just above the conduction transition threshold , \n we observe slow temporal evolution of the powder resistance with a noisy component . \n electrical breakdown of the oxide layers on grains has been invoked @xcite for the transition , but this explanation is unsatisfactory , for we observe that the noise involves both increasing and decreasing the electrical resistance of the powder . in this letter , we show that this electrical noise has interesting scale invariant properties . \n scale invariance @xcite occurs for various physical signals : turbulent velocity @xcite , financial stock market data @xcite , earthquake energy release @xcite , or world wide information traffic @xcite . \n one of the goals of this study is to use the analytic tools developed for turbulent signals in the case of this granular system . \n we shall focus the comparison on two aspects : the statistics of current increments , @xmath5 , depending on the tested time scale @xmath6 , and the correlations between the amplitudes of these increments . \n this latter will show that the electrical noise in this granular system has a hierarchical organization through the time scales . \n two kinds of experiments are performed with commercial copper powder samples of 100 @xmath1 m `` spherical particles '' @xcite : @xmath2@xmath3 characteristics on one hand , and noise and relaxation measurements on the other . in both cases , the powder samples are confined in a polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) cylinder , of 10 mm inner diameter , capped with two metallic electrodes ( stainless steel or brass cylinders ) . \n the container is filled with powder up to a height of 5 mm , roughly corresponding to 500 000 particles . for the @xmath2@xmath3 characteristics , a sensor measures the force applied to the powder through the electrodes . \n we occasionally embedded two wires inside the powder to check that the resistance is not controlled by the electrode - powder interface . \n generally , before each experimental run , the container is refilled with a new sample of powder . \n this procedure ensures better reproducibility than simply relaxing the confining pressure and shaking the container . \n the dc current , @xmath3 , is provided by a kepco power supply ( bop 50 - 4 m ) . \n we first apply a static force , @xmath7 , to a new sample . \n then we measure the voltage , @xmath2 , across the sample , as a function of increasing values of the current , @xmath3 . \n a single run typically lasts 10 s.    figure [ fig.1 ] displays the @xmath2@xmath3 characteristics for various applied forces ranging from @xmath8 to 850 n. @xmath3 is normalized by the sample resistance @xmath9 at low @xmath2 , and thus the slope of each characteristic is 1 at the origin . \n we see that at a higher applied force , the departure from linear behavior occurs at lower voltages ( see fig . \n [ fig.1 ] ) . \n note that @xmath9 decreases with @xmath7 , 1m@xmath0 being a typical value . \n we define @xmath10 as the departure from linearity , that is the nonlinear part of @xmath3 . \n figure  [ fig.2 ] then shows that plotting @xmath11 as a function of @xmath12 collapses all data . at first glance , \n a simple interpretation for this @xmath12 dependence can be developed . \n indeed , developing @xmath3 in powers of @xmath2 such as : @xmath13 however , due to the symmetry of the system , @xmath14 should be zero . \n thus , this interpretation does not hold . \n we prefer to focus on the main observation : the relative nonlinear component of the current , @xmath11 , seems to depend only on the total dissipated power in the sample , @xmath15 . \n an interpretation along these lines will be proposed in what follows . \n in a new series of experiments , the pmma cylinder is filled with 5 mm of powder , then vibrated and embedded in a cylindrical brass press with 5 mm thick walls . \n the pressure on the sample is generated by means of the lid press acting as a screw . at constant low voltage ( @xmath16 v ) , the sample resistance , @xmath17 , \n is monitored during the stepwise pressing of the sample until a maximum pressure , @xmath18 , is reached . \n @xmath17 is found to decrease with increasing @xmath18 , and to reach a value ranging from 100 k@xmath0 to 500 k@xmath0 , at the end of the pressing process ( half an hour later ) . \n we then let the system relax for one day . \n after checking that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constant in time , a fixed voltage , @xmath2 , is suddenly applied to the sample , and the current , @xmath3 , is monitored . if @xmath2 is smaller than a threshold value @xmath19 , the sample is in a weakly conducting state with very slow temporal evolutions of @xmath3 , if any . when @xmath20 , an instability occurs . \n @xmath3 rapidly increases at constant @xmath2 which can be interpreted as the resistance relaxing down . \n the larger @xmath2 is , the faster the resistance relaxes . \n similar features have been observed by kamarinos _ \n _ @xcite . \n when the above experiment is repeated for different values of @xmath18 , it shows that both @xmath19 and @xmath17 depend on @xmath18 . \n however , the critical ratio @xmath21 is found to be independent of the applied pressure , with a value close to @xmath22 mw . \n this value is close to the point where @xmath23 ( see @xmath24-mark in fig .  [ fig.2 ] ) . \n all these observations suggest that this spontaneous transition from an insulating to conducting state is a thermal instability . to further characterize the phenomenon observed for @xmath20 , \n let us make three remarks :    * due to the strong sample pressure , vibrations have no effect ; even a strong jolt applied to the press has no visible consequence on the signal . * \n we occasionally followed the relaxation down to a resistance of 500 @xmath0 , which is almost three orders of magnitude lower than the initial one @xmath25 ; however , this resistance remains much higher than a metallic contact would produce between the grains , no matter how small the contact @xcite . \n * the temporal evolution of the current , at constant @xmath20 , is not monotonic . both increasing and decreasing events occur for the current . \n however , the former dominate and control the global evolution . \n this is contradictory to what would result from a cascading electrical breakdown for the oxide layers , as supposed by kamarinos _ \n _ @xcite .    finally , we observe that the direction of the global evolution of the resistance depends on the applied voltage . as shown in fig . \n [ fig.3 ] , we first apply to the sample a voltage @xmath26 v ( @xmath27 mw @xmath28 ) , which triggers the relaxation . \n half an hour later , we decrease @xmath2 to 0.5 v , and the conductance goes down . \n two hours later , we increase @xmath2 to 3.5 v and we see that the conductance goes up again . \n consequently , with a well choosen applied voltage , we can obtain an approximately constant conductance . \n note that these observations are coherent with the last item above . \n we exploit them in what follows . \n our goal is now to obtain a quasi - stationary current signal in order to apply the usual tools of signal processing ( _ e.g. _ spectral analysis ) , and more sophisticated ones developed in the framework of studies of turbulence time series @xcite . \n to start , we consider an initial sample resistance of @xmath29 m@xmath0 . to obtain the relaxation \n , we apply @xmath30 v ( @xmath31 mw @xmath28 ) . \n five minutes later , the resistance reaches 830 @xmath0 , we then apply @xmath32 v , and the resistance goes up , reaching 1 k@xmath0 one hour later . applying now @xmath33 v , \n the resistance slowly decreases to a value of 950 @xmath0 after one hour . \n finally , applying @xmath34 v leads to an approximately constant current for hours , with stochastic fluctuations ( see fig . \n [ fig.4 ] ) . at fixed voltage @xmath34 \n v , the current @xmath3 is recorded through an acquisition system , with a sampling frequency of @xmath35 khz ( resp . @xmath36 hz ) , the signal being previously filtered at 10 khz ( resp . \n 50 hz ) to avoid aliasing . \n the signal is recorded during 20 s ( resp . \n 65 min ) leading to a file of 0.5 mpt . \n this type of data acquisition was repeated 20 times , first at @xmath37 , then at @xmath38 , to extract averaged quantities , due to the quasi - stationarity feature of the signal . \n figure  [ fig.5 ] displays the log - log power spectra of filtered signals of current recorded at @xmath38 and @xmath37 . at first sight \n , this power spectrum of current fluctuations seems to be a power law of the frequency . \n however , when one examines the spectra carefully , a small curvature appears in fig . \n [ fig.5 ] . letting @xmath6 \n designate a time lag or a time scale , we define the _ i_-th order structure function @xmath39^i \\right\\rangle $ ] , where @xmath40 represents an average over time @xmath41 . \n we focus on the structure function of order four as a function of @xmath42 , as shown in fig . \n [ fig.6 ] . in this log - log plot , \n high sampling frequency data present a power law dependence with @xmath42 . \n deviations from this are observed at large times ( e.g. , @xmath43 ) , that is at times @xmath6 greater than a critical time scale @xmath44 s. this critical time @xmath45 can be understood as a typical effective diffusive time of a thermal pertubation within our typical size sample , @xmath46 mm , estimates corresponding to @xmath47 s. this order of magnitude agreement supports the hypothesis of a thermally driven phenomenon . with similar reasoning \n the heat diffusion in a single grain provides the short time limit , @xmath48 ms , which is on the order of the inverse of our 10 khz filtered frequency . for high frequency data , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 . \n the same data give @xmath51 , with @xmath52 . \n these power - law behaviors are consistent with scale invariance over more than 3 decades in time . \n intermittency , corresponding to @xmath53 , appears more clearly from the direct examination of probability density functions , and correlations , in the next paragraphs . here , \n @xmath54 and @xmath55 differ only by one standard error . \n we concentrate now on the high frequency part of the signal , which presents nice scale invariance properties for @xmath56 . \n figure  [ fig.7 ] shows , for three different @xmath6 , the probability density functions ( pdf ) of current differences , @xmath57 , normalized to their respective root mean square , @xmath58 . \n the exact shape of these pdf is rather sensitive to the statistics ( see pdf tails in fig .  [ fig.7 ] ) , and would have led to smoother curves with a greater quantities of data . \n however , two remarks can be made in the light of what is known for velocity signals in turbulence @xcite :    * the pdf shape changes with the time scale @xmath6  this is a direct signature of intermittency , as @xmath59 can not be proportional to @xmath60 and thus @xmath61 . * \n current difference pdf are symmetric  time reversal , which _ a priori _ should not be invoked here , is the only symmetry able to lead to this behavior . \n turbulent velocity differences have a skewed pdf , @xmath62 being proportional to the dissipated power @xcite . however , even in turbulence , global quantities , like the total dissipated power ( equivalent to what we measure here ) have rather symmetric time difference pdf @xcite . \n a signal with scale invariance is called self - similar since its statistical properties can be described by the same laws at various scales . if the shape of time difference pdf changes across scales with a self - similar law of deformation , this signal is generally described either in terms of a `` multifractal set of singularities '' , or a `` multiplicative cascade '' across scales , both approaches being considered equivalent @xcite . in the `` multiplicative cascade '' , \n a given scale ( e.g. , average gradients on a time interval ) conditions smaller scales ( e.g. , smaller intervals within this one ) in a random markovian way . \n it induces not only intermittency ( evolution of distribution shape across scales ) , but long - range correlations between short intervals @xcite . \n therefore , if our current signal can be described by a self - similar multiplicative cascade , then the mean squared deviation of @xmath63 should linearly depend on @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 ^ 2\\right\\rangle=-\\mu \\ln(\\tau / t ) + c { \\rm \\ , } \\ ] ] where @xmath66 is some large time scale . \n also , as shown by @xcite , the log - correlation between two short intervals ( of size @xmath67 ) should depend linearly on @xmath64 , @xmath68\\right\\rangle    \\\\                   & = -\\mu\\ln(\\tau / t ) + c '   { \\rm , } \\\\ \n \\end{split}\\ ] ] with the same coefficient @xmath1 , @xmath14 and @xmath69 being two constants . \n figure [ fig.8 ] shows the two experimental quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 , shifted by appropriate constants . \n the agreement between them and the linearity in @xmath64 strongly supports a multiplicative cascade description . as in the case of turbulence , \n large scale events condition those at a smaller scale . \n any physical interpretation of the phenomenon discussed in this paper must address these points . \n we can now take stock of all of our results and propose a physical picture of what is taking place . as shown above \n , the driving parameter is the total dissipated power . \n this suggests either local heating , able to change the electrical properties of contacts ( several hundreds of degrees are needed in this case ) , or thermal expansion , which locally creates or destroys contacts . \n the power involved is of the order of @xmath72w . \n when divided by the number of contacts , it remains so small that only electrons can undergo significant heating . \n such `` hot '' electron effects have been reported in systems having some analogies with this one @xcite . \n however , the influence of the large scales on the small ones , as shown by the observed logarithmic correlations , can not be taken into account by such a local process . \n therefore , thermal expansion seems to be the mechanism driving the instability and the associated noise .    in this spirit \n , we attempt to show the correspondence between the formal multiplicative cascade and electrical conduction in our powder . since the contact distribution in a powder is very inhomogeneous , one would also expect an inhomogeneous current distribution . \n thus joule heating should create inhomogeneous increasing stresses in the powder . \n very small thermal expansion can result in dramatic changes in the current paths , thus in the distribution of this joule heating , and so on . \n such events can occur at any scale , ranging from the size of the sample and the grain size . \n the large scale events should influence the small ones , as suggested by our study . \n a full confirmation of this idea requires longer carefully controlled studies . \n the results of this work are two - fold . \n first , we show that the spontaneous decrease in resistance of a copper powder sample above a voltage threshold is due to a thermal instability , and not to electrical breakdown , as previously had been proposed . \n this conclusion results from the observation that dissipated power drives the phenomenon , in spite of the probable smallness of the induced temperature inhomogeneities . \n second , we propose a procedure yielding an interesting self - similar process in this non - equilibrium system . \n our system displays both intermittency and multiplicative cascade - like two point correlations , in ways that are interesting to compare and contrast with the archetypical case of turbulence . \n we wish to thank o.  michel for his exciting ideas , p.  metz and d.  bouraya for electronical and technical support , and g.  kamarinos , t.  lopez rios and l.  k.  j.  vandamme for discussions . \n thanks are also due to v.  bergeron , l.  chevillard and m.  marder for help in improving the manuscript .    99 ( in * french * ) . . \n note that this section has been removed since the 4th ed . ; ( both in * french * ) . . . . . \n cu 006025 , , see also http://www.goodfellow.com/. j. f. pinton , private communication . \n ( in * french * ) . .", "StartTimeOffset": 24303828294, "RequestID": "9e0183e9c7c3de56030a5f66fe6b6d14f6891705", "TotalTokens": 4024}
{"ContextTokens": 2685, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "numerical simulation procedures for designing waveguide couplers to accelerator structures are described in [ 1 ] and an example of its application to the design of the input coupler for the nlc linac is given in [ 2 ] . \n a coupler cavity is designed with the intent of providing a matched connection between a waveguide and a uniform accelerator structure with dimensions corresponding to those of the cell adjacent to the coupler cavity . \n a symmetric structure consisting of two coupler cavities ( with associated waveguides ) connected by a short section of accelerator structure ( typically two cells worth ) is modeled and subjected to a ( let us assume single frequency ) time domain simulation . \n the entire assembly is treated as a single structure with two wave guide ports . \n the coupler cell dimensions are adjusted until an apparent match is achieved , that is , until no reflection is experienced at the ports ( the external matching condition ) . to eliminate the possibility that the match arises from a fortuitous cancellation between forward and backward waves within the accelerator structure , both the amplitude and phase of the accelerating field on the beam axis are observed and required to have the periodicity and phase advance properties appropriate to a pure traveling wave ( the internal matching condition ) . as a check one may add a cell to the accelerator structure and see whether all these conditions are still satisfied . \n it is often the case that accelerator structures are slowly varying rather than uniform , in which case the input and output couplers are matched separately .    in practice the procedure ( we refer to it as the standard procedure ) has been quite time consuming , involving trial and error rather than a systematic procedure to simultaneously satisfy both the internal and external matching conditions . \n another limitation arises from the fact that the method assumes that evanescent bands can be neglected but provides no procedure for demonstrating their absence .    in the next section \n we describe a new simulation procedure which has been found to be much more efficient , and also which provides information about the presence of evanescent bands . \n the basic elements of the method were briefly described in [ 3 ] in connection with the design of a coupler for the zipper structure . \n because it has since replaced the old method for all of our coupler design work , a more complete presentation together with examples will be presented in the following sections . \n as in the case of the old standard procedure one applies a single frequency time domain simulation by driving the input port of a two port structure consisting of an input cavity , an @xmath0 cell periodic structure with period @xmath1 , and an output cavity . \n instead , however , of focusing attention on the s parameters of the structure as a whole , we direct our attention to the simulated accelerating field @xmath2 evaluated along the beam axis . \n we assume a steady state has been reached , so that the subsequent time dependence can be expressed in terms of the complex @xmath3 ( @xmath4 henceforth ) , obtained in the standard way by combining the simulated real fields at two times separated by a quarter period . then from floquet s theorem ( neglecting evanescent bands , losses , and an irrelevant overall phase factor )    @xmath5.\\ ] ]    here @xmath6 is a real positive amplitude function with period @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is a real phase function , periodic except for a cell to cell phase advance @xmath8 . \n thus    @xmath9    @xmath10 is a @xmath11 independent complex reflection coefficient . \n note that one is free to shift @xmath12 by an arbitrary constant with a compensating phase shift in @xmath10 , since the overall phase of @xmath13 is irrelevant . \n this freedom corresponds to the choice of reference plane through some point @xmath14 where we take @xmath15 . \n we now consider the quantities @xmath16    where @xmath17    elementary algebraic manipulation leads to the relations :    @xmath18    @xmath19/[2sin(\\psi)+j\\delta(z)].\\ ] ]    we note that while the rhs of ( 5 ) is formed of @xmath11 dependent complex quantities , it nevertheless turns out to be real and @xmath11 independent . \n similarly the absolute value of the rhs of ( 6 ) is also @xmath11 independent . \n both these results should hold for all `` allowed '' @xmath11 values , i.e. , values such that the three points @xmath20 , @xmath11 , and @xmath21 all lie within the periodic portion of the structure simulated , and together they constitute a powerful constraint on the validity of the floquet representation eq . \n their failure beyond small numerical fluctuations or small deviation from steady state is evidence for the presence of evanescent bands . \n an example will be presented in the section on the zipper structure . \n it is noteworthy that these relations allow one to determine all the properties of the traveling wave solutions , including the functions @xmath7 and @xmath6 from a simulation which contains an arbitrary mixture of forward and backward waves . \n of particular importance is the fact that it gives the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient . \n in contrast to the old standard method , there is here only one matching condition to be satisfied , namely @xmath22 . \n typically match is achieved by varying two parameters in the coupler design . \n once one has determined how the real and imaginary parts of @xmath10 vary with the parameters , one can choose linear combinations of changes which accelerate the process of converging to the origin in the complex @xmath10 plane [ 4 ] . because the phase of @xmath10 does depend upon the position of the reference point relative to the couplers , one naturally keeps it fixed while carrying out this process . \n note that it is the output cavity that is matched by this procedure . while not necessary , it is usually convenient to construct a symmetric mesh . \n the input and output cavities are then the same , and the structure as a whole is matched when @xmath10 vanishes . \n _ ( a ) the nlc four port output coupler _    as an example of the principal features of the new method we use the new nlc four port output coupler cavity [ 5 ] . \n the purpose of the four port design was to provide damping for those dipole modes that reach the end of the structure while also providing an output for the accelerating mode . \n these dipole modes are typically those which had been poorly damped because of decoupling of the last cells from the manifolds . \n the four port symmetry provides damping for both dipole mode polarizations and has the added advantage of eliminating quadrupole distortion of the coupler fields . \n the design simulation was carried out with a three cell periodic structure , and results are illustrated in fig . \n two cases are shown , one matched , the other not . \n the reflection coefficients @xmath23 as computed from eq . \n ( 5 ) for the two cases are shown as functions of @xmath11 . \n the allowed z values are those lying within the central cell , and one sees that for both cases @xmath23 is constant over that range . the real part of @xmath24 is also plotted as a function of @xmath11 . \n one sees that the two values are indeed constant over the allowed range , but contrary to expectations they differ somewhat from each other and from the expected value of one half . \n this is due to the fact that a different and coarser mesh than that used to determine the phase advance parameter was used for the time domain simulations . \n the two cases differ from one another because the parameter variations in the coupler associated with the matching procedure induce small but global changes in the meshing . \n it has been confirmed in a number of cases that there is good agreement between the phase frequency relation determined from single cell periodic boundary condition frequency domain calculations and that determined from the time domain method described here so long as the same mesh is used for both simulations . \n ( 100,200)(-10,15 ) = 7.5 cm    _ ( b ) a photonic band gap ( pbg ) structure _    ( 100,200)(-5,-65 ) = 8.5 cm    a coupler cell very similar to those of the slac structures has been designed for a pbg structure , that is , a cylindrical cell with a pair of symmetrically placed waveguide ports , a conventional beam pipe , and conventional beam iris coupling to the periodic pbg structure . \n the pbg cell structure [ 6 ] is a seven by seven square array of metallic posts aligned in the beam direction and terminated by metallic end plates , the cell cavity being formed by removing the central post . \n a circular aperture in the end plates , identical to that between the coupler cell and the adjacent pbg cell , provides cell to cell coupling and a path for the beam . a perspective representation of the four cell quarter structure used for the simulations is shown in fig . \n ( 2 ) . also shown is the simulated electric field distribution , scaled logarithmically to enhance the visibility of weak field strengths . \n the figure illustrates the effectiveness of the pbg structure in confining the acceleration fields to the interior of the structure . \n the matching procedure worked well , and , as in the four port coupler above , there was no evidence for evanescent band contamination . \n fabrication of an experimental model with 5 coupled pbg cells and complete with couplers is in progress at slac .    _ \n ( c ) the zipper structure _ \n the zipper is a planar accelerator structure described in [ 3 ] . \n a 25 ( counting the coupler cavities ) cell w band model has been built , cold tested , and subjected to bead pull measurements as reported in [ 7 ] . \n the design was governed by a decision to avoid bonded joints involving tiny structure elements such as the vanes which serve as cell boundaries and also form the beam iris . \n the coupler cell is a quarter wave transformer terminating in wr10 waveguide . \n early attempts at matching the coupler using the old standard method failed , and it was this failure which led to the development reported here . matching using this method was accomplished by making use of a time domain simulation of a structure with 22 periodic cells . \n 3 shows the resultant @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath23 plots as computed from eqs . \n ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . \n one sees large deviations from the expected @xmath11 independent behavior as one moves away from the center of the structure . \n this effect indicates a clear violation of eq . \n ( 1 ) . from the fact that the violation fades away as one moves away from the couplers \n indicates that the effect is due to the couplers generating an evanescent band , the nearby monopole band pointed out in [ 3 ] . \n this example demonstrates how the method indicates the presence of evanescent band interference , and also how one can carry out the matching procedure even when it is present . \n ( 100,200)(-5,-62.5 ) = 8.cm \n electrical discharge damage has been commonly observed in the coupler cells of accelerator structures and has been attributed to the field enhancement noted in simulations . \n we have taken advantage of our enhanced matching capability to initiate a study of this long standing problem . \n exploration of the situation for the nlc coupler [ 2 ] showed that the largest enhancement occurred on the coupler side of the aperture of the iris separating the coupler from the adjacent cell with azimuthal maxima opposite the coupler waveguides and azimuthal minima 90 degrees away . \n this observation was consistent with the pattern of discharge damage [ 9 ] . \n it is pointed out in [ 8 ] that the azimuthal variation is due to the quadrupole component introduced by the coupler waveguides and that the enhancement can be reduced by introducing a racetrack like modification of the coupler cell shape designed to eliminate it . \n this effect and its cure have been confirmed in our own studies of the nlc coupler . \n two other modifications have also been explored . \n the simplest and most effective was simply to reduce the radius of the cell adjacent to the coupler . \n the effect for a 2@xmath27 reduction is illustrated in fig . \n 4 where it is seen that the field on the coupler cell iris is significantly less than that on the interior coupling irises . \n an undesirable consequence is a 10 degree phase advance deficiency in the modified cell . \n an even larger field reduction would be obtained by removing the quadrupole enhancement . \n we attribute the reduction to an increase in group velocity . the other modification consisted of enlarging the coupler iris combined with an increase in the adjacent cell radius chosen so as to preserve the cell phase advance , but \n the exploration of this effect is incomplete . \n experimental investigation to determine whether such changes actually do reduce electrical discharge damage in the coupler is clearly needed .", "StartTimeOffset": 34323382914, "RequestID": "3c82f33fa855bfd6b808dcd076ca22a65e1adae8", "TotalTokens": 2823}

centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice of tungsten with the experimental lattice constant . \n the self - consistent electronic structure calculations were performed on an eight - layer slab : the slab consisted of four tungsten layers , one layer of @xmath0 transition - metal alloy , and three empty layers that mimicked the vacuum above the surface . \n the slab was then matched to a semi - infinite vacuum region on one side and to a semi - infinite tungsten bulk on the other side . \n the layers of the surface slab form an ideal continuation of the bulk structure and possible layer relaxations are neglected . \n we have tested the stability of various magnetic phases of two - dimensional random overlayers on the w(001 ) substrate . \n in addition to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase , we have also considered the dlm phase ( disordered local moments ) , the so - called apm phase ( antiparallel arrangement of moments ) , and the uncompensated dlm ( udlm ) phase . \n the dlm phase is defined by randomly oriented local magnetic moments . \n the distribution of directions is uniform in the whole space . \n such a structure can be efficiently studied using the spin - polarized cpa : the infinite number of possible orientations of local moments can be replaced by two equally large groups of atoms with opposite orientations of local moments . \n the dlm phase of a binary alloy x@xmath3y@xmath4 can be formally described as a four - component alloy x@xmath5x@xmath6y@xmath7y@xmath8 , where the superscripts denote the orientations of respective local moments . \n the dlm structure has a zero total magnetization similarly as any antiferromagnetic structure . \n in contrast to an ordered antiferromagnetic structure , however , the local moments in the dlm phase are distributed on the lattice randomly . \n energetic preference of the dlm arrangement to the ferromagnetic one is an indication that the antiferromagnetic arrangement would be favored over ferromagnetism . \n the apm arrangement in a binary alloy is defined as a magnetic phase in which all local moments of one component are aligned in one direction and all local moments of the other component are aligned in the opposite direction . \n the apm phase can be described as x@xmath9y@xmath10 . \n this arrangement resembles a ferrimagnetic one in a similar way as the dlm resembles antiferromagnetism . \n it should be noted that both the antiferromagnet or ferrimagnet assume the existence of two different sublattices while the dlm or apm arrangement exist on one lattice .    a mixed magnetic state , which we denote as dlm(x)+fm(y ) , \n can be represented by a ternary compound x@xmath5x@xmath6y@xmath11 . \n the most general phase is the uncompensated dlm state ( udlm ) . \n it can be approximated as a four - component alloy x@xmath12x@xmath13y@xmath12y@xmath13 where all occupation probabilities ( concentrations ) , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are arbitrary with the obvious constraints @xmath18 and @xmath19 . \n all previously discussed phases can be viewed as special cases of the udlm . \n the local magnetic moments of fm , dlm and apm phases of the femn / w(001 ) alloy are shown in fig . \n 1 and contrasted with behavior of the fev / w(001 ) system . magnetic moments of mn and also of fe are rigid , only weakly influenced by their environment . \n total energies for the femn / w(001 ) alloys in different magnetic phases are presented in fig .  2 . \n to analyze it , let us consider pairwise magnetic interactions only and suppose that the magnetic interaction between two atoms is determined by the atoms themselves independently of their environment . \n we can then approximate the dependence of energy on magnetic configuration by a simple quadratic form @xmath20 specifically , we get : @xmath21 the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 have been chosen to fit the calculated total energies of the ferromagnetic fe / w(001 ) surface , the ferromagnetic mn / w(001 ) surface , and the fe@xmath25mn@xmath25/w(001 ) surface in the apm phase .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we have also investigated the udlm states to find the state with the lowest total energy . \n good sampling of possible udlm configurations requires a large number of calculations . \n we have therefore performed calculations for only three different compositions of femn ( see table  [ tabu ] ) . it should be noted that for all concentrations mn moments prefer ferromagnetic alignment ( @xmath26  =  0 ) .    for some surface alloy compositions , \n there are udlm states that have lower total energy than the special magnetic arrangements discussed so far . \n we have verified that the formula ( [ eq1 ] ) describes fully self - consistent calculations for femn alloys with a good accuracy even in the udlm phase under the assumption that parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are determined from calculated total energies of the dlm , fm , apm , and dlm+fm phases . \n the existence of udlm phases is a consequence of the interplay between the three basic trends discussed above .    for pure fe and mn monolayer \n is the first interlayer distance reduced by 13.7% and 4.7% , respectively @xcite . to judge the impact of interlayer relaxation on our results , we have reduced distances between femn alloy addlayer and the first tungsten layer by 10% . \n this relaxation has no remarkable influence on magnetic behavior of femn alloy film . \n nevertheless , the surface relaxation suppress magnetic moments of iron and manganese atoms slightly because of @xmath27-band broadening due to stronger bonding with substrate . \n we have investigated magnetic ground states of two - dimensional binary femn transition - metal alloys on w(001 ) . for pure monolayers \n we have found that fe overlayer order antiferromagnetically while mn atoms prefer the ferromagnetic alignment . in alloy monolayers , fe and \n mn tend to orient their local magnetic moments antiparallel to each other . \n incompatible tendencies of magnetic moment alignments among fe and mn atoms lead to an uncompensated dlm phase , which becomes the calculated ground state for some alloy compositions . \n this indicates tendency to a non - collinear ground state . to reach a more detailed understanding of the alloyed monolayers on w(001 ) , further sp - stm measurements as well as theoretical calculations \n are needed . + * acknowledgments *", "StartTimeOffset": 55811266188, "RequestID": "a3a591bb008778e71f7c1bdf0999702df4c8a20d", "TotalTokens": 2293}

gas phase transition at the origin of the multifragmentation process @xcite-@xcite . at low excitation energies , \n the decay of hot nuclei follows the predictions of the statistical model for a compound nucleus , and the deexcitation occurs by binary sequential decays @xcite,@xcite . for systems excited at higher energy around 3 \n mev / nucleon @xcite , the multifragmentation channel opens which is interpreted as a manifestation of a liquid - gas phase transition @xcite . \n many experimental clues have been collected recently @xcite,@xcite on multifragmentation and its relation to phase transition . nonetheless the question is still debated . \n disentangling binary sequential decay from multifragmentation close to the threshold should help to better define the thermodynamical properties mentioned above .    in this aim \n we will study the decay of hot nuclei formed in the @xmath5 reaction at @xmath2 mev / nucleon @xcite . using the backtracing technique @xcite-@xcite \n the data will be compared with the predictions of two codes : gemini @xcite for binary sequential decay , and the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite for multifragmentation . \n the reaction dynamics was simulated by boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov ( bnv ) transport model simulations which describe the evolution of the one - body distribution function according to the nuclear mean field and including the effects of two - body collisions with the test - particle method @xcite , @xcite . \n we used a soft equation of state ( @xmath6 mev ) and a free nucleon - nucleon collision cross - section @xmath7 . \n the time evolution of the density contour in the reaction plane for various impact parameters was simulated @xcite . \n those simulations @xcite predict the formation of a single source by incomplete fusion for small impact parameters ( @xmath8 fm ) . for larger impact parameters the mechanism showed a binary character with formation of two sources , quasi - projectile ( qp ) and quasi - target ( qt ) . in this paper we will study the decay of incomplete fusion and qp sources . \n collisions of @xmath0 ions at 30 mev / nucleon with a @xmath9 thick @xmath1 target were studied at the ganil facility using the indra multidetector . \n indra is constituted by 324 independent telescopes on 16 rings : the telescopes covering the polar angular range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 are comprised of an ionization chamber , a 300 @xmath12 m thick silicon detector and a csi(tl ) scintillator . \n those covering the range from @xmath11 to @xmath13 are comprised of two layers : an ionization chamber and a csi(tl ) crystal @xcite-@xcite . \n the reaction @xmath14 was measured during a campaign of experiments for which indra was coupled to the chimera ( @xcite - @xcite ) first ring , which covered the angular range from @xmath15 to @xmath10 , and some indra modules in the horizontal plane were replaced by silicon strip detectors . \n however , for the present reaction study , none of these additional detectors were used . \n indra detects charged particles and fragments with an efficiency close to @xmath16 of the whole solid angle and a high granularity in order to reduce double counting ( down to @xmath17 ) . \n the identification thresholds are low ( @xmath18 mev / nucleon ) . \n indra can measure ion charge and energy in a wide range and it can resolve masses up to z=4 . \n the energy calibration of the silicon detectors and ionization chambers for heavy fragments was obtained by elastic scattering of ar , ni and xe beams on a gold target at incident energies from 7 to 9 mev / nucleon . for the scintillators \n the energy calibration was accomplished with secondary beams of hydrogen and helium isotopes at different energies . \n the charge identification was realized by means of a seven parameter fit of the @xmath19-@xmath20 matrices @xcite which well reproduces the form of the lines for each atomic number , @xmath21 . \n unit charge resolution was obtained for all nuclei produced in this reaction . \n the data for the @xmath5 at 30 mev / nucleon were recorded with an acquisition trigger requiring at least 5 fired telescopes . \n the calculated reaction cross section is @xmath22 barns @xcite . \n the total measured cross - section , calculated from the target thickness , integrated beam current , and total number of recorded events , corrected for dead time , is @xmath23 barns . \n the lower experimental value is due to the lack of detection at forward angles ( @xmath24 ) and , above all , to the acquisition trigger condition which eliminates the most peripheral collisions . for this reaction , \n the available center of mass energy is @xmath25 mev and the projectile velocity is @xmath26 cm / ns . the grazing angle is @xmath27 . \n in order to select well - detected events , we used the @xmath28 correlations ( see figure  [ mom ] ) , the total parallel momentum versus the total charge on an event by event basis . for the analysis , only the events with a total parallel momentum greater than @xmath29 of the beam momentum were kept , @xmath30 mev / c . \n the events were sorted as a function of two observables correlated with the impact parameter @xcite : @xmath32 , the total transverse energy , and @xmath31 , the total charged particle multiplicity . \n three regions are defined according to cuts made perpendicular to the ridge line of this correlation , which we refer to as t1 , t2 and t3 ( see figure  [ molty ] ) . \n the cuts were made in order to retain approximately the same number of events in each region . \n events in the t1 region correspond to less dissipative ( peripheral ) collisions , while those in t3 correspond to more dissipative ( central ) collisions . \n table  [ expsorg ] shows the corresponding average values of the total transverse energy , the total multiplicity , the residue ( the biggest fragment ) velocity and charge in the three regions .       in perspective one should understand why the alpha particle multiplicity is underestimated by gemini \n this could be connected to the dependence of the level density parameter @xmath33 from the excitation energy ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in the present work , \n the lestone parameterization was used , but there are different formulae describing this dependence of @xmath33 that could be used alternatively in the backtracing .    in order to better enhance the differences between the two models , an attempt could also be done using the backtracing of dynamical observables , more sensitive to the coulomb effects @xcite . \n one should however recall that some of the dynamical observables ( like velocities for example ) are mass dependent . \n this addresses the problem of the choice of the mass parameterization previously evoked . on this subject \n , we may hope to gain some useful insight by upgrading in the mass identification of existing @xmath34 devices like chimeraps or by new generation projects like fazia ( four 4@xmath35 a z ion array )  @xcite . \n h.fuchs and k.m@xmath36hring , rep . \n 57 ( 1994 ) 231 . \n s.shlomo and j.b.natowitz , phys . \n c 44 ( 1991 ) 2878 . \n european physical journal a30 ( 2006 ) , special issue : dynamics and thermodynamics with nuclear degrees of freedom . \n j. pochodzalla et al . , \n lett . 75 ( 1995 ) 1040 . \n m.dagostino et al . , phys . \n b 473 ( 2000 ) 219 . j.richert and p.wagner , phys . \n ( 2001 ) 1 . \n h.a.bethe , phys . \n 50 ( 1936 ) 332 . \n a.bohr and b.mottelson , nuclear structure , vol.1 , benjamin ed . \n , new york , ( 1969 ) . \n g. bizard et al.,phys . \n lett b 302 ( 1993 ) 162 . \n g.f bertsch , p.j . \n siemens , phys . \n 126 b ( 1983 ) 9 ; + j.e . \n finn et al . , phys . \n lett 49 ( 1982 ) 1321 . \n j.b.natowitz et al . , phys . \n c 65 ( 2002 ) 34618 . \n l.manduci , phd thesis(2004 ) , universit de caen ( france ) , + _ http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00011469/fr/ _ \n p. dsesquelles et al . , nucl . \n phys . a604 ( 1996 ) 183 . \n p. dsesquelles et al . , nucl . phys . \n a633 ( 1998 ) 547 . \n o. lopez , lpc caen ; procedings of the xlvith international winter meeting on nuclear physics ( 2008 ) , bormio ( italy ) . \n r.j.charity et al . , nucl . \n a476 ( 1988 ) 516 and references therein . \n j.p.bondorf et al . , phys . \n 257 ( 1995 ) 133 . \n a. bonasera , f. gulminelli and j. molitoris , phys . \n ( 1994 ) 1 . \n a.guarnera,m.colonna,ph.chomaz , phys.lett . \n b 373 ( 1996 ) 267 . \n courtesy dr . \n e. galichet . \n j.pouthas et al . \n instr . and meth . \n a357 ( 1995 ) 418 . \n j.pouthas et al . nucl . \n instr . and \n meth . a369 ( 1996 ) 222 . \n m. prlog et al . \n instr . and meth . \n a482 ( 2002 ) 674 . m. prlog et al . \n instr . and meth . \n a482 ( 2002 ) 693 . s. aiello et al . \n a 583 ( 1995 ) 461 . \n a. pagano et al . \n phys . a 681 ( 2001 ) 331 . \n a. pagano et al . \n phys . a 734 ( 2004 ) 504 . \n l. tassan -

{"ContextTokens": 2730, "GeneratedTokens": 64, "SynthesizedBody": "the simplest relativistic generalization of the schrdinger equation is the `` square root klein - gordon equation '' : @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the wave function in momentum space representation and @xmath4 is the relativistic hamiltonian ; @xmath5 . \n this equation can be rewritten in position space representation as follow : @xmath6 the above equation , sometimes called `` salpeter '' equation . \n this equation and its integral representations can be uniquely derived from following simple assumptions : ( 1 ) the equation has the first order of time . ( 2 ) the equation is linear . ( 3 ) the equation leads to relativistic dispersion relation for plane waves ( in other words , being consistent with de broglie relations ) . \n the history of the square root klein - gordon equation ( srkg equation ) goes back to the early years of relativistic quantum mechanics . in the 1927 weyl \n proposed the operator @xmath7 for the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite . \n but he did not expand his idea as a comprehensive theory and also other pioneers of quantum mechanics used different methods for the formulation relativistic quantum mechanics which led to other wave equations such as dirac and klein - gordon equations . on the other hand , although the srkg equation lacks proper theoretical characteristics and even gets rid of some difficulties that other relativistic wave equations have ( such as klein paradox and `` zitterbewegung '' ) , but higher order derivatives in this equation makes it look more complicated than the other quantum wave equations ; therefore it attracted less attention during the historical development of relativistic quantum mechanics . \n but after derivation of this equation from bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite , it was more attention . in this regard , in the recent years , theoretical characteristics and integral representations of this equation have been attracting special attention @xcite . \n also , this equation has been successfully used in description of several relativistic problems and phenomena ; such as relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite , waves in relativistic quantum plasma @xcite , relativistic ( quark ) bound states @xcite , and the relativistic bohmian mechanics @xcite . \n we particularly note the consistency of the results of this equation with the experimental spectrum of mesonic atoms @xcite . \n in addition , since this equation is of first order with respect to time , there is the possibility of using the born interpretation , @xmath0 , for the interpretation of the wave function and as a result it avoid of negative probability problem of the klein - gordon equation . in this regard , k. kowalski and j. rembielinski derived , the position born s probability density and its corresponding current density in the momentum representation as follow @xcite :    @xmath8    @xmath9    in which the `` velocity '' , @xmath10 defined as @xmath11 . this very possibility of a probabilistic interpretation of the wave function has been often the stimulus to using this equation . on the other hand , \n the lorentz invariance of the srkg equation has always been under discussion because of its high derivatives , in fact checking lorentz invariance of this equation is complicated and can not be specified easily . \n therefor sometimes because of the inequality of time and space derivatives , this equation has been mistakenly accepted as a frame dependent equation and incompatible with special relativity @xcite . \n but it has been shown that if the wave function is scalar this equation is lorentz invariant ( in the absence of interactions ) @xcite . \n but we need to pay attention that born rule , @xmath12 , is inconsistent with assuming the wave function as scalar . \n because the position probability density is the first component of the probability current four - vector and can not be scalar . on the other word , because of the relativistic length contraction , the probability density can not be scalar . \n hence , born rule ( eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) ) can not be a proper interpretation for the scalar wave function . \n in fact in the rest of this article we will show even if the wave function is not scalar , born rule will still not be proper for the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function . \n it means that no transformation will be found for the wave function in a way to cause born probability density and born current densities(eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) ) become altogether as one four - vector . \n so , the born rule must be modified to conform with lorentz symmetry . \n in this regard , we find a proper relativistic modification of the born rule for scalar wave function ( spin 0 particles ) in the section ( i ) and for spin 1/2 particles in the section ( ii ) . \n we propose the relativistic generalization of the born rule as follows : @xmath13 in which @xmath14 , is defined as : @xmath15 the expression ( [ 5 ] ) is the simplest covariant generalization of the eq . \n ( [ 3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) . \n in fact by means of direct ( and also long ) calculation , we can see that @xmath16 is actually a four - vector and as a result,@xmath17 is a four - vector as well - of course if the wave function be scalar(see section ii ) . \n it can also be simply shown that @xmath17 ( as was defined above ) satisfies the continuity equation . \n it is obvious that the first component of the @xmath17specify the relativistic generalization of the born rule in the momentum representation : @xmath18 the question that arises at this point is whether the definition ( [ 7 ] ) lead to a positive definite probability density . for answering this question , we note that the coefficient @xmath19 in the expression ( [ 7 ] ) can be separated as follow : @xmath20 where @xmath21.through the aid of this separation , the position probability density can be derived in position space representation as follow : @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is compton wavelength ; @xmath24 . \n so eq.([7 ] ) leads to a positive - definite probability density . \n it is clear that in non- relativistic limit , @xmath25 , the equation ( 9 ) reduce to born rule , @xmath26 . \n in addition , if @xmath27 then @xmath28 and the expression ( [ 7 ] ) gives the non - relativistic expression ( [ 3 ] ) . \n it means that whenever the width of wave packet in momentum space is small in comparison with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32 will be negligible . as a result , based on uncertainty relations , deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32 \n is considerable only if the width of wave packet is smaller than the compton wavelength @xmath33 . to see this fact explicitly , \n we plot the relativistic ( eq.([9 ] ) ) and nonrelativistic ( born rule ) probability density for a particle in one dimensional infinite square well potential . from fig . \n ( 1 ) it is obvious that if the width of the box , @xmath34 , is greater than the compton wavelength of the particle , @xmath23 , the diagram of the relativistic probability density , @xmath31 , will be coincident with the diagram of the born probability density , @xmath35 ; and whenever the width of the box is smaller than the compton wavelength then @xmath31 will deviates from @xmath35 . \n in fact if@xmath36 then the probability of the particle s presence in the box will be uniform(see figure.1 ) .     ; red diagrams represent the relativistic probability density,@xmath31 , for the first excited state n=2 of particle in infinite potential well . \n the diagram is drawn considering different width of the box : ( a)@xmath37 , ( b)@xmath38 and ( c)@xmath39 . ] \n particle and spin @xmath72 particle in one dimensional box . \n the ( dashed ) green line represents born probability density , the blue line represent @xmath69 and the red line represent the @xmath82 . \n the wave function of particle is considered as @xmath83 which @xmath84 is the width of the box and we consider @xmath85 . ] \n in this article we have introduced relativistic generalization for the born rule for particles with zero and half spins . \n therefore it seems that the srkg equation with the appropriate interpretation of the wave function can be adapted to use for particles having various spins . \n 99 h. weyl : zeit . \n f. physik 46 ( 1927 ) pp . \n 38 - 44 e. e. salpeter and h. a. bethe , phys . \n 84 , 1232 w. lucha and f. f. schoberl , int . j. mod . phys . a 7 ( 1992 ) 6431 . \n w. lucha and f. f. schoberl , int . j. mod \n . phys . a 14 ( 1999 ) 2309 j.j . \n kohn , l. nirenberg , communications in pure and applied mathematics , 18,293295.(1965a ) . \n no.5 , 199.8 kh . \n namsrai , international journal of theoretical physics , vol.37,no.5 , 199 . \n k. kowalski and j. rembielinski , phys . rev a 84 , 012108 ( 2011 ) t. l. gill , w. w. zachary and m. alfred , j. phys . \n 31 t. l. gill and w. w. zachary , j. phys . \n 38 , 2479- 2496 , ( 2005 ) . \n f. brau , j. math . \n 39 , 2254 ( 1998 ) . \n zhi - feng li , jin - jin liu , w. lucha , wen - gan ma and f. f. schberl , j. math . \n 46 , 103514 r. l. hall , w. lucha and f. f. schoberl , j. phys . a 34 ( 2001 ) , 50595064 . \n k. kowalski , j.rembielinski,phys.rev.a 81:012118,2010 f. haas , journal of plasma physics / volume 79 / spe- cial issue 04 / august 2013 , pp 371 - 376 j. l. friar and e. l. tomusiak , phys . \n c 29 , 1537 published 1 april 1984 w. lucha , franz f schberl , physics letters b , volume 387 , issue 3 , 24 october 1996 i. w. herbst , math.phys . \n 53 ( 1977 ) , 285294 ;

{"ContextTokens": 1105, "GeneratedTokens": 114, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of the statistics of the fluctuating gravitional force in infinite homogeneous systems was pionered by chandrasekhar & von neumann in two classical papers ( chandrasekhar & von neumann 1942 , 1943 hereafter cn43 ) . \n the analysis of the fluctuating gravitional field , developed by the quoted authors , was formulated by means of a statistical treatment in the case of uniform systems , and with no correlations . \n two distributions are fundamental for the description of the fluctuating gravitional field :    * \\1 ) @xmath1 which gives the probability that a test star is subject to a force @xmath2 in the range @xmath2 , @xmath2 + d@xmath2 ; * \\2 ) @xmath3 which gives the joint probability that the star experiences a force * f * and a rate of change * f * , where @xmath4 .    from a pure theorethical ground we expect that inhomogeneity affects all the aspects of the fluctuating gravitational field ( antonuccio & colafrancesco 1994 ; del popolo 1996a , b ; del popolo & gambera 1998 ) .      assuming that the system density is described by a powe law of index @xmath6 , the expression of @xmath3 is given following markoff s method by ( cn43 ) : @xmath7 } \\right\\ } d{\\bf k } d{\\bf \\sigma } \\label{eq : set}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a lenghty calculation leads us ( see del popolo & gambera 1998 for a derivation and the meaning of simbols ) to find the function @xmath8 : @xmath9 \\cdot   [ q({\\bf \\sigma } ) + k r({\\bf \\sigma } ) ] \\ }   \\label{eq : trense}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this last equation introduced into eq . \n ( [ eq : set ] ) solves the problem of finding the distribution @xmath10 and makes it possible to find the moments of @xmath11 that give information regarding the dynamical friction . using this last expression for @xmath8 and performing a calculation similar to that by cn43 the first moment of @xmath12 \n is given by : @xmath13 \\label{eq : quaruno}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 \\left [ \\frac { \\sin{x}}{x^{(2 - p)/2 } } - \\frac{\\cos{x}}{x^{p/2 } } \\right ] dx \\nonumber \\\\             &    & - \\ ; 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty }             \\left [ e^{(x/\\beta)^{\\frac{(3 - p)}{2 } } }             \\right ] \\cdot \\frac{\\sin{x}}{x^{(p - 2)/2 } } dx \\label{eq : quardu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown by eq . \n ( [ eq : quaruno ] ) , in a inhomogeneous system , differently from homogeneous ones , @xmath12 is a function of the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath6 .    at this point \n we may show how dynamical friction changes due to inhomogeneity . from eq . \n ( [ eq : quaruno ] ) we see that @xmath15 differs from that obtained in homogeneus system only for the presence of a dependence on the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath16 . \n if we divide eq . \n ( [ eq : quaruno ] ) for the correspondent of cn43 we obtain : @xmath17 this last equation is an increasing function of @xmath6 . \n this means that for increasing values of @xmath16 the star suffers an even greater amount of acceleration in the direction @xmath18 ( when @xmath19 ) than in the direction @xmath20 ( when @xmath21 ) , with respect to the homogeneous case . \n this is due to the fact that the difference between the amplitude of the decelerating impulses and the accelerating ones is , as in homogeneous systems , statistically negative , but now larger , being the scale factor greater . \n this finally means that , for a given value of @xmath22 , the dynamical friction increases with increasing inhomogeneity in the space distribution of stars . \n in addition , by increasing @xmath22 the dynamical friction increases , just like in the homogeneous systems , but the increase is larger than the linear increase observed in homegeneous ones .    antonuccio - delogu v. , colafrancesco s. , 1994 , apj 427 , 72 chandrasekhar s. , von neumann j. , 1942 , apj 95 , 489 chandrasekhar s. , von neumann j. , 1943 , apj 97 , 1 ( cn43 ) del popolo a. , 1996a , a&a 305 , 999 del popolo a. , 1996b , a&a 311 , 715 del popolo a. , gambera m. , 1998 , a&a , 342 , 34", "StartTimeOffset": 74412817872, "RequestID": "fe0cada25e9edc0c000e43c41ccc7721af465ae0", "TotalTokens": 1219}
{"ContextTokens": 4091, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "the lanthanide series of the periodic table comprises fifteen members ranging from lanthanum ( la ) to lutetium ( lu ) . \n although they are more abundant than silver , and some of them are more abundant than lead , they are known as rare - earth ( re ) elements . \n rare  in their name refers to the difficulty of obtaining the pure elements , not to their abundances in nature . \n they are never found as free metals in the earth s crust and do not exist as pure minerals . \n all having two electrons in the outermost 6__s _ _ orbital , they can form trivalent cations . \n their chemistry is largely determined by the ionic radius , which decreases steadily along the series corresponding to the fillings of the 4__f__-orbitals . \n one of the principal applications of the rare - earth elements in industry , involving millions of tons of raw material each year , is in the production of catalysts for the cracking of crude petroleum.@xcite they are also commonly used in the glass and display industry.@xcite additionally , rare - earth oxides are regarded as potential candidates for high - k gate dielectrics because of their ability to form direct contact with silicon substrate.@xcite superconductors based on rare - earth oxypnictides@xcite were also discovered with critical temperatures as high as 55 k.@xcite very recently it was shown that the rare - earth oxide ceramics are intrinsically hydrophobic and durable materials preventing water from spreading over a surface.@xcite s. bertaina _ _ et al.__@xcite revealed a new family of spin qubits based on re ions having desired characteristics suitable for scalable quantum computation at @xmath0he temperatures . \n adsorption of re adatoms on graphene were investigated by several studies . \n in contrast to most of simple and transition metals , it was shown that re adatoms induce significant electric dipole and magnetic moments on graphene.@xcite    although re elements constitute a significant portion of atoms in the periodic table and exhibit unique ( and mostly unexplored ) properties , it is interesting to note that the ab - initio electronic structure calculations with re elements are very scarce . \n this is due to the fact that re elements containing 4__f__-electrons are particularly very challenging for density functional theory ( dft ) methods . \n it is well known that the narrow _ f_-bands in re compounds are not adequately described by standard local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and generalized - gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite due to strong electronic correlation effects . to cope with this insufficiencies , \n the dft+u method@xcite is often employed , with u fit to some spectral data . \n another approach is to use a hybrid functional introducing a portion of exact hartree - fock type exchange into the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite both approaches improve the treatment of strongly correlated electrons . \n however dft+u suffers from ambiguity of hubbard u value while hybrid functionals suffer from extremely demanding computational costs . \n we realized that reliable dft potentials for majority of re elements are not provided by any open - source@xcite dft simulation environments such as abinit,@xcite siesta , @xcite and quantum espresso.@xcite the aim of this study is to provide projected augmented wave ( paw ) potentials for re elements with some suggested hubbard u values allowing efficient plane - wave calculations . \n these potentials were developed to yield results comparable to highly accurate all - electron flapw+lo results using wien2k.@xcite hubbard u values are consistently determined according to all - electron hybrid functional calculations . \n the optimization of the potentials were performed on rare - earth nitrides in which re element adopts trivalent ionic state . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we present the details about the generation of re paw datasets . \n next we investigate the electronic properties of re - nitrides ( ren s ) which will be used as a reference for validation of our generated paw datasets . in section [ sec : comp ] \n we compare the performance of generated paw datasets with all - electron flapw+lo results . in section [ sec : match ] we present our procedure of obtaining hubbard u values for feasible dft+u calculations that match results from demanding hybrid functional ( ys - pbe0 ) calculations . \n our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] . \n we used atompaw program@xcite to generate projector and basis functions which are needed for performing first principles calculations based on the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite for any element in the periodic table , the program inputs the atomic number , exchange - correlation functional , electronic configuration , choice of basis functions , and a cutoff radii . \n after initialization , the program can be instructed to output potential files which can be used by open - source density functional simulation environments such as quantum espresso@xcite and abinit.@xcite it also outputs several files enabling wave function and logarithmic derivative plots . \n although scandium ( sc ) and yttrium ( y ) belong to rare - earth element family , we focus our attention in the lanthanides ( la - lu ) since paw datasets already exist for sc and y in the atompaw repository . for each lanthanide we used neutral electronic configuration . \n 6__s _ _ , 5__s _ _ , 5__p _ _ , 5__d _ _ and 4__f _ _ orbitals are treated as valance states . \n two projector and basis functions were used for each angular momentum channel ( s , p , d , f ) . \n two rydberg reference energy was used to build each partial - waves . \n since lanthanides are high - z elements , scalar - relativistic wave equation was used for all - electron computations . \n vanderbilt scheme@xcite was used to pseudize partial - waves . \n the analytical form of shape functions used in compensation density was chosen according to the besselshape option.@xcite the generated dataset was carefully checked with logarithmic derivatives against ghost states . \n [ xe ] 4__f__@xmath15d@xmath26s@xmath3 atomic configuration was assumed for each re in which n=0 for la , n=1 for ce , n=2 for pr , n=3 for nd , etc . \n cutoff radius@xcite ( r@xmath4 ) of augmentation regions in the paw formalism was determined according to solid state calculations performed on re - nitrides ( ren s ) . \n we first obtained equilibrium lattice constants ( a@xmath5 ) for each ren using the all - electron wien2k@xcite program which employs highly accurate full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave + local orbitals ( flapw+lo ) method . \n then we tuned cutoff radius of each paw dataset to yield equilibrium lattice constant error not larger than @xmath60.03 % relative to wien2k . \n table [ table : radius ] lists r@xmath4 values for each re . \n .muffin - tin radii values ( _ _ r__@xmath7 ) used in wien2k calculations and cutoff radius ( r@xmath4 ) of augmentation regions in paw method used in atompaw . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in conclusion , we have generated accurate and publicly available paw datasets for re elements ( la - lu ) which can be used readily with open - source quantum espresso and abinit dft simulation packages . \n similar to common trivalent re ions found in nature , solid state tests and optimizations of paw datasets were performed on rare - earth nitrides . \n we find that our optimized paw datasets yield almost identical results to highly accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave plus local orbital ( flapw+lo ) calculations . \n all - electron hybrid functional calculations ( ys - pbe0 ) were carried out to overcome limitations of standard pbe calculations and to be used as reference for the determination of hubbard u values for pbe+u calculations . \n pbe results tend to place f - states very close to the fermi level and 2.5 to 5.5 ev hubbard u values are required to place f - states in positions similar to those produced by the ys - pbe0 hybrid functional . \n nonzero hubbard u value ( @xmath8 ev ) on empty re d - orbitals was also shown necessary to open a band gap of some ren s , which is consistent with experimental findings . \n we believe that these new paw datasets - if used with suggested hubbard u values ( for trivalent high - spin ions ) - will allow further studies on rare - earth materials . \n this work was supported primarily by nsf / dmr through the university of minnesota mrsec . \n rmw was also supported by nsf / ear 1319361 . \n we acknowledge fruitful discussions with dr . \n koichiro umemoto , prof . \n natalie holzwarth and prof . \n david vanderbilt . \n computations were performed at the minnesota supercomputer institute ( msi ) . \n atompaw input files used in the generation of lda and gga paw datasets and corresponding output potential files which can be used with abinit and quantum espresso are publicly available at http://www.vlab.msi.umn.edu/resources/repaw/index.shtml . \n supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.07.030 . \n cornell , pure appl . \n chem . 65 , 1993 , 2453 . \n gschneidner , jr . , \n chem . soc . \n s. coh , t. heeg , j.h . \n haeni , m.d . \n biegalski , j. lettieri , l.f . \n edge , k.e . \n obrien , m. bernhagen , p. reiche , r. uecker , s. trolier -

{"ContextTokens": 3100, "GeneratedTokens": 112, "SynthesizedBody": "the hele - shaw problem involves two inmiscible newtonian fluids that interact in a narrow gap between two parallel plates . \n one of them is of higher viscosity and the other is effectively inviscid . \n the model under consideration is valid when surface - tension effects in the plane of the cell are negligible . in the most of the cases \n it is known that when a fluid region is contracting , a finite time blow - up can occur , in which a cusp forms in the free surface . \n the solution does not exist beyond the time of blow - up . \n however , saffman and taylor in 1958 @xcite discovered the long time existence of a continuum set of long bubbles within a receding fluid between two parallel walls in a hele - shaw cell that further have been called the saffman - taylor fingers . \n it is worthy to mention that the first non - trivial explicit solution in the circular geometry has been given by polubarinova - kochina and galin in 1945 @xcite . \n they also have proposed a complex variable approach , that nowadays is one of the principle tools to treat the hele - shaw problem in the plane geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n following these first steps several other non - trivial exact solutions have been obtained ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . through the similarity in the governing equations ( hele - shaw and darcy ) \n , these solutions can be used to study the models of saturated flows in porous media . \n another typical scenario is given by witten - sander s diffusion - limited - aggregation ( dla ) model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n in both cases the motion takes place in a laplacian field ( pressure for viscous fluid and random walker s probability of visit for dla ) . \n one of the ways , in which several new exact solution have been obtained , is to perturb known solutions . \n for example , howison @xcite suggested perturbations of the saffman - taylor fingers that led him to new fingering solutions keeping the same asymptotic behavior as time @xmath0 . \n recently , hele - shaw flows and saffman - taylor fingering phenomenon have been studied intensively in wedges ( see , e.g. , @xcite nad the references therein ) . in particular , kadanoff @xcite suggested a self - similar interface evolution between two walls in a hele - shaw cell expressed explicitly by a rather simple parametric function with a logarithmic singularity at one of the walls . by this note \n we perturb kadanoff s solution and give new explicit solutions with similar asymptotics . \n we suppose that the viscous fluid occupies a simply connected domain @xmath1 in the phase @xmath2-plane whose boundary @xmath3 consists of two walls @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the corner and a free interface @xmath6 between them at a moment @xmath7 . \n the inviscid fluid ( or air ) fills the complement to @xmath1 . \n the simplifying assumption of constant pressure at the interface between the fluids means that we omit the effect of surface tension . \n the velocity must be bounded close to the contact point that yields the contact angle between the walls of the wedge and the moving interface to be @xmath8 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . \n a limiting case corresponds to one finite contact point and the other tends to infinity . by a shift \n we can place the point of the intersection of the wall extensions at the origin . to simplify matter , we set the corner of angle @xmath9 between the walls so that the positive real axis @xmath10 contains one of the walls and fix this angle as @xmath11 $ ] .    in the zero - surface - tension model neglecting gravity \n , the unique acting force is pressure @xmath12 . \n the velocity field averaged across the gap is given by the hele - shaw law ( darcy s law in the multidimensional case ) as @xmath13 . \n incompressibility implies that @xmath14 is simply @xmath15 the dynamic condition @xmath16 is imposed on the free boundary @xmath17 . \n the kinematic condition implies that the normal velocity @xmath18 of the free boundary @xmath19 outwards from @xmath1 is given as @xmath20 on the walls @xmath21 and @xmath22 the boundary conditions are given as @xmath23 ( impermeability condition ) . \n we suppose that the motion is driven by a homogeneous source / sink at infinity . \n since the angle between the walls at infinity is also @xmath9 , the pressure behaves about infinity as @xmath24 where @xmath25 corresponds to the constant strength of the source ( @xmath26 ) or sink ( @xmath27 ) . \n finally , we assume that @xmath28 is a given analytic curve . \n we introduce the complex velocity ( complex analytic potential ) @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the stream function \n . then , @xmath31 by the cauchy -

{"ContextTokens": 3537, "GeneratedTokens": 233, "SynthesizedBody": "the future international linear will enter a new era of vertex detection . with the aimed impact parameter resolution of @xmath5 precision physics will become possible which complements the discovery potential of the lhc machine . to achieve such outstanding performance , the ilc vertex detector requires a row wise operation where all sensor periphery is placed outside the sensitive area and detector layers that are thinned to 50@xmath2 m or even below . \n furthermore , the emerging background rates due to the high luminosity beam necessitate the readout of the whole detector in 50@xmath2s which translates into line rates of 20mhz and more . \n one technological option presently discussed for the ilc vertex detector is the depfet concept . \n the basic principle of operation of the depfet is illustrated in figure  [ depfet_principle ] . \n the depfet ( abbreviated * * dep**leted * * f**ield * * e**ffect * * t**ransistor ) @xcite combines in - pixel amplification and particle detection by embedding a fet in high - ohmic silicon material . \n the sensor is fully depleted due to sidewards depletion from the backside contact and from the transistor channel jointly . the sidewards depletion and additional implantations close to the detector front side form a laterally confined potential valley underneath the transistor channel . \n this potential valley is called internal gate , derived from the external gate of the transistor . \n electrons generated by impinging radiation drift to the internal gate where they are collected . \n the potential of the internal gate changes due to the collected charge @xmath6 and the transistor current is modulated according to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is called the internal gain of the depfet transistor , equivalent to the transconductance of the external gate @xmath9 . \n finally , the signal charge collected in the internal gate can be determined by measuring the device current . since the readout of the device current does not affect the charge in the internal gate \n , it has to be removed from time to time . \n this is know as the clear of the device and is realized by an additional contact at the pixel fringe ( not shown in figure  [ depfet_principle ] ) . \n the main advantages of the depfet technology are the fully depleted bulk that is used for signal generation and the fact that charge collection is induced by an electric field . \n since the depfet concept relies on a backside contact to provide the fully depletion , new thinning concepts apart from the standard ones used in microchip industry need to be explored to fabricate thin depfets . \n the present approach for thinning depfet modules is based on wafer bonding technology and anisotropic etching . \n the principle has been demonstrated by producing thin diode structures @xcite and will be combined with a large scale depfet pixel production in future . \n the radiation tolerance of the sensor against ionizing radiation has been shown up to a dose of 1mrad using x - rays from a @xmath10 source @xcite . \n a principle sketch of one ladder end proposed for a depfet ilc vertex detector is shown in figure  [ ilc_ladder ] . \n the sensitive area is thinned to @xmath11 m keeping a thicker frame ( @xmath12 m ) for mechanical stability and stiffening of the 100 mm long and 13 mm wide ladder . \n the steering chips for row selection and clearing strobes are situated at the longer side so that the detector is read out row wise to the ladder ends . there \n , readout chips are placed that process all matrix columns in parallel .    concerning the readout of such a depfet ladder , \n new concepts have been explored as well @xcite . \n since the device signal of the depfet is a current , the most natural way is to adapt the signal processing queue to the current operation of the device . \n therefore , current memory cells are used in the readout chip for temporal storage and processing of the signal current . \n the basic principle of operation of such a memory cell @xcite is shown in figure  [ si_cell ] . \n the cell operates as a dynamic current mirror , where transistor m1 works as the input and output stage depending on the setting of the different switches s1-s3 . \n apart from the fact that a direct signal processing without any current to voltage conversion is smart , additional advantages of operating in the current domain exist , upon the most important ones are :    * the voltage sampled at the gate of the transistor m1 in figure  [ si_cell ] is not directly proportional to the signal current . hence , a higher dynamic range compared to a voltage sample and hold can be achieved . \n this is particularly important for emerging process technologies with reduced supply voltage . * the subtraction of two values , as needed for pedestal subtraction , \n can be done very accurate and easily with currents . \n as an intermediate step towards a full scale ilc detector ladder , a prototype system using a depfet pixel matrix has been developed . a schematic overview of the system is given in figure  [ system_overview ] . \n it consists of three major parts : a usb - board , a daq - board and a hybrid - board . \n the usb - board is based on usb2.0 standard and provides the communication between the system and a pc . the hybrid - board hosts the depfet pixel matrix , the steering chips switcher  ii , the readout chip curo  ii and a pair of transimpedance amplifiers ( i2u ) that convert the current outputs of the curo chip to voltage signals . \n the daq - board carries two 14bit adcs for digitization and a sram for data storage . \n integral part of the daq - board is a spartan 3 fpga which provides the configuration of all chips in the system and manages the synchronization between the components during data acquisition . \n an external protection - board can be inserted to safeguard the power supply voltages . \n a photograph of the depfet system is shown in figure  [ system_photo ] . \n figure  [ chip_assembly ] shows a close - up view of the chip assembly on the hybrid - board .    ) \n .,width=302 ]    the @xmath0 pixel depfet matrix is situated in the center . \n the steering strobes for the matrix are provided by two switcher  ii chips @xcite located at both matrix sides . \n the switcher  ii has been fabricated in an ams high voltage process to provide a voltage range of up to 25v , needed to operate some matrix designs . \n the present hybrid uses two steering chips to be very versatile in operating different matrix types . \n recent measurements @xcite show that for some matrix designs only one steering chip is sufficient to take care of matrix steering and clearing .    at the bottom of the matrix \n the 128 channel readout chip curo  ii @xcite is placed . \n this chip is fabricated in a @xmath13 m tsmc process . \n in addition , most of the design already uses radiation tolerant layout rules @xcite . \n it is therefore very likely that the readout chip sustains the radiation dose of 200krad expected after 5 years operation of the ilc . \n whether the present chip already shows a suitable radiation tolerance or if the layout has to be improved further on will be studied in irradiation test . \n one of the main features of the readout chip are on - chip pedestal subtraction and zero suppression . \n the zero suppression is performed by a scanner which scans the binary hit pattern in parallel . \n standalone tests with the present curo  ii chip show that the scanner finds up to two hits in a 128 channel hit pattern with rates of more than 100mhz . \n this is much faster than needed to cope with the expected rates at the ilc . \n the system has been used in the lab for x - ray detection in an energy range from 5.9 up to 44.23kev . \n the capability of spatial detection of x - rays has been demonstrated using a 75@xmath2 m thick tungsten test chart with an engraved logo and several line structures having a pitch of 100 , 75 , 50 and 25@xmath2 m ( from left to right , respectively ) . \n the radiogram of the @xmath142x3@xmath15 large test chart is shown in figure  [ lab_faustlogo ] . \n tungsten test chart taken with @xmath16.,width=302 ]    the test chart has been placed on the backside of the detector and the system has been irradiated with a @xmath17 source . \n the radiogram has been obtained by summing the pulse heights for pixels that contain a signal higher than five times their noise . \n although no spatial reconstruction techniques have been applied to improve the spatial resolution , the 50@xmath2 m lines in the radiogram are clearly visible . to determine the internal gain of the depfet device and to measure the linearity of the system , \n energy spectra have been taken for rubidium ( rb ) , molybdenum ( mo ) , silver ( ag ) , cadmium ( cd ) , barium ( ba ) and terbium ( tb ) , provided by a variable x - ray source @xcite . \n after performing a row - wise common mode correction , clusters are reconstructed by identifying neighboring pixels , where every pixel contains a signal higher than five times its noise . in figure  [ lab_matrixgain ] \n the mean cluster signal as a function of the characteristic x - ray energy is shown . \n -5 mm     from the slope of the system response an internal gain of the depfet sensor of @xmath18 is extracted . the integral - non - linearity ( inl ) of the system is better than 0.8@xmath19 for a dynamic range of 8500@xmath20 . \n this range is large enough for the detection of about 2 mips in a 50@xmath2 m thin sensor device . \n the best noise performance achieved in the lab is around enc=220e@xmath3 at room temperature . \n this number is quite comparable with the calculated noise performance of @xmath21 , where thermal noise is identified as the dominant contribution @xcite . \n however , the total noise needs to be improved by a factor of two to achieve the final aim of around 100e@xmath3 . \n this is within a realistic scope since the bandwidth of the present readout and steering chips have already been designed to cope with the final line rate of 20mhz . \n it is therefore very likely that a future generation of the system with an optimized readout chip and sensors with higher @xmath8 can achieve a noise of 100e@xmath3 . \n the system has been tested for mip detection in the 6gev electron test beam at the desy synchrotron . \n the analysis of the data is done in the following way : after pedestal and common mode corrections , clusters are searched for . \n seeds are identified with a threshold cut of 5@xmath22 . \n the seeds are combined with neighboring pixels if their signal is two times higher than the noise . \n the signal distribution for clusters containing a maximum of @xmath23 pixels is shown in figure  [ tb_signals ] . \n pixels.,width=283 ]    the observed most probable value of about 36000e@xmath3 ( @xmath24adu ) obtained by a landau fit complies with the expected mip signal in a @xmath25 m silicon sensor material . the system noise extracted from the noise peak of the raw data spectrum \n is found to be @xmath26adu . \n this combines to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath27 . \n the observed noise figure in the test beam ( @xmath28 ) is higher than the one achieved in the lab . \n it turned out that the connection node between readout chip and transimpedance amplifier is very sensitive for pick - up . \n hence , the system noise depends on different operating parameters . a future version of the readout chip implementing either a transimpedance amplifier or a current mode adc is expected to overcome this . \n figure  [ tb_clustersize ] shows the cluster size distribution . \n -5 mm   pixels.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    the most probable cluster contains about 5 pixels only . \n the relatively small clusters are due to the fact that charge collection in the depfet is done by an electric field and not by thermal diffusion . also shown in figure  [ tb_clustersize ] is the cluster size distribution for inverse signals . \n this event distribution is obtained by inverting the signals and repeating the analysis . \n it is very likely that the inverted signals are due to out - of - time events . \n furthermore , efficiency and purity for track reconstruction have been studied . \n a four plane telescope system is used to determine the particle tracks . \n clusters are searched in the depfet matrix within an area of @xmath29pixels around the predicted track position . \n the efficiency is defined as the ratio of clusters found in the fiducial depfet area and the corresponding tracks identified by the telescope system . \n figure  [ tb_efficiency ] shows the efficiency as a function of the seed cut threshold . \n -5 mm     the observed inefficiency in the order of 0.3% is mostly due to multiple scattering effects in the low energy electron beam . \n ( note , that clusters are detected in a relatively small area of @xmath302 pixels . ) to reduce multiple scattering effects , only very stiff tracks are selected for the analysis by applying a high @xmath31 probability cut of 0.9995 . \n this enhances the efficiency to almost .    the purity defined as the ratio of found good clusters and all clusters is shown in figure  [ tb_purity ] as a function of the seed cut . \n -5 mm     the main result of the efficiency and purity study is that an operation at almost 100% purity and efficiency is achieved by choosing a seed cut of @xmath32 . \n note , that this threshold corresponds to only @xmath33 of a mip signal . \n a prototype system for the ilc vertex detector based on depfet pixels has been developed . \n the system has been successfully used for x - ray and mip detection . \n the current benchmarks of the system are :      concerning position resolution , the present test beam data yields an upper limit of @xmath34 m dominated by multiple scattering effects . \n a more precise measurement will be performed in the high energy test beam at cern in summer 2006 .    to achieve the final ilc specifications the system still needs improvements . \n most importantly , the line rate needs to be increased by a factor of 10 . \n the single components of the systems have already been tested up to a line rate of more than 20mhz , whereas their synchronization in the system needs further optimization . moreover \n , the noise performance has to be improved by a factor of two . based on calculations and the experience with the present system , we are very confident that this will be achieved with the next version of depfet sensors and readout chip .    as a next step , \n new generations of all system components are designed and fabricated . \n large depfet matrices with up to @xmath35 pixels are in production . \n the pixel size is reduced to @xmath36 and the internal gain of the sensor is optimized .    a new steering chip using a standard , low voltage process is designed . \n some depfet designs having a so called _ cleargate structure _ can be cleared at much lower voltages than offered by the present steering chip . \n hence , the use of a submicron process is possible here as well . \n this promises a much better radiation tolerance compared to the present chip using a high voltage technology . \n a new generation of the readout chip is designed as well . \n operating the system with a duty cycle as close as possible to the bunch timing of the accelerator ( 1:199 ) will reduce the total power consumption significantly . \n hence , one of the most important conceptual extension of the readout chip will be a power down feature . \n on a longer time scale , a major step is to combine the thinning technology with a depfet production in order to fabricate thin depfet sensors . \n together with the aimed noise figure of enc=100e@xmath3 , a signal - to - noise ratio of 40 is expected for these thin devices . \n the authors would like to thank the technology crew of pnsensor gmbh and the semiconductor laboratory at the mpi munich supporting the depfet fabrication , and uli ktz and norbert meyners for the invaluable support at desy . \n m. trimpl ( 2005 ) : `` design of a current based readout chip and development of a depfet pixel prototype system for the ilc vertex detector '' , phd thesis bonn -

{"ContextTokens": 2209, "GeneratedTokens": 71, "SynthesizedBody": "the recent results obtained by the hst on the optical counterpart of grb 970228 [ 3,4 ] have given answer to important questions concerning its light decay , its proper motion and the nature of the underlying nebula . \n this information must be taken into account in reanalysing all the previously published data .    in this paper \n we aim to refine the values and lower limits ( particularly those obtained with the 1.5meter telescope of the bologna astronomical observatory ) of the points in the @xmath0 light curve of grb 970228 , taking into account the refined magnitude value for the underlying nebulosity given by fruchter et al . \n moreover , we show for the first time and briefly discuss the @xmath1 light curve of this grb . \n galama et al . [ 5 ] collected all the known @xmath0 points and lower limits referring to the grb 970228 optical light curve . \n they however used a value for the luminosity of the nebulosity associated to the object ( @xmath2 ; groot et al . [ 6 ] ) which is overestimated according to the most recent hst observations ( @xmath3 ; fruchter et al . [ 4 ] ) . \n this discrepancy is likely due to calibration errors which depend on the faintness of the object and not on an intrinsic variability ; fox et al . \n [ 2 ] and fruchter et al . [ \n 3 ] actually showed that the nebula is constant in brightness . \n therefore , we refined the @xmath0 data collection by galama et al . [ 5 ] using the new value of the magnitude for the underlying fuzzy object ; in particular , since the ccd observations obtained at bologna observatory [ 7 ] measured the total flux received from the transient plus the nebula and a nearby k  type star whose magnitude is @xmath4 [ 9 ] , we obtained the new @xmath0 magnitudes or lower limits for the optical transient by subtracting the two latter contributions from the data . \n we want to note that in the galama et al.s [ 5 ] data collection the @xmath0 point by guarnieri et al . [ 7 ] is wrongly plotted and must be corrected . \n indeed , the quoted @xmath0 magnitude refers to the total contribution coming from the transient plus the nebulosity and the nearby star , and not from the optical transient alone . the right value on feb . \n 28.827 ( and not on feb . \n 28.76 ) is therefore @xmath5 .    in this revision \n pedichini et al.s [ 10 ] observation of feb . \n 28.81 was not considered because of the difficulty of reliably converting their color system to the @xmath0 band . \n anyway , the importance of pedichini et al.s [ 10 ] observations lies in the fact of providing a variation @xmath6 m @xmath7 between feb . 28 and \n 4 . their observations span from feb 28.795 to 28.827 ut . the bologna @xmath0 frame was taken between feb . \n 28.816 and 28.837 ut , so the two observations partially overlapped . \n the magnitude could be quite different only if the luminosity of the transient during the first part of the observation was higher than in the last part . assuming that pedichini et al.s [ 10 ] magnitude on feb . \n 28 was the same as that found in bologna in the @xmath0 band the same day , the lower limit @xmath8 could be derived for the day mar \n we consider this figure as representative of the magnitude variation in the @xmath0 band , too .    from the observation of margon et al . \n [ 8 ] on mar . \n 3.1 , made with the astrophysical research consortium 3.5meter telescope at apache point in the apm @xmath9 photometric band , galama et al . \n [ 5 ] derived an estimate of @xmath0 by interpolating between the color index @xmath10 measured on feb . \n 28 and on mar . \n bartolini et al . \n [ 1 ] found evidence of fast color variations near the maxima of the optical counterpart of both grb 970228 and grb 970508 , so it could be dangerous to extrapolate the @xmath0 magnitude from margon et al.s [ 8 ] observation and to assume @xmath9 = @xmath11 ; moreover , galama et al . \n [ 5 ] used the color index of the optical transient alone on feb . \n 28 , and that of the optical transient plus the underlying extended source on mar . 9 \n for these reasons we did not include the value obtained by galama et al . \n [ 5 ] from the apache point measurement . \n the refined @xmath0 light curve of the optical transient associated to grb 970228 is shown in fig . 1 \n .    we also collected from the literature all the @xmath1 data points [ 3,7,11,12 ] and plotted them in fig . \n 2 . the @xmath1 band lower limits published by van paradijs et al . \n [ 12 ] were slightly corrected with the use of the @xmath1 magnitude of the nebula ( @xmath12 , as reported by fruchter et al . [ 3 ] ) . \n it should be noted that the value by guarnieri et al . [ 7 ] is interpolated from their @xmath11 and @xmath0 data acquired on feb . \n the overall trends of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves of the transient associated to grb 970228 are quite similar . indeed , we find that both decay following a power law with spectral indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 , i.e. they are coincident within the errors . \n this similarity is however related to the long  term trend . \n actually , in a short time scale the @xmath0 light curve ( fig . \n 1 ) deviates from a unique power law . \n the decay from the light peak can indeed be divided into two phases : the first one , spanning from the optical maximum and lasting 34 days with @xmath15 and the second one , after march 4 , with @xmath16 . \n these figures are in agreement with the findings by galama et al . \n [ 5 ] and confirm the rapid light decay noticed by guarnieri et al .

[ 7 ] . \n we find that in @xmath0 the transient at maximum light was @xmath1760 times brighter than the underlying nebulosity . \n if the nebula is a host galaxy , the optical transient associated to grb 970228 has been by far the brightest variable object known up to now . \n we refined the @xmath0 light curve of the optical transient associated to grb 970228 with the use of a more correct value for the magnitude of its underlying nebula and compared this curve to the one in the @xmath1 band ( previously unpublished ) . \n it is interesting that both the overall trends follow a power law decay and are almost identical within the errors . \n the ratio between the @xmath0 luminosity of the optical transient at maximum and the nebulosity has been corrected : now we know that the transient was approximately 60 times brighter than the nebula at that time . \n 90 bartolini c. , beskin g.m . , \n guarnieri a. , masetti n. , piccioni a. , 1997 , did grb 970228 and grb 970508 present similar optical properties ? . \n in : meegan c. , cushman p.

solving boson sampling problem with @xmath3 bosons on classical computers depends on computing permanents of @xmath4 matrices . \n therefore , the upper - bound is strongly related to the condition on which a quantum boson sampling machine will surpass classical computers .    here \n we present the test results of computing permanents on tianhe-2  @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig : tianhe2 ] ) , the supercomputer which has retained its position as the world s no.1 in top500 supercomputer lists since june 2013 . \n the performance of tianhe-2 is comparable with that of several millions of typical personal computers working simultaneously . \n we developed , optimized and tested parallel programs of two best - known algorithms , ryser s algorithm and balasubramanian - bax / franklin - glynn s ( bb / fg s ) algorithm . in this paper , we report the speed performance of ryser s algorithm and bb / fg s algorithm in real tests on tianhe-2 supercomputer . \n we then show the predicted performance of computing the permanent of a @xmath1 matrix on the full system of tianhe-2 supercomputer . \n in addition , we show that ryser s algorithm has an unacceptable accumulating rounding error from the limited word length of classical computers , compared to bb / fg s algorithm . \n this implies the result of ryser s algorithm for large - size matrices may be untrustable . \n ryser s algorithm is shown in equation   and bb / fg s algorithm in equation  . in the equations \n , @xmath5 denotes the permanent of the matrix @xmath6 . \n @xmath7 is the element of @xmath6 in the @xmath8th row and @xmath9th column . \n @xmath3 is the matrix size . \n @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .            to test the upper - bound speed of computing permanents classically , we tried exploiting tianhe-2 s computing resources as many as possible ( see section  [ sec : methods ] and appendix  [ app : methodology ] ) . \n tianhe-2 has 16,000 compute nodes , and each comprises two intel ivy bridge xeon e5 processors ( cpus ) and three xeon phi coprocessors ( denoted as mics , because they adopt intel many integrated core architecture ) . \n ryser s algorithm was tested with only cpus , while bb / fg s algrithm was tested under two types of configurations : with only cpus or with cpus and mics heterogeneously . \n we use real tests on small - scale subsystems ( with @xmath16 compute nodes ) to evaluate and optimize our programs . \n note that even a small - scale subsystem with 256 nodes still has a predicted linpack performance of 541.8 teraflops and a theoretical peak performance of 848.4 teraflops that may be ranked in the top 160 in top500 s list in nov . \n 2015 . \n the key of gaining speedup from a parallel computer system is to implement the scalable parallel program , which can get more and more performance improvement with the increase of the computing resources . to evaluate the scalability of our programs \n , we tested them with different combinations of problem scale and parallel scale . according to the complexity ( @xmath17 \n , @xmath3 is the matrix size ) , the number of operations almost grows double with the increase of @xmath3 . \n execution time grows by 1.95 times in fig . \n [ fig : executiontime](a ) , meaning that the additional cost of larger matrix is very small with the increase of problem scale \n . meanwhile , execution time decreases with nearly linear speedup ( slopes of 0.54 and 0.59 in fig . \n [ fig : executiontime](b ) ) when the parallel scale increases . \n ideal slope is @xmath18 , meaning no additional cost . \n these suggest our programs have execellent scalability with only small and fixed cost from their serial parts . \n rccc + & & + & & * lower bound * & * upper bound * + & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + * b : * & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 +   + & 284.2 & + * r_square : * & 0.994 & + * adjusted r_square : * & 0.9938 & + * rmse : * & 2.665 & +", "StartTimeOffset": 126172571004, "RequestID": "14deca915fcaeaf7002a4a8908954999c5d4dc10", "TotalTokens": 1589}
{"ContextTokens": 2659, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "there has been significant recent progress in the study of galaxy formation within a cosmological context , mainly due to a phenomenological approach to this problem . \n the idea is to start with a structure formation model that describes where and when galactic dark haloes form . a simple description of gas dynamics and star formation provides a means to calculate the amount of stars forming in these haloes . \n stellar population synthesis models then provide the spectral evolution , i.e.  luminosities and colours , of these galaxies . \n many physical processes are modelled as simple functions of the circular velocity of the galaxy halo . therefore \n , the tully - fisher relation is the most obvious observational relation to try and predict , as it relates the total luminosity of a galaxy to its halo circular velocity . \n however , most phenomenological galaxy formation models do not simultaneously fit the i - band tully - fisher relation and the b or k band luminosity function . \n when one sets the model parameters such that the tully - fisher relation has the right normalization , the luminosity functions generally overshoot ( e.g.  kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; kauffmann , colberg , diaferio & white 1999 ) , certainly for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 standard cdm cosmology ( in the form given by davis et al .  1985 ) that we consider in this paper . \n alternatively , when making sure that the luminosity functions matches by changing some of the model parameters , the tully - fisher relation ends up significantly shifted with respect to the observed relation ( e.g.  cole et al .  1994 ; heyl et al . \n 1995 ) .    in order to keep the modelling as analytical as possible , an extension to the press & schechter ( 1974 ) prescription for the evolution of galaxy haloes ( e.g.  bond et al . 1991 \n ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ) has been a popular ingredient for implementations of a phenomenological theory of galaxy formation . \n however , the eps formalism is designed to identify collapsed systems , irrespective of whether these contain surviving subsystems . \n this ` overmerging ' of subhaloes into larger embedding haloes is relevant to the problem of matching both the galaxy luminosity function and the tully - fisher relation , as the central galaxy in an overmerged halo is the focus of a much larger cooling gas reservoir than the reservoir that galaxy is to focus of in case its parent subhalo survives . \n traditional n - body simulations suffer from a similar overmerging problem ( e.g.  white 1976 ) , which is of a purely numerical nature , caused by two - body heating in dense environments when the mass resolution is too low ( carlberg 1994 ; van kampen 1995 ) .    in order to circumvent these problems , we use an n - body simulation technique that includes a built - in recipe for galaxy halo formation , designed to prevent overmerging ( van kampen 1995 , 1997 ) , to generate the halo population and its formation and merger history . \n this resolves most of the discrepancy sketched above , _ and _  allows us to make the modelling more realistic by adding chemical evolution and a merger - driven bursting mode of star formation to the modelling . once stars are formed , we apply the stellar population synthesis models of jimenez et al . \n ( 1998 ) to follow their evolution . \n we have enhanced these models with a model for the evolution of the average metallicity of the population , which depends on the starting metallicity . \n feedback to the surrounding material means that cooling properties of that material will change with time , affecting the star formation rate , and thus various other properties of the parent galaxy . \n the key ingredients of the model are described below . \n we refer to van kampen et al . \n ( 1999 ) for a much more detailed description and discussion of the model , and a list of the choices for the various parameters involved . \n this is often treated by monte - carlo realizations of the analytic ` extended press - schechter ' formalism , which ignores substructure . \n we use a special n - body technique to prevent galaxy - scale haloes undergoing ` overmerging ' owing to inadequate numerical resolution . \n each halo contains a single galaxy at formation . \n when haloes merge , a criterion based on dynamical friction is used to decide how many galaxies exist in the newly merged halo . \n the most massive of those galaxies becomes the single central galaxy to which gas can cool , while the others become its satellites . \n when a halo first forms , it is assumed to have an isothermal - sphere density profile . \n a fraction @xmath3 of this is in the form of gas at the virial temperature , which can cool to form stars within a single galaxy at the centre of the halo . \n application of the standard radiative cooling curve shows the rate at which this hot gas cools below @xmath4  k , and is able to form stars . \n energy output from supernovae reheats some of the cooled gas back to the hot phase . \n when haloes merge , all hot gas is stripped and ends up in the new halo . \n the star formation rate is equal the ratio of the amount of cold gas available and the star - formation timescale . \n the amount of cold gas available depends on the merger history of the halo , the star formation history , and the how much cold gas has been reheated by feedback processes . \n we also model star bursts , i.e.  the star - formation rate may suffer a sharp spike following a major merger event .      the energy released from young stars heats cold gas in proportion to the amount of star - formation , returning it to the reservoir of hot gas . \n our work assumes the spectral models of jimenez et al . \n ( 1998 ) ; for solar metallicity , the results are not greatly different from those of other workers . \n the imf is generally taken to be salpeter , but any choice is possible . unlike other workers , we take it as established that the population of brown dwarfs makes a negligible contribution to the total stellar mass density , and we do not allow an adjustable @xmath5 ratio , @xmath6 , for the stellar population \n .      the evolution of the metals must be followed , for two reasons : ( i ) the cooling of the hot gas depends on metal content ; ( ii ) for a given age , a stellar population of high metallicity will be much redder . \n the models of jimenez et al . \n ( 1998 ) allow synthetic stellar populations of any metallicity to be constructed . \n with the set - up described above we match both the b and k band luminosity function and the i - band tully - fisher relation , for an @xmath0 standard cdm structure formation scenario . resolving \n the overmerging problem is the major contributor to this result , but the inclusion of chemical evolution and starbursts are also important ingredients . \n the new ingredients we have added to the modelling of galaxy formation are needed in order to make the models more realistic , and are not introduced simply in order to give yet more free parameters . nevertheless , our resolution to the tully - fisher / luminosity function discrepancy may well not be unique , and various other changes to the ingredients of the phenomenological galaxy formation recipe might produce similar results . \n for example , we have not studied the influence cosmological parameters have on the model galaxy populations , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are likely to be the important parameters . \n other types of ingredients are possible as well : somerville & primack ( 1998 ) resolve some of the discrepancy using a dust extinction model plus a halo - disk approach to feedback . \n one way of resolving the worries about degeneracies in the cosmological / physical parameter space will be to include data at intermediate and high redshifts , which is being gathered with increasing speed and ease , and at increasingly higher redshifts . in this contribution \n we show a preliminary comparison of the correlation properties of galaxies at redshift @xmath10 . \n recently , giavalisco et al .  ( 1998 ) gave an estimate for the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xmath11 for a sample of lyman - break galaxies at this redshift . \n they found @xmath12mpc and @xmath13 . \n we selected our model galaxies in exactly the same way as giavalisco et al . \n ( 1998 ) did , and compared two of the models produced by van kampen et al . \n ( 1999 ) , models @xmath14 and @xmath15 , to the observational data . the first model ( @xmath14 ) , which is as close as possible to the model by cole et al .  ( 1994 ) , but with the mass - to - light parameter @xmath16 , gives @xmath17mpc and @xmath18 . the second model ( @xmath15 ) , which includes starbursts and chemical evolution , gives @xmath19mpc and @xmath20 . \n both models fit the correlation function at @xmath21 very well , and can not be distinguished from each other .    as the observed correlation data are still relatively uncertain at this moment in time \n , it is premature to rule out models on the basis of this data . \n the two models discussed above have similar predictions for low redshifts , but predict different clustering properties at high - redshift . \n however , the differences are not large , so one needs either really good data , or a much larger variety of observational characteristics of the high - redshift galaxy population .    many thanks for the loud vocal support from outside the conference building during my presentation . \n i like to think that the people of marseille just wanted to show how much they supported everything i said ...    bond j.r . , cole s. , efstathiou g. , kaiser n. , 1991 , apj , 379 , 440 bower r.j . , 1991 , mnras , 248 , 332 carlberg r.g . , 1994 , \n apj , 433 , 468 cole s. , aragn - salamanca a. , frenk c.s . , navarro j.f . , \n zepf s.e . , 1994 , mnras , 271 , 781 davis m. , efstathiou g. , frenk c.s . \n , white s.d.m . , 1985 , \n apj , 292 , 371 heyl j.s . , cole s. , frenk c.s . , navarro j.f . , 1995 , mnras , 274 , 755 giavalisco , m. , steidel c.c . , adelberger , k.l . , \n dickinson , m.e . , \n pettini , m. , kellogg , m. , 1998 , apj , 503 , 543 jimenez r. , padoan p. , matteucci f. , heavens a. , 1998 , mnras , 299 , 123 kauffman g. , white s.d.m . , 1993 , mnras , 261 , 921 kauffmann g. , colberg j.m . , diaferio a. , white s.d.m . , 1999 , mnras , 303 , 188 kauffmann g. , white s.d.m . , guiderdoni , 1993 , mnras , 264 , 201 lacey c.g . , cole s. , 1993 , mnras , 262 , 627 press w.h . \n , schechter p. , 1974 , \n apj , 187 , 425 somerville r.s . , \n primack j.r . , 1998 , astro - ph/9802268 van kampen e. , 1995 , mnras , 273 , 295 van kampen e. , 1997 , in clarke d.a . , west m.j . , \n 12th ` kingston meeting ' on theoretical astrophysics : computational astrophysics , asp conf . \n vol . 123 . \n , san francisco , p. 231 , astro - ph/9904270 van kampen e. , jimenez r. , peacock j.a , 1999 , mnras , in press , astro - ph/9904274 white s.d.m . \n , 1976 , mnras , 177 , 717", "StartTimeOffset": 140884934430, "RequestID": "42aa5cd68b445ae1b16a45cb3a86ed5c9c7c574b", "TotalTokens": 2813}
{"ContextTokens": 3387, "GeneratedTokens": 59, "SynthesizedBody": "energy localization in the form of breathers has been intensely investigated over the past several years @xcite . \n these highly localized long - lived excitations in translationally invariant nonlinear arrays are of great interest because they provide a mechanism for energy storage that does not rely on defects . indeed , the fact that these excitations are often mobile ( which they would in general not be if the localization were defect - induced ) makes them particularly interesting in the context of efficient transport of vibrational energy  @xcite . \n exact breather excitations , that is , breathers that persist forever , can be confirmed analytically and constructed numerically for certain nonlinear infinite arrays of interacting masses , among them nonlinear arrays with no local potentials and interactions between neighboring sites that vary as @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite . \n the @xmath2 s denote displacements of the masses at sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n when the interactions are not precisely of this form , or when the array is finite , or when other excitations ( for example , phonons or other localized excitations ) are present in the system , it is no longer possible to prove that there are exact breather solutions . \n nevertheless , it is possible to explore the problem numerically . in particular , in this paper we study the asymptotic dynamics of localized excitations in the one - dimensional fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) @xmath5-model at zero temperature and during thermal relaxation . \n we corroborate that long - wavelength thermal excitations have a profound effect on breather stability . \n since thermal fluctuations are inevitable in any real system , zero - temperature results must be applied with appropriate caution . \n these results extend our earlier work to much longer time regimes  @xcite , and agree with and complement those of piazza et al . \n the conditions for breather stationarity and longevity are thereby further clarified . \n we present our numerical results in secs .  [ zero ] and [ nonzero ] , and end with a brief summary in sec . \n [ summation ] . \n the hamiltonian for the fpu @xmath5-model is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of sites , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the harmonic and anharmonic force constants , respectively . \n we set @xmath10 throughout . \n the equations of motion with free - end boundary conditions are integrated using a fourth order runge - kutta method with time interval @xmath11 ( further reduction leads to no significant improvement ) . \n the total energy of the array is the sum over individual symmetrized site energies @xmath12  @xcite . \n a zero temperature environment with the least disturbance to the dynamics in the chain is achieved by connecting only the ends of the chain to such an environment via a dissipation term . \n this is accomplished by adding a term of the form @xmath13 to the equations of motion for sites @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite .    since we do not _ a priori _ know the form of the longest - lived localized excitation \n , we initially create an excitation of the  odd parity \" breather configuration with amplitudes @xmath16 , and zero velocity at each site . \n the frequency of the resulting oscillatory motion increases with increasing @xmath17 , which must be chosen so that this frequency is above the phonon band edge at @xmath18 . \n this excitation is not an exact stationary solution of the equations of motion , so it typically sheds some energy while re - accommodating amplitudes and frequencies , and settles into an excitation that is very long - lived . \n the discarded energy appears in the form of phonons that travel away from the localized excitation and dissipate quickly , in a time @xmath19 , across the ends of the chain . \n the balance of the energy remains localized , most of it ( @xmath20 for @xmath21 ) on the three initially excited sites , and decays exponentially with an extremely long characteristic time @xmath22 . \n = 3.0 in    to extract exponents and characteristic times , it is crucial to have data that covers both time scales , and to normalize the data in such a way that one behavior does not mask or distort the other  @xcite . \n we introduce the _ normalized energy _ @xmath23 and the _ modified normalized energy _ \n @xmath24 : @xmath25 the denominator in the first contains the initial energies , and in the second the energies after the discarded phonons have dissipated ( but before the remaining localized excitation has decayed appreciably ) . in our illustrations we take @xmath26 . \n = 3.0 in    in fig .  [ fig1 ] we show typical results for the normalized energy for three excitation amplitudes over more than six decades of time . \n the modified normalized energy shows essentially the same behavior . \n if the decay of the long - lived excitation is exponential , we expect @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] vs @xmath29 to be straight lines over the appropriate long time intervals . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] we clearly see this behavior , which extends over the entire time interval for the higher ( but not the lower ) amplitude excitation . \n the slope for the @xmath21 curve leads to a decay time of @xmath30 , a number reported here merely to stress its enormous magnitude . \n the frequency of the localized breather increases with increasing amplitude and hence is more separated from the phonon band for larger @xmath17 , leading to a slower decay of more energetic breathers . \n as the breather loses its energy , its frequency decreases , and eventually as it approaches the phonon band edge the decay becomes more rapid . \n this behavior is evident in the @xmath31 curve in fig . \n we also find that longer chains exhibit a longer decay time : residual amplitude of the breather at sites far from its center decreases rapidly with increasing distance and thus the chain end sites have less energy to dissipate . \n figure  [ fig3 ] confirms the exponential behavior of the breather decay  @xcite . for two initial amplitudes \n , the figure shows @xmath32 $ ] vs @xmath33 , which yields a straight line of slope @xmath5 if the decay is of the form @xmath34 . \n the inset shows the values of the slopes as a function of time . \n for @xmath21 pure exponential behavior @xmath35 is confirmed throughout the time range presented . \n the deviation from pure exponential decay for the lower amplitude breather is evident . \n = 3.0 in    a breather of a given amplitude has a well - defined characteristic frequency . in fig . \n [ fig4 ] we show this frequency in relation to the phonon band edge as a function of time for the cases discussed above . for 31-site chains , \n the frequency of the breather of initial amplitude @xmath21 decreases very little over the entire simulation , while that of initial amplitude @xmath31 decreases more markedly . \n consistent with the fact that the breather does not disappear entirely in the time range shown , its frequency never reaches the phonon band edge . if the initial amplitude of the excitation were even smaller , or the simulation time much longer , or the chain shorter , the breather would eventually disappear . \n this last case is illustrated in fig . \n the disappearance of the breather coincides with its frequency reaching the band edge . \n the inset shows @xmath36 , the ratio of the energy on the five sites around the breather to the total energy . \n this parameter is of order unity when most of the energy is localized on a small number of sites . \n the situation is less certain when a localized excitation evolves in a thermal environment . \n other excitations in the medium perturb the breather , and its eventual fate varies from one realization to another . to illustrate the complexity of the situation , we present two scenarios . \n = 3.0 in    we begin with a chain that is initially in thermal equilibrium at a nonzero temperature @xmath37  @xcite . at time @xmath38 \n , the end sites of the thermalized chain are connected to a zero temperature bath via a purely dissipative term  @xcite . \n we follow the thermal relaxation of the chain and , in particular , the dynamics of breathers that may spontaneously appear during relaxation if the initial temperature is sufficiently high . \n figure  [ fig5 ] shows the evolution of the total energy in a chain of @xmath39 sites initially thermalized at temperature @xmath40 . \n the figure also shows the energy in only the four sites @xmath41 . after a relatively short time ( @xmath42 time units in this particular realization ) almost all of the energy settles in these sites and remains there . \n the excitation around the four sites turns out to be an  even parity \" breather , with maximum displacements @xmath17 and @xmath43 alternating on sites @xmath44 and @xmath45 , smaller but not negligible amplitudes at sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and essentially no motion of the other sites . \n the frequency of the breather , initially @xmath48 , decreases very little for the duration of the simulation . in fig . \n [ fig5 ] we also present the modified normalized energy . \n its decay is clearly exponential , with an enormously long time constant , @xmath49 . \n thus this breather , even in our relatively short chain , is essentially stationary . \n this decay time is much longer than that reported in the previous section , consistent with the fact that the amplitude of the breather that has emerged spontaneously is larger . \n the thermal relaxation process has swept the lattice clean of all other excitations , allowing the breather to survive undisturbed . \n this process was described in our earlier work  @xcite . \n there we reported a stretched exponential rather than a purely exponential decay , a conclusion that relied on the normalized rather than the modified normalized energy  @xcite , on a time history that was not sufficiently long , and on a statistical average over a thermal ensemble that included realizations where no breather appeared during the thermal relaxation process ( and where the energy dissipation was consequently much more rapid ) .    in our second scenario , at @xmath38 a breather is explicitly injected into a chain that is in thermal equilibrium at a very low temperature ( too low for the spontaneous formation of breathers ) . \n the chain is then allowed to relax into a zero temperature heat bath . \n we find that the thermal background invariably sets the breather in motion , and causes the breather to collide with other excitations and with the chain boundaries . \n collision events not only cause the breather to keep moving , but also lead to breather degradation through loss of energy upon collision  @xcite . \n the resulting lifetime @xmath22 of the breather is then in general much smaller than in the first scenario . \n the lifetime is also much smaller than that of a breather of the same amplitude injected into a zero temperature chain . \n we find this behavior even when the temperature is extremely low ( all the way down to @xmath50 ) . as a quantitative check \n we have explicitly injected a breather of initial amplitude @xmath21 into a chain thermalized at @xmath51 . \n the system is then allowed to relax into a zero temperature bath , as before . \n compared to the lifetime of the breather in the zero temperature chain , the lifetime of the breather is now much reduced , @xmath52 . \n a similar comparison with @xmath53 again leads to dramatically different lifetimes , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 ( @xmath51 ) . \n note that it does not much matter whether the injected breather is of even or odd parity ( we inject an odd one ) . \n why is a breather created spontaneously during thermal relaxation more stable than one explicitly injected into a thermalized chain , even at extremely low temperatures ? \n the answer lies in the effect of different phonons on breather dynamics  @xcite . \n whereas short wavelength zone - boundary phonons contribute to spontaneous breather formation (  modulational instability \" ) , breathers are most strongly perturbed by the longest wavelength phonons . \n these are also the phonons that dissipate most rapidly out of a chain with free - end boundaries into a zero - temperature bath . in the higher temperature system , \n when the breather is created spontaneously the long wavelength phonons have already dissipated and , as dissipation continues up the phonon spectrum , the breather is increasingly less disturbed until it reaches a spatially stationary very long - lived configuration  @xcite . on the other hand , \n if the breather is injected into a thermalized system , the breather is subject to strong disturbance by long wavelength phonons even at the very lowest temperatures until these phonons dissipate . \n an injected breather in the thermalized scenario is therefore a more fragile excitation than a spontaneously created breather of the same amplitude . to confirm this description \n we have followed the dynamics of a breather injected into a relaxing chain _ \n after _ the long wavelength phonons have decayed , and find the breather to be almost as stable as one in a zero - temperature simulation . \n for example , for a zero - temperature injected breather of initial amplitude @xmath57 in a chain of 31 sites ( @xmath58 ) , we find a lifetime @xmath59 . in a chain \n initially thermalized at @xmath60 and then allowed to relax , if we wait until @xmath61 before injecting the same breather we find a somewhat shortened but still very long lifetime of @xmath62 , in any case much longer than it would be if injected at @xmath38 . \n we have also observed a breather in a chain whose temperature is maintained at an extremely low but nonzero value . \n the breather in this case is always fragile , continuing to move and lose energy until it degrades completely . \n the zero temperature stability of the breather is therefore a somewhat singular result . \n our work supports three main conclusions concerning the dynamics of breathers in fpu @xmath5-chains : 1 ) at zero temperature in finite chains , breather - like excitations remain stationary and localized , and their energy decays exponentially with time ; 2 ) the decay time at zero temperature is extremely long , increasing with increasing chain length and with increasing initial breather amplitude ; 3 ) long wavelength thermal background sets the breather in motion , which in turn leads to a more rapid decay of the breather . \n the zero - temperature result is in this sense fragile . \n we have confirmed that breather decay for any particular realization is exponential  @xcite until the breather frequency closely approaches the phonon band edge . \n however , since the characteristic exponential time varies considerably from one realization to another , an ensemble averaged decay may be of stretched exponential or other form . \n the authors are grateful to f. piazza for enlightening discussions . \n this work was supported by the engineering research program of the office of basic energy

[ figure3]b suggests that a thin , circular gas disk model in general can not explain simultaneously observed gas velocities and dispersions . for a simultaneous fit one \n has to invoke gas turbulence . \n alternatively , the extended gas might somehow rotate at subcircular velocities , which would lead the models to infer a lower bh mass and hence lower nuclear differential rotation . \n qualitatively , fig . \n [ figure2 ] suggests another possible solution to this problem : the gas changes from a flat disk configuration outside the nucleus to a ( more ) spherical distribution closer to the nucleus . \n the nuclear spherical gas distribution explains the central @xmath0 . \n furthermore , the new configuration implies that ( i ) the flat gas disk effectively has an inner radius and ( ii ) only part of the observed nuclear emission - line flux is coming from a disk . \n both changes put the gas associated with the circular disk at a larger mean distance from the bh , compared to the continous disk model , and hence at lower circular velocities for the same bh mass . \n the simple models discussed above suggest that the observed excess in velocity dispersion in nuclear emission - line gas disks could be explained by a more spherical gas distribution towards the nucleus . \n in such a model , the gas remains collisionless ( as in the customary single gas disk model ) and thus avoids invoking ad hoc turbulence or shocks which require a permanent input of kinetic energy to persist . \n nevertheless , it could well be that activity associated with the bh can provide such a continuous input of energy . \n the outliers in figs . \n [ figure2 ] &  [ figure3 ] and the tendency for the collisionless models to underpredict @xmath0 more for active galaxies rather than for quiescent galaxies perhaps favor this scenario . \n more sophisticated modeling and further observations can help to determine between different gas configurations . \n on the one hand , more accurate modeling of the stellar mass density and the emission - line velocity profiles are expected to decrease the predicted @xmath2 at fixed bh mass . \n the central density profile of bright ellipticals is generally shallower than an isothermal distribution . \n emission - lines often show extended wings : the true 2nd moment is then larger than the gaussian 2nd moment . \n this effect is taken into account in the gas disk model , but not in the spherical model . \n on the other hand , emission - line flux profiles are typically marginally resolved . \n they may contain a significant contribution from an unresolved component which can be arbitrarily close to the bh . \n this might increase the predicted @xmath0 . \n uv spectroscopy can determine directly if shocks are present . \n in the presence of shocks the gas can be shock - ionized . \n if absent , the emission - line gas is only photo - ionized . \n the two ionization mechanisms produce different uv emission - line ratios ( e.g. , dopita et al . \n 1997 ) .    in summary \n , the current results can not distinguish between the various gas configurations . \n however , accurate bh mass measurements ( and hence bh demography ) and bh accretion models depend on such a distinction . \n improvement of the simplistic gas dynamical modeling presented here and uv observations can help to resolve this .", "StartTimeOffset": 164815375278, "RequestID": "39c6b6af489983a3865f59a4b542a3858167a841", "TotalTokens": 2730}

ribbon flares accompanied by a filament / prominence eruption . \n this question is critical both for understanding the physics of solar eruptions and for predicting them . \n it has long been known empirically that two features are required for strong solar activity : magnetic shear and magnetic complexity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by shear we mean that the field near the photospheric neutral line is observed to be almost parallel to the neutral line , rather than perpendicular to it , as would be the case for a potential field . by complexity \n we mean that that the active region is not simply bipolar , consisting of a leading sunspot and a well - separated trailing polarity region , but contains instead an intermingling of polarities as in a delta sunspot in which two opposite polarity umbrae share a common penumbra ( @xcite ) . \n delta sunspots , in particular , are well known to be prolific flare producers . \n ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the physical reason for the observed requirement of shear is straightforward to understand . \n the field must contain free energy in order to power the eruptive event ; somewhere , there must be a large deviation of the field from its potential state . \n furthermore , since the free energy is most easily generated in the deep photosphere , it should appear in the field that has most recently emerged and , therefore , is nearest the neutral line . \n the second feature , magnetic complexity , is more difficult to understand . \n cmes , filament eruptions , and two - ribbon flares usually appear to occur along only a single neutral line , i.e. in a bipolar region . \n the post - eruption x - ray emission is observed to straddle only one neutral line . \n in fact , the standard picture for flare / filament eruptions , the so - called tether cutting model ( e.g. @xcite ) involves only a single sheared magnetic arcade . \n although magnetic complexity plays no role in this model , the observations show that it is essential for the event to occur in the first place . \n also , recent observations indicate that multiple neutral lines may be a common feature of cmes ( @xcite ) . in this paper \n , we clarify why the magnetic complexity of a delta sunspot , or worse , is necessary for violent eruptions . \n recently , we developed a new model for solar mass ejections ( @xcite ) which shares with the standard picture , the features that the eruption and the bulk of the energy release occur in a sheared arcade . \n as usual , the shear is concentrated near the neutral line , so that the stressed core field near the neutral line provides the free energy and the upward push , whereas the unsheared overlying field provides the downward pull that restrains expansion of the core field . \n the key new feature proposed in our model is that additional flux systems are present , which make it possible for reconnection to take place between the unsheared overlying flux and the flux in those neighboring systems . \n this reconnection transfers unsheared flux to the neighboring flux systems , thereby removing the overlying field and the restraining pull . \n hence , reconnection allows the innermost core field to `` break out '' to infinity without opening the overlying field , and violating the aly - sturrock open - field energy limit ( @xcite ) . \n a 2d model for this `` breakout '' process has been presented ( @xcite ) . \n the model postulated a global magnetic field topology for the sun consisting of a four - flux system in which reconnection between the upper and lower systems transfers flux to the two side systems . \n the question we address in this paper is the following : _ what is the minimum complexity needed in the magnetic field of an active region so that a similar process can occur in a fully 3d geometry ? \n _    in order to answer this question , let us first determine the topology of a bipolar active region . \n for this case , the relevant magnetic field corresponds to a large - scale background solar bipole in which an active region bipole has emerged . \n since we are interested only in the basic topology , it is sufficient to consider a potential , unsheared field ; a typical example is shown in figure 1 . \n the yellow surface in the figure corresponds to the photosphere chosen to be at @xmath0 , and the view is oriented so that the @xmath1 direction is vertical , @xmath2 is to the right , and @xmath3 is out of the page . \n the background field is that due to a magnetic dipole pointing in the @xmath4 direction , with relative magnitude @xmath5 , and located at position @xmath6 . \n the active region is due to another dipole , in the @xmath2 direction , with magnitude @xmath7 , and located at @xmath8 . \n the active region `` sunspots '' are indicated in the figure by the black and white spots , which contain all the contours of @xmath9 on the photosphere that are greater than half - maximum . note that @xmath9 is smooth everywhere ; the contours simply indicate where there is concentration of field , and can be thought of as indicating the umbra of the spots . \n a true sunspot would have much higher field concentration than our example here , but the topology would be the same . \n there are three polarity regions on the photosphere : a semi - infinite negative region due to the background dipole , a semi - infinite positive region consisting of the positive background plus the positive , leading - polarity active region sunspot , and a finite negative region due to the trailing polarity sunspot . \n the two neutral lines defining the three polarity regions are indicated by the black lines on the yellow photospheric plane . \n the closed neutral line surrounding the finite negative polarity region would correspond to the edge of the trailing spot s penumbra . \n it is evident from figure 1 that the topology of a bipolar active region is simply that of an embedded dipole ( @xcite ) . \n it consists of only two flux systems , the flux connecting the positive polarity region to the background field ( red field lines ) and the flux connecting the positive polarity to the negative spot ( green lines ) . \n the separatrix surface can be visualized by examining those field line sections where the four pairs of red and green lines are indistinguishably close together in the figure . \n these red - green sections outline a hemispherical separatrix surface that encloses the green flux , and across which the magnetic connectivity is discontinuous . \n the connectivity is also discontinuous at a singular line originating at a point inside the negative sunspot region ( where the four green field lines appear to come together in the figure ) , and continuing into the background region ( the four red field lines that are close together ) . \n a magnetic null occurs in the corona where this singular line passes through the separatrix surface ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n the intersection of the separatrix surface with the plane of the photosphere forms a closed curve that encircles the negative sunspot and defines the photospheric boundary between the green and red field lines . \n the photospheric connectivity is discontinuous at this curve and at the two points where the singular line intersects the photosphere . \n we now imagine that the field near the photospheric neutral line of the negative spot is strongly sheared , and ask what happens to the overlying green flux . \n the key point is that , in this case , the amount of overlying unsheared flux can not decrease . \n the green flux inside the photospheric separatrix curve must always be exactly equal to the amount of flux in the trailing negative - polarity sunspot . \n note , however , that reconnection and energy release can still occur . \n for example , if the `` sunspots '' in figure 1 move , then red and green flux can reconnect at the null ( @xcite ) , exchanging positions and causing the separatrix curve to move to its most energetically favorable position . but \n the amount of green flux inside the separatrix never changes . \n therefore , in order for the sheared core field to open , a fixed amount of unsheared overlying flux would have to open as well , which is energetically unfavorable ( @xcite ) . \n this is the fundamental reason why bipolar active regions do not exhibit violent eruptive activity even if strongly sheared  their topology is too restrictive to allow a decrease in the overlying unsheared flux . \n now , let us consider a delta sunspot . to the system of figure 1 \n , we add a dipole that is pointing in the @xmath1 direction , with magnitude @xmath10 , and located inside the negative spot region at @xmath11 . \n the resulting topology is shown in figure 2 , which focuses on the region around the negative spot for clarity . due to the presence of the additional dipole , a positive polarity umbra and \n a neutral line have appeared inside the the negative spot , giving it a delta appearance . in order to make the topology easier to visualize \n , we chose the dipole parameters so that the parasitic polarity is located centrally within the parent spot , but the results described below remain valid for the usual case where the parasitic spot is off to one side .    now \n four distinct flux systems are present . \n in addition to the original red and green systems , there is a blue flux system comprised of field lines that connect the negative spot to the parasitic positive polarity . \n we expect this system to appear with the addition of the parasitic polarity , but surprisingly , another flux system ( gray field lines ) appears inside the parasitic spot and connects some of the innermost positive flux to the distant , negative - polarity background region . \n the separatrix surfaces now consist of a horizontal and a vertical torus , both cut by the photosphere plane . \n the horizontal torus can be visualized by joining the fieldline sections where the red and green lines are indistinguishably close to the sections where the blue and gray lines are close . \n similarily the vertical torus is formed by joining the blue - green sections to the red - gray sections , ( only a small base section of this torus can be seen in the figure ) . in the corona , the curve of intersection of the two torii defines a separator line along which all four flux systems come in contact . for the particular delta spot of figure 2 , which has a high degree of symmetry , there are four magnetic nulls located on this separator line , but there can be as few as two . the intersection of the two separatrix surfaces with the plane of the photosphere forms three concentric closed curves across which the photospheric connectivity is discontinuous . \n as before , an approximately circular curve outside the negative spot marks the photospheric boundary between red and green flux , a closed curve lying inside the negative spot but outside the positive spot denotes the boundary between green and blue , and a closed curve lying inside the positive parasitic spot bounds the blue from the gray . \n this four - flux topology is precisely what is needed for eruption to occur , and is the direct 3d analog of our 2d model ( @xcite ) . \n assume , as before , that the neutral line around the negative spot is strongly sheared . \n the green flux overlying the core neutral line field can now be decreased by reconnection between the green and gray systems at the coronal separator line . \n this will convert green and gray flux into red and blue . note that , unlike the dipolar active - region case above , the actual amount of green flux decreases , which allows the sheared core field to erupt outward . on the photosphere , \n the outer separatrix curve shrinks inward while the middle separatrix curve expands outward . \n an identical behavior can be obtained by shearing the inner neutral line . \n reconnection between blue and red field lines at the separator line converts them into green and gray . \n of course , a real active region on the sun can have much more complexity than this very simplest of delta - configurations ; even so , we expect that the topology of four flux systems meeting along a coronal separator line is the basic topology underlying eruptive activity . \n it is unlikely that more than four systems would share a common boundary . \n we conclude , therefore , that a delta sunspot has sufficient complexity for the breakout model to operate , and propose that this is why delta spots are so active . \n note that , if eruption does occur , it will take place on only one neutral line at a time , because a decrease in the field overlying one neutral line requires an increase in the field overlying the adjacent neutral line . \n this explains why solar eruptions typically appear to involve only one sheared arcade . \n the eruption , itself , is exactly the same in our model as in the standard picture , except that now even the lowest - lying sheared field can open ( @xcite ) . \n the sheared field at one neutral line blows open , ejecting a filament if present , and then reconnects with itself to close back down and form the observed hot x - ray loops . \n it should be emphasized that this post - eruption reconnection , which can release a great deal of energy , is completely different than the reconnection proposed in our model , which acts only as a trigger for the eruption . \n our model has interesting implications for observations . \n a crucial feature of the topology in figure 2 is the presence of the gray flux connecting the parasitic spot to the distant background region . \n this feature is the main difference between the delta and the bipolar field of figure 1 , in which all the flux of the negative sunspot connects locally . \n even though the parasitic - polarity flux in our example is significantly smaller than the flux of the parent spot , this nonlocal connection is the minimum - energy , current - free state of the magnetic field . \n of course , if the parasitic spot is sufficiently small , then all its flux will close locally into the parent spot , so that the topology becomes that of an embedded dipole within an embedded dipole . \n these considerations imply that , as flux emerges through the photosphere , one should see an abrupt jump in the structure of coronal loops after it becomes energetically favorable for the parasitic spot to form distant connections . such dramatic jumps in coronal connections , correlated with magnetic emergence , \n should be directly observable with the magnetogaph on soho and the high - cadence xuv telescopes on trace .", "StartTimeOffset": 174123018516, "RequestID": "b4df0f12d90ac116afbfe90de59ca05086019b98", "TotalTokens": 3182}

mass stars ( vlmss ) and bds pair less frequently in binary systems than solar - like stars . \n however , these surveys can not resolve the inner @xmath53 to 10au ( depending on distance ) around the objects . \n companions orbiting at such close separations may have originated based on a substantially different companion formation mechanism than the one found so far by direct imaging . \n they can be detected indirectly by spectroscopic doppler surveys . \n precise monitoring of the radial velocities ( rvs ) of bds became possible in the last years with the generation of 810 m class telescopes . \n shortly after the high - resolution echelle spectrograph uves at the vlt saw its first light in october 1999 , two programs were started with this instrument in spring 2000 and 2001 in order to systematically search for close companions to bds and vlmss in the very young chai star - forming region ( joergens & guenther 2001 @xcite ; joergens 2005 @xcite ) and in the field ( guenther & wuchterl 2003 @xcite ) . in this article , we present and discuss the current results of the survey in chai . \n in order to probe bd multiplicity at very young ages an rv survey of bds / vlmss in the chai star - forming region ( @xmath52myr ) was started by joergens & guenther ( 2001 @xcite ) . among a subsample of ten bds / vlmss ( m@xmath60.12m@xmath7 , m5m8 ) \n , nine do not show signs of companions down to masses of giant planets . \n the sampled orbital periods for them are @xmath0 40 day corresponding to separations @xmath00.1au ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n monte - carlo simulations show that the data set provides a fair chance ( @xmath8 10% ) to detect companions even out to 0.4au ( maxted & jeffries 2005 @xcite ) . for the bd candidate chah@xmath18 ( m6.5 ) , \n rv data were recorded with a time base of a few years and they indicate the existence of a spectroscopic companion of planetary or bd mass with an orbital period of at least several months or even years ( fig.[joe : fig2 ] ) . \n thus , among ten bds / vlmss , none shows signs of bd companions with periods less than 40 days and one with a period @xmath8 100 days . \n furthermore , the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.5 ) also exhibit long - term rv variations ( fig.[joe : fig3 ] ) that are attributed to an orbiting companion with at least 19 jupiter masses . \n the rv survey in chai revealed that very young bds / vlmss exhibit no rv noise due to surface activity down to the precision required to detect jupiter mass planets ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n they are , therefore , suitable targets when using the rv technique to search for planets . in the upper panel of fig.[joe : fig1 ] , the distribution of rv differences recorded for very young bds and vlmss ( m@xmath60.12m@xmath7 , m5m8 ) is compared to the rv signal caused by a planet of 1 - 10 m@xmath4 . \n it shows that the rv signal of a giant planet is detectable well above the rv noise level for a bd primary . \n the lower panel of fig.[joe : fig1 ] displays as comparison rv data for t  tauri stars recorded by guenther et al . \n ( 2001 @xcite ) . the rv amplitude of a planet \n is completely swallowed by the large systematic rv errors of up to 7km / s for them making planet detections by the rv technique around very young stars quasi impossible . \n distribution of rv differences for very young bds / vlmss ( upper panel , joergens 2005 @xcite ) and for t  tauri stars ( lower panel , guenther et al \n . 2001 @xcite ) . \n the plot shows that systematic errors caused by activity at very young ages are sufficiently small in the substellar mass regime to allow for detections of giant planets by the rv technique , which is not the case for t  tauri stars . \n rv differences / amplitudes in the plot are peak - to - peak values . inserted ranges of rv planet signals \n were calculated based on circular orbits , a semi major axis of 0.1au and a primary mass of 0.06m@xmath7 for bds , and 1au and 1m@xmath7 for t  tauri stars , resp . ] \n if bds form in the same way as stars , we should observe an equivalent companion mass distribution for both . \n then , the bd desert observed for solar - like stars could exist as a scaled - down equivalent also around bd primaries , this would be a _ giant planet desert _ , as illustrated in fig.[joe : fig4 ] ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n the here presented rv survey started to test its existence for bds in chai . for higher than solar - mass primaries , there are indeed hints that the bd desert might be a scalable phenomenon : while rv surveys of k giants detected a much higher rate of close bd companions compared to solar - like stars ( e.g. hatzes et al . \n 2005 @xcite , mitchell et al . 2005 @xcite ) , with only one exception they all do not lie in the bd desert when scaled up for the higher primary masses \n .     schematic illustration of the bd desert as observed for solar - like stars , and of a scaled version of it for lower primary masses ( bds / vlmss ) , and for higher primary masses ( giants ) . ] \n radial velocity data for the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.5 ) recorded with uves / vlt : significant variability occurring on time scales of months to years hint at a companion at @xmath9au and a mass msin@xmath3 of at least 19 m@xmath4 ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . ]    the study of the multiplicity properties of bds for separations of less than @xmath5310au has been recognized as one of the main observational efforts that are necessary in order to constrain the formation of bds . \n this can be done by means of high - resolution spectroscopic surveys . \n we have presented here the current results of the first rv survey of very young bds ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n it exploits the high resolving power and stability of the uves spectrograph and the large photon collecting area of the vlt . \n a remarkable feature of this survey is that it is sensitive to planetary mass companions . \n this is due to a precise rv determination and to the fact that systematic rv errors caused by activity are sufficiently small for the targets to allow for the detection of jupiter mass planets around them , as shown for the first time by this survey . \n thus , very young bds , at least in chai , are suitable targets for the search for close extrasolar planets in contrast to very young stars . \n none of the bds and vlmss monitored shows signs of bd or planetary companions for separations smaller than 0.1au . \n this hints at a small binary fraction and a low frequency of giant planets in this separation range ( zero of ten ) . within the limited statistics , this result is consistent with the binary frequency found for field bds / vlmss ( 12@xmath107% , guenther & wuchterl 2003 @xcite ) and with the frequency of stellar g dwarf binaries ( 7% , @xcite ) in the same separation range . \n for some of the chai targets also larger separations were probed leading to the detection of two candidates for spectroscopic systems : both the bd candidate chah@xmath18 ( m6.5 ) and the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.5 ) exhibit long - term rv variations that were attributed to orbiting companions with several jupiter masses at minimum . \n orbit solutions have to await follow - up observations , however , the data suggest orbital periods of at least several months , i.e. separations of @xmath8 0.2au and 0.4au , resp . \n direct imaging surveys found a significantly lower frequency of bd binaries with separations @xmath11310au compared to solar - like stars @xcite . \n this might be ( partly ) caused by a shift to smaller separations for lower mass primaries . \n the first surveys that probe the inner few au around bds by spectroscopic means are the one presented here ( joergens & guenther 2001 @xcite , joergens 2005 @xcite , fair detection efficiency for @xmath120.4au @xcite , sensitive to m@xmath13 planets ) , and the following ones by other groups : basri & martn ( 1999 @xcite , detection of first spectroscopic bd binary ) , reid et al . \n ( 2002 @xcite , single epoch spectra , sensitive to double -

{"ContextTokens": 3535, "GeneratedTokens": 136, "SynthesizedBody": "ue to their remarkable agility and robustness , quadcopters have become an exciting area of research and a common sight among aircraft hobbyists , academic researchers and industries . in general \n , they have high thrust to weight ratio which allows them to carry significant payloads or have high lateral accelerations when not carrying a load . \n quadcopters are nowadays being used to study a plethora of concepts ranging from non - linear control[1 ] and learning[2 ] to vision - based pose estimation[3].when quadcopters are used for tasks like mapping , search and rescue , patrol , surveillance and product delivery , they re required to follow a predefined path at a particular height . in general , circular and straight line paths are used . \n path - following algorithms are used to ensure that the quadcopter will follow a predefined path in two or three dimensions at constant height . \n another important consideration is that the path - following algorithms are robust and accurate with regard to turbulences . \n a wide range of path - following algorithms have been proposed [ 4 ] . \n in this paper we use the non - linear guidance logic ( nlgl ) [ 4 ] coupled with model - predictive control [ 5 ] for trajectory tracking for the quadcopter . \n the main objective of this approach includes :    * the trajectories must be feasible under the dynamic and input constraints of the quadrotor * the generated trajectories should bring the vehicle to the target position on the path as quickly as possible , * the trajectory calculation must be fast enough to be used online , and * it must be possible to generate an implicit feedback control law by re - planning the trajectory intercept at each controller update , and applying the control inputs of the first section of it . \n a scheme is presented in [ 6 ] for generating state interception trajectories for quadcopters ; that is , trajectories starting from an arbitrary state and achieving a ( reduced ) end state in a specified amount of time , whilst satisfying input constraints . \n this approach builds on the previous work presented above in that we seek to develop that satisfies various constraints and is also fast enough to allow real - time planning . \n trajectory tracking is done by formulating the trajectory of the quadrocopter in its jerk , in discrete time , and then solving a convex optimization problem on each decoupled axis . \n the nlgl algorithm is now used to track the path effectively . \n the quadrocopter model is presented in section ii , with the trajectory tracking scheme given in section iii . \n section iv discusses simulation results , and an outlook is given in section v. \n the quadcopter is modeled as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom : linear translation along the inertial x1 , x2 and x3 axes , and three degrees of freedom describing the rotation of the frame attached to the body with respect to the inertial frame , which is taken here to be the proper orthogonal matrix r. the control inputs to the system are taken as the total thrust produced f , for simplicity normalized by the vehicle mass and thus having units of acceleration ; and the body rates expressed in the body - fixed frame as  = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . \n these are illustrated in fig \n . 1 . \n figure  [ fig:3d ]    the mixing of these inputs to individual motor thrust commands is done on board the vehicle , using feedback from gyroscopes . \n it is assumed that the time constant of the onboard controllers is low enough to have negligible influence on the algorithm presented here . \n because of their low rotational inertia , quadcopters can achieve extremely high rotational accelerations ( on the order of 200 rads2 [ 7 ] ) about the 1 and 2 axes , while it will be shown that the rotation about 3 is not needed for the trajectories considered here . \n the differential equations governing the flight of the quadcopter are now taken as those of a rigid body [ 8 ]    @xmath0    @xmath1\\ ] ]    with e3 = ( 0,0,1 ) and [ [ wx ] ] the skew symmetric matrix form of the vector cross product such that :    @xmath2 = \\left| \\begin{array}{ccc } - w_3 & -w_2 & 0 \\\\ w_3 & 0 & -w_1 \\\\ -w_2 & w_1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right|\\ ] ]    and g = ( 0 , 0 , g ) the acceleration due to gravity . note the distinction between the vector g and scalar g.      we follow [ 6],[9 ] in considering the trajectories of the quadrocopter in terms of the jerk of the axes , allowing the system to be considered as a triple integrator in each axis and simplifying the trajectory generation task . \n it is assumed that a thrice differentiable trajectory x(t ) is available , where the jerk is written as :    @xmath3    the input thrust f is then found by applying the euclidean norm  to ,    @xmath4      a quadrocopter trajectory described by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is considered to be feasible if the thrust and the magnitude of the body rates lie in some feasible set of values , defined as    @xmath5    note that @xmath6 for fixed - pitch propellers with a fixed direction of rotation , and , specifically , that the requirement on the thrust input is non - convex . \n @xmath7    the following conservative box constraints are applied to yield convex constraints :    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    the resulting trajectories are guaranteed to be feasible with respect to the thrust limit if    @xmath11 \n the three axes are decoupled and hence the optimization problem is solved separately for each axis . \n the trajectory tracking is rewritten as an optimal control problem , with boundary conditions defined by the quadrocopter s initial and ( desired ) final states . the cost function to minimize \n is chosen as    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    a nonlinear guidance law based method described in [ 4 ] is used to determine the destination intercept along the given path . for simplicity , \n assume the uav is following a path , as shown in figure 4 . \n at the current uav position p , draw a circle of radius l. the circle will intercept the path at two points q and ql . depending on the direction in which the uav has to move , either q or @xmath15 . will be selected . \n the advantage of this algorithm is that the same algorithm can be applied to any type of trajectory . \n the stability of the guidance law is shown using lyapunov stability arguments [ ] . \n once the target intercepts are calculated , future position , velocity and acceleration of the quadcopter are predicted using convex optimization and having constraints based on the quadcopter model . the discrete time formulation ( described in the next sub - section ) is used to predict up to 5 values if position , velocity and acceleration . \n the first value of the jerk calculated from the constraints is given as input . \n figure  [ fig : vtp ]      the trajectory generation problem for each decoupled axis is rendered finite dimensional by discretizing the time with uniform steps of size t . \n each axis is then a discrete time linear , time invariant system in the state z , consisting of position , velocity and acceleration , with scalar jerk input @xmath16 , where the axis subscripts have been neglected for convenience . \n @xmath17 = \\dddot x(k\\delta t)\\ ] ]    @xmath18 = [ x(t_1 ) x(t_2 ) . . \n x(t_n ) ] ^t\\ ] ]    @xmath19 = \\begin{bmatrix } \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 & 0 \\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 \\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } \\end{bmatrix } \\times \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\\\ u_4 \\\\ u_5 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    @xmath20 \\times \\ddot x(t_1 ) + \\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\delta t\\\\ 2\\delta t\\\\ 3\\delta t\\\\ \n 4\\delta t\\\\ 5\\delta t\\end{array } \\right ] \\times \\dot x(t_1 ) + \\left[\\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\times x(t_1)\\ ] ]    the optimal control problem is to solve for u[k ] matrix in equation ( 17 ) subject to the above dynamics , satisfying the boundary conditions defined by the initial and final positions @xmath21 , respectively , velocities @xmath22 and accelerations @xmath23 . \n @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    the quadratic cost function ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) with the linear equality constraints ( 17 ) to ( 20 ) define a convex optimization problem.there exist efficient methods for solving problems of this sort , with cvxopt [ 11 ] , forces [ 12 ] and cvxgen [ 13 ] presenting techniques for creating c - code based solvers for specific instances of convex optimization problems . here , solvers are generated using the cvxopt software of [ 11 ] , which was able to generate solvers for large problems . \n cvxopt uses efficient interior point methods tailored to convex optimization problems , as are typical in model predictive control applications , and allows for high - speed implementation with good numerical stability properties .    the generated solvers either return a solution that solves the problem to within some acceptable residuals , or returns that no solution is found . in reality , \n failure to find a solution can mean that :    * a solution exists , but the solver failed to find it due to reaching an internal limit ; * no solution exists to the conservatively constrained decoupled problem ; * no solution exists to the fully coupled nonlinearly constrained problem . \n the proposed algorithm was used to follow particular straight line paths , circles and sinusoidal curves defined by their respective mathematical equations . \n the results of the above have been shown in fig ( 3 ) ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . \n the starting points were taken to be outside the path to follow , but close enough for the circle to find the vtp and start tracking the trajectory . in the plots shown in the figures , the time intervals between every measurement of velocity , \n acceleration and position was taken to be 0.08s . \n the radius of the circle used in these plots is 50 units . \n the output of the proposed algorithm was also compared with the trajectory generation model proposed in [ 7 ] , where the cost function to be minimized calculates the sum of squares of the input jerk . in comparison \n , the proposed algorithm performs as well as the trajectory generation method proposed in [ 6 ] . \n the performance of the trajectory tracking is found by solving trajectories from rest , for step times varying from 0.08s to 2s . \n for each trajectory length , 1000 iterations were executed using python idle which took a mean time of 60ms per iteration . \n these were calculated on a pc running ubuntu 12.04 , with an intel core i3 - 330 m dual core processor ( 2.13 ghz ) with 4 gb ram . \n the solver was linked to an executable using python idle . in each case \n the optimizations were set to maximize speed . \n this paper presents a method for trajectory tracking for quadcopters , from arbitrary initial conditions to a desired end state characterized by a position . the nlgl based destination \n intercept works satisfactorily in tracking subsequent intercepts in the predefined path . \n the constrained trajectory tracking problem is posed as a convex optimization problem for each decoupled axis , which can be solved in real time . \n therefore this technique is suitable for use in feedback as a model predictive controller ; it also naturally handles cases where the desired end state evolves over time , such as when trying to hit an uncertain target or when it has to overcome an obstacle , where the target prediction evolves in real time . \n the convex optimization problem could be easily modified to achieve different goals , e.g. by removing the equality constraint on end velocity and acceleration , and adding the magnitude of the end velocity to the cost function , one solves a problem somewhat similar to that of [ 14 ] . \n this project work was supported by the robotics research centre at international institute of information technology , hyderabad ( iiit -

integrated quantity ) as well as the the observed ionization degree at @xmath3 . we discuss the uncertainties due to the cosmological parameters , the reionization parameters and the observed uv luminosity function . \n finally , we discuss the possibility of more stringent constraints from future progress on the high redshift igm . \n [ fig : tau ] shows the constraints on @xmath2 due to the observed optical depth , @xmath48 , and its uncertainties . starting from our reference case in the top panel , we see that for weak magnetic fields the optical depth is well within the @xmath16 range of wmap7 results . as @xmath2 increases the low - luminosity cut - off of halos contributing ionizing photons is raised and at @xmath49 ng \n , @xmath48 starts to drop . \n it reaches a minimum at several ng and then , as collisional ionization resulting from heating due to ambipolar diffusion kicks in , @xmath48 increases again  ( however , values of several ng for @xmath2 , would be inconsistent with cmb observations , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n this is the qualitative trend in all panels of fig . 1 , 2 and 3 . \n the top panel also shows the effects of @xmath50 variations of the cosmological parameters , on @xmath48 . for the purpose of the current discussion , * higher * values of @xmath51 and smaller values of @xmath52 increase the value of @xmath48 and thus weaken the constrain on @xmath2 . \n thus , the constraint on @xmath2 is set by the highest curve , which says that the required field strength at the 95% cl limit is @xmath21  ng . note also that adopting a cosmology as in @xcite would have minor effects on our results .    in the mid panel \n we consider instead the effect due to uncertainties in the reionization parameters . \n such uncertainties can in principle be very large . \n however , a large clumping factor @xmath53 is inconsistent with the observed ionization fraction ( see fig . \n 2 ) even in the limit of weak magnetic fields . likewise , \n a very large escape fraction @xmath54 produce too high an ionization rate at @xmath55  @xcite . with these considerations , \n a meaningful 95% cl upper limit of 2ng is implied by our results . \n finally , in the bottom panel we consider the uncertainties due to 3@xmath56 observational errors in the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , of the schechter function . here , it is large values of @xmath59 or @xmath31 that increase @xmath48 , and therefore weaken our constraint . \n thus , the highest curve on the plot shows that the computed value of @xmath48 remains within @xmath60 of the wmap7 result for @xmath613ng . \n note that the redshift evolution of the schechter function parameters is also very uncertain , but we have verified that it does not lead to more significant uncertainties on the current constraints . \n we thus arrive at a 95% cl upper limit of @xmath62  ng on @xmath2 . \n [ fig : ion ] shows the constraints due to the observed ionization degree , @xmath63 , and its uncertainties . following the analysis of  @xcite \n , the igm is assumed mostly ionized at @xmath3 . \n note that for the present purposes the accurate value of the ionization degree is not crucial and even a 90% value would lead to very strong constraints independent of the specifically adopted cl . in our reference case ( top panel ) \n , we find at @xmath64 an ionization degree close to 1 for co - moving field strengths up to @xmath65  ng . for increasing field strengths \n , @xmath63 drops rapidly , as the magnetic jeans mass increases with @xmath66 , significantly suppressing the production of ionizing photons . thus considering all the uncertainties due to the cosmological parameters \n leads to @xmath67ng . \n as already discussed for the optical depth , the uncertainties due to the reionization parameters are considerably higher ( mid panel ) . \n however , cases with high clumping factors , low escape fractions or low igm temperatures and even very high escape fraction  @xcite are inconsistent even in the limit of weak magnetic fields . for the remaining cases , the ionization degree drops rapidly for @xmath2 above a ng , and the most conservative upper limit corresponds again to @xmath68 2ng . \n as for the uncertainties in the parameters of the schechter function bottom panel of fig . \n [ fig : ion ] shows that some extreme values can be ruled out because inconsistent with the ionization degree at @xmath64 , even with negligible @xmath2 . \n however , the most important source of uncertainty for the upper limit on @xmath2 are those related to @xmath31 . \n this forces our constraint to @xmath61 3ng . \n this constraint will be improved once the schechter function is observed more accurately . \n again , we checked that the uncertainties in the redshift evolution have no impact on our results.from the observed ionization degree , we thus find an overall constraint @xmath4  ng .    in fig . \n [ fig : redshift ] we show the ionization degree at different redshifts as a function of the co - moving field strength . \n the plot illustrates the sensitivity of our constraint to the redshift at which the ionization degree is measured \n . in particular our constraint would be slightly weaker if based on data at @xmath69 , while it would considerably improve if a high ionization degree at @xmath70 could be observationally established . at even higher redshifts , \n our model predicts the presence of a substantial neutral fraction in the igm which could be translated into a further independent constraint . \n using the combined constraints from the observed thomson optical depth , the ionization degree of the igm at @xmath64 and the observed uv luminosity function at high redshifts , we have derived robust upper limits of @xmath71  ng , virtually independent of the cl , on the strength of primordial magnetic fields . \n previous work  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see also introduction ) found similar limits but generally was based on the thomson optical depth only , used less refined physical models , had a lower cl . \n however , the similarity of conclusion also suggests that we are approaching the intrinsic limitation of the methods . \n our results are mostly based on the lower cutoff of the luminosity function of galaxies contributing ionizing photons , set by the magnetic jeans mass ( eq .  [ jeansb ] ) . on the other hand , \n heating effects due to ambipolar diffusion are important for @xmath2 close to 10 ng , which is ruled out by cmb observations . \n our constraints on the primordial magnetic field would be mostly strengthened by measurements of a high ionization degree at redshift @xmath72 . \n this is simply because the earlier the igm is reionized , the more important becomes the contribution of ionizing photons from halos whose collapse is hindered by primordial magnetic fields . \n however , improvements beyond an order of magnitude are likely out of reach , as the formation of structure at the magnetic jeans mass corresponding to 10@xmath73 g ( see eq .  [ jeansb ] ) is severely affected by other feedback processes  ( see , e.g. , discussion in * ? ? ? \n other limiting factors in the derivation of our constraints are mostly due to uncertainties in the uv luminosity function at high redshift and lack of information about the igm ionization fraction at redshift higher than 7 . \n there is reason to expect good progress in these areas in the near future . \n for example , jwst will provide a unique opportunity to probe the igm at and beyond redshift @xmath74 , lyman @xmath57 emitters may provide additional information on the strength of the photoionizing background ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , while the planck satellite will provide an improved measurement of the thomson optical depth . \n these additional data may help to improve our understanding both with respect to reionization and the origin of magnetic fields . \n we thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments and r. banerjee , b. ciardi , c. federrath , d. galli , r.s . \n klessen and r. salvaterra for stimulating discussions .", "StartTimeOffset": 197979158214, "RequestID": "2140a33905bfd79e41d799b752ca37da7fba1874", "TotalTokens": 3965}

( 1.5 ) in @xcite ) is the better , the more multipole number @xmath3 and the less overtone @xmath7 . for the schwarzshild bh \n the results practically coincide with accurate numerical results of leaver @xcite at @xmath8 when being restricted by lower overtones for which @xmath9 . for fewer multipoles , however , accuracy is worse , and may reaches @xmath10 per cents at @xmath11 , @xmath12 . \n numerical approach @xcite , on contrary , is very accurate , but , dealing with numerical integration or systems of recurrence relations , is very cumbersome , and , often , require modification to be applied to different effective potentials . at the same time wkb approach lets us to obtain qnm s for a full range of parameters giving thereby some fields of work for intuition as to physical behavior of a system . \n even though wkb formula gives the best accuracy at @xmath9 , it includes the case of astrophysical black hole radiation where only lower overtones are significantly excited @xcite . both advantages and deficiencies of the wkb approach motivated us to extend the existent 3th order wkb formula up to the 6th order . \n the perturbation equations of a black hole can be reduced to the schrodinger wave - like equation : @xmath13 where `` the potential '' @xmath14 is constant at the event horizon ( @xmath15 ) and at the infinity ( @xmath16 ) and it rises to maximum at some intermediate @xmath17 . \n consider radiation of a given frequency @xmath18 incident on the black hole from infinity and let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the reflection and transmission amplitudes respectively . \n extend @xmath19 to the complex frequency plane such that @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is regular . \n then , the quasinormal modes correspond to the singularities of @xmath23 . \n we have a direct analogy with the problem of scattering near the pick of the potential barrier in quantum mechanics , where @xmath24 plays a role of energy , and the two turning points divide the space into three regions at which boundaries the corresponding solutions should be matched . \n to extend the 3th order wkb formula of @xcite we used the technique of iyer and will . \n we shall omit here the technicalities of this approach which are described in @xcite . \n the only thing we should stress is that since the coefficients @xmath25 , that connect amplitudes near the horizon with those at infinity , depend only on @xmath26 ( related to the overtone number @xmath7 ) they may be found to higher orders , simply by solving the interior ( between the turning points ) problem to higher orders . thus there is no need to perform an explicit match of the solutions to wkb solutions in the exterior ( outside turning points ) regions to the same order . \n the result has the form : @xmath27 where the correction terms @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be found in the appendix i. note that @xmath28 coincides with preliminary formula ( a3 ) of @xcite in proper designations .    an alternative , pure algebraic approach to finding higher order wkb corrections was proposed by o.zaslavskii @xcite , using a quantum anharmonic oscillator problem where wkb correction terms come from perturbation theory corrections to the potential anharmonicity . \n thus we have obtained an economic and accurate formula for straightforward calculation of qnm frequencies . \n the 6th order formula applied to the @xmath4 schwarzshild bh is as accurate already at @xmath31 as the 3th order formula does at @xmath32 . \n we show it in appendix ii on example of qnm s corresponding to perturbations of fields of different spins : scalar ( @xmath33 ) , neutrino ( @xmath34 ) , electromagnetic ( @xmath35 ) , gravitino ( @xmath36 ) , and gravitational ( @xmath37 ) . in addition , looking at the convergence of all sixth wkb values to some unknown true qn mode , we can judge , approximately , how far from the true qn value we are , staying within the framework of wkb method . \n the metric of the schwarzshild black hole in @xmath0-dimensions has the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 here we used the quantities @xmath40 . \n the scalar perturbation equation of this black hole can be reduced to the schrodinger wave - like equation ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath41 : @xmath42 where `` the potential '' @xmath14 has the form : @xmath43 at some fixed @xmath0 we can put @xmath44 and measure @xmath18 in units @xmath45 . \n the quasinormal modes satisfy the boundary conditions : @xmath46    the 6th wkb order formula used here gives very accurate results for low overtones . \n the previous orders serve us to see the convergence of the wkb values of @xmath24 as a wkb order grows to an accurate numerical result . \n namely we can observe that for @xmath47 for the fundamental overtone the 6th order values differs form its 5th order value by fractions of a percent or less at not very large @xmath0 ( we are restricted here by @xmath48 ) . \n it proves out that if one takes @xmath44 for each given @xmath0 , then the real parts of @xmath18 for different @xmath0 lay on a strict line . \n that is , @xmath49 is proportional to the product @xmath50 ( remember that @xmath6 depends on @xmath0 itself ) . \n namely , for the fundamental overtone we obtain the following approximate relations : @xmath51        here we take @xmath54 . generally , the more the multipole number @xmath3 , the more the coefficient before the product @xmath5 . the same @xmath55 relation we observed for higher overtone but not higher than @xmath3 , for which wkb treatment is applicable . in fig.1,2 we presented the real and imaginary parts of @xmath18 measured in @xmath45 for different @xmath0 . for real parts of @xmath31 modes we see the deviation from the strict line at large @xmath0 . \n this however , is stipulated by a bad accuracy of the wkb approach , and we believe that the true frequencies will lay on strict line again . \n indeed , one can judge about it by looking at the convergence plot fig.3-fig.6 where the real and imaginary parts of @xmath18 are shown as a function of the wkb order . \n generally the accuracy of the wkb formula is the better , the more @xmath3 , and the less @xmath7 and @xmath0 . \n note that the dependence @xmath5 for lower overtones can be recovered even within 3th order formula , provided @xmath3 is greater than @xmath56 , and @xmath0 is not very large . \n ( bottom ) and @xmath59 ( top ) as a function of wkb order of the formula with which it was obtained for @xmath31 , @xmath60 , @xmath4 modes , and the corresponding numerical value . \n we see how the wkb values converge to an accurate numerical value as the wkb order increases . ] \n another point is the @xmath11 modes : in this case the lowest overtone implies @xmath63 , and the wkb formula has considerable relative error . \n for a four - dimensional bh , for which the accurate numerical results are known , the error is about @xmath10 percent for @xmath59 , and @xmath64 percent for @xmath49 in the third wkb order , while in the sixth order it reduces to @xmath65 percent for @xmath49 and @xmath57 percent for @xmath59 ( see appendix ii ) . for greater @xmath0 \n the error increases , the difference between the fifth and sixth order wkb values grows and one can not judge of true quasinormal behavior in this case ( see fig.3 , 4 , 5 . ) . \n fortunately , other field perturbations , including gravitational , have the lowest overtone with @xmath66 and the wkb treatment is of good accuracy for all @xmath3 . in table 1 . \n we compare the third order wkb values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 modes for different @xmath0 @xcite with those obtained through the sixth order here .        99 s.dimopoulos and s.landsberg , phys . \n 87 * 161602 ( 2002 ) v.p.frolov and d.stojkovic , gr -

{"ContextTokens": 2737, "GeneratedTokens": 110, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most puzzling problems nowadays in physics is the issue of the late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite . a possible approach to tackle this problem is within the frame - work of self - accelerating universes @xcite ; i.e. could a modification of gravity at late - time and on large scale be the cause of the current inflationary phase of the universe ? \n in other words , could this modification of gravity on large scales provide an _ effective negative pressure _ that would fuel the late - time acceleration of the universe ?    a possible approach to tackle these questions is the dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) scenario @xcite , which corresponds to a five - dimensional ( 5d ) model . in this model , \n our universe is a brane ; i.e. a 4d hyper - surface , embedded in a flat space - time . \n the dgp model has two types of solutions : the self - accelerating branch and the normal one . \n the self - accelerating brane is asymptotically de sitter . \n this feature takes place without invoking any unknown dark energy component . on the other hand \n , the normal branch requires a dark energy component to accommodate the current observations @xcite . despite the nice features of the self - accelerating dgp branch \n , it suffers from serious theoretical problems like the ghost issue @xcite . in this paper \n we propose a mechanism to self - accelerate the normal branch which is known to be free from the ghost issue @xcite . \n this mechanism will be based on a modified hilbert - einstein action on the brane @xcite and the simplest gravitational option is an @xmath0 term @xcite . \n we consider a brane , described by a 4d hyper - surface ( @xmath1 , metric g ) , embedded in a 5d bulk space -

time acceleration of the universe in an @xmath0 brane - world model . \n this approach will also enable us to look for self - accelerating solutions on the modified normal dgp branch . \n so , in this section , we first obtain the fixed points of the model corresponding to a de sitter space - time and then we study their stability under homogeneous perturbations .      in our model , the hubble parameter for de sitter solutions can be expressed as term we will disregard the matter content in our analysis of de sitter branes . ] \n @xmath25}%\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 , the subscript 0 stands for quantities evaluated at the de sitter space -

self - accelerating solution for @xmath30 . \n when the brane action contains curvature corrections to the hilbert - einstein action given by the brane scalar curvature , the branch with @xmath30 is no longer flat and accelerates ( cf . \n [ ploth ] ) . \n therefore , an @xmath0 term on the brane action induce in a natural way self - acceleration on the normal branch . \n most importantly , it is known that such a branch is free from the ghost problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) . \n the reason behind the self - acceleration of the generalised normal brane is the presence of the effective energy density @xmath31 on the modified friedmann equation on the brane . \n this can be easily shown by comparing the friedmann equation ( [ desitterh1 ] ) with that of modified gravity on brane world -

dimensional effect . \n if we assume that we are close to the 4d regime ; i.e. the hubble rate of the brane is close to its analogous quantity in a 4d @xmath0 model , then @xmath44 and @xmath45 . \n consequently , @xmath42 tends to make the perturbation heavier . \n however , the perturbative effect encoded on @xmath43 would make the perturbation lighter . \n it can be shown that the extra - dimension has a _ benigner _ effect in the 4d f(r ) model ; i.e. @xmath46 , as long as ; i.e. the effective gravitational constant of the brane is positive . on the other hand , we have also assumed that we are slightly perturbing the hilbert - einstein action of the brane , i.e. @xmath47 . \n therefore , @xmath48 is positive because @xmath49 . ] \n we have presented a mechanism to self - accelerate the normal dgp branch which unlike the original self - accelerating dgp branch is known to be free of the ghost problem . the mechanism is based in including curvature modifications on the brane action . for simplicity , we choose those terms to correspond to an @xmath0 contribution , which in addition is known to be the only higher order gravity theories that avoid the so called ostrogradski instability in 4d models .    * acknowledgements *    m.b.l . \n is supported by the portuguese agency fundao para a cincia e tecnologia through the fellowship sfrh / bpd/26542/2006 . \n 99      s.  nojiri and s.  d.  odintsov , econf * c0602061 * , 06 ( 2006 ) [ int . \n j.  geom . \n phys .   * 4 * , 115 ( 2007 ) ] [ arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 2890, "GeneratedTokens": 252, "SynthesizedBody": "since hydrogen is one of the best clean fuels in the future , looking for an ideal storage material has become an important task for experimental and theoretical researchers . among all the candidates , magnesium ( mg ) based materials are widely concerned because they are relatively inexpensive and can hold a high weight percentage of hydrogen @xcite . \n so the interaction between hydrogen and mg has been extensively studied @xcite . \n the main disadvantage that prevents the vast applications of mg for hydrogen storage lies in that the corresponding hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures are large @xcite . \n recently , it is found that the aluminum ( al ) doped mgal thin films have much lower hydrogenation temperatures than pure mg films @xcite . \n however , the specific reason for the improvement as well as the influence of al doping on the electronic properties of mg films , remains unclear . \n so , in order to advance the searches for ideal hydrogen storage materials and applications of hydrogen fuels , it become quite important to make clear the influence of al doping on the electronic structure of mg and the the interaction between hydrogen and mg . \n apart from the potential usages in hydrogen storage , mgal alloys are also important industrial materials used in aerospace applications @xcite . \n it is always believed that the al doping makes mg more resistent to being corrupted by air . \n so lots of efforts have been applied to upgrade the manufacturing techniques to dope al in mg materials , and now the technology has become quite mature . \n studying the interactions between small molecules and al - doped mg surfaces can give us critical information about the mechanisms for al doping to improve the resistance of mg to corruption , and thus are very meaningful and necessary . \n based on this background and the requirements of hydrogen storage materials , we here perform first principles calculations to systematically study the influence of al doping on the electronic properties of the mg(0001 ) surface and the adsorption behavior of hydrogen molecules . \n previous studies have revealed that the mg(0001 ) surface has both considerable @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic states distributing around the fermi energy , because of the @xmath3 hybridizations @xcite . \n here we further find that after doping of an al atom , the electronic structures around the fermi energy mainly distribute around the doping layer . \n for the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the clean mg(0001 ) surface , it has been found that the most energetically favored site is the surface bridge site @xcite , with the corresponding minimum energy barrier of 0.85 ev @xcite . through our present first - principles calculations , we find that al - doping will not change the most energetically favored dissociation channel . \n however , the minimum energy barrier for dissociation of hydrogen is critically dependent on the doping depth of al , and the values are all larger than that on the clean mg(0001 ) surface . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec . \n ii , we describe our fist - principles calculation method and the models used in this paper . in sec . \n iii , we present in detail our calculated results , including the comparisons of the electronic structures of the mg(0001 ) surface before and after al doping , and the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the al - doped mg(0001 ) surface . at \n last , the conclusion is given in sec . \n our calculations are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . \n the pw91 @xcite generalized gradient approximation and the projector - augmented wave potential @xcite are employed to describe the exchange - correlation energy and the electron - ion interaction , respectively . \n the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion is set to 250 ev , which is large enough to make the calculational error of the adsorption energy below 0.01 ev . \n the clean and al - doped mg(0001 ) surface are modeled by a slab composing of five atomic layers and a vacuum region of 20  . \n the @xmath4 supercell in which each monolayer contains four mg atoms are adopted in the study of the h@xmath0 adsorption . \n our test calculations have shown that the @xmath4 supercell is sufficiently large to avoid the interaction between adjacent hydrogen molecules . \n integration over the brillouin zone is done using the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite with @xmath5 grid points . \n a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.1 ev is chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around the fermi energy ( e@xmath6 ) by a finite-@xmath7 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath8 k. during geometry optimizations , the bottom layer of the clean and al - doped mg(0001 ) surface is fixed while other mg and al atoms are free to relax until the forces on them are less than 0.01 ev /  . \n the calculation of the potential energy surface for molecular h@xmath0 is interpolated to 209 points with different bond length ( @xmath9 ) and height ( @xmath10 ) of h@xmath11 at each surface site . the calculated lattice constant of bulk mg ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and the bond length of a free h@xmath11 molecule are 3.21  , 5.15    and 0.75  , respectively , in good agreement with the experimental values of 3.21  , 5.20   @xcite and 0.74   @xcite . \n as shown in fig . 1 , we have employed 3 different doping depths for al in the mg(0001 ) surface , with the al atom respectively in the first ( mgal1 ) , second ( mgal2 ) and third monolayer ( mgal3 ) . \n for the clean mg(0001 ) surface , our calculations reveal that the distances between the three topmost atomic layers are expanded from their bulk values , in accordance with previous theoretical @xcite and experimental reports @xcite . \n it is because that due to its special surface charge redistribution , the topmost three layers of the mg(0001 ) surface are negatively charged and hence repel each other . \n in fact , the surface expansion is a special phenomena for the mg(0001 ) surface , which is not seen for other surfaces of mg @xcite . and instead of expansions , the surface relaxations of many metals show contractions @xcite . the relaxation calculation for the clean mg(0001 ) surface also confirms the precise of our methods . \n however , after the doping of an al atom , the surface relaxation is changed . to describe more clearly the changes , here \n we define the surface relaxation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the distance between the @xmath17th and @xmath18th layer of the relaxed surface , and the lattice spacing along the ( 0001 ) direction of bulk mg . \n table i summarizes the calculated relaxations for the clean mg(0001 ) , mgal1 , mgal2 , and mgal3 surfaces . \n we can easily see from table i that the results critically depend on the doping length of the al atom . \n if the al atom is doped at the first ( i.e. the topmost ) layer , then the distance between the first and second layers is contracted by 3.00 % . and \n if the al atom is doped at the second layer , then @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively decreases by 2.60 % and 2.12 % . \n one can see that for the layer containing the doped al atom , the lattice spacings with its nearest mg layers are decreased a lot from that of bulk mg . \n this result is confirmed by the relaxation results of the mgal3 surface , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are decreased by 2.25 % and 2.12 % . by analyzing the atomic charges , we find that the neighboring mg atoms always lose electrons to the doped al atom . \n so the charging state of the doping layer and its neighboring mg layers are respectively negative and positive , and the interactions between them become attracting forces . thus the surface relaxation changes from expansion of the clean mg(0001 ) surface to the contraction after al doping . \n .surface relaxations ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and work function ( @xmath25 ) of the mg(0001 ) , mgal1 , mgal2 , and mgal3 surfaces . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tableii ]    for the dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules on most metal surfaces , it has been revealed that two different interactions exist , which are respectively the orthogonalizations between molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 and electronic states of metal , and the charge transfer from metal atoms to hydrogen atoms @xcite . as shown in fig . \n 2(b ) , we find that the al - doping did not change the metallic properties of the mg(0001 ) surface . \n so such two different interactions still exist for the dissociation of h@xmath0 on the mgal1 surface .    /mgal1 \n system with the height of h@xmath0 to be 2.00 ( a ) and 0.92    ( b ) . \n mg , al , and h atoms are shown in grey , dark grey , and red balls respectively . \n all the values are in unit of electrons per @xmath26.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figures 6(a ) and ( b ) respectively show the difference electron density for the adsorption system of h@xmath0/mgal1 before ( @xmath27=2.00  ) and after ( @xmath10=0.92  ) the transition state along the bri-@xmath28 channel , namely , @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the electron density of the adsorption system , the h@xmath0 molecule and the mgal1 surface . to calculate @xmath33 , the atomic positions in the last two terms in eq . \n 2 have been kept at those of the first term . through careful wavefunction analysis \n , we find that at the beginning of the adsorption process , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 orthogonalize with electronic states of the mgal1 surface and are thus broadened . \n this orthogonalization is very similar to that has been observed during the interaction of h@xmath0 with the mg(0001 ) @xcite and al(111 ) @xcite surfaces . as shown in fig . \n 6(a ) , there is an electron - depletion region on top of the al atom , which is formed because electrons around the al atom are repelled by the h@xmath0 bonding electrons due to the orthogonalization . in comparison , on the clean mg(0001 ) surface \n , the electrons of mg are repelled from the surface at the beginning of the adsorption of a h@xmath0 molecule . \n we can also see from fig . \n 6(b ) that the h@xmath0 molecule begins to get some electrons from the mg and al atoms , when it gets more closer to the mgal1 surface .    as we have already seen , extra electrons on the mgal1 surface trends to distribute around the al atom . \n thus during the initial stage of the adsorption of a h@xmath0 molecule , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 orthogonalize only with electronic states around the al atom , while on the clean mg surface , the molecular orbitals orthogonalize with electronic states around the two nearest mg atoms . besides , the ability to lose electrons is stronger for a mg atom than an al atom . therefore , the h@xmath0 molecule is more difficult to get electrons from the mgal1 surface . \n and so the dissociation energy barrier is larger on the mgal1 surface . \n in summary , the electronic structures of the al - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces and the dissociation behaviors of h@xmath0 molecules on the doped surfaces are systematically studied , using the first - principles calculations . \n our calculational results show that after al - doping , the surface electronic structure is largely changed . due to the electrons redistribution , the surface relaxation changes from expansion to contraction around the doping layer . for different doping lengths , the work function of the mg(0001 ) surface \n are all enlarged . through careful electronic structure analysis , we further find that the electronic states around the fermi energy mainly distribute around the doping layer for al - doped mg(0001 ) surface . by calculating the potential energy surface of a h@xmath0 molecule on the al - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces , we find that the doping of an al atom does not change the dissociation path with the lowest energy barrier , but enlarges the energy barrier . and \n for the first layer doping , the energy barrier is changed by 0.30 ev . from wavefunction and charge - density analysis \n , we reveal the two interaction stages during the dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule , i.e. the first orthogonalization and later charge - transfer stages . \n we find that because more surface electrons distribute around the al atom , the orthogonalization mainly happens between the h@xmath0 molecule and the surface al atom . \n in addition , since al atom has a weaker ability to lose electrons , the dissociation energy barrier for h@xmath0 is enlarged on the mgal1 surface than on a clean mg(0001 ) surface . \n our studies provide a detailed mechanism for explaining the improvement on the resistance to corrosion for the mg(0001 ) surface by doping of al atoms .", "StartTimeOffset": 239701641600, "RequestID": "86f1b4048851d7d8d3ad43384105bdb7b5db632d", "TotalTokens": 3142}

{"ContextTokens": 3801, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "shortly after the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fractional qhe ) @xcite laughlin @xcite introduced a set of trial wave functions describing the ` parent ' quantum hall states occurring at landau level filling fraction @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an odd integer . \n in addition to the ground state , laughlin introduced trial wave functions describing fractionally charged quasielectron @xmath3 and quasihole @xmath4 excitations . from the very beginning it was clear that the wave function for the quasihole , with its simple jastrow form , was more natural than the wave function for the quasielectron , which contains explicit derivatives with respect to electron coordinates . \n this difference is reflected , for example , in the fact that while there exists a hamiltonian for which the laughlin ground state and quasihole wave functions are exact ( zero energy ) eigenstates@xcite there exists no such simple hamiltonian for which the quasielectron wave function is also an exact eigenstate . \n according to the composite fermion theory , proposed by jain @xcite , the fractional qhe corresponds to an _ integer _ \n qhe of composite fermions \n electrons bound to an even number of statistical flux quanta . \n this identification leads to a procedure for constructing fractional qhe trial states by first constructing integer qhe states , then multiplying by a jastrow factor which binds an even number of vortices to each electron , and finally projecting the resulting state onto the lowest landau level . \n the wave function obtained using this procedure for the parent quantum hall state is identical to laughlin s ground state , and the same is true for the quasihole wave function . \n however , the composite fermion quasielectron wave function is not identical to the one proposed by laughlin .    to date , the best estimate of the energy gap for creating a quasielectron - quasihole pair with infinite separation at @xmath0 computed using laughlin s trial states was obtained by morf and halperin , using the disk@xcite and spherical@xcite geometries , with the result @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic length . \n this may be compared with the result of bonesteel @xcite using the composite fermion quasielectron wave function of @xmath7 . \n it therefore appears that the energy gap computed using the laughlin quasielectron is over % 10 lower than that obtained using the composite fermion theory , and so one might conclude that the laughlin quasielectron wave function provides a ( slightly ) better description of the physical quasielectron state . \n more recently , girlich and hellmund@xcite have shown that for the truncated ( @xmath8 ) pseudopotential interaction introduced by haldane @xcite , the interaction for which the laughlin ground state and quasihole state are exact eigenstates , the laughlin quasielectron has an energy which is 18 % _ higher _ than the composite fermion quasielectron . \n these authors go on to speculate that the same would be true for the coulomb interaction , and this has motivated us to reexamine the calculations of morf and halperin . \n taking advantage of the availability of significantly faster computers , and performing a better extrapolation of finite size results to the thermodynamic limit , we find that the @xmath0 energy gap computed using the laughlin quasielectron extrapolates to @xmath9 , a significantly higher result than previously reported . this result is higher than @xmath10 and so is consistent with girlich and hellmund @xcite , though we find that for the coulomb interaction the difference between the two energy gaps is quite small ( less than 5 % ) indicating that both wave functions provide adequate descriptions of the true quasielectron . \n we have also performed what we believe are the first calculations of the energy gap using laughlin s quasielectron wave functions for filling fractions @xmath11 and 1/7 . comparing these energies to the corresponding composite fermion energies we find the same result \n the composite fermion energy gap is consistently smaller than the corresponding laughlin energy gap . comparing these results to the extrapolated exact diagonalization results of fano et al . \n @xcite we find that the composite fermion energy gaps are also consistently closer to the ` exact ' results . \n however , as for @xmath0 , the differences are slight , and the main conclusion is that both wave functions provide an adequate description of the physical quasielectron .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec . \n ii we review the formulation of the two dimensional electron gas on the haldane sphere and introduce a procedure for projecting wave functions on the sphere into the lowest landau level . in sec . \n iii we review both the composite fermion construction of the quasielectron state , which requires the projection developed in sec . \n ii , as well as the laughlin quasielectron wave function . finally , sec . \n iv contains a summary of our results . \n we begin by reviewing the problem of one spin polarized electron confined to move on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath12 with a magnetic monopole at its center . following convention \n we let @xmath13 denote the number of flux quanta piercing the surface of the sphere due to the monopole . \n the hamiltonian describing this particle is then @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the surface of the sphere . in what follows we work in the wu - yang gauge @xcite for which @xmath17 and use the complex stereographic coordinate @xmath18 . \n the eigenfunctions of @xmath19 in this gauge are the monopole harmonics@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is a jacobi polynomial , @xmath23 , and for a given @xmath24 , @xmath25 . \n if we let @xmath26 then the energies of these states are @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the spherical landau level index . \n it will be necessary in what follows to project general wave functions onto the lowest landau level @xmath29 hilbert space . \n following girvin and jach @xcite we now introduce a general procedure for performing such a projection on the sphere . \n first note that the lowest landau level wave functions in the wu - yang gauge are @xmath30 the hilbert space of lowest landau level wave functions on the sphere then corresponds to wave functions of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a polynomial of degree up to @xmath33 in @xmath34 . \n the differential area element on the surface of the sphere in terms of the stereographic coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 and so the scalar product between any two polynomials @xmath38 and @xmath39 in this hilbert space is @xmath40 with this definition of the scalar product it is straightforward to derive the following identity by repeatedly integrating by parts , exploiting the fact that @xmath41 , @xmath42 this result immediately implies the following spherical generalization of the @xmath43 rule of girvin and jach to the sphere , @xmath44 thus , to project any polynomial @xmath45 into the lowest landau level one simply orders each term so that the @xmath46 s all sit to the left , then replaces these factors by derivatives with respect to @xmath34 according to ( [ identity ] ) . \n the hamiltonian for @xmath47 spin polarized electrons on the sphere interacting via the coulomb repulsion is then @xmath48 the interaction energy @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the chord distance between a given pair of electrons on the sphere . here \n the sphere is assumed to have a uniform compensating charge density with total charge @xmath52 . \n when considering a homogeneous state the appropriate background charge is @xmath53 for which @xmath54    the spherical analog of the laughlin state@xcite at @xmath1 occurs when @xmath55 and in the wu - yang gauge is @xmath56 the quasihole wave function corresponding to a single charge @xmath57 defect at the top of the sphere ( @xmath58 ) is @xmath59 \n according to jain s composite fermion approach @xcite a given fractional qhe wave function at filling fraction @xmath60 where @xmath61 is found by first constructing the corresponding _ integer _ qhe wave function at @xmath62 and then multiplying by a jastrow factor which ties @xmath63 vortices to each electron . \n the state is then explicitly projected into the lowest landau level . denoting the slater determinant corresponding to the effective integer qhe state , with the overall @xmath64 factor \n removed , as @xmath65 , the corresponding fractional qhe states are @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the projection operator onto the lowest landau level . \n for the @xmath68 ground state the vandermonde determinant @xmath69 corresponding to one filled ` pseudo'-landau level of composite fermions , gives for @xmath70 the laughlin wave function ( [ laughlings ] ) for @xmath1 where @xmath71 . if we remove a composite fermion from the lowest ` pseudo'-landau level then @xmath72 and @xmath70 is identical to ( [ laughlinqh ] ) and describes a state in which a single quasihole sits at the top of the sphere . \n we now consider the quasielectron wave function constructed using this approach . \n if we introduce a composite fermion into the first excited ` pseudo'-landau level then @xmath73 and the corresponding physical electron wave function is @xmath74    this wave function can be projected into the lowest landau level as follows . first rewrite @xmath75 by pulling the jastrow factor and the projection operator into the last column of the determinant , @xmath76 this can be done here because the cofactor associated with the @xmath77 element of the @xmath78 column does not contain @xmath79 . \n thus , when we do the projection we need only project each element of the matrix separately . following the procedure outlined in sec . \n iia this projection gives @xmath80 thus @xmath81 can be rewritten , up to an irrelevant normalization constant , to give @xmath82    one can simplify things further by expanding the determinant in a cofactor expansion down the @xmath78 column . \n the cofactors are then all vandermonde determinants and the final expression for the jain quasielectron is @xmath83 in this form @xmath84 can be sampled by usual variational monte carlo techniques with each monte carlo step taking order @xmath47 instructions , rather than @xmath85 for a usual determinant . \n the generalization to the spherical geometry of the quasielectron wave function introduced by laughlin is @xmath86 straightforward monte carlo sampling of @xmath87 is not possible because of the explicit derivatives with respect to the electron coordinates . to compute the energy of this state \n we therefore follow the procedure of morf and halperin@xcite which , for completeness , we review below . \n a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite . \n following @xcite we first take the absolute square of the wave function to obtain @xmath88 the expectation value of any operator @xmath89 depending only on the coordinates @xmath90 is then @xmath91 which , after integrating by parts twice in the numerator and the denominator can be rewritten @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 the chord distance between any two points on the sphere is given by @xmath95 and so for the coulomb interaction the operator @xmath89 is @xmath96 it is then straightforward to compute @xmath97 and evaluate ( [ exp ] ) by usual variational monte carlo techniques . \n the excitation energies of isolated quasielectron and quasihole states have been obtained using the trial wave functions reviewed in secs . \n ii and iii . \n following @xcite we have computed the _ proper _ energies , meaning that the relevant ground state energies are computed with monopole strength @xmath98 and background charge @xmath53 , while the energy of the quasielectron ( quasihole ) excitations are obtained keeping @xmath12 and @xmath47 fixed and decreasing ( increasing ) the monopole strength according to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) . \n in addition , following @xcite and @xcite , we have shifted the background charge when computing the quasielectron ( quasihole ) energies taking @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , in order to compensate the charge density of the _ bulk _ of the wave function . \n this eliminates a finite size correction of @xmath103 , a correction which was not included in @xcite and which may account for the slightly different results obtained here . our results for the proper energies of the quasiholes , the laughlin quasielectrons , and the composite fermion quasielectrons for filling fractions @xmath104 and 1/7 are shown plotted vs. @xmath105 in fig .  1 .    the quasihole energy gaps obtained here , @xmath106 , extrapolated to the @xmath107 limit \n are given in table i , together with the @xmath0 result of morf and halperin @xcite and the extrapolated exact diagonalization results of fano et al . \n as stated above , the discrepancy between our results and those of morf and halperin is most likely due to the @xmath108 finite size correction we have eliminated by modifying the background charge density . \n the quasielectron energy gaps obtained using both the laughlin trial state , @xmath109 , and the composite fermion state , @xmath110 are givin in table ii . \n again , in comparing the present @xmath0 result for @xmath109 with those of @xcite we note a slight discrepancy which we attribute to the @xmath108 finite size correction we have included here . for @xmath111 and 1/7 \n the composite fermion excitation energy @xmath110 is consistently about 10 % lower than the laughlin excitation energy , as can be seen clearly in fig .  1 . \n note that the composite fermion result is also in slightly better agreement with the extrapolated exact diagonalization results of fano et al . \n @xcite . \n finally , table iii gives results for the total energy gap for creating a well separated quasielectron quasihole pair , @xmath112 . \n the results are again compared with those of @xcite for the laughlin energy gap as well as those of @xcite for the composite fermion energy gap . for @xmath0 our extrapolated energy gap using the laughlin quasielectron \n is @xmath113 , roughly 20 % larger than the earlier estimate of morf and halperin @xcite . \n our improved calculation gives a laughlin energy gap which is slightly larger than the corresponding energy gap computed using the composite fermion quasielectron , @xmath114 . \n this is consistent with the results of girlich and hellmund @xcite using the short - range @xmath8 model ; however , we find here that for the coulomb interaction the energy gaps obtained using these two wave functions are essentially the same . \n table iii gives similar results for @xmath11 and 1/7 . \n we therefore conclude that that both the laughlin and composite fermion quasielectron wave functions provide adequate descriptions of the physical quasielectron , though the energy gap obtained using the composite fermion quasielectron is slightly closer to extrapolated exact - diagonalization results for all the filling factors we have considered .    to summarize \n , the quasielectron and quasihole excitation energies in the fractional qhe have been calculated for @xmath104 and 1/7 by variational monte carlo . \n results have been obtained using the quasielectron states originally proposed by laughlin , as well as the fully projected composite fermion quasielectron states proposed by jain . \n we have improved on earlier estimates @xcite of the excitation energies of the laughlin states at @xmath0 in order to show that the composite - fermion energy gap is actually slightly lower than the laughlin energy gap , consistent with the results of girlich and hellmund @xcite . \n results for the energy gap using laughlin s quasielectron for @xmath11 and 1/7 , obtained here for the first time , show that , as for @xmath0 , for coulomb interactions the energy gaps obtained using the laughlin and composite fermion quasielectron wave functions are essentially the same , though those obtained using the composite fermion quasielectrons are slightly smaller , and closer to extrapolated exact - diagonalization results of fano et al .

{"ContextTokens": 3615, "GeneratedTokens": 205, "SynthesizedBody": "the present article describes a photoassociation ( pa ) experiment with ultracold helium atoms in the metastable ( @xmath9 8000 s ) @xmath2 state . since the development of laser cooling techniques which provide sub - millikelvin ultracold atomic samples , the photoassociation of such atoms has been of much interest and provides detailed information on the inter - atomic interaction and collisional properties  @xcite . \n the measurement of the pa spectra allows very precise measurement of the s - wave scattering length  @xcite , a crucial parameter for understanding the collisional properties of the ultracold atoms or molecules and the dynamic behavior of the condensate . \n one of the interesting phenomena in pa is the light induced frequency shift of the pa spectra . as demonstrated in ref . \n @xcite for na and ref . \n @xcite for li , the light shift of the pa spectra is clearly visible at moderate laser intensity for the ultracold samples . \n the observed shifts are described by a theoretical calculation based on the theory developed by bohn and julienne  @xcite or simoni _ et al . _ \n the laser light couples the excited molecular bound state with the continuum of scattering states and the ground molecular bound states , which results in the shift of the pa resonance curve when the laser frequency is swept over the resonance . \n the dependance of the shift on @xmath6 has two origins . \n first , in the limit of large and positive scattering length @xmath6 , the energy of the least bound - state @xmath10 in the ground state potential vanishes , and varies as @xmath11 . at ultracold temperature \n , the atoms collide with a near zero relative kinetic energy @xmath12 , which is therefore very close to @xmath10 . \n when the laser is tuned in the vicinity of the free - bound transition , the excited state is therefore close to resonance with the least - bound state . as a consequence , a shift of the excited state \n is produced , which is dependent on @xmath10 and so on @xmath6 . \n second , the couplings of the excited state with the bound and scattering ground states involve franck - condon overlaps which depend critically on @xmath6 .    in this letter , \n we report the first observation of the light shift of the j=1 ro - vibrational states recently found by our group  @xcite in the purely long - range @xmath3 interaction potential for @xmath0he atoms . \n the v=0 , 1 , 2 levels ( see fig . \n [ fig : potential ] ) can be populated from two ultracold colliding atoms excited by absorption of laser light red - detuned from the @xmath4 transition . from the measurement of the light shifts for several vibrational levels , we deduce an estimation of the value of the s - wave scattering length @xmath6 of the spin polarized @xmath0he@xmath1 atoms in @xmath7 quintet potential . \n this is the first spectroscopic measurement of @xmath6 , which provides a significantly lower value than most previous experimental results  @xcite . \n the spin - polarized ultracold atomic @xmath0he@xmath1 samples are confined in a three - coil magnetic trap of ioffe - pritchard type and cooled down to @xmath13k range by radio - frequency - induced evaporation . \n the bias field is typically 3 g and the density is of the order of @xmath14 atoms/@xmath15 . \n the pa experiment is performed at a temperature of around 4 @xmath13k , just above the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation  @xcite to avoid mean field shifts . \n the pa light is provided by a dbr diode laser with an external cavity operating at 1083 nm and a 1 w yb - doped fiber amplifier . \n the pa pulse is focused with a waist of 640 @xmath13 m on the atomic sample of approximately 30 @xmath13 m diameter ( in radial direction ) and switched on for durations from tens of @xmath13s to a few ms depending on the laser intensity . \n the light propagates parallel to the trap bias magnetic field in @xmath16 polarization to produce selectively the desired bound states from v=0 to v=4 in the purely long - range @xmath17 potential by setting its detuning in the range of -20 mhz to -1.4 ghz  @xcite . in order to allow large detunings \n , we use a heterodyne frequency locking technique : the beat signal between the pa laser and a master laser is monitored by a fast photodiode , mixed down with a local oscillator and converted to dc voltage which is then fed back to the current supply of the pa laser . \n the master laser is locked to the atomic d@xmath18 transition . \n the linewidth of the pa laser is measured to 0.6 mhz . \n our polarization purity is limited to approx . \n 98 % in the electric field because of imperfections in the optical elements .    ) vibrational level of the @xmath3 potential with pa laser intensity of ( a ) 9 mw/@xmath19 and ( b ) 5 w/@xmath19 and pulse duration of 1 ms and 10 @xmath13s respectively . \n the heating of the cloud due to the pa process is plotted as a function of the opposite of the laser detuning @xmath20 from the @xmath21 transition . \n the two sets of data are fitted with lorentzian curves represented in solid lines , and the center frequencies are found to be ( a ) -1435.0 @xmath22 0.6 mhz and ( b ) -1460 @xmath22 1 mhz . \n the resonance peak ( b ) is clearly shifted by a quantity @xmath23 larger than 20 mhz at strong pa laser intensity . ] \n the pa resonance curves are obtained by the calorimetric method described in ref . \n @xcite . even for intensities \n several order of magnitudes higher in the present work , the rise in temperature , the optical density and the atom loss signals ( which are simultaneously registered ) still give the same central position of the resonance line . \n this validates our detection method . \n we deduce the temperature by ballistic expansion . for each pa line \n , the pa laser frequency is scanned over 20 mhz in steps of 0.3 mhz by changing the rf - frequency of an acousto - optic modulator in the pa beam line . \n [ fig : shift - raw](a ) shows a pa resonance line obtained at low pa laser intensity . \n the width is typically 3 mhz . when the pa laser intensity is increased , the line is red shifted and broadened as shown in fig . \n [ fig : shift - raw](b ) . \n we decrease the pulse duration as we raise the laser intensity in order to keep enough atoms trapped after photoassociation , so that the heating by the pa process is still measurable . \n we checked that the resonance position is independent of the pulse duration by varying it by more than an order of magnitude . \n the amplitude of the temperature raise signal is not proportional to the laser energy : when the laser energy focused on the cloud is large , the atom loss is not negligible compared to the initial number of atoms , and the thermalization properties of the cloud are changed . with the temperature and laser intensity we use \n , the broadening of the signal is too large to be explained by ref . \n @xcite where it is related to the transition rate from the coupled scattering states to the excited state . \n however , some decay mechanisms enhanced by light are suggested by the observation of ions when a metastable helium cloud is illuminated by a laser red - detuned from the atomic transition @xcite . \n for each vibrational level , we measure the shifts @xmath23 of the center of the resonance curve for different pa laser intensities i. typical results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : shift - comp ] . \n the error bar is explained as follows . at high intensities , the error bar in @xmath23 increases due to signal broadening and large shot - to - shot noise . \n close to zero intensity , we assign an error of 0.6 mhz to @xmath23 resulting from fluctuations of experimental parameters , which is larger than the error of the lorentzian fit . \n the results displayed in fig . \n [ fig : shift - comp ] show a linear dependance of @xmath24 as a function of i. the maximum measurable light shift is limited by two experimental factors . \n first , the signal broadens with the laser intensity . \n second , to keep the amount of loss of atoms low enough , the pulse duration is decreased when i is increased as mentioned earlier , which is limited by the 5 @xmath13s switching time of the aom . \n these constraints are more severe for v=2 . the main error in the determination of the slopes @xmath25 is due to the systematic uncertainty in the intensity i. this results from the difficulty to measure precisely the beam diameter at the cloud location , the calibration of our laser power meter , a possible slight misalignment of the laser on the cloud and the optical losses on the glass cell walls . \n we estimate that these factors lead to an error of up to 50  % in the absolute value of i. this is why our measurement of the scattering length relies on the ratio of the slopes for two vibrational levels : v=0 and v=1 or v=0 and v=2 , which is not affected by the systematic error in the intensity . \n we also observed that the laser intensity to which we expose the atomic cloud varies from day to day by approximately 10  % , due to small changes of the position of the center of the magnetic trap . \n the slopes of the three levels are therefore measured in a single run without interruption to keep the experimental conditions as similar as possible . \n the precision in the measurement of each ratio is limited by the fitting errors in the slopes @xmath26 which are 2  % for v=0 , 2.5  % for v=1 , and 4.5  % for v=2 ( see fig .  [ \n fig : shift - comp ] ) . \n the ratios of the frequency shifts are measured several times , and we find the results @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . \n the error bars are chosen such that they include all the measurements and their individual error bars , and a statistical analysis shows that they correspond to a three standard deviation error . \n the result for @xmath28 is the most precise because larger shifts produce less error in the linear fit . \n the details of the theoretical analysis which provides the relation between the shifts and the scattering length for different vibrational levels and light polarizations will be given in great detail in a forthcoming paper @xcite . \n we focus here on its main features . \n we consider the light coupling of the molecular bound state in the purely long - range @xmath31 potential to the continuum of scattering states in the @xmath32 waves as well as in several spin states allowed by selection rules . under our experimental conditions ( ultracold atoms in a magnetic trap ) \n , the only significant entrance collisional channel corresponds to two spin - polarized atoms colliding in the s - wave . \n however , the contribution to the light shift of all other possible allowed channels may not be negligible @xcite . \n the fact that @xmath33 channels contribute to the shift suggests a dependance on light polarization . \n in addition , the contributions of the ground molecular bound states is included . \n the least bound state v=14 of the @xmath7 potential gives the most important one , as the other vibrational levels are much further from resonance . \n using ref . \n @xcite , it can be shown that the shift @xmath26 is the sum of partial shifts @xmath34 due to different collisionnal channels @xmath35 . \n only the partial shifts corresponding to s - wave collisionnal channels depend on the scattering length . \n each @xmath34 can be written as a sum over bound and continuum states or as an overlap integral involving the regular and irregular solutions of the scattering equation , and the excited state wavefunction @xcite . \n the former can be used to show that in our case both contributions of the least - bound state and the scattering states in the s - wave collisional channel provide the sensitivity of the shift on @xmath6 . \n the latter is preferred for computational reasons , and proves that the shift is a linear function of @xmath6 , very weakly dependent on the scattering energy @xmath12 and on the magnetic field for the low temperature and values of the field we use . \n we prefer using experimentally the ratio of the shifts between different vibrational levels which is independent on intensity . in our case , \n the fraction of the shift which depends on @xmath6 is appreciably different for the different levels . \n the ratios of the shifts depend therefore in a critical way on @xmath6 . \n several approximations are made in the theoretical analysis . \n first , the isolated level approximation , which takes into account that the resonances associated to the excited molecular states are well separated , is valid as their shifts and broadenings are much smaller than the level spacing . \n second , the different ground state collisional channels can be assumed to be uncoupled in the absence of light , as the spin - dipole interaction , which mixes different spin states , is very weak @xcite . \n third , we neglect dressing effects , which arise from the fact that at infinite separation the colliding atoms still interact with light @xcite . as we solely deal with the deepest bound excited states our laser is tuned far from the atomic resonance . \n although these approximations are made , the errors they induce on the determination of @xmath6 are much smaller than the one due to experimental uncertainty on the ratio measurement . \n we compare the measured ratio of the light shift for @xmath28 with the calculations in ref . \n the fact that the polarization is not pure is taken into account . \n as mentioned above , our theory does not add uncertainty when deducing the scattering length . \n the measured ratio of the light shift for @xmath28 provides a determination of the scattering length of @xmath36  nm as shown in figure  [ fig : ratios](a ) . \n the ratio @xmath30 and the measurements for linear polarization shown in figure  [ fig : ratios](b ) provide less precise but yet compatible values . \n one can infer from the present determination of @xmath6 the absolute values of the slopes of @xmath37 as a function of i for different polarizations ( see ref . \n we find a systematic discrepancy of 40% with the experimental results , which are smaller in absolute value . \n we attribute this to an overestimation of the intensity i.    this new value of @xmath6 can be compared with the previous experimental determinations . in most cases \n the error - bars do not overlap . \n the condensate expansion yields @xmath38  nm  @xcite and @xmath39  nm  @xcite . \n the largest discrepancy is found with the value of the orsay group @xmath40  nm derived from inelastic collision rates combined with the determination of the critical temperature  @xcite . \n however , the measurement of the elastic collision rate based on the evaporative cooling rate gave @xmath41  nm  @xcite , which is in good agreement with our result . \n the small value of @xmath6 could explain why the hydrodynamic regime was not reached in our previous experiment accounting for the collective excitation of collisionally dense thermal clouds  @xcite . \n the comparison with theoretical values obtained from ab  initio calculations is also instructive . using the potential of starck and meyer  @xcite \n a value of @xmath42 nm is found . \n more recently , a value of 8.0 nm @xmath43 12.2 nm has been calculated  @xcite . \n after completion of the present work , we became aware of the result of przybytek and jeziorski  @xcite , which agrees very well with our measurement . \n we measure precisely the light - induced frequency shift of the pa spectra of metastable helium atoms and compared our results with our theoretical calculation . \n the measurements of several ro - vibrational levels at different light polarizations are considered . \n we also provide the first pa spectroscopic measurement of the s - wave scattering length of spin - polarized helium atoms in metastable @xmath2 state . \n the value for @xmath6 presented in this letter is significantly lower as compared to most previous values .    a more precise spectroscopic method to determine the scattering length would be to measure the binding energy of the least bound state ( v=14 ) in the ground state @xmath7 potential with a two - photon scheme . \n this pa experiment is in progress in our group . \n the authors thank olivier dulieu from the cold atoms and molecules group at laboratoire aime cotton in france and paul julienne from national institute of standards and technology in usa , for fruitful discussions .", "StartTimeOffset": 258787681920, "RequestID": "9718828266b4a7e8986967e03e37837b0c0ef2d6", "TotalTokens": 3820}

the two `` layer  modes '' are actually located in the two first layers adjacent to the substrate whereas the `` bulk '' mode is spread throughout the system . \n however , the figure also shows that

over both layers .     for a 4 film for the potential strength @xmath30k . the two layer \n rotons , the bulk roton , and the ripplon are indicated by arrows.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we have carried out two independent calculations of the two  dimensional roton excitation : first , we calculated the roton energy as a function of the density for a rigorously two dimensional liquid \n . we can assess the accuracy of our predictions with the shadow  wave  function calculation of @xmath27 of ref . \n , who obtained a roton energy of @xmath31k at the equilibrium density of @xmath32@xmath6 . \n

0.0421@xmath6 . \n the short  dashed horizontal lines show experimental values of the roton energy on aerogel @xcite ( 7.39 and 7.14  k ) , vycor@xcite ( 7.23 k ) , and geltech@xcite ( 6.71 k ) , their energies are marked on the right margin.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    although exactly the same method has been used for the computation of the purely two - dimensional system and for the films , the results are quite different . \n we have obtained for the film calculation an effective layer density by integrating the three - dimensional densities shown in fig . \n [ fig : profiles ] to the first minimum . \n this is evidently not very well defined for the weakly bound systems , but it is not legitimate either for the case of strong binding where the first layer is well defined . \n in fact , the integrated density for the strongest substrate is 0.08  @xmath6 , which is well beyond the solidification density of the purely two  dimensional system . \n evidently , the zero  point motion in @xmath34 direction can effectively suppress the phase transition . \n we make therefore three conclusions : ( i ) the position of the layer roton minimum is indeed a sensitive measure for the strength of the substrate potential , ( ii ) purely two  dimensional models are manifestly inadequate for their understanding , and , hence , ( iii ) purely two  dimensional models are also questionable for interpreting thermodynamic data of adsorbed films . \n with one exception @xcite , the bulk roton energy in porous media have been reported to be practically identical to that in the bulk liquid , ref . reports a slight increase of the roton energy in aerogel at partial filling . \n a roton energy above the one of the bulk liquid can be explained by assuming that the density of the helium liquid in the medium is below that of the bulk liquid . \n this can , in turn , be qualitatively explained by the cost in energy to form a surface .    to be quantitative , \n we have performed calculations of the energetics and structure of 4 in a gap between attractive silica walls @xcite and obtained the energy of the bulk roton ( c.f . \n [ fig : skwplot ] ) as a function of filling . fig . \n [ fig:3d - roton ] shows , as a typical example , the roton energetics in in a gap of 25    width . \n the independent parameter is the areal density @xmath35 , the corresponding three \n dimensional density was obtained by averaging the density profile over the full volume . \n it is seen that the equilibrium density is well below the bulk value . in other words , \n the roton energy in a confined liquid should correspond to the one of a liquid that would , without confinement , have a negative pressure . \n the energy increase of the roton minimum found in this model is about 0.5 k , which is consistent with the experiments of ref . . \n to verify this interpretation of the data , it would be very useful to have comparable measurements for porous media with a more uniform distribution of pore sizes . \n in particular , comparably small pores should allow to densities that are even below the bulk spinodal density @xcite , thus facilitating experiments on 4 in density areas that were up to now inaccessible .", "StartTimeOffset": 266192295390, "RequestID": "8c78b63a5569b3dd60ce8e1400ce6752d14d472b", "TotalTokens": 2803}

{"ContextTokens": 2372, "GeneratedTokens": 160, "SynthesizedBody": "electrons are bound to the surface of superfluid helium by a weak image potential in addition to potentials from underlying electrostatic gates which control the position of these electrons on helium [ 1 - 4 ] . \n electrons typically float in vacuum about 10 nm above the surface , forming a clean two dimensional electron system ( 2des ) . \n it is a well studied system which has shown the highest mobility of any 2des [ 5 ] , and exhibited the first 2d wigner crystal [ 6 ] . \n electron spins have been studied as possible quantum bits ( qubits ) , since they are natural two level quantum systems , but their coherence is rapidly degraded during transport in semiconductors . unlike other electron spins in heterostructure 2des systems , spins on the surface of helium reside in vacuum and are expected to suffer much less decoherence , especially from spin - orbit interactions [ 7 ] . \n hence , the possibility of mobile qubits in a condensed matter system arises . using existing fabrication technology \n we have shown that manipulating a large number of spins with a small number of gates is possible [ 8 ] . \n devices with electrons confined in channels have been studied previously [ 9 - 13 ] . \n similar to those , a standard complementary metal - oxide - silicon ( cmos ) process at sandia national laboratory was used to fabricate 2@xmath1 m deep , 3@xmath1 m wide channels [ 14 ] . \n the upper metal interconnect layers are used to fabricate the channels and gates . \n the topmost metal layer defines the channel width , and acts as a mask for etching the surrounding dielectric layers ( sio@xmath2 ) down to the underlying gate electrodes , running under 120 parallel channels ( see fig.1 ) . \n electrons are photoemitted onto the sample from a zinc film placed a few millimeters above the device . by keeping the underlying gates positively biased with respect to the zinc film , \n electrons are attracted to the channels [ 15 ] . \n the large gate labeled  right reservoir \" is where the electrons are initially collected . \n electrons collected over the reservoir are blocked from moving above the small gates by keeping the  door \" gate dc - voltage negative ( repulsive ) with respect to the reservoir . \n lowering the door gate potential allows a packet of electrons to moves from the reservoir to the electron detection gates ,  twiddle \" and  sense \" . \n these electrons are detected through their capacitive coupling to the sense gate , which is connected to the gate of a nearby high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) . \n an ac - voltage is applied to the twiddle gate to push the electrons over the sense gate and pull them away . \n the sense gate sees a periodic charge induced voltage , which is buffered by the hemt and detected using a lockin amplifier . \n the small gates in the horizontal channels have a 3@xmath1 m period including a 0.5@xmath1 m gap . \n these underlying gates to the left of detection gates are connected as a 3-phase ccd , with every third gate connected by on - chip vias to its clock rail in a lower metal layer . \n each set of three gates ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ; makes up one pixel for electron control . \n a 2.5 @xmath1 m vertical channel connecting 120 horizontal channels has two extra gate electrodes , vccd@xmath2 and vccd@xmath6 . \n these two gates and @xmath72 from the horizontal channel comprise a 3-phase ccd to bring electrons from one channel to the others . the device is wired and mounted in a cell that is cooled to 1.6k . \n the cell is filled with superfluid helium up to about 1 cm below the device . \n helium fills the channels by capillary action with the depth in the channel being determined by the device structure . \n seven of the 120 parallel horizontal channels are seen , with a schematic cross - section to the right of the image . \n the darker regions of the image are the channels with underlying gates , and the lighter areas are the metal layer between the channels . \n electrons are confined above the helium in the channels by a positive dc bias ( 3v ) on the gates with respect to the top metal plane . \n the 3-phase ccd connection is drawn schematically below the micrographs . \n a cartoon above the channel image is a cut - away along the middle of a channel giving a scale view of the loading and detection gates . \n the horizontal channels are interposed by two memory cells for electron storage and an interconnecting vertical ccd channel . \n all gates used in these experiments run under and control electrons in all 120 channels in parallel . ] \n unprecedented electron transfer efficiency has been demonstrated by clocking a packet of electrons back and forth along the horizontal channels for more than one billion pixels [ 8 ] . \n when loading electrons from the reservoir onto the small gates , we initially clear out the ccd pixels and make sure that electrons in the right reservoir are blocked with the door gate closed ( negative ) . \n electrons are loaded from the reservoir onto the twiddle and sense gates by opening and then closing the door . to achieve a desired pixel occupancy , the potential of the door gate \n is lowered temporarily to bleed off excess electrons back to the reservoir . \n after the initial charge measurement , a packet of electrons is moved into one pixel of the ccds and clocked along the channels using an appropriate voltage sequence , similar to the 3-phase ccd sequence first described by boyle and smith[16 ] . \n the reliability of 2d transport in the channel array has also been tested using a vertical ccd channel . \n a packet of electrons in lower half of the channels ( 60 channels ) are moved in a \n c \" pattern : one pixel left , 60 pixels up , one pixel right , and then the sequence is reversed to return the electron packets to their starting point . \n no measurable failure has been seen after a billion pixel cycles . \n the sense gate runs under all 120 horizontal channels and thus measures the sum of the electrons in all of them . \n the signal calibration in units of electrons per channel assumes perfect uniformity over 120 parallel channels . \n when we see a signal corresponding to 120 electrons , we can not know whether there is one electron per channel or several electrons in some of the channels and none in the others . \n the vertical channel can be utilized in a measurement of the distribution of electrons amongst the horizontal channels . \n there are no reservoirs at the top or bottom of the array ( note that up and down are defined here by the orientation of fig . \n 1 ) . by progressively shifting the electrons up or down , \n electrons are ejected . when the remaining electrons are moved across to the sense gate , the signal is reduced . \n as long as the devices are not overcharged during the initial photoemission , bringing the underlying gates to the potential of the metal top plane serves to kick electrons out of the channels , probably out onto the thin van der waals helium film covering the top metal plane . \n it is likely that these ejected electrons are immobilized by the roughness of the metal in this area , though for the analysis of these data it is sufficient to know , experimentally , that the ejected electrons do not return to the channels . \n figure 2(a ) plots the results of two vertical clocking experiments where electrons are clocked up or down 120 pixels . \n one pixel cycle using @xmath72 , vccd@xmath2 , and vccd@xmath6 brings a packet of electrons up or down one channel . in the experiment , an electron packet in each channel \n is loaded from the reservoir , measured over the detection gates , and then clocked in the horizontal channels to the vertical ccd , over @xmath72 . \n this packet of electrons is clocked 12 pixels up or down and then brought back horizontally to the detection gates for a new measurement . \n this cycle continues until electrons from all 120 horizontal channels have been ejected at the top or bottom of the device . \n the data shows that all the groups of 12 channels , except the topmost 12 , have approximately equal populations . \n the experiments were done after a specific loading ( by photoemission ) of the right reservoir . by repeating such an experiment for many reservoir loading levels , we find that the population of all 120 channels are equalized when the right reservoir has been well - filled by photoemission . \n ( a ) measurement of the electron population of the horizontal channels for a typical initial loading of electrons . the circle ( blue ) and triangle ( red ) data points represent electron signals as the vertical channel is clocked upwards and downwards , respectively . \n the electron signal is normalized to the initial loading ; about 1600 electrons , or approximately 13.5 electrons per channel . \n the dashed black lines show a linear depopulation which would correspond to perfctly uniform channel occupation . \n ( b ) total number of electrons in all the channels after the c - pattern experiment . \n the electron signal is measured after each time the electrons were clocked up 10 pixels . a constant signal through the first 60 pixel cycles and \n then a linear decay confirm a uniform occupancy of the lower 60 channels . ]    after the c - pattern transport efficiency experiment described above , electrons occupying the lower 60 channels were brought to the vertical channel to measure the charge uniformity . \n electrons are clocked 10 pixels up and then brought across to the detection gates . \n the electron signal does not decrease for the first 60 pixel cycle which says that the top 60 channels are unoccupied , as expected ( these channels were emptied by the c - pattern ) . \n the electron signal decreases linearly after 60 pixel cycles , which confirms the uniformity of bottom 60 channels ( see fig . \n manipulating a large number of qubits is necessary for applications in quantum computing . \n the charge - coupled device with electrons on the surface of helium has shown undetectably rare electron transfer failure , allowing electrons to be positioned at any of more than four thousand distinct sites by controlling only five electrostatic gates . \n this interpretation rests on the assumption that all the channels are approximately equally populated . \n non uniformity could affect the interpretation of the clocking result , and it raises the question as to whether we can expect uniform occupancy for qc applications . \n we have shown that channel uniformity is achievable with the electron loading methods we have established , and have verified it using the vertical channel . \n we would like to thank s. shankar and g. sabouret for helpful discussions and j. donnal for the electronics to apply clock voltages to the ccd . \n work at princeton was supported by the nsf under grant nos . \n ccf-0726490 and dmr-1005476 . \n additionally , this work was performed , in part , at the center for integrated nanotechnologies , a u.s . \n department of energy , office of basic energy sciences user facility . \n sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by sandia corporation , a lockheed martin co. , for the united states department of energy under contract no . \n de -

ion physics program : deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration . given the potential physics benefits that can be derived from these measurements , experimentalists at rhic and sps \n have endeavored to extend their abilities to identify hadron types up to higher @xmath0 regions  @xcite . here \n i review those measurements which provide evidence for active quark and gluon degrees - of - freedom and discuss implications of the baryon enhancement on pion and non - photonic electron spectra . \n figure  [ ratios ] ( left panel ) shows the @xmath6 ratio measured in @xmath7  @xcite , p+p  @xcite , and au+au  @xcite collisions . \n the right panel shows the @xmath8 ratio for p+p , mid - peripheral au+au , and central au+au collisions scaled by 0.5  @xcite . in central au+au collisions , @xmath6 reaches a maximum value of nearly 1 at @xmath9  gev / c . \n the baryon junction calculations in ref . \n @xcite predict that the @xmath0 value where the @xmath10 ratio is at its maximum will increase with collision centrality . \n this prediction can be compared to the @xmath11 data . \n measurements are still not precise enough , however , to confirm nor disprove this prediction . \n figure  [ ratios ] demonstrates that the baryon enhancement in au+au collisions is part of a systematic trend . \n baryon production is also enhanced in @xmath12  gev @xmath7 collisions when @xmath13 events are compared to continuum @xmath14 events  @xcite . from those measurements \n the question arose : _ is the enhancement related to multi - parton topological effects or a difference between quark and gluon fragmentation ? _ \n since @xmath15 is a purely gluonic process , the observation that the @xmath6 ratio is even larger in au+au collisions indicates that multi - parton topological effects drive the enhancement ( baryon junctions or coalescence ) . \n @xmath4 is a sensitive measure to distinguish between possible interpretations of the hadron type dependence of particle spectra . \n figure  [ v2 ] shows preliminary measurements of @xmath4 with a minimum bias centrality selection in au+au collisions at @xmath16  gev  @xcite . \n the curves show @xmath4 for pions , kaons , protons and @xmath17s from a hydrodynamic calculation  @xcite . at @xmath18 \n gev / c , the mass ordering suggests that @xmath4 in that region results from collective motion . \n the hydrodynamic calculations capture some of the general features of the data in this region . at \n much higher @xmath0 it is expected that @xmath4 will be developed via energy loss by fast partons as they traverse the medium created in the collisions . \n calculations suggest that @xmath4 from this mechanism should be less than 10%  @xcite . \n it is also expected that all hadrons will have similar @xmath4 values where partonic energy loss is the dominant source of @xmath4 . \n the magnitude and particle - type dependence of @xmath4 seen for @xmath19  gev / c suggests that other mechanisms contribute to the development of @xmath4 up to 67 gev / c . \n this observation is consistent with results from a parton cascade model predicting that the effects of flow may persist up to @xmath20  gev / c  @xcite . at @xmath20 \n gev / c , within errors , the particle - type dependence of @xmath4 disappears and the @xmath4 measurements are consistent with expectations from energy loss models  @xcite . \n hadronization by coalescence or recombination of constituent quarks is thought to explain many features of hadron production in the intermediate @xmath0 region ( @xmath2  gev / c )  @xcite . \n these models find that at intermediate @xmath0 , @xmath4 may follow a quark - number ( @xmath21 ) scaling with @xmath22 for all hadrons falling on one curve . \n this scaling behavior has been observed in au+au collisions at 200 gev  @xcite . \n more sophisticated theoretical considerations have led to predictions of fine structure in quark - number scaling  with predictions for a baryon @xmath23 being smaller than meson @xmath23  @xcite . \n figure  [ nqscaling ] ( top panel ) shows @xmath4 vs @xmath0 for identified particles , where @xmath4 and @xmath0 have been scaled by @xmath21 . \n a polynomial function is fit to the scaled values . \n the deviations from the scaling are shown in the bottom panel by plotting the difference between the scaled baryon @xmath4 and the scaled meson @xmath4 divided by the sum @xmath24 . \n theoretical predictions for this value are also shown . \n the model that compares best to data is a coalescence model that includes the effect of quark momentum distributions inside the hadron ( _ coalescence + wavefunction _ )  @xcite . \n accounting for the substructure of constituent quarks ( _ higher fock states _ ) \n @xcite leads to a negative @xmath24 ratio but with a smaller magnitude than observed in the data . \n the hadron / string model urqmd yields @xmath4 values smaller by a factor of two than experimental data . \n the model does , however , find a scaling with quark number . in this model \n the scaling originates from the additive quark model for hadronic cross - sections . \n it should be noted , when considering comparisons to any models , that the systematic uncertainties on these preliminary measurements have not yet been specified . \n quark - number dependences at intermediate @xmath0 are also manifested in the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 spectra . \n figure  [ rcp ] shows the ratios @xmath25  @xcite ( central au+au over peripheral au+au ) in the left panel and @xmath26  @xcite ( au+au over p+p ) in the right panel where the spectra have been scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath27 ) . for @xmath28  gev / c \n , @xmath25 values are grouped by hadron type ( mesons vs. baryons ) . \n the larger baryon @xmath25 values indicate that baryon production increases more quickly with centrality than meson production . \n this observation is confirmed with good precision for protons and hyperons . \n the @xmath29 is a particularly interesting test particle since it is a meson but is more massive than the proton . with good precision , the @xmath29 \n is now confirmed to follow the systematics of the other mesons . \n measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath25 at @xmath32  gev indicate that baryon production is also enhanced at lower center - of - mass energies  @xcite : with @xmath31 @xmath25 values well above @xmath27 scaling . \n the difference between @xmath31 @xmath25 and @xmath30 @xmath25 is similar at all energies . \n this similarity is surprising since the underlying shape of the spectrum is changing very drastically with @xmath33 , becoming much steeper at higher energies . \n it remains to be seen if any of the current theoretical interpretations of the baryon enhancement can explain this lack of energy dependence in the relative enhancement of baryons . \n if the baryon enhancement also exists for charm hadrons , then the non - photonic electron spectrum may be affected  @xcite . \n the branching ratio for @xmath34  +  _ anything _ \n ( 4.5% @xmath35 1.7% ) is smaller than that for @xmath36  +  _ anything _ ( 17.2% @xmath35 1.9% ) or @xmath37  +  _ anything _ ( 6.87% @xmath35 0.28% )  @xcite . in this case , even if charm quark production is unchanged , increasing the @xmath38 ratio will lead to a reduction in the number of observed non - photonic electrons . in fig . \n [ lc ] ( left ) we show the effect of a @xmath39 enhancement on the charm decay electron spectrum . \n the ratio of two cases is taken : @xmath40 follows the shape of the @xmath8 ratio in au+au collisions , or it follows the shape of the @xmath8 ratio in p+p collisions . \n a suppression of electrons from heavy flavor decays due to the larger charm baryon - to - meson ratio in au+au collisions is visible . \n the suppression in this figure is a result of smaller @xmath41  +  _ anything _ branching ratio . \n the different curves show the experimental uncertainties on the branching ratio  @xcite . \n the figure demonstrates that even if the total charm yield follows @xmath27 scaling , the non - photonic electron spectrum can be suppressed . \n the magnitude of the suppression depends on the @xmath38 ratio and the @xmath42  +  _ anything _ branching ratio . \n the @xmath38 ratio in au+au collisions is unknown but for the charm baryon - to - meson ratio assumed here , the suppression can be as large as 20% . in fig . \n [ lc ] ( right ) we show the case when charm @xmath26 follows light quark @xmath26 and @xmath43 is enhanced . \n the non - photonic electron data are above the resulting non - photonic electron curve . if we scale the input charm @xmath26 up and calculate the @xmath44 , we find the smallest @xmath44 value for charm quark @xmath45 charged hadron @xmath26 . \n it has been proposed that the large @xmath10 values at rhic may be a result of the suppression of pion production coupled with novel baryon production mechanisms scaling with @xmath27 or @xmath46  @xcite . \n the lower energy measurements call this interpretation into question since baryon production is still enhanced even while the suppression of mesons is much weaker . furthermore , it is possible that part of the pion suppression is actually a manifestation of the baryon enhancement . \n most baryons do not decay into pions while many meson resonances do . \n if the relative fraction of baryons is increasing with centrality , then that should lead to an absence of pions from decays . \n much of the difference between kaon and pion @xmath26  @xcite may be caused by this effect : an effect exactly analogous to that described in the previous section on non - photonic electrons . \n pion , kaon , proton , and hyperon momentum - space distributions have been measured up to @xmath47  gev / c . \n several observations indicate that at @xmath48 gev / c , hard processes may dominate particle production . below this \n , measurements of the @xmath10 ratios , @xmath25 , and @xmath4 indicate that processes beyond the reach of perturbative qcd are prevalent . \n the baryon enhancement at intermediate @xmath0 is seen to be generic to many systems and appears to be correlated with higher multiplicity . \n measurements favor pictures involving multi - parton dynamics and point to the presence of active quark and gluon degrees - of - freedom . \n a baryon enhancement in the charm sector is shown to potentially impact the interpretation of non - photonic electron @xmath26 . \n for the scenario presented we find that preliminary non - photonic electron @xmath26 data prefer a charm quark @xmath26 35% larger than light quark @xmath26 . \n we also note that the baryon enhancement may lead to an extra suppression of pions due to the reduction in the number of pions from resonance decays when baryon production becomes preferred . \n i thank the conference organizers and acknowledge valuable input from h.  huang , z. xu , h.  long , j.  nagle , x.  dong , n.  xu , h -

{"ContextTokens": 2567, "GeneratedTokens": 181, "SynthesizedBody": "core - softened @xmath0 potentials have been attracting attention due to their connections with the anomalous behavior of liquid systems including water . these potentials , u(r ) , exhibit a repulsive core with a softening region limited by @xmath1 where @xmath2 with @xmath3  @xcite . \n despite their simplicity , these models originate from the desire of constructing a simple two - body isotropic potential capable of describing the complicated features of systems interacting via anisotropic potentials  @xcite . \n this procedure generates models that are analytically tractable and computationally less expensive than the atomistic models . moreover \n , they are lead to conclusions that are more universal and are related to families of atomistic systems  @xcite . \n one of the features that has been successfully described by many of these models is the density anomaly . for water \n the specific volume at ambient pressure starts to increase when cooled below @xmath4 . \n the anomalous behavior of water was first suggested 300 years ago  @xcite and was confirmed by a number of experiments  @xcite . besides , between @xmath5 mpa and @xmath6 mpa water also exhibits an anomalous increase of compressibility  @xcite and , at atmospheric pressure , an increase of isobaric heat capacity upon cooling  @xcite . for the case of water \n the density anomaly is attributed to the presence of hydrogen bonds between neighbor molecules . \n as the temperature increases the bonds break and the density increases . \n however , other systems such as te , @xcite ga , bi ,  @xcite s ,  @xcite , ge@xmath7te@xmath8 ,  @xcite , silica ,  @xcite silicon  @xcite and bef@xmath9 ,  @xcite show the same density anomaly without presenting hydrogen bonds what suggests that the mechanism for the presence of density anomaly might be more universal . \n in compass with the presence of the density anomaly in water a few years ago it was suggested that there are two liquid phases , a low density liquid ( ldl ) and a high density liquid ( hdl )  @xcite . \n the critical point ending this transition , found only in computer simulations is located at the supercooled region beyond the line of homogeneous nucleation and thus can not be experimentally measured . \n even with this limitation , this hypothesis has been supported by indirect experimental results  @xcite . \n the presence of two liquid phase and of second critical point is also observed in certain @xmath10 potentials  @xcite .    which are the conditions for a cs potential to exhibit density anomaly and two liquid phases ? \n a definitive answer to this question is still missing . \n there are , however , a few clues . \n if a cs potential has discontinuous forces it presents two liquid phases but no density anomaly  @xcite is observed . \n however , once the cs potential is modified to have continuous forces , the anomalies appear  @xcite .    recently it has been proposed that a cs potential exhibits density anomaly if the two length scales identified with the softened region would be accessible  @xcite what can be understood as follows . the radial distribution , @xmath11 of a cs potential has peaks at @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the two length scales of the cs potential  @xcite . if @xmath16 the model is introduced and the simulation details are presented . in sec . \n [ sec : results ] the pressure - temperature phase diagram is presented together with the behavior of the radial distribution function with density and temperature . \n conclusions are presented in sec . \n [ sec : conclusions ] . \n our system consists of @xmath17 identical particles interacting through a continuous pair potential obtained by the addition of @xmath18 different fermi - dirac distributions  @xcite , @xmath19 the resulting expression describes a family of pair interaction potentials discriminated by different choices of the parameters @xmath20 . \n appropriated choices of the parameters allow us to obtain potentials that go from a smooth two length scales potential to a sharp , almost discontinuous , square potential  @xcite .    in the table  [ table : ref ] \n nine different sets of parameters are shown , organized in three families named , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . \n as shown in figure  [ fig : potential ] , for each family a specific characteristic of pair interaction potential is tuned . \n then it is possible to test the effect of changing the two length scales in the pressure temperature phase diagram .    in the potentials \n @xmath21 the slope between the two length scales is varied . \n then it is possible to check if the slope between the two length scales controls the location in the pressure - temperature phase diagram of the density anomalous region as suggested by yan et al . \n @xcite .    in the case of the potentials \n @xmath22 , the attractive length becomes broader . consequently using this potential we test if increasing the range of the attraction leads to a decrease in the critical pressure as proposed by skibinsky et al . \n @xcite .    in the case of the potentials \n @xmath23 , the repulsive length scale becomes broader . \n therefore this family of potentials is appropriated to observe if the enlargement of the repulsive length scale leads to a decrease in the liquid - liquid critical pressure and to an increase in the liquid - liquid critical temperature as suggested by skibinsky et al . \n in addition to verify the assumptions of yan et al . \n @xcite and of skibinsky et al . \n @xcite related to criticality , these three families of potentials are the perfect scenario to check our hypothesis that the density anomaly region in the pressure - temperature phase diagram is delimited by properties of the radial distribution function at the two length scales .            .parameters for potentials @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in reduced units of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the figs . \n [ fig : grcros ] show the value of the radial distribution function at the closest , @xmath12 ( dashed lines ) , and at the furthest scale , @xmath13 ( solid lines ) , as a function of the reduced density , @xmath26 . for the closest scale @xmath12 \n is monotonic with density while the value for the @xmath13 for a fixed temperature increases with the density for densities below the @xmath27 and decreases for densities above this threshold . \n this behavior , also shown in the fig . \n [ fig : gr ] , corroborates the condition stated in the eq . \n [ eq : condition ] and supports the idea that particles move from one scale to the other by compression at @xmath28  @xcite .    besides to the move of particles from the attractive scale to the repulsive scale for @xmath29 as the pressure ( density ) is increased , particles also move from one scale to the other due to the increase of temperature  @xcite for @xmath27 . at constant density , @xmath27 , \n the radial distribution function of the attractive scale , @xmath13 , decreases with the increase of the temperature while @xmath12 increases with the increase of temperature , indicating that particles move from one scale to the other due to thermal effects . at the density @xmath30 , the value of @xmath12 is independent of the temperature . \n potential for different temperatures for different pressures.,width=302 ]    what is the meaning of the density @xmath31 in which @xmath32 is independent of temperature ? as it was pointed in the previous paragraph , for @xmath27 particles move from the furthest scale , @xmath33 , to the closest scale , @xmath14 , using thermal energy as the temperature is increased . in this case \n @xmath12 increases with temperature . for @xmath29 particles \n move from @xmath33 to @xmath14 , using the increase of pressure pressure ( or density ) as illustrated by the eq . \n [ eq : condition ] . from statistical point of view , the two mechanisms governing the behavior for @xmath29 and @xmath27 are quite different . \n while increasing temperature affects particles individually , increasing the density or the pressure affects the particles as clusters or networks . \n then , as the potential becomes more soft , the threshold density @xmath30 beyond which the particles move form one scale to the other by compression should decrease as observed in fig . \n [ fig : grcros ] . \n therefore @xmath30 is the threshold between these two mechanisms present in systems that have density anomaly . \n in addition to these low density limit , the density anomalous systems also have a high density threshold , @xmath34 . \n [ fig : grcros ] illustrates as a solid thick line the temperatures and densities , @xmath34 , in which @xmath35 . \n since @xmath11 is related with the number of particles at distance @xmath36 , for @xmath37 more particles are in the attractive scale , @xmath33 , while for @xmath38 more particles are at the repulsive scale @xmath14 . \n therefore , the thick solid line is a boundary between the high density liquid and the low density liquid . \n analysis of the stability indicates that no real phase transition is observed across this line .    in order to understand what what happens in the region of the pressure - temperature phase diagram of the @xmath34 , the behavior of the specific heat in this region was analyzed . \n [ fig : cp ] shows the curves of isobaric specific heat , for different pressures as a function of the temperature for the potential @xmath39 . \n the peak of @xmath40 for each one of the potentials analyzed in this manuscript coincide with the region @xmath34 where @xmath35 . \n this result indicates that the structure in the tmd region already build the liquid arrangements required for the liquid - liquid phase separation . \n in this paper we have studied three families of core - softened potentials that exhibit two length scales , one repulsive , @xmath14 , and another attractive , @xmath33 . \n we had observed that the region in the pressure - temperature phase diagram occupied by the tmd is quite sensitive to the slope between the two length scales . as the slope increases the region decreases . \n we also found that the region in the pressure - temperature phase diagram where the density , diffusion and structural anomalous behavior is observed shifts to lower pressures and shrinks the attractive scales or the repulsive scales become wider . \n our results suggests the competition between two length scales are the relevant mechanism for the existence of the tmd .    in an attempt to confirm this assertion we showed in this family of potentials that the condition @xmath41 seems to be associated with the presence of anomalous behavior . \n in addition we also observed that the peaks of the radial distribution function at each length scales exhibit very distinct behavior with density and temperature suggesting two complementary mechanisms for the competition between the two scales .    at low densities , \n @xmath27 particles move from @xmath33 to @xmath14 with the increase of temperature , using thermal energy . for densities above \n @xmath30 the increase of @xmath12 is associated with the increase in the pressure ( density ) . in this interval of densities at a certain density and temperature the radial distribution function at the first length scale equals the value at the second scale , namely @xmath35 . \n this point can be identified with the widom line . \n the relation between the radial distribution function and the widom line , believed to be the onset of the liquid - liquid phase transition give the support to the idea that the widom line separates two structural distinct regions that are also separated by a fragile - strong transition  @xcite . \n we expect that his result will not only shade some light in the definition of what is the shape an effective core - softened would have in order to held anomalies but also would serve to reinforce the ideas of linking dynamic transitions and thermodynamic properties . \n we thank for financial support the brazilian science agencies cnpq and capes . this work is partially supported by cnpq , inct - fcx .", "StartTimeOffset": 298308333936, "RequestID": "17cc41d4b7c5825f9ea28afe5e9a6f1f06dfe0d7", "TotalTokens": 2748}

a price - equally - weighted index is an arithmetic average and a value - weighted index is an value weighted average of current stock prices . \n the former such as djia assumes that every stock has the same influencing power , while the latter such as s&p500 assumes that each stocks have the power proportional to their market capitalization . \n kospi200 is a value - weighted index of 200 representative stocks in kse , that is appropriate for the purpose of this study . \n table [ table - top10 ] shows the market capitalization of some largest companies listed on the s&p500 and kospi200 . \n this quantity reflects the financial scale of a given company and the fraction of total market capitalization in a stock market . \n ( @xmath3 ) denotes stock symbol . \n the main distinction between two markets is the influence of several top companies . \n the portion of top 10 kospi200 companies is 49.13% where that of s&p500 is 22.82% . \n it means that kospi200 index is more sensitive to the influence of a few top companies . \n table [ table - investor ] shows shareholding composition of kse by investor group . we can notice that foreign investors possess the bulk of stocks of large companies and a large part of market liquidity is supplied by them . \n thus , the foreign investors trading activities are crucial to the kse . \n so naturally the korean stock market is highly correlated with the foreign stock markets such as the us market . \n we construct a network of kospi 200 companies ; each node ( company ) has a different number of links ( connections ) and weights ( correlations ) . \n we use the cross - correlations in stock price changes between kospi200 companies from jan/2001 to jun/2004 . \n the dataset is daily closure prices in terms of korean won ( krw ) , the korean local currency . in 1997 , the asian financial crisis made the exchange rate to fluctuate violently . \n however , during the period analyzed the korean fx market does nt have an experience of external impact or violent fluctuation . \n let @xmath4 be the stock price of company @xmath5 . \n then , the log - return of the stock price is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 t is time interval . in this paper \n , we analyzed daily data ; @xmath7t=1day . \n the cross - correlations between stock i and j can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 means a time average over the period . \n these correlation coefficients form a correlation matrix @xmath10 . \n this matrix is a symmetric n@xmath11n matrix . if stock i and j are completely correlated ( anti - correlated ) , @xmath12 . \n the case of @xmath13 means they are uncorrelated . \n each node of the network corresponds to a company , which is fully connected to every another nodes . \n each link has a weight @xmath14 , simply as the same value with the cross - correlation coefficient ; @xmath15 . \n the influence strength ( is ) is a physical quantity to measure how strongly a node influences other nodes . \n this quantity is defined as the sum of the weights of all links incident upon a given node @xmath5 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the links connected to the node @xmath5 . \n since the weight is distributed in the range [ -1,1 ] , the is can be negative . \n here we just need to determine the influencing structure , and the sign of @xmath18 is not important \n . thus we only deal with the absolute magnitude of the is denoted by @xmath19 . \n in fig . [ kospipowerlaw ] , we plot the is distribution @xmath20 of kospi200 . \n et al_.@xcite found the is distribution of s&p500 follows a power law distribution , @xmath21 where the exponent @xmath22 is estimated to be @xmath23 . \n it is known that as the degree exponent is smaller in sf networks , the connectivity of a node with a large degree becomes higher , and hence the network tends to be more centralized to a few nodes . in other words , \n several powerful companies make a dominant effect to the whole market . \n it is also noticeable that the is component of the s&p500 is smaller than the degree exponent values for sf networks in the real world such as the internet and the world - wide web@xcite .    by table \n [ table - top10 ] , the largest company from the viewpoint of a market capitalization in the s&p500 is general electric ( ge ) ; its fraction is 3.39% . in the case of the kospi200 , \n samsung electronics corporations ( sec ) occupies this position ; its fraction is 21.94% . \n so we can consider the kospi200 s hub to be more powerful , and the kse network is more centralized to this company than the s&p500 . \n however , fig . \n [ kospipowerlaw ] shows that the kospi200 s is distribution does not follow a power law distribution , but an exponential distribution . \n the korean stock market is less centralized than the s&p500 or other scale - free networks in the real world . \n we construct the asset tree through the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) to find the difference between the s&p500 and kospi200 . \n ge acts as the hub of the s&p500 s mst@xcite . \n however , we can not find any comparable hub in the whole market of the kospi200 contrary to the dominant position of sec in kse . \n sec node is located far away from the center ( fig . \n [ isdist ] ) . \n this means the fraction of sec s market capitalization is large , and as such the kospi index moves with sec while most companies stocks do not follow this trend . \n neither sec nor the others in table [ table - top10 ] is located at the center of kospi s mst . \n the weak influence of sec shows weak correlations with other stocks . \n hence , we can not find such scale - free behaviors in the korean market as the american market . \n one possible explanation of this difference is the market maturity . \n the american stock market is a mature market . \n there are numerous powerful companies such as ge , microsoft and citigroup . \n these companies have similar market capitalization and influence power on the market . in the korean stock market , an emerging market \n , there is a great gap between the sec and the others - even though , 9 companies of table [ table - top10 ] - with a viewpoint of the market capitalization .    for the application of portfolio optimization \n , the identification of groups of stocks in common dynamics is necessary to diversify the risks . at first \n , we introduce some terminology . \n the term _ branch _ is defined as a subset of a tree , to all nodes that share a specified common parent and _ cluster _ as a subset of a branch . \n there are two kinds of clusters . \n complete _ cluster and the other is _ incomplete_. a complete cluster contains all the companies of the studied set belonging to the corresponding branch , so that none are left outside the cluster . \n et al_.@xcite found that clusters of s&p500 with business sector or industry categories are mostly incomplete , but come very close to being complete clusters , only missing one or two companies of the cluster . \n we consider this situation as a complete cluster from the viewpoint of practical portfolio optimization . \n however , the clusters of kospi200 do not coincide with business sectors or industry categories . \n in addition , they made the portfolio using the central node ( ge ) , but the kospi200 has no single central hub , and thus this method can not be applied to the korean situation . \n we attempted to identify groups of kospi200 with other rules than business sectors or industry category . \n most major korean companies are members of conglomerate forms of enterprise , commonly known as _ \n chaebeol_. for example , samsung electronics co. is a member of samsung conglomerate . \n this conglomerate is comprised of many companies over different sectors , i.e. , samsung electronics co. , samsung life insurance , samsung heavy industries co. , samsung petrochemical co. , samsung corporation , and so on . \n their ownerships are controlled by complex shareholding structures . so their stocks can be considered a group . \n however , we can not find any group structure related with korean major conglomerates - samsung , lg , sk , hyundai , and so on . \n we also consider the influence of foreign investors on the trading patterns of domestic investors . \n foreign investors are generally believed to employ superior techniques and information and their strategies are considered as benchmarks by domestic counter parties in the korean stock market . \n so we apply the msci index to make groups of korean stocks . \n morgan stanley capital international inc . \n ( msci ) is one of the leading providers of equity indices and offers the most widely used international equity benchmarks by international investors . \n msci equity indices are designed to fulfill the investment needs of a wide variety of global institutional market participants . \n these include many categories of indices , i.e. sector , industry group and industry indices , global , regional and country equity indices , and so on . \n we focus on the msci korea index - one of the msci country equity indices .    fig . \n [ mst ] supports the validity of msci index grouping . \n we can identify two types of clusters by mainly composed of stocks included in msci index or not . \n while all of them are incomplete clusters , they can be considered as complete clusters in practice . \n it seems that msci index grouping is the most acceptable method for the korean market . in fig [ mst ] , \n the weight of link @xmath24 is the second lowest and that of @xmath25 is the fifth lowest one . \n so we can divide the whole market into three clusters separated by these two links , and each cluster forms a sub - market . \n another noticeable feature of this mst is the absence of a global hub . \n the node in the center of cluster seems to be a hub , but it is just a local hub for isolated sub - market . \n we can also see that highly capitalized stock like sec is far from a hub even for a sub - market @xmath26 . \n bonanno _ _ et al.__@xcite constructed the mst using market models ; random market model and one - factor model . \n random market model assumes that the return distribution is uncorrelated gaussian and one - factor model assumes that the return is controlled by a single factor like index . \n the degree distribution for the mst of mature market follows a power law distribution , and the degree distribution of the one - factor model is decayed rapidly and contains an asset with a very high value of the degree . \n [ kospipowerlaw ] shows that the degree distribution of the kospi200 follows neither a power law distribution nor a distribution of the one - factor model . \n it seems close to a distribution of the random market model . \n we have studied the korean stock market and obtained some characteristics that differ from the characteristics of the us market . \n the pertinent question is , why does the korean stock market have different properties ? \n one possible reason is the composition of firms . \n the history of mature markets is longer than that of emerging markets . \n thus , the mature markets have many companies including several large firms . in the case of the korean market \n , there are only a few large firms , e.g. sec ; these corporations are very large in comparison with others . as such , \n these large firms are separated from other companies of the market . \n this accounts for why there are no hubs in the korean stock market . \n we do nt know yet whether this is the characteristics of an emerging market or only korean characteristics . \n the other is the trading culture and globalization . \n foreigners trading patterns are much important in the korean market . \n globalization has progressed very rapidly and influence of a few developed countries has become more and more powerful . at present , many stock markets synchronization to the us market is observed . in other words , \n the whole markets in the world are synchronized . \n we may thus find clusters in terms of the msci index . \n if a specified company s stock is included in the msci index , it is more synchronized to a foreign market and regarded as a good company s stock to the korean market . \n all markets throughout the world have characteristics of their own . \n we need to study each market with its own properties . \n the 1997 asian financial crisis was a very important event to the korean market . \n after the crisis , the market s response to the external market is more sensitive@xcite . the correlation coefficient of the korean market is smaller than that of the american market and \n sometimes shows unusual distribution . \n the correlation and the mst have more information about the market than this paper s analysis , i.e. average length , positive correlation and negative correlation . \n the investigation about the points mentioned with the knowledge on the history of the korean market is our future work .                                                : \n rectangle ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , @xmath26 : circle ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 : triangle ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 : diamond ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) . @xmath37 and @xmath31 are the clusters of the stocks which are not listed on the msci index , @xmath26 is the cluster of the stock listed on the msci index . \n @xmath34 is shuffled area , so can not be a meaningful cluster . \n , scaledwidth=100.0% ]", "StartTimeOffset": 319334826582, "RequestID": "1ebaa38e5730e39ff66df52be54f35f373c87778", "TotalTokens": 3798}
{"ContextTokens": 3926, "GeneratedTokens": 339, "SynthesizedBody": "s1040 ( catalogued by @xcite ; = fagerholm 143 ) is a yellow giant with = 0.86 , and an astrometric and radial velocity member of the open cluster m67 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in their radial velocity study of m67 , \n mathieu et al .   discovered that s1040 was a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a circular orbit and a period of 42.8 days . in the m67 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , s1040 occupies a `` red straggler '' position , 0.2 mag blueward of the giant branch . \n janes and smith ( 1984 ) suggested that this anomalous location of s1040 in the cmd could be explained if s1040 were a photometric binary consisting of a star on the lower giant branch and a star near the main - sequence turnoff . \n however , mathieu et al .  ( 1990 ) found no evidence of a secondary correlation peak in their high signal - to - noise spectra of s1040 , indicating that the secondary must be considerably fainter than the primary . \n they also pointed out that the mass function was consistent with a secondary mass as low as 0.18 m@xmath3 . \n to explain the circularization of the orbit , verbunt and phinney ( 1995 ) suggested that the secondary of s1040 was a white dwarf , and that the white dwarf progenitor must have filled its roche lobe . \n an important clue to the nature of the s1040 secondary was provided by a 1620   image of m67 obtained in 1995 march with the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( @xcite ) . \n a total of 16 stars in m67 were detected at 1620  , including the 11 hottest blue stragglers , four white dwarf candidates , and s1040 ( @xcite ) . \n the detection of s1040 at 1620   almost certainly implies that the secondary is a hot white dwarf , since a more luminous type of ultraviolet source would be inconsistent with the composite red b  v color . \n since a white dwarf secondary makes a negligible contribution to the integrated v magnitude , the peculiar location of s1040 in the m67 cmd is likely the result of an earlier mass - transfer episode . to further elucidate the nature of s1040 \n , we have now obtained observations of s1040 with the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope_.    the spectroscopic determination of the fundamental parameters of a post - mass - transfer binary is often problematic , because both components have deviated from single star evolution . \n thus the membership of s1040 in the well - studied solar - metallicity open cluster m67 is particularly fortunate , and we adopt in this _ letter _ the cluster distance ( 820 pc ) , age ( 4 gyr ) , and reddening ( e(b  v ) = 0.025 ) given by carraro et al . \n s1040 was observed on 18 may 1996 with the g140l mode of the ghrs , covering the wavelength region from 1175   to 1450  , and with the g270h mode of the fos , covering the region from 2220   to 3300  . \n the observation date corresponds to phase 0.54 in the mathieu et al . \n ( 1990 ) orbit . \n the exposure time of the ghrs observation was 6582s , and the use of the large ( @xmath5 ) aperture gave a spectral resolution of about 0.8  . \n the exposure time of the fos observation was 300s , and the use of the large ( @xmath6 ) aperture gave a spectral resolution of about 2.0  . \n spectra from both instruments were reduced using the software prepared by the ghrs instrument team ( @xcite ) . \n the ghrs spectrum was further corrected for a @xmath7% sensitivity degradation below 1200   ( @xcite ) . \n the ghrs spectrum of s1040 ( figure 1 ) shows a broad  absorption that confirms the identification of the s1040 secondary as a hot white dwarf . \n s1040 is among the faintest white dwarfs ever observed in the ultraviolet , and so despite the deep ghrs exposure , the s / n per resolution element is only about 18 . \n the strong emission in the core of  is due to the earth s geocorona , and the strength and spectral profile of the emission feature near 1304    is also consistent with being entirely due to diffuse gecoronal emission . \n interstellar lines of @xmath81260 , @xmath81335 , @xmath81302 , and @xmath81304 are clearly present , while other possible absorption features at @xmath81180 , @xmath81329 , and @xmath81371 are of uncertain origin . \n the s / n and spectral resolution of the ghrs spectrum is insufficient to determine whether narrow photospheric lines exist in the white dwarf spectrum , such as would be needed for an eventual determination of a double - lined spectroscopic orbit . \n we fit the ghrs spectrum using the pure - hydrogen white dwarf model atmospheres of bergeron et al . \n a low - dispersion ultraviolet spectrum is not sufficient by itself to constrain both t@xmath0  and @xmath1  in a hot white dwarf , because a good fit is possible at any value of @xmath1(@xcite ) . \n however , for an assumed value of @xmath1 , the best - fit value of t@xmath0  and the angular diameter derived from the flux scaling can be used along with a ( t@xmath0-dependent ) theoretical mass - radius relation to derive the white dwarf distance . \n table 1 shows the computed distances to s1040 for a range of assumed @xmath1  values , using the mass - radius relation of wood ( 1995 ) for carbon white dwarfs with thick hydrogen and helium layers . even for the lowest mass ( 0.2 m@xmath3 ) carbon model available , the computed distance is less than the cluster distance of 820 pc . \n qualitatively , the origin of this low mass determination is that a relatively cool t@xmath0  is required to fit the broad  absorption profile , so that a large radius ( low mass ) is needed to reproduce the absolute ultraviolet flux level . \n in fact , the use of a carbon composition to compute a mass - radius relation is not realistic for a such a low - mass white dwarf , because the ignition of helium requires a core mass of at least 0.49 m@xmath3 near the tip of the red giant branch ( c.f . \n @xcite ) . at high ( @xmath4 50,000 k ) temperatures , \n a helium white dwarf is known to have a significantly larger radius than a carbon white dwarf of the same mass ( @xcite ) , and some modifications in the mass - radius relation might still be expected at the relevant t@xmath0   ( @xmath416,000 k ) for s1040 . \n therefore , we have recomputed the derived distances in table 1 , using new evolutionary calculations of the helium - rich core of a giant star whose envelope has been stripped ( see @xcite for more details ) . \n the m67 distance of 820 pc can then be matched using a model with t@xmath0  = 16,160 k , @xmath1  = 6.7 , and a mass of @xmath9 m@xmath3 . \n the evolutionary time for the white dwarf to reach this t@xmath0  is about 75 myr after ejection of the envelope on the giant branch . \n note that , whereas the evolutionary track of a typical 0.6 m@xmath3  white dwarf crosses into the hottest ( @xmath10 k ) region of the hr diagram , the maximum t@xmath0  along the 0.22 m@xmath3  evolutionary track is only about 17,500 k.    the fos spectrum of s1040 is shown in figure 2 , along with the model white dwarf spectrum derived from the fit of the ghrs spectrum . \n the white dwarf still dominates the spectrum at 2200  , but provides only about 1% of the total flux at 3300  . \n also shown in figure 2 is a best - fit kurucz ( 1993 ) model with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 , t@xmath0  = 5150 k and @xmath1  = 3.5 , normalized to the reddening - corrected v magnitude of s1040 . \n the scaling required to fit the kurucz model yields a radius of the yellow giant of 5.1 r@xmath3 . \n a radius about five times larger than this value would be needed for s1040 to show an eclipse of the white dwarf , assuming the mathieu et al . \n mass function , and masses of 1.5 m@xmath3  and 0.22 m@xmath3for the primary and secondary . \n figure 2 also shows that the @xmath82800 doublet is observed in emission , with an reddening - corrected integrated flux of @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 . \n this corresponds to a surface flux of @xmath14 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 , using the angular diameter derived above . \n this  surface flux is an order of magnitude larger than the typical values reported for seven m67 giants by dupree , hartman , & smith ( 1990 ) , and near the upper envelope of the surface flux values observed in field g giants . \n the high chromospheric activity level indicated by this  surface flux value , supports the classification of s1040 as an rs cvn binary , as originally suggested on the basis of its x - ray luminosity by belloni et al . \n ( 1993 ) . \n table 2 summarizes the parameters of s1040 , as derived in this work and taken from the literature . \n the relatively long orbital period of s1040 , and the low mass derived here for the white dwarf secondary , place strong constraints on the possible evolutionary history of s1040 . \n an episode of mass transfer must have occured before the white dwarf progenitor developed a core mass which is larger than the mass of the current white dwarf . \n but if the mass transfer episode began while the donor still had a radiative envelope , then a common envelope would likely occur , leading to a shrinkage of the orbit , in contradiction to the observed 42.8d period . \n in fact , population synthesis calculations ( @xcite ) indicate it should not be rare for mass - transfer during the subgiant or lower giant branch of the primary ( early case b evolution ) to lead to systems similar to s1040 . for such systems , \n a relation between the final orbital period and the mass of the helium white dwarf can be derived by combining the core mass  radius relation for a red giant with the requirement that the red giant always fill its roche lobe during the mass - transfer phase ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n the rappaport et al . \n relation predicts a white dwarf mass of @xmath15 m@xmath3for the s1040 orbital period , while a similar formula of eggleton ( personal communication ) predicts a white dwarf mass of 0.25 m@xmath3 . \n these predicted masses are sufficiently close to the white dwarf mass of 0.224 m@xmath3  derived here , to lend confidence in our ability to outline the evolutionary history of s1040 . \n the basic scenario is that two stars in a relatively close orbit begin an epoch of mass transfer when the more massive star fills its roche lobe . \n if the initial orbital period is on the order of days , the donor star will have a helium core mass near or slightly larger than @xmath16 when mass transfer begins . until sometime after the masses equalize \n , the mass transfer rate will be fairly high , governed by the the donor s attempts to re - establish thermal equilibrium as it expands , while its roche lobe either shrinks or remains close to a fixed volume . \n after mass equalization , continued mass transfer tends to expand the roche lobe , even as the donor itself expands , leading to an epoch of stable mass transfer . \n the mass transfer rate during this latter epoch is governed by the donor s nuclear evolution time scale , which can be longer than it would have been had the donor mass remained constant . \n mass transfer ends when the donor s envelope is depleted , leaving the white dwarf remnant we observe .    for concreteness \n , we have constructed a binary evolution model which yields a system with the approximate parameters derived here for s1040 . \n the final white dwarf mass ( 0.25 m@xmath3 ) and age ( 5.0 gyr ) in the model are slightly larger than values reported here for s1040 , but probably within the observational errors . \n the model ingredients are described by di stefano & nelson ( 1996 ) and di stefano ( 1997 ) , and we note here only that the mass retention factor , @xmath17 , is taken to be proportional to the ratio of the donor s thermal time scale to that of the accretor . \n the initial model masses are 1.24 and 0.82 m@xmath3 , and the initial orbital period is 1.86d . \n for such a system , roche lobe overflow occurs after about 4.1 gyr , when the more massive star has developed a core mass of 0.159 m@xmath3 . \n after 95 myr , the component masses have equalized at about 0.98 m@xmath3(with about 0.1 m@xmath3  lost from the system ) , although the orbital period ( 1.97d ) , and the donor core mass ( 0.163 m@xmath3 ) , have increased only slightly . \n stable mass transfer continues for another 765 myr until the envelope of the donor is depleted , leaving a system with an orbital period of 42.1 d , consisting of a 0.25 m@xmath3  helium white dwarf and a 1.48 m@xmath3   blue straggler . \n in fact , the star is observed as a blue straggler ( i.e.  the accretor mass exceeds the cluster turnoff mass ) during the final @xmath18 myr of mass transfer . \n as noted earlier , comparison with the 0.22 m@xmath3evolutionary track indicates that mass transfer in s1040 ended about 75 myr ago . \n thus , within the past 75 myr the blue straggler in s1040 must have evolved redward to its current location , 0.2 mag blueward of the giant branch in the m67 cmd . \n qualitatively , an evolved blue straggler is expected to lie to the blue of the cluster giant branch , but a more detailed calculation than presented in this _ \n letter _ will be needed to follow the temperature and luminosity evolution of the accretor .    are there other systems similar to s1040 ? \n case b mass transfer is the most likely explanation for the origin of the current m67 blue straggler f190 , which has a 4.2d period , although it may not be possible to explain the other m67 blue stragglers as the end products of mass transfer ( @xcite ) . among the field stars , many of the parameters of ay cet (= hr 373 , k0 iv + wd , p = 56.8d ) are similar to those of s1040 , including the mass function and the estimated white dwarf temperature ( @xcite ) . \n simon et al . \n point out that the white dwarf mass in ay cet could be as low as 0.25 m@xmath3 , provided that its distance is near the the upper limit of that derived from the ( large ) uncertainty in its parallax . \n the hot component in the eclipsing binary hd 185510 ( k0 iii / iv , p = 20.7d ) is known to have a low ( 0.3 m@xmath3 ) mass , but whether its atmospheric parameters are consistent with those of a degenerate helium white dwarf is still uncertain ( @xcite ) . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through grant number go-06680.01.94a from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under nasa contract nas5 -

{"ContextTokens": 1932, "GeneratedTokens": 153, "SynthesizedBody": "modern and demanding application of radial velocities , like those associated with the search for extra - solar planets , have promoted the introduction of new methods of wavelength calibration . \n the key to success has been recording of the reference wavelength grid for to the whole duration of the science exposure and through the same optical train and path . \n two approaches have been followed : the _ parallel _ ( where thorium lines going through telescope optics are recoded on the ccd close and parallel to the science spectrum with an exposure lasting as long as the science observation ) , and the _ iodine - cell _ one ( the stellar spectrum passes through and is absorbed by a cell filled with iodine vapors , that mark the stellar spectrum with a huge number of sharp and equally intense absorption lines ) . \n both approaches require delicate instrumentation , careful maintenance and dedicated spectrographs . \n as such they are not easily manageable on small , all - purpose telescopes . \n we propose here a third , independent way to mark with reference wavelengths the science spectrum as it is recorded , through exactly the same optical train and path . \n it consists of using optical fibers with recorded in them bragg gratings that allows undisturbed passage of all wavelengths except a selection of few ones that will appear in the spectrum as sharp , deep absorption lines of constant and pre - selected wavelengths . \n the latter are then used as a reference grid to accurately wavelength calibrate the science spectrum . \n the system is easy and fast , allows to decouple the spectrograph from the telescope and operate it in a controlled environment , requires minimal mechanical work to be adapted to existing spectrographs , the marking absorption lines can be placed at any preferred wavelength , and the fibers can be mass - produced at low cost for distribution to interested observatories . \n fbgs can be easily installed on spectrographs already designed to operate in multiple fiber mode . \n the rave project ( steinmetz 2003 ) , with its fixed wavelength range , would represent an ideal case for the application of fbgs . \n the fbgs ( fiber bragg grating ) appear of potential interest also to gaia . \n the latter s spectrograph operates in tdi , slit - less mode with thousands of spectra simultaneously crossing the field of view as the satellite spins . \n no conventional calibration lamp can be used , obviously . \n the base - lined wavelength calibration procedure foresees using stars of recognized constant radial velocity as they travel across the spectrograph focal plane , by accurately linking their astrometric position on the sky to the wavelength of their absorption lines on the pixels of the ccds .    a bundle of fbgs properly introduced in the gaia spectrograph optical train would mark with a set of properly placed reference absorption lines the spectra of all stars entering the field of view . \n the fbgs could become the prime wavelength calibration mean of gaia spectra ( particularly for preliminary solutions while the mission is still flying ) , or a backup for the method based on standard radial velocity stars in case this would not satisfactorily operate for whatever reason once the satellite will reach l@xmath0 . \n the fbgs dissipate no power and have no movable parts . \n they should also stand the low operating temperatures of the satellite in l@xmath0 and should do not degrade with time , and thus looking ideal for use in space . \n no fbg has ever been used as proposed in this paper , and thus confirmatory tests are required . at the astronomical observatory of padova \n we plan to manufacture and test prototype fibers for the gaia / rave wavelength range to check their performance with actual observations at the telescope . \n fiber gratings are made by laterally exposing the core of the fiber to a periodic pattern of intense ultraviolet light . \n the exposure produces a permanent increase in the refractive index of the fiber s core , creating a fixed index modulation according to the exposure pattern : this fixed pattern is called a grating . at each periodic change of refraction , a small amount of light is reflected ( bragg diffraction ) . \n all the reflected light signals combine coherently to one large reflection at a particular wavelength when the grating period is approximately half the input light wavelength . \n this is referred as the bragg condition and the wavelength at which this reflection occurs is called the bragg wavelength ( @xmath1 ) . \n light at wavelengths different from @xmath1 , which are not phase matched , will pass unabsorbed through the fiber . thus , light propagates through the grating with negligible attenuation and only those wavelengths that satisfy the bragg condition are affected and strongly back - reflected . \n application of this technology to astronomical spectra at gaia wavelengths is attractive for two basic reasons : ( @xmath2 ) the technology is already mature with the tele - communication industry that operate it in the near - ir , down to 1  @xmath3 m , and ( @xmath4 ) the limited @xmath5 range observed by gaia and rave requires only a limited number of reference lines to be properly calibrated ( see discussion in desidera and munari 2003 ) , which in turn means an easier fbgs production . \n exposing a photosensitive fiber , usually germanium - doped ( yuen , 1982 ) , to an intensity pattern of ultraviolet radiation ( at wavelengths between 240 and 255 nm , where the germanium has an absorption band ) is used to produce ( i.e. write ) a fiber bragg grating . in its basic form \n the grating selectively reflects light at the bragg wavelength @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the grating spacing and @xmath8 is the effective index of refraction . \n both @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on fabrication parameters : @xmath8 depend on the modal dispersion characteristics of the fiber and lies , for each mode , between the core and cladding indices . \n the functional form of the normalized frequency ( @xmath9 ) parameter is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diameter of the fiber core , @xmath12 is the free space wavelength , @xmath13 the core index and @xmath14 the clad index . \n note that the difference between the two squared index is also the numerical aperture of the fiber . for low enough @xmath9 values \n the fiber is single mode and only one bragg reflection is observed at @xmath15 wavelength given above . at a certain value of @xmath9 the fiber become two moded with two separated bragg wavelengths , and for larger @xmath9 values many more modes begin to appear in the fiber grating spectrum . \n the lowest order or fundamental mode has the longest @xmath1 , and the higher order modes have progressively shorter @xmath1 with the cladding index giving the limit on the shortest @xmath1 . \n the peak reflectivity is an increasing function of the grating length and of the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( lam & garside , 1981 ) .    recording fbgs inside a fiber usually involves interference between two coherent uv laser beams that precisely define the spacing between the grating planes . for symmetric incidence and an angle @xmath16 between the uv beams , \n the pitch of the recorded grating is 0.5@xmath17 , where @xmath12 is the illumination wavelength . \n the basic interferometric setup splits the laser beam to create an interference pattern on the fiber ( morey et al . \n , 1989 ) as shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) . \n because the beams travel different paths , the laser must have sufficient temporal coherence to account for path - length mismatch , and good spatial coherence . \n the sensitivity to mechanical instabilities of this method of fbg production can make difficult to produce identical replicas . \n the other way for writing fbgs is to use phase mask to generate multiple beams ( hill et al . , 1993 ) . \n two of the beams carry approximately 40% of the total energy and closely overlap the phase mask surface to create an interference pattern at the desired bragg wavelength . \n the fiber - phase mask assembly can be illuminated either by a large beam to cover the full fiber bragg grating length or by a small scanning beam . because the fiber is usually in proximity to the phase mask , the assembly is a very stable mechanical system , suitable for mass - production of identical fbg replicas . \n the pattern recorded into the fiber is a copy of the phase mask ( pitch and chirp ) scaled by about 50% . \n desidera , s. , munari , u. , 2003 , this volume , pag . \n xxx hill k. , malo b. , bilodeau f. , johnson d. 1993 , appl.phys.lett . \n 62 ( 10 ) , 1035 lam d.k.w . , \n garside 1981 , appl . \n optics , 20 ( 3 ) , 440 morey w.w . , meltz g. , glenn w.h . \n 1989 , proc . \n spie , 1169 , 98 steinmetz m. , 2003 , this volume , pag . \n xxx ( and http://www.aip.de./rave/ ) yuen m.j . \n 1982 , appl . \n optics , 21 ( 1 ) , 136", "StartTimeOffset": 357416843352, "RequestID": "04d0170ce8cebb2d4309841cbea470ec844c0d70", "TotalTokens": 2085}

\n we investigated this in the context of three models for the origin of the x - ray radiation :    1 . \n * submm ic : * nir flare = synchrotron , x - ray flare = submm photons inverse compton scattered by nir - emitting electrons ( we assume the submm photons come from the known radio - submm source ) . \n * ssc ( synchrotron self compton ) : * nir flare = synchrotron , x - ray flare = nir photons inverse compton scattered by nir - emitting electrons 3 .   * cooling break synchrotron : * nir flare = synchrotron , x - ray flare = synchrotron , with a cooling break between nir and x - ray wavelengths . \n we found it useful to approach this problem in a different way to previous investigations . \n rather than using analytical power - law models for which , in order to apply the model , we must first assume the nir and x - ray spectral indices are equal ( an assumption which is not favoured by the data ) , we instead look at the problem from the point of view of where the peaks in the synchrotron and scattered spectra occur . \n we can make use of three well - known aspects of synchrotron radiation :    * the synchrotron spectrum of a single electron with energy @xmath9 peaks ( in @xmath6 ) at the critical frequency @xmath10 . * \n an electron of energy @xmath9 inverse compton scatters a photon of frequency @xmath11 up in frequency to @xmath12 . * \n the ratio of the inverse compton luminosity to the synchrotron luminosity from a population of relativistic electrons follows @xmath13 .    as an extension of the first two points , \n populations of electrons with a characteristic energy @xmath14 ( a turnover in the underlying electron distribution , or a cutoff ) , corresponding to a synchrotron peak at @xmath15 , will scatter a seed photon spectrum peaking at @xmath11 to a frequency @xmath16 . \n we can use these three properties together to make constraints on the physical parameters in the flaring region for the two inverse compton scenarios @xcite . \n both scenarios are problematic : we find that in the submm ic case , the characteristic electron energy is constrained to be @xmath17 , the magnetic field @xmath18 g and the size of the seed photon region @xmath19 , which is incompatible with the observed size of the submm ic region ( fwhm size @xmath20 * ? ? ? \n * ) . in the ssc case , we find @xmath21 , @xmath22 g and a size of @xmath23 , which leads to an electron density @xmath24@xmath25 . \n these values for the electron density and the magnetic field are two - three orders of magnitude higher than the electron densities and magnetic fields in the inner accretion flow @xcite . \n the `` cooling break synchrotron '' model allows parameters more natural to the inner accretion flow . in this scenario \n the x - ray flare is also synchrotron radiation and there is a break in the synchrotron spectrum between ir and x - ray wavelengths due to the onset of dominant synchrotron cooling which causes a change in spectral index of @xmath26 . for the kinds of magnetic fields expected in the inner regions of the accretion flow of @xmath27 to @xmath28 g @xcite , x - ray emitting electrons \n cool fast on the dynamical timescale while nir - emitting electrons cool slowly , so a cooling break between these wavelengths is very natural . since both nir and x - ray are optically thin synchrotron , we can not obtain a constraint on the size of the flaring region as we did for the inverse compton scenarios , except by requiring the _ absence _ of an inverse compton contribution to the x - ray luminosity ( for reasonable parameters the inverse compton spectra are blue in the x - ray range , and if they contributed the x - ray spectral index would not be red as observed ) . in a companion paper , \n @xcite have shown the ic / ssc components do not contribute for reasonable sizes and electron densities . \n we have also carried out detailed numerical calculations which confirm the above constraints on the physical conditions in the region where the flare occurs @xcite . \n the constraints we have outlined are of course not valid if the true spectral index of the nir is @xmath29 rather than @xmath8 . \n however , models where the synchrotron peak occurs at frequencies @xmath30 are not within the 90% parameter confidence region when fitting our numerical models to the nir and x - ray data ( we fit the models and derived confidence regions using the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec ) . furthermore , blue indices ( @xmath8 ) for intermediate to bright emission from sgr a * are favoured not just by our observational constraint on the mir - nir spectral index , but by evidence from other observations as well @xcite . \n there is much still to learn from the spectacular multiwavelength observation of april 4 , 2007 . \n the simultaneous lightcurves show intriguing differences : the l-band lightcurve is broader ( has longer duration ) than the x - ray lightcurve , and it also has pronounced substructures while the x - ray lightcurve is comparatively smooth . \n these properties are not straightforward to understand in the context of any emission model . in the ssc scenario \n a shorter duration x - ray flare can arise naturally without changes in the magnetic field , due to the quadratic dependence of the ssc luminosity on the synchrotron luminosity , but there is no obvious solution to the substructure problem . for the cooling break synchrotron and the submm ic models fluctuations in magnetic field \n together with a general decrease in magnetic field during the flare could explain the substructure and duration problems , since in both cases the nir emission is dependent on the magnetic field while the x - ray emission is not . \n taking the spectral properties also into account , so far the cooling break synchrotron model appears to be the most promising model to explain the april 4 , 2007 flare . \n time dependent modeling of the lightcurves will give us further insights into the flare mechanism and the dynamics of their production . \n baganoff , f. k. et al . \n 2001 , nature , 413 , 45 dodds - eden , k. , et al . \n 2009 , , 698 , 676 doeleman , s.  s. , et al . \n 2008 , , 455 , 78 eckart , a. , et al . \n 2004 , , 427 , 1 eckart , a. et al . \n 2006 , , 455 , 1 eckart , a. , et al . \n 2009 , , 500 , 935 genzel , r. et al . \n 2003 , nature , 425 , 934 gillessen , s. , et al . \n 2006 , , 640 , l163 hornstein et al . \n 2007 , , 667 , 900 marrone , d. p. et al . \n 2008 , , 682 , 373 porquet , d. et al . \n 2003 , , 407 , l17 porquet , d. et al . \n 2008 , , 488 , 549 trap et al . \n 2010 , adv . \n space res . \n , 45 , 507 yusef - zadeh , f. , et al . \n 2006 , , 650 , 189 yusef - zadeh , f. et al . \n 2008 , , 682 , 361 yusef - zadeh , f. , et al . \n 2009 , , 706 , 348 yuan , f. , quataert , e. , & narayan , r.  2003 , , 598 , 301", "StartTimeOffset": 374574815970, "RequestID": "ee2c30d9b35c7989a0e4a2cbdbe39f829405fe8a", "TotalTokens": 2417}
{"ContextTokens": 3306, "GeneratedTokens": 226, "SynthesizedBody": "ecc is an approach to public - key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields . \n the use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by neal koblitz@xcite and victor s. miller@xcite in 1985 . \n elliptic curve cryptography , in essence , entails using the group of points on an elliptic curve as the underlying number system for public key cryptography . \n the primary reason for using elliptic curves as a basis for public key crypto - systems is that elliptic curve based crypto - systems appear to provide better security than traditional crypto - systems for a given key size@xcite , thereby reducing the process overhead . \n one can take advantage of this fact to increase security , or ( more often ) to increase performance by reducing the key size while keeping the same security . \n designers are now working on designing dedicated hardware accelerator blocks along with the main processor @xcite@xcite@xcite to increase the throughput of the design . \n ecc algorithm is used for secured communication in smart cards@xcite and also in gsm security@xcite . \n so , high speed , resource constrained environment is required . using a dual - core instead of a dedicated co \n - processor enables the user to operate from the application layer without entering the subordinate layers . also , the thread - level parallelism , used by the dual - core ensures higher throughput without increasing the much power , which is an important issue for low - power communication devices like smart cards . \n implementations can be made in different platforms namely , fpga or asic or can be done using micro - controllers . \n fpgas provides reconfigurability and lesser design time , while asic provides better throughput though the design time is large and expensive . \n we propose the design and implementation of elliptic curve cryptography ( ecc ) encryption algorithm by developing suitable single core and dual core design on xilinx virtex 4 ( ml403 ) device . \n the system is optimized in terms of execution speed . \n we perform a trade - off between throughput , power and resource requirements for our dual core implementation . to the best of our knowledge , \n dual - soft core processor based implementation of ecc in an fpga is not yet available in related literatures and hence it is first of its kind . \n the paper is organized as follows : section 2 details the overview of ecc , the encryption and decryption process . \n the design and implementation details for single and dual - core processor architectures are described in section 3 . \n the experimental results are summarized in section 4 . \n conclusion and references are briefed in section 5 . \n this section provides some background on elliptic curves and ecc and then the hardness of decrypting the elliptic curve ciphers is also discussed . \n the idea of a multi processor system , establishment of communication between the processors using shared memory and the needed data synchronization is also briefed in the later part of this section . \n elliptic curves are described by curves , which are similar to cubic equations , used for calculating the circumference of an ellipse . in general , cubic equations for elliptic curves \n take the following form known as weierstrass equation@xcite : @xmath0 where _ a _ , _ b_,_c _ , _ d _ , _ e _ \n , _ p _ are real numbers and _ x _ and _ y _ take on any values in the real numbers . for our purpose , it is sufficient to limit ourselves to equation of the form given in equation[eqn : reduced weierstrass equation ] for appropriate curve parameters of ecc . \n @xmath1 figure [ fig : elliptic curve(a ) ] shows an example of elliptic curve . \n ecc can be used to encrypt a plain text message _ \n m _ into cipher text for secured communication . \n firstly , the plain text message _ \n m _ is converted into a set of finite points p@xmath2(_x _ , _ y _ ) , which lie in the elliptic curve e@xmath3(_a _ , _ b _ ) . \n a generator point , _ g _ \n e@xmath3(_a _ , _ b _ ) , is chosen next such that the smallest value of _ n _ for which _ ng _ = _ o _ is a very large prime number . \n the elliptic curve e@xmath3(_a _ , _ b _ ) and the generator point _ \n g _ are then made public . \n let there be two parties a and b who wish to communicate using ecc . \n each user selects a private key , user a s private key is n@xmath5 , while n@xmath6 is the private key for user b such that n@xmath5 , n@xmath6 < _ _ \n n__. then they compute their public keys . \n the public key of a is p@xmath5 = n@xmath5_g _ , while for b the public key is p@xmath6 = n@xmath6_g_. to send the secret message to b , a encrypts the message point p@xmath2 by choosing a random number _ \n k _ and computes the cipher text points c@xmath2 using b s public key . the cipher text is given by : @xmath7   \\label{ciphertext}\\ ] ] on receiving the cipher text ( pair of points ) _ c@xmath2 _ , b multiplies the first pair of points ( _ kg _ ) with his private key _ \n n@xmath6 _ , and then adds the result to the second point of the cipher text ( _ p@xmath2 + kp@xmath6 _ ) \n i.e. , @xmath8 = \\;\\;(p_{m } + kn_{b}g ) - [ n_{b}(kg ) ] = \\;\\;p_{m } \\label{palintext}\\ ] ] plain text message point p@xmath2 , corresponds to the message _ m_. \n it is to be observed here that only b can remove n@xmath6(_kg _ ) from the second part of the cipher text . \n no , third party or intruder can know the message except b. thus , ecc is very secured and can be relied for confidential communication . \n + breaking of ecc is a `` hard problem '' , which requires computing of discreet logarithm @xcite . \n a multi processor system consists of two or more processors working concurrently and capable of communicating with each other . \n such a design tends to double the throughput , with two processors running independently , but with an extra cost of resource and power . on the other hand , \n a multi core system is one in which more than one processor is build on the same die . \n in fpga we have on - chip soft processor cores , which has been utilized in our design to multi core design . \n there are some basic conditions required for the execution of a design in a multi core system . \n the primary being concurrency in the design i.e. , no data dependency must be present in processes that run in different processors and also the two processors must have some handshaking for synchronization of data . \n multi core processors often use a shared memory system or a mailbox system as a interprocessor communication mechanism , that operates very quickly@xcite .      in a multi core environment , mailbox and shared memory @xcite are the two mechanisms , provided by xilinx . \n out of these two mechanisms , shared memory is the most common and most intuitive way of passing information between processing subsystems and we have used it in our design .    a shared memory system has the following properties@xcite : + any processor can refer any location in the shared memory directly by some system call . \n + location of data in memory is transparent to the programmer . \n data could be distributed across multiple processors , with the help of some proper api , data can be handled at program level . \n + a synchronization is a must for accessing the shared memory segment by some hardware / software protocol between the two processors . \n + shared memory is typically the fastest asynchronous mode of communication , especially when the information to be shared is large . \n shared memory gives another approach of `` in - place '' message processing schemes . \n shared memory can be built out of on - chip local memory like bram or on external memory like ddr sdram . \n the region in which the shared data is stored is known as a critical region in operating system terminology . unless there is some sort of well - defined non - conflicting way in which each processor accesses the shared data , the multi core system can not work properly . a synchronization protocol or construct \n is usually required to serialize accesses to the shared resource . \n the xps mutex synchronization primitive is used in this work , which is provided by xilinx as a separate ip - core@xcite . when using shared memory as a method of data communication , the pseudo code should look like this to ensure proper synchronization , + _ / \n * shared tasks * / _ + _ xmutex_lock ( ) ; _ + _ / * critical region - perform shared memory access * / _ + _ xmutex_unlock ( ) ; _ + by calling the _ xmutex_lock ( ) _ it must be ensured that one processor is accessing the critical region and other processor should not be allowed to access the same until _ xmutex_lock ( ) _ is called by that processor . \n this section highlights the key components of our proposed design . at first \n , we describe the processor that is used and then we brief the design innovations made to enhance the throughput . \n the microblaze embedded processor soft core is a 32-bit reduced instruction set computer ( risc ) optimized for implementation in fpgas@xcite . as a soft - core processor , microblaze \n is implemented entirely in the general - purpose memory and logic fabric of xilinx fpgas . the embedded development kit ( edk ) \n platform from xilinx has been used to build a complete processor system on fpga .      in a single processor architecture , \n the fpga receives the input via the rs-232 port through uart and then the input plaintext message is encrypted using ecc algorithm , which is running in the microblaze processor of the the fpga . after encryption , \n the cipher text is send back to the host pc and is seen in the hyper terminal using serial communication between the board and the pc . \n figure [ single ] shows the flow of steps in the design . \n processor working at 100mhz clock frequency is used to encrypt 8-bits of message using ecc . \n scalar multiplication constitutes the main operation in ecc . \n it is seen that the processor takes 19.01 msec to perform the total encryption . the resource utilized i.e. , the number of luts and slices required by the design as well as the power requirements are summarized in the table [ table : resource and power calculation ] .          after evaluating the performance of ecc in single processor architecture by using microblaze soft - core processor , \n another approach is taken to implement it in dual processor architecture by considering the fact discussed in section  [ mps ] for higher throughput and efficiency . \n xilinx virtex4 ml403 is taken as a platform for design . \n shared memory is used for creating a handshaking between the two processors as described in section  [ shared ] and the synchronization for communication is achieved using the process described in section  [ sync ] . \n [ dual ] shows the architecture of dual microblaze design ,        in addition , multiple port memory controller ( ddr_sdram ) and inter - processor communication - xps mutex hardware ip @xcite is also incorporated in the test bed to facilitate the memory sharing and inter processor synchronization and communication .    in the experiment , \n the two processors are equally engaged to execute ecc in parallel fashion and in between the consequent steps , the two processors communicate with each other via shared memory with proper synchronization . \n the message to be encrypted is transferred to the fpga from a computer using rs232 serial port communication . \n the two multiplications are executed concurrently in two processors and the resulting data is assembled in the shared memory . \n the addition operation is then performed by the 1st processor and the resultant cipher text is generated . \n the resultant cipher text is send back to the pc using the rs232 interface and is viewed at the hyper terminal of the computer . \n [ dual - mb ] shows the mechanism in which the two processors communicate using the shared memory and using mutex locking and unlocking . \n it is seen that the encryption engine speeds up by 3.3 times as the proposed architecture takes only 5.72 msec to perform the encryption.the resource estimation , power required and throughput measurements for both the designs are shown in table [ table : throughput calculation ] and table [ table : resource and power calculation ] below . the design improves the throughput of execution , but utilizes more resources due to the dual cores . \n it is to be noted here that the throughput of the design can be improved further by enabling the cache memory . but due to the resource constraints of our implementation board the cache memory of the two processors \n could not be enabled . \n .for an encryption process [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : resource and power calculation ] \n this work is an exploration of ecc implementation for fpga based embedded systems . \n two specific designs have been addressed , the first one is simpler involving a single microblaze core whereas the other one utilizes two microblaze cores and thus enables multi - threading . \n the dual core based implementation gives almost a 3 times increase in the throughput but utilizes almost twice the resource and 30% more power as compared to the single core based implementation . \n this clearly shows a trade off between speed , resource utilization and power requirement . in future \n we look forward to do a further exploration of ecc implementation for embedded applications involving fpga based hard processor cores and asic based design .    00 , `` elliptic curve cryptosystems , '' _ mathematics of computation 48 _ , ( 177 ) : 203209 . \n jstor 2007884 . \n , `` use of elliptic curves in cryptography , '' _ crypto 85 _ : 417426 @xmath9 . \n , `` cryptography and network security : principles and practice ( 6th edition ) , '' , isbn : 0133354695 . \n , `` hardware architectures for public key cryptography , '' _ integration , the vlsi journal _ , 34(1 -

{"ContextTokens": 3855, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "the critical properties of nonequilibrium systems have attracted attention and have seen a great development in the last years @xcite . this may be credited to their resemblance with critical phenomena occurring in systems in thermodynamic equilibrium . in equilibrium as well as in nonequilibrium phase transitions \n there is a singular dependence of the steady - state properties upon the control parameters , marking a transition between distinct regimes . \n other common features include long - range correlations , well - defined order parameter and singularities characterized by critical exponents that are grouped in universality classes @xcite .    due to absence of a general theory for the nonequilibrium regime , \n these properties are analyzed in particular models , trying to form a complete picture . \n in particular , a class of simple models used to perform this task is constituted by lattice models with absorbing states . \n the presence of an absorbing state is sufficient for breaking the detailed balance condition , making these models intrinsically irreversible . in the steady - state regime \n , these models display a phase transition from an absorbing state to an active state , as the control parameter is varied . \n a very robust universality class for these models is the directed percolation ( dp ) class . \n it describes the critical properties of any system with a phase transition between an absorbing and an active state characterized by a scalar order parameter , short - range interactions and no conservation laws @xcite .    usually , the tool utilized in the study of these problems is the numerical simulation , but analytic approaches are also used as an important tool in this task leading , in some cases , to very precise results . as in other fields of physics , \n simulational and analytical approaches are complementary in the study of phase transitions in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems @xcite . \n one of these analytical approaches is the series expansion @xcite that has provided the most precise estimates of the dp exponents in one - dimension @xcite . \n inspired by the equilibrium case , the series for nonequilibrium systems can be either supercritical or subcritical , in analogy with the high- and low - temperature expansions in equilibrium systems . \n a pioneer work that uses series expansions for lattice models with absorbing states was developed by dickman and jensen @xcite , in their study of the critical properties of the contact process ( cp ) . \n the contact process is an icon among the models that display a phase transition between an absorbing and active state . \n initially the cp was proposed as a model for spreading of an epidemic disease @xcite and has become the `` ising model '' for the dp universality class . using subcritical and supercritical series , dickman and \n jensen obtained the critical point and its associate exponents . \n their results indicate that the supercritical case works better than the subcritical series . \n recently , de oliveira @xcite proposed an alternative approach for generating the subcritical expansion obtaining critical values comparable to those of the supercritical series @xcite . the difference between the approaches is that in @xcite , the non - perturbated operator ( associated with the annihilation of particles ) should be diagonalized , whereas this procedure is not required for the supercritical series .    in this paper , \n a comparative study between subcritical and supercritical series expansion is performed for the pair - creation contact process ( pccp ) @xcite . \n although this model does not show any surprise concerning the critical properties , since it belongs to the dp universality class as the ordinary cp , it is interesting for the comparative analysis . \n we will show that the original approach for the supercritical series @xcite does not work properly , presenting problems in its construction . \n even an alternative version of the model , that would overcome these problems , does not lead to precise results for the critical point . on the other hand \n , the subcritical series gives results , without any maneuver , that are comparable to those obtained by numerical simulations @xcite . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 \n we present the model and the operator formalism . in section 3 \n we show the derivation of the supercritical series , discussing its problems . in section 4 , we attempt to overcome the problem by introducing a modified pccp and deriving the supercritical series . in section 5 \n we present the approach for the subcritical case and results coming from the pad analysis for both pure and modified pccp . \n finally , in section 6 the conclusions and final discussions of this work may be found . \n we consider an interacting particle system on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath0 sites . \n the system evolves in the time according to a markovian process with local and irreversible rules . \n the configurations are described in terms of occupation variables , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 according to whether the site @xmath3 is empty or occupied by a particle , respectively . \n the time evolution of the probability @xmath4 of a given configuration @xmath5 at the time @xmath6 is given by the master equation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 . \n the transition rate @xmath9 for the pccp is given by @xmath10 if an empty site has two occupied neighbor sites , then this site becomes occupied with a transition rate equals to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of the pairs of the first neighbors occupied . \n if the site is occupied , then it is becomes empty with a rate @xmath13 , independently of its neighborhood . \n when the lattice is entirely empty , the system is trapped in an absorbing state . however , for small values of the rate @xmath13 , an active state can be achieved in the stationary state . in this way , \n a continuous phase transition occurs in this model with the critical point localized , according to simulational results @xcite , in @xmath14 .    to develop this operator formalism \n , we represent the microscopic configurations of the lattice by the direct product of vectors latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath65+\\gamma[r_1+r_2])^{-1}$ ] , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( are the number of empty sites with one and two pairs of occupied neighbors , respectively and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the number of empty sites with one and two occupied neighbors , respectively . \n the expression @xmath38 corresponds to the configuration obtained by replacing a hole at site @xmath3 by a particle . differently from the pure pccp , \n the modified pccp does not have divergences when one takes the limit @xmath68 . \n thus , for configurations @xmath55 , we have that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an integer number and @xmath71 is a configuration originated from @xmath55 by a simple creation process . the particular case of the vacuum @xmath72 for which @xmath73 does not diverge in the stationary state limit .    in the supercritical expansion the operator @xmath49 acting over any configuration ( except the vacuum ) generating an infinite set of configurations , \n so it is impossible to evaluate @xmath74 in a closed form . \n we can evaluate , however , the ultimate survival probability @xmath75 , which corresponds to the coefficient of the vacuum . we define the series coefficients as @xmath76 using a proper computational algorithm , we can calculate the coefficients up to order 23 , with values of @xmath77 shown in figure [ fig3 ] . \n the limiting factor for this calculation is actually the memory required . \n we attempt to obtain the critical properties of the pccp model by performing the numerical extrapolation @xmath78 , since this approach does not work in the case @xmath79 . \n to analyze the series , we use the d - log pad approximants approach . \n these approximants are defined as ratios of two polynomials @xmath80 in our case the function @xmath81 represents the series for @xmath82 , for a fixed value for the parameter @xmath77 . \n therefore , we are able to obtain approximants satisfying the condition @xmath83 . \n one verifies that diagonal ( @xmath84 ) and near - diagonal approximants usually exhibit better convergence properties , so that we will restrict our calculations to the set of approximants such that @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .    in the neighborhood of the critical point \n the ultimate survival probability behaves as @xmath87 . \n the critical point @xmath88 is determined by the pole of the approximant @xmath89 and the exponent @xmath90 by the residue associated with this pole .    in figure [ fig3 ] the estimates for critical points \n @xmath88 are depicted for different values of the parameter @xmath77 . using a linear extrapolation of these data , \n we obtain the estimation for the asymptotic limit @xmath63 as @xmath91 , in disagreement with the simulational result @xmath14 @xcite . \n we remark that decreasing the parameter @xmath77 , the dispersion of the approximants increases and the precision of the result becomes smaller . \n the exponent @xmath90 , as shown in figure [ figbeta ] , is in accordance with the dp universality class value for any value of the parameter @xmath77 , as expected . \n however , the uncertainties on the location of the critical point put in doubt the accuracy of the supercritical series around @xmath92 . \n in fact , what happens is that the coefficients of the configurations @xmath55 in the steady - state behaves as @xmath93 diverging as @xmath78 . \n this behavior causes a ill - conditioned series for @xmath94 , becoming impossible a more accurate result for the critical point in this limit . \n to develop subcritical series expansion , we rewrite the evolution operator as @xmath95 where @xmath96 . since the operator @xmath28 is associated to annihilation process and , for small values of the parameter @xmath97 , this annihilation process is favored , this expansion describes indeed the subcritical regime . differently from the supercritical case , the series here are generated directly , without the necessity of taking the laplace transform . \n the operator @xmath28 , associated to annihilation particles process , is expressed as @xmath98 , with @xmath99 . \n each term @xmath100 has the following set of right and left eigenvectors @xmath101 with eigenvalue @xmath102 and @xmath103 with eigenvalue @xmath104 .    to find the steady state vector @xmath105 , that satisfies the steady condition @xmath106 \n , we assume that @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the steady solution of the non - interacting term @xmath28 satisfying the stationary condition @xmath109 the vectors @xmath110 can be generated recursively from the initial state @xmath111 . following dickman @xcite \n , we get the recursion relation @xmath112 is the inverse of @xmath28 in the subspace of vectors with eigenvalues and is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are right and left eigenvectors of @xmath28 , respectively , with nonzero eigenvalue @xmath116 . since the creation of particles is catalytic , if we start from steady state of the noninteracting term , that corresponds to the vacuum state , we will obtain a trivial steady vector . to overcome this problem \n , it is necessary to introduce a modification on the rules of the model . \n the necessity of changing the initial state in systems with absorbing states in order to get nontrivial steady states have been considered previously by jensen and dickman @xcite and more recently by de oliveira @xcite . \n the modification we have performed @xcite consists in introducing a spontaneous creation of particles . for the case \n @xmath79 ( pure pccp ) the creation occurs in two adjacent sites , chosen to be @xmath117 and @xmath118 . \n this modification leads to the following expression to the operator @xmath28 @xmath119 where @xmath120 is supposed to be a small parameter and @xmath121 . \n the steady state @xmath111 of @xmath28 is not the vacuum state anymore . \n now , it is given by @xmath122 where all sites before and after the symbol `` . '' \n are empty . \n two remarks are in order . \n first , only the last term in @xmath111 will give nonzero contributions to the expansion so that @xmath123 , @xmath124 , will be of the order @xmath125 . \n second , although the change in @xmath28 will cause a change in @xmath126 , only the terms of zero order in the expansion in @xmath120 , given by the right - hand side of equation ( [ r ] ) , will be necessary since the corrections in @xmath126 will contribute to terms of order larger than @xmath125 . \n for instance , the two first vectors , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , for the pure pccp are given by @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 where the translational invariance of the system is assumed . \n for @xmath132 , it suffices to consider the spontaneous creation in just one site . \n this modifications leads to the following expression @xmath133 instead of equation ( [ wo ] ) .    from the series expansion of the state vector @xmath134 , it is possible to determine several quantities . in this paper \n , we will be concerned only with the series expansion for the total number of particles @xmath135 , given by @xmath136 one can show that the coefficient of @xmath137 in the expansion for @xmath135 is simply the coefficient of @xmath138 in @xmath139 . \n this allows us to get a longer series for the number of particles . \n for both modified and pure pccp , we have obtained a series with 38 terms . \n the critical behavior of @xmath135 obeys the following relation @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the exponents related to the time correlation length and to the growth of the number of particles , respectively . through an analysis of the d - log pad approximants , like that performed for supercritical series expansion , we are able to calculate the critical point and its associated exponent . using the series for the number of particles @xmath135 the values obtained were @xmath143 and @xmath144 . \n these values do not agree with the best estimates , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath145 @xcite . \n another estimate is obtained by performing a non - homogeneous d - log pad approximant @xcite . using this approach we obtained the value @xmath146 , closer to the value obtained by numerical simulations @xcite . \n more reliable estimates are obtained when we determine the pad approximants for the series @xmath147 @xmath148 @xcite , called biased pad approximants . considering a given pad approximant \n @xmath149 $ ] and a trial value of @xmath150 , we develop the series above obtaining @xmath151 . \n we can build curves for different pad approximants by repeating this procedure for several trials @xmath150 and we expect that they intercept at the critical point ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) .    from the figure [ padepccp ] we see a very narrow intersection of the pad approximants , revealing the utility of this approach . \n however , as pointed out by guttmann @xcite , it is difficult to estimate uncertainties in series calculations . \n thus , in order to give a more realistic estimate of the quantities measured here and their associated uncertainties , we have estimated them by taking into account the first and last crossings among various pad approximants . \n the estimate of @xmath88 for the pccp , @xmath154 , in excellent agreement with the corresponding value obtained from recent numerical simulations @xcite . \n finally , the exponent obtained is @xmath155 , in agreement with the best estimation of @xmath156 for the dp universality class @xcite .    to stress the difference between subcritical and supercritical approaches , we have also developed subcritical series expansion for the modified pccp model for some values of @xmath77 , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] . in the limit @xmath63 , the subcritical approach gives @xmath157 , which is in good agreement with the estimate @xmath154 for @xmath79 and @xmath14 obtained from numerical simulations @xcite . \n on the other hand , the extrapolation for @xmath63 in the supercritical case does not lead to the correct value , as can be seen in figure [ fig3 ] . \n in this work , we have considered the pair - creation contact process by carrying out a comparative study between subcritical and supercritical expansions . differently from the contact process , \n the supercritical expansion in its canonical formulation @xcite is intrinsically ill - conditioned for the pccp . \n in fact , divergences in coefficients of the supercritical series occur for any model with creation by cluster of particles . as an attempt to circumvent the divergences \n , we introduced and analyzed a modified version of the pccp . however \n this procedure does not lead to the correct result when one recovers the original model . \n it would be interesting to search an alternative procedure to develop supercritical series for such models . \n we have shown here that subcritical series expansion provides results comparable with recent numerical simulations @xcite .    a natural extension of this work is the use of subcritical series to study models with creation by clusters ( pairs and triplets ) and diffusion of particles @xcite . \n results from numerical simulations @xcite suggest that these models display a tricritical point . \n thus this approach , associated with an analysis by means of partial differential approximants in two - variables , could be used to determine the existence of a tricritical point . \n in fact , such an approach has already been shown to be useful for the location of a multicritical point in a generalized contact process @xcite . \n c. e. fiore and w.g . \n dantas thank the financial support from fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) under grants no . 05/04459 -

{"ContextTokens": 2281, "GeneratedTokens": 71, "SynthesizedBody": "in this talk we consider a new mechanism for hard inclusive production , which violates the factorization theorem @xcite . \n the suggested mechanism is present in any central hard inclusive production , such as heavy higgs meson production and/or the high @xmath0 inclusive production of mini jets and jets . \n we illustrate this mechanism for the case of inclusive heavy higgs production in nucleon - deutron high energy scattering . \n the usual description of inclusive production of a higgs meson with mass @xmath1 in a nucleon - deutron interaction , is based on the factorization theorem @xcite , using which the cross section of interest is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the parton distribution within the deutron , and in the impulse approximation @xmath4 . \n @xmath5 denotes the cross section for higgs meson production in the parton - parton collision . \n the factorization theorem ( ft ) can be proven for the nucleon - deutron scattering using the agk cutting rules @xcite ( see ref . @xcite and references therein for detail discussion of the agk cutting rules in qcd ) . \n indeed , let us assume that the ft holds for nucleon - nucleon scattering . for nucleon - deutron scattering \n we have two contributions to the total cross section : the projectile nucleon interacts with one nucleon in the deutron ( impulse approximation ) and it interacts with both nucleons in the deutron ( glauber corrections ) . \n the first process obviously leads to the ft of eq.(1 ) , while for the second one we can use the agk cutting rules for the decomposition of the total cross section with respect to the multiplicity of produced particles . \n the relation between different contributions is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the amplitude of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . \n @xmath9 is the cross section of all processes where no particles were produced in the central rapidity region ( elastic scattering and single and double diffractive dissociation ) ; @xmath10 is the contribution to the total inelastic cross section , which has the same multiplicity distribution as in nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section , and @xmath11 is part of the total inelastic cross section for the nucleon - deutron scattering which describes the inelastic interaction of the projectile nucleon with two nucleons in the deutron . \n one can see that eq.(2 ) leads to the cancellation of the interaction with the two nucleon in the deutron for the inclusive cross section of the particle in the central rapidity region . \n indeed , @xmath9 does not contribute to this production while two other contributions cancels since in the subprocess described by @xmath11 there is two ways of the production of the particle of the interest . \n therefore , the inclusive production can be described in the impulse approximation for which the ft is valid by our assumption . \n the natural question arises : _ what is wrong in our above discussion_. \n let us start with the short answer to the formulated question : _ we missed the interference diagrams given in fig.1 _ and these diagrams give the new mechanism for centrally produced higgs meson ( or for any other  hard \" process . \n trying to describe what kind of processes we picture in fig.1 , one can see that fig.1a shows the process where the higgs , which is produced centrally , is separated by two large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) from the small final state multiplicities which occur on the edges of the rapidity plot . \n we define this process as a double pomeron exchange reaction , and denote its contribution as @xmath12 . \n the contribution of fig.1b is denoted by @xmath13 . \n this is a mixed diagram , where the higgs which is produced in a double pomeron process , is superimposed on a normal uniform rapidity distribution typical of an inelastic nucleon - nucleon reaction . \n finally , fig.1c describes higgs production as part of the nucleon - nucleon background to the rapidity distribution . \n we denote this contribution by @xmath14 . to obtain our final result we need to sum over all three of the above contributions , noting that these are not necessarily positive . \n the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) amplitude for higgs production via double pomeron exchange , has been calculated @xcite , to be @xmath15 @xmath16 is the the vertex of the hard parton - parton @xmath17 higgs process and @xmath18 is the pomeron exchange amplitude . \n the second ingredient in our calculation is the amplitude shown in fig.1c ( see also one of the amplitude in fig.1b ) . \n this amplitude has no analog in the case of a single nucleon - nucleon interaction , and it depicts the cut in the diagram shown in fig.1a . \n we note that this diagram is equal to @xmath19 , unlike the case for inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section where @xmath20 . \n the above result follows from the unitarity constraint @xcite .    recalling that the integration over the longitudinal components of the momentum carried by the pomeron in fig.1b results in a negative sign for the interference diagram ( see ref . \n @xcite for details ) , we can easily calculate all diagrams contributing to the inclusive higgs meson production . \n indeed , calculating @xmath12 , the sum of the diagrams in fig.1a , and using eq.(3 ) , one has    @xmath21    for the sum of diagrams in fig.1b we have @xmath22 finally , for @xmath14 , shown in fig.1c , we obtain @xmath23 the relation between the different contributions is @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    summing all contributions we obtain an additional term in the cross section \n compare to the one given in eq.(1 ) @xmath26    we would like to draw attention to the novel fact , that the contribution of the new mechanism is proportional to the real part of the amplitude . for a soft pomeron with @xmath27 , the contribution of eq.(8 ) vanishes , and we recover the factorization theorem @xcite , i.e. an exact cancellation of the diagrams shown in fig.1c . \n however , for the hard processes (  hard \" pomeron ) both theory and experiment lead to a steep behaviour of the cross section as a function of energy ( see ref . \n @xcite ) which results in considerable violation of the factorization theorem for totaly inclusive production . indeed , at high energy ( low @xmath28 ) \n @xmath29 is equal to @xmath30 in all available parametrization for the deep inelastic structure function @xmath31 at @xmath32 . \n to give a quantative measure of the effect of the nonfactorization we plot in fig.2 the ratio of the nonfactorized contribution ( see ref.@xcite for the formula of this contribution ) to the cross section from the factorization theorem of eq.(1 ) , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gluon density of the @xmath35-th hadron and @xmath36 is the unintegrated gluon density , which closely related to the gluon structure function , namely , @xmath37 . in fig.2 we took @xmath38 = 0 , where @xmath38 is rapidity of produced higgs meson . \n notice , that this ratio does not depend on the hard cross section , and as such is also applicable to any central production process , in particular , hard minijet and jet production . in evaluating eq.(10 ) \n we use @xcite the grv parametrization @xcite for the gluon density . \n we assume that @xmath39 ( see ref.@xcite ) . \n for the initial virtuality we take @xmath40 , as the grv parametrization is in agreement with the hera data on @xmath41 @xcite for all @xmath42 . \n one can see , that @xmath43 is quite big for low masses and decreases when m increases . \n for example , @xmath43 = 1.2 for @xmath44 . \n we do not expect the higgs meson mass to be that small , but our result is also applicable in the case of jet production where @xmath45 . \n accordingly , with such a value of @xmath43 we can expect minijet production ( jets with @xmath46 ) which can be responsible for the structure of the minimum bias events at the tevatron energy .    the value of @xmath43 is bigger for nucleus - nucleus interaction . to estimate this value \n we need to multiply eq.(10 ) by a factor of @xmath47 . using the simple relation @xmath48 \n , one has @xmath49 . \n therefore , for a gold - gold interaction we expect that @xmath43 is enhanced by factor 4 - 9 . \n our conclusion is very simple : _ the factorization theorem @xcite is only approximate _ and the violation of the ft can be rather big especially for heavy ion collisions and/or for hadron ones at the lhc energies . \n we firmly believe that the formal proof of the ft given in ref.@xcite should be reconsidered to find out the correct region of the applicability of this theorem .    99 e. gotsman , e. levin and u. maor : taup 2416/97 , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3848, "GeneratedTokens": 180, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of binary systems over the past ten years indicate that in a number of close binaries , the best known being her  x-1 ( hz  her ) and ss433 , long - period variations are detected on characteristic timescales substantially longer than the orbital period . \n to explain these variations , precession of the accretion disk in the binary is widely assume ( see , e.g. , [ 13 ] and references therein ) . \n possible reasons for precession of an accretion disk have been analyzed in a number of studies . \n as early as in 1972 n.i.shakura [ 4 ] noted that the accretion disk can precess if its plane does not coincide with the orbital plane of a binary . among various mechanisms that can lead to formation of an accretion disk inclined to the orbital plane , two \n are usually considered to be most probable : influence of magnetic field of the accretor or violation of the symmetry of the donor - star outflow due to rotation of the star . \n the question of formation an inclined disk under the action of the accretor s magnetic field remains open : control of the disk orientation would require a strong magnetic field which , in turn , could inhibit the formation of the disk itself . \n an inclined accretion disk is more likely to form due to a change of the position of the stream flowing from the inner lagrangian point @xmath0 . in particular w.roberts [ 1 ] and \n a.m.cherepashchuk [ 5,6 ] proposed a scenario in which a minor asymmetry of the explosion of a supernova ( resulting in the formation of a relativistic object in the binary ) can decline the orbital plane of a binary relative to the rotation axis of the normal component of the system . in this case , after the supernova explosion and the formation of a relativistic object , the rotation axis of the normal component of the system might become oriented not perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary . for systems where \n mass is transfer from the normal star to the relativistic object , the disturbance of the symmetry of the outflow of matter from the donor - star might result in the formation of an accretion disk not aligned with the orbital plane . \n precession of such a disk could be caused either by induced precession of the disk itself under the action of the gravitational attraction of donor - star [ 7,8 ] , or by the stream oscillations due to precession of the rotation vector of the donor - star ( the ` slaved disk ' model , [ 1,4 ] ) , or by some other mechanism ( see , e.g. , [ 9 ] ) . \n the description of the gas dynamics of mass transfer binaries of this type calls for the use of three - dimensional models because the rotation vectors of the donor - star is not perpendicular to the orbital plane and is engaged in precession . \n this means that this problem can not be reduced to a two - dimensional one . \n further , there is an additional complexity in describing such systems connected with the periodic time dependence of the boundary conditions , that is with the absence of a steady - state flow of matter in the system , thus necessitating the consideration of the structure of flow over long periods of time ( few times longer than maximum characteristic period of the system ) . until very recently , these circumstances , together with insufficient computational resources , made numerical studies of flow structures in binary systems of this type difficult . \n a few attempts to consider the formation of an accretion disk in such systems were made in substantially simplified formulation [ 10 , 11 ] . \n here we consider for the first time numerical , self - consistent solution for the three - dimensional flow structure of mass transfer in semidetached binary systems in which the donor s rotation axis precesses . \n the obtained results support the model of ` driven accretion disk ' , based on the idea that the oscillations of the disk relative to the equatorial plane reflect variations of the stream of matter from the inner lagrangian point @xmath0 . \n in [ 12 ] we presented a three - dimensional simulation of mass transfer in semidetached binaries with rotation of the donor - star . \n we investigated both synchronous ( the rotational period of the donor - star equals to the orbital period of the system @xmath1 ) and asynchronous ( @xmath2 ) rotation of the donor - star [ 12 ] . \n for the case of asynchronous rotation both axially aligned rotation , when the rotation vector of the donor - star is perpendicular to the orbital plane of a binary , and non - aligned , when this vector is inclined relative to the orbital plane were considered . \n it was also assumed in [ 12 ] that the case of asynchronous non - aligned rotation implies that the rotation vector of the donor - star is in a rest in the laboratory coordinate system ( i.e. , relative to observer ) . \n the existence of observational evidence for precession of rotational vector of the donor - star requires extension of the model . \n the model we use here assumes that the rotation vector of the donor - star precesses ( in a laboratory coordinate system ) about its mean position , which coincides with the vector of orbital rotation of the binary . \n note that although this model has a formally more general character ( rate of precession of the rotation vector in the laboratory coordinate system @xmath3 ) than the model considered in [ 12 ] for the case of asynchronous non - aligned rotation ( rate of precession of the rotation vector in the laboratory coordinate system @xmath4 ) , these models differ significantly in the laboratory coordinate system only . in a rotating coordinate system ( adopted for our calculations ) \n , we can expect that there will be qualitatively similar solutions for both models because in this coordinate system the rotation vector of the donor - star in model of [ 12 ] also undergoes precessional motion , i.e. for both models @xmath5 . \n the different rates of precession in the models should lead only to quantitatively difference of the solutions leaving the general features of the flow structure in a binary unchanged .    to study in detail whether accretion disk will follow the ` driven disk ' model , we conducted the calculations over a time exceeding the period of long - period variations of the system ; this made it possible to obtain established solutions both in a laboratory and in a rotating coordinate system . to be able to compare the solutions with the results obtained in [ 12 ] we adopted the same parameters of binary system : the primary ( filling its roche lobe ) parameters are @xmath6 , @xmath7 k ; the secondary ( compact objects ) \n parameters are @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; parameters of binary system @xmath10 ; @xmath11 . \n we assumed that the rotation velocity of the donor - star in the laboratory coordinate system exceeds twice the angular velocity of the system . \n the angle between the rotation vector of the donor star @xmath12 and the ` @xmath13'-axis was assumed to be @xmath14 ( in the laboratory coordinate system ) . \n the inclination angle of this vector in the rotating coordinate system is @xmath15 . \n the rate of precession of rotation vector of the donor - star was equal to @xmath16 in the laboratory coordinate system or @xmath17  in the rotating coordinate system ( the minus sign indicates that the precession of the rotation vector is retrograde with respect to the orbital rotation ) . \n following the procedure of [ 12 ] , we determined the boundary conditions on the surface of this star by solving the riemann problem between gas parameters ( @xmath18 ) on the stellar surface and the parameters in the computation gridpoint closest to the given point on the star surface . \n the asynchronism of rotation of the donor - star , as well as the precession of the vector of its rotation were taken into account when setting the boundary conditions for the gas velocity vector on the roche lobe of the donor - star . \n all other parameters of the mathematical model including the details of numerical realization were taken the same as in [ 12 ] , namely :    * we adopted the computational domain as a parallepipedon @xmath19 ; * a non - uniform ( more fine in the zone near accretor ) finite - difference grid with @xmath20 gridpoints was used ; * the shape of the donor - star was determined , taking into account the asynchronicity of its rotation . \n the results of calculations fully confirmed our assumption that , given a rotating coordinate system , the qualitative features of the flow structure are independent of the rate of precession of the rotation vector of the donor - star . \n 1 depicts the iso - surfaces of density at the level @xmath21 for 10 moments of time which cover a full period of variation of the boundary conditions in a rotating coordinate system . \n note that , in line with the assumed parameters of the system , the period of precession of the rotation vector of the donor - star in a rotating coordinate system @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 of the orbital period @xmath24 . \n owing to this the results are given in fig .  1 over the interval @xmath25 \n .    analysis of the results presented in fig . \n 1 shows that the behavior of the disk @xmath26 and of the near - disk matter @xmath27 reflects the variations of the stream of matter @xmath28 flowing from @xmath0 ( i.e. boundary conditions on the surface of the donor - star @xmath28 ) . \n this points to the realization of the ` slaved disk ' model in the calculations . \n the results show also that the unique morphology of the flow , as well as the effect of circumbinary envelope gas lead to a shock - free interaction between the stream and the outer edge of the accretion disk and , as a consequence , to the absence of a ` hot spot ' in the disk . in the model discussed here the zone of increased energy release \n is located beyond the accretion disk  at the region where the gas of circumbinary envelope interacts with the stream and where the extended shock wave is formed . similarly to the case of non - aligned asynchronous rotation described in \n [ 12 ] , the interaction between the rarefied gas of the circumbinary envelope and the stream of matter results in the formation of gaseous ` clouds ' located ahead of the front edge of the stream , beyond the zone of disk formation ( marker @xmath27 in fig .  1 ) . \n the period of variation of these gaseous formations  ` clouds '  reflects the period of variation of the boundary conditions at the mass - losing star .    in the laboratory \n coordinate system the characteristic timescale of the long - period variation ( precession of the rotation vector of the donor - star with period @xmath29 ) is equal to @xmath30 . \n the calculations were made over period of time exceeding @xmath29 starting from the time when the flow was established . \n as expected , the comparison of results of calculations in the laboratory coordinate system confirms the periodic character of solution with the period @xmath31 . \n this is illustrated in fig .  2 and  3 where iso - surfaces of density at the level @xmath21 are shown in the laboratory coordinate system . \n these plots show the 3d view of density distribution in the vicinity of @xmath0 and in the near - disk region , respectively , for six moments of time covering the period of precession in the laboratory coordinate system . \n analysis of fig . \n 2 indicates that in accordance with the variations of boundary conditions , the position of the stream flowing from @xmath0 varies with respect to the equatorial plane , and , after a time @xmath29 , returns to its initial position . \n figure  3 shows that the accretion disk @xmath26 and surrounding gaseous formation ( clouds @xmath27 and @xmath32 ) follow the position of the stream ( see fig . \n 2 ) , and their shape varies with the same period . \n the presence of two characteristic periods  the precessional period of the rotation vector of the donor star in the laboratory frame @xmath29 and orbital period of the system @xmath24  can explain the appearance of other periods of observation evidences , apart from @xmath29 . in particular , the interaction of @xmath29 with @xmath24 leads to formation of short - period beating oscillations . \n for example , as concerns the system ss433 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , in additions to the period @xmath35 , there should exist variations with the period of @xmath36 . \n these short - period oscillations , as well as the following beating harmonic with period @xmath37 are observed in ss433 ( see , e.g. , [ 13,14 ] and references therein ) . \n our three - dimensional simulations of mass transfer in semidetached binaries with precession of rotation vector of donor star reveal the ` driven ' nature of forming accretion disk . for typical parameters of numerical viscosity adopted for the numerical model ( @xmath38 in terms of @xmath39-disk ) , the change of the flow pattern , the parameters of accretion disk , and parameters of the near - disk regions reflect the variations of boundary conditions on the donor star . in turn , the periodicity of boundary conditions is determined by the precessional velocity . \n analysis of the flow pattern indicates that the basic features of the solution are qualitatively similar to those for calculations previously obtained for the cases of synchronous , aligned asynchronous , and non - aligned asynchronous rotation of the donor - star [ 12 ] , and , in turn , indicates to the universal character of the model without a ` hot spot ' proposed in [ 1518 ] . \n the ` driven ' character of the solution implies that the emission properties of the accretion disk and intercomponent gaseous structures recur with the precessional period of the rotation axis of donor - star . in binary systems \n where observed long - period variations can be explained by the precession of the donor - star the periodicity of the solution obtained here can be used to interpret the observational data . \n this work was supported by the russian foundation for basic research ( grant 99 -

atom interaction with the use of feshbach resonances . \n the interaction can be made strong / weak and attractive / repulsive simply by tuning an external magnetic field . \n this has resulted in many important discoveries concerning strongly interacting many - body systems and the pace at which new results are being reported shows no sign of slowing down . \n sophisticated and very precise coupled channels calculations have been developed to describe atomic feshbach resonances at the two - body level  @xcite . \n such coupled channels approaches are in general not easily generalized to study the intriguing many - body effects observed in the atomic gases . several effective theories \n have therefore been developed which include a simplified version of the two - body feshbach physics such that many - body calculations are tractable  @xcite . \n most of these theories either neglect the feshbach molecule entirely using so - called single channel models  @xcite or put it in by hand as a point boson  @xcite . \n such approaches have been very successful in calculating various many - body properties of the atomic gases for wide resonances where the multi - channel nature of the scattering is less important . for narrow resonances \n however , single channel approximations can not be expected to be accurate , and even for wide resonances there are observables which depend specifically on the multi - channel nature of the scattering .    to address this , we describe in this paper an effective theory for the feschbach scattering which in the spirit of landau expresses the multi - channel scattering matrix in terms of observables only . \n the feshbach molecule emerges dynamically as a proper two - body state , yet the theory is still simple enough to be easily generalized to treat many - body effects . as an application of this theory , we consider the collective modes of trapped atomic fermi gases . \n the study of collective modes is a powerful probe into the properties of interacting quantum liquids . in cold atomic fermi gases \n , collective mode spectroscopy has revealed a wealth of information about zero temperature @xmath0  @xcite as well as @xmath1 properties  @xcite . \n we outline how one can calculate the frequency and damping of the collective modes in the normal phase above the critical temperature @xmath2 for superfluidity . \n focus is on how the modes reveal information about the collisional properties and many - body effects . \n first we develop an effective low energy theory for fermionic alkali atom - atom scattering in a medium . \n consider alkali atoms in a magnetic field @xmath3 oriented along the @xmath4-direction . \n the strongest part of the atom -

of - mass momentum @xmath29 since galilean invariance is broken by the presence of the medium . \n the expressions for the pair propagators in the open and closed channels @xmath30 and @xmath31 with medium effects included through the ladder approximation are given in ref . \n @xcite . equation ( [ lippmannschwinger ] ) is easily solved and the open channel scattering matrix can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the in - medium pair propagator in the closed channel . \n equation ( [ tatas ] ) provides a transparent physical interpretation of the multi channel scattering : the first term in ( [ tatas ] ) describes scattering induced by the open channel interaction only and the second term describes the scattering via the closed channel . the diagrammatic structure of ( [ tatas])-([moleculeprop ] ) \n is shown in fig . \n [ feynman ] . \n the scattering of alkali atoms depends on the magnetic field @xmath3 both through the hyperfine states and the matrix elements @xmath19 . \n close to a feshbach resonance located at a given field @xmath34 , the zero energy two - body scattering matrix in the open channel can be parametrized as @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the ( non - resonant ) background scattering length and @xmath37 the width of the resonance . \n the feshbach resonance comes from the presence of a molecular state in the closed channel . \n it is thus contained in the second term in ( [ tatas ] ) . \n the energy @xmath38 of a feshbach molecule ( including medium effects ) with momentum @xmath39 is determined by @xmath40 . by making a pole expansion of ( [ tatas ] ) around @xmath41 and comparing with ( [ phenomenology ] ) , \n one can write the scattering matrix in the very useful form  @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule with respect to the open channel . \n a detailed analysis of the molecular propagator ( [ moleculeprop ] ) shows that @xmath45 can be split into a contribution from the magnetic dependence of the bare closed channel state and a contribution from screening due to coupling to high energy states in the open channel . \n this screening which reduces the magnetic moment from its bare value is often ignored in the literature . \n it comes from a _ linear _ frequency dependence of the molecule self energy in addition to the well known @xmath46 threshold dependence , and it can lead to a significant reduction of the magnetic moment of the molecule  @xcite . \n the function @xmath47 is given in ref . \n it describes effects coming from the composite two - fermion nature of the feshbach molecule , and it is here that many - body effects in the closed channel enter .    with ( [ t(mu , abg ) ] ) , we have arrived at an effective low energy theory for scattering in a medium . \n the complicated energy and momentum dependent multichannel scattering matrix is expressed in a simple way through the physical observables @xmath36 , @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and @xmath45 . the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath34 , @xmath37 can be measured in scattering experiments whereas the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule can be measured in rethermalization experiments  @xcite . \n contrary to many other approaches in the literature , the theory allows one to include non - trivial many - body effects in the closed channel as well as in the open channel . \n examples of such closed channel medium effects were considered in ref . \n we now consider the collective modes of trapped fermi gases and examine how they can reveal information about the scattering properties discussed in the previous section . \n we focus on the normal state for temperatures @xmath48 . \n the dynamics of the gas is assumed to be described by a semiclassical distribution function @xmath49 which satisfies the boltzmann equation . \n a collective mode corresponds to a deviation @xmath50 away from the equilibrium distribution @xmath51 . by expanding @xmath52 in a set of basis states with the symmetry appropriate for the particular mode considered , one can express the boltzmann equation in matrix form  @xcite . \n the corresponding determinants determine the mode frequency @xmath28 . \n to be specific , we model the collective modes studied experimentally in ref . \n @xcite , where the atoms are trapped in a very elongated harmonic potential of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 . \n the motion of the collective modes is then mainly in the @xmath55-plane . for the scissors mode , \n the determinant equation determining the mode frequency becomes  @xcite @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the mode frequency in the hydrodynamic limit when @xmath58 characteristic of many collisions , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mode frequencies in the collisionless limit @xmath61  @xcite . \n the collision rate @xmath62 is @xmath63}{\\int d^3{r}d^3{p}p_x^2p_y^2f^0(1-f^0 ) } \\label{tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] is the collision integral in the boltzmann equation weighted by the momentum function @xmath65  @xcite . \n it is in the collision integral , that the scattering matrix enters . \n the collision rate ( [ tau ] ) is closely related to the viscosity of the gas and it is therefore sometimes called the viscous relaxation rate  @xcite .    when the atoms are strongly interacting , there are significant pair correlations even in the normal phase . \n the correlations depend strongly on temperature and interaction strength which is parametrized by the scattering length @xmath66 in ( [ phenomenology ] ) \n . correlations and their dependence on @xmath66 and @xmath67 enter the theory for collective modes through ( [ tau ] ) . in fig . \n [ taufig ] , we plot the scattering rate @xmath62 as a function of @xmath67 for : ( a ) strong coupling right at a feshbach resonance @xmath68 , and ( b ) in the weak coupling regime @xmath69 .     for a gas in the unitarity limit ( a ) ( from @xcite ) and in the weak coupling limit ( b ) . \n the superfluid region is indicated in ( a ) whereas it is not visible in ( b ) due to the smallness of @xmath2 . \n the dashed lines show the classical limit , the dash -

dotted lines include fermi blocking , and the solid lines include medium effects in the cross section . ]    to clearly identify the importance of medium effects on the scattering matrix , the rate is calculated using three different approximations . \n the dashed curves are a classical approximation where pauli blocking effects are neglected and the two - body scattering matrix is used . \n the dash - dotted lines include pauli blocking in the collision integral @xmath64 $ ] while the two - body scattering matrix is still used . \n we see that pauli blocking reduces the scattering rate as compared to the classical result as expected ; the classical rate scales as @xmath70 whereas @xmath71 for @xmath72 due to pauli blocking . finally , the solid lines use the many - body scattering matrix ( [ t(mu , abg ) ] ) in addition to including pauli blocking effects in the collision integral . \n medium effects in the scattering matrix are included through the pair propagator @xmath30 in ( [ t(mu , abg ) ] ) . as seen by comparing the solid and the dash - dotted lines in fig . \n [ taufig ] ( a ) , medium effects significantly increase the scattering rate over a wide range of temperatures above @xmath2 for the strong coupling case . \n this is due to pair correlations . \n it is the same physics which gives rise to a divergence in the @xmath73 scattering matrix at @xmath2 signaling the onset of cooper pairing . from fig . \n [ taufig ] ( a ) , we see that the scattering rate calculated including both pair correlations and pauli blocking effects is almost the same as the classical rate which neglects both effects . \n thus , pair correlations nearly cancel the reduction of the scattering rate due to pauli blocking in the normal phase . \n these strong pair correlations are often referred to as the pseudogap effect . \n so we have demonstrated that it is essential to include medium effects in the scattering matrix ( [ t(mu , abg ) ] ) when one considers strong coupling fermi gases ; a simple two - body scattering matrix strongly underestimates the correlations . \n in contrast , there are no observable medium effects on the scattering matrix in the weak coupling regime depicted in fig .  [ taufig ] ( b ) . \n here the curves using a two - body and a many - body @xmath74 are essentially indistinguishable . \n once we know the scattering rate @xmath62 , we can calculate the collective mode frequencies as discussed above . in fig . \n [ scissorsmode ] , we plot the scissors mode frequency @xmath75 and damping @xmath76 obtained from the real and imaginary parts of the solution of ( [ determinant ] ) , i.e.   @xmath77 .     and damping @xmath76 of the scissors mode . \n the solid line is theory and the experimental points are from ref . \n @xcite . ]    the scattering rate is obtained from ( [ tau ] ) using the many - body scattering matrix ( [ t(mu , abg ) ] ) . \n the gas is strongly interacting with @xmath78 and we compare with the experimental data in ref . \n taking into account the experimental uncertainties and the fact that there are _ no fitting parameters _ in the theory , the agreement between theory and experiment is good . \n this indicates that the expressions ( [ t(mu , abg ) ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) account for most of the correlation effects even for strongly correlated fermi gases . \n since the medium effects increase the scattering rate significantly , they make the modes more hydrodynamic . \n we conclude that the observation of well defined hydrodynamic modes above @xmath2 ( see fig . \n [ scissorsmode ] and ref . \n @xcite ) is a signature of many - body effects on the scattering . \n we developed an effective theory for multi - channel feshbach scattering in cold alkali atom gases . \n the theory expresses the scattering in terms of physical observables only . \n it allows for the inclusion of many - body effects in all channels and provides a precise link between microscopic two - body multi - channel calculations and effective many - body theories . \n many - body effects significantly increase the scattering rate over wide range of temperatures . \n we showed how this can be detected on the frequency and damping of collective modes . \n our results were finally compared to experimental data obtaining good agreement . \n 99 pethick cj , smith h ( 2002 ) bose - einstein condensation in dilute gases . \n cambridge university press , cambridge giorgini s , pitaevskii lp , stringari s ( 2008 ) rev mod phys 80:1215 khler t , gral k , julienne ps ( 2006 ) rev mod phys 78:1311 perali a , pieri p , strinati gc ( 2004 ) phys rev lett 93:100404 holland mj , kokkelmans sj , chiofalo ml , walser r ( 2001 ) phys rev lett 87:120406 ; kokkelmans sj , milstein jn , chiofalo ml , walser r , holland mj ( 2003 ) phys rev a 65:053617 kinast j , turlapov a , thomas je ( 2005 ) phys rev lett 94:170404 wright mj , _ \n et al_.

{"ContextTokens": 1475, "GeneratedTokens": 74, "SynthesizedBody": "the arches cluster is one of the most massive young star clusters found in the milky way . \n the total stellar mass is estimated to be @xmath1 , with a central stellar density of @xmath2 ( figer et al . \n located at a projected distance of only 25 pc from the galactic center ( gc ) , it evolves under extreme physical conditions . as the formation of massive stars ( @xmath3 ) \n is proposed to be strongly dependent on high stellar and gas densities ( behrend & maeder 2001 , bonnell et al . \n 1998 ) , star clusters close to the gc are important test beds for star formation ( sf ) scenarios in dense regions . displaying the highest stellar density found in a massive young cluster ( yc ) in the milky way , the arches cluster is a unique object for the comparison with massive sf models . due to the proximity to the gc , strong tidal forces act towards the disruption of the cluster entity , causing the timescale for dynamical evolution to be short , which may lead to the dissolution of the cluster within @xmath4 ( kim et al . \n 1999 , portegies zwart et al . \n 2002 ) . with an age of only @xmath5 myr ( figer et al . \n 2002 , in prep . ) \n , the stellar population of the arches cluster should be mostly unaffected by stellar evolution , but the spatial appearance of the cluster should reflect the fast dynamical evolution . \n we analyse high - resolution adaptive optics ( ao ) @xmath6 and @xmath7-band observations of the arches cluster center obtained during the gemini north science verification ( sv ) with the university of hawaii ao system hokupaa ( graves et al . 2000 ) . \n these data are compared to hst / nicmos observations of the same field obtained by figer et al . \n ( 1999 ) . in uncrowded regions , the spatial resolution and limiting magnitudes in both datasets are comparable given a 3 to 4 times longer integration time in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , for the gemini observations . \n in crowded regions , the ao data are limited by uncompensated seeing haloes from bright stars caused by the low strehl ratio of only a few percent in the gemini sv data . \n these haloes locally decrease the detection efficiency of faint sources . \n evidence for this is seen at the faint end of the colour - magnitude diagrams and in the mf of the dense cluster center . \n the @xmath8 colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are shown in fig . \n 1 . the dominant feature in the cmds is the arches main sequence ( ms ) . due to the low strehl ratio in the gemini data \n , the upper part of the ms , corresponding to the bright population in the cluster center , appears less confined than in the nicmos cmd . \n the fainter stars , not detected in the cluster center due to crowding , show a large scatter towards redder colours , which is caused by a strong colour gradient observed over the arches field . \n the colour trend is apparent in both datasets , with increasingly red stellar colours observed at increasing radii ( fig . \n 2 ) . the change in @xmath9 corresponds to an increase in visual extinction of @xmath10 mag ( @xmath11 , rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) ) . \n the well confined main sequence at the bright end of the cmd shows that the innermost cluster center ( @xmath12 , 0.2 pc at 8 kpc distance ) is unaffected by this colour trend . \n this suggests that the remaining dust and gas has been expelled from the cluster center by winds and/or photoevaporation from the massive stars . \n after correction for the extinction variation , a 2 myr isochrone from the geneva basic set of stellar evolution models ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) has been used to transform @xmath13-band magnitudes into stellar masses . \n the resulting mf ( fig . \n 3 ) displays a slope of @xmath0 in the mass range @xmath14 in the gemini as well as the hst dataset . \n this slope is flatter than the salpeter slope of @xmath15 , often assumed to be universal in young star forming regions . \n when neglecting the colour trend , we derive a mf slope as flat as @xmath16 . \n this clearly shows that the changes in extinction in sf regions are not negligible when deriving mass functions . \n the flat mf observed in arches indicates an overdensity of high - mass stars as compared to other sf regions , thereby supporting models predicting enhanced high - mass sf in dense regions . \n we have analysed the stellar population at different radii from the cluster center to derive the radial variation in the mf ( fig . \n 4 ) . the mf slope appears very flat in the cluster center , where stellar and gas densities are highest , and increases with increasing radius . while mainly massive stars are found in the central part of arches , an increasing number of faint , low - mass stars is found in the cluster outskirts , indicating mass segregation . to exclude that the derived variation is due to crowding \n , incompleteness simulations have been performed in each radial bin , shown as dotted lines in figs . 3 and 4 . \n although incompleteness begins to affect the mf earlier in the cluster center ( @xmath17 ) , the corrected mf remains very flat for @xmath18 . from the distribution of stellar masses \n , we can obtain a rough estimate of the relaxation timescale , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass within the half - mass radius @xmath21 , @xmath22 the characteristic mass , and n the number of stars ( binney & tremain 1987 ) . \n we obtain @xmath23 and observe @xmath24 as a lower limit to the total mass . \n the median mass within @xmath21 is measured to be @xmath25 . assuming a total mass of at least @xmath26 leads to @xmath27 . a characteristic mass of @xmath28 , more typical for sf regions , yields @xmath29 . \n with @xmath30 being on the same order of magnitude as the age of arches , it is impossible to discrimate between primordial and dynamical mass segregation . \n the radial variation in the mf of the arches cluster as well as the flat integrated mass function support massive cluster and star formation models , suggesting high - mass stars to form in dense cluster environments . \n although the radial variation in the mf strongly suggests mass segregation in arches to be present , the short dynamical timescales , strongly influenced by the gc tidal field , prohibit discrimination between primordial and dynamical segregation effects . \n the close similarity of the mass functions obtained from the gemini ao and the hst datasets reveal that high - resolution ground - based ao data are capable to produce comparable physical results as space - based observations - in particular in dense regions where spatial resolution is essential .", "StartTimeOffset": 420787203894, "RequestID": "20c7e9ef1a91b9add7f8213b47dc8e6f24b88fb0", "TotalTokens": 1549}

{"ContextTokens": 3862, "GeneratedTokens": 78, "SynthesizedBody": "it has long been known that an inflationary phase in the very early universe sources a background of gravitational waves . \n the amplitude of this background is tightly constrained by cosmic microwave background [ cmb ] data @xcite placing nontrivial constraints on the inflationary parameter space @xcite . \n the temperature anisotropy of the cmb is measured with much higher accuracy than the polarization anisotropy ( although constraints on the latter are rapidly improving @xcite ) but ultimately polarization measurements will provide the strongest constraints on the primordial tensor background @xcite . the amplitude of this signal is strongly correlated with the physical scale of inflation , and there is no guarantee that inflation occurs at a high enough scale for this primordial signal to be observable , even in an ideal experiment . in the longer term \n , space - based interferometers might make direct detection of this background at wavelengths of thousands or even millions of kilometers , but these comoving scales still left the horizon a number of e - folds before inflation ended . \n recently , substantial attention has been paid to physical processes at the end of inflation which generate gravitational waves  either preheating @xcite , or hawking radiation from primordial black holes @xcite . \n in contrast to the usual inflationary signal , these backgrounds are sharply peaked , and have frequencies corresponding to `` laboratory '' ( or , at their lowest , solar system ) scales , as opposed to the astrophysical scales associated with the cmb . \n their amplitude can be substantial , but the technical challenges associated with the detection of high frequency gravitational waves suggest that it may be some time before these backgrounds are directly constrained . \n conversely , these backgrounds are sensitive to physical processes occurring at the end of inflation , and the coupling between the inflaton field(s ) and the rest of the matter sector , and could provide a unique window into the primordial universe . \n parametric resonance and preheating following inflation has been studied in great detail : see , for example @xcite and references therein . \n preheating as a source of gravitational waves was first discussed by khlebnikov and tkachev @xcite , and the topic was revived by easther and lim @xcite in 2006 , who discussed the scaling relationships between the gravitational wave signal and the inflationary scale , confirmed in @xcite . \n at least three other groups have developed codes for computing signal @xcite , which is a nontrivial numerical problem , and there is excellent agreement between them @xcite , although the internal workings of the codes differ significantly . consider a toy model comprised of a _ classical _ inflaton @xmath0 coupled to a second field @xmath1 with lagrangian @xmath2 the equation of motion for @xmath1 is @xmath3 expanding @xmath1 in terms of its momentum ( fourier ) modes we obtain @xmath4 as inflation ends , @xmath0 oscillates about zero . if we ignore the expansion of the universe @xmath5 and @xmath0 oscillates with constant amplitude @xmath6 , although backreaction from @xmath1 particle creation extracts energy from the @xmath0 field , eventually terminating resonance . \n changing variables to @xmath7 turns ( [ eomkmode ] ) into a mathieu equation , @xmath8 where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath9 . \n every solution to mathieu s equation has two parts , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is periodic and @xmath12 isthe _ \n mathieu characteristic exponent_. if @xmath12 has an imaginary part the solution has an exponentially growing mode . \n figure [ fig : stabilitychart ] shows the values of @xmath13 as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . \n we see that ( [ mathieuparameters ] ) requires @xmath16 , so we are interested in the parameter values that lie to the left of the diagonal line in figure  [ fig : stabilitychart ] . \n .[fig : stabilitychart],width=264 ]    the amplification of selected @xmath17 ( and , by backreaction , @xmath18 ) makes the universe increasingly inhomogeneous , yielding an inhomogeneous , time dependent energy density  which necessarily leads to the emission of gravitational radiation . ultimately , the only way to follow the full evolution is via numerical simulation , and then extracting the contribution to the tensor modes .    the stress - energy tensor associated with gravitational radiation is given by @xcite @xmath19 and is specific to the _ transverse - traceless _ part of the metric perturbation . \n the @xmath20 denotes a spatial average and since we are solve for the field values ( and @xmath21 ) numerically , we simply integrate over the full `` grid '' on which our numerical solutions are computed . the associated energy energy density is the @xmath22 component , @xmath23 we compute @xmath21 by extracting the source terms for the equations of motion obeyed by the @xmath24 from the full @xmath25 obtained from numerical solutions of the scalar field dynamics @xcite . \n we express the gravitational wave power in terms of its contribution to the fractional energy density in gravitational waves , @xmath26 , per logarithmic interval in wavenumber , @xmath27 which we then convert in present - day units via an appropriate matching condition @xcite . \n field at three times , with an arbitrary normalization . \n gravitational waves are induced by ( time varying ) spatial gradients , which peak in the middle frame.[fig : field],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   field at three times , with an arbitrary normalization . \n gravitational waves are induced by ( time varying ) spatial gradients , which peak in the middle frame.[fig : field],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   field at three times , with an arbitrary normalization . \n gravitational waves are induced by ( time varying ) spatial gradients , which peak in the middle frame.[fig : field],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]        the resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sharply peaked , and located at very high frequencies when compared to both suspected astrophysical sources , and current and future interferometric experiments . \n the gravitational wave background depends on the details of the resonance bands in the underlying cosmological model , and modes move in and out of resonance bands as the universe expands . for the example considered here , \n the lowest lying resonance band is dominant . \n modes whose physical wavenumber @xmath28 never enter this region during preheating are not significantly amplified , resulting in the cutoff we see at high frequencies in figure  [ fig : power ] .    in this model ( and many resonant scenarios ) , the resonant modes are not vastly smaller than the post - inflationary hubble scale . \n if the universe promptly reheats to the gut scale the comoving post - inflationary hubble scale is mapped to centimeter scales in the present universe , and the spectrum peaks near ghz scales . if the inflationary scale is _ lowered \n _ , the signal appears at lower frequencies , because the growth of the universe between the present day and the preheating epoch is necessarily smaller @xcite  and if the energy scale is very low ( closer to the tev scale than the gut scale ) , a background of gravitational waves generated during preheating would provide an alternative target for experiments like bbo . \n the amplitude of this signal does not necessarily change with the inflationary energy scale . only the gradient terms of the scalar field which source the gravitational wave background , and in many preheating scenarios the gradient energy rises until its average value is similar to that of the kinetic and potential energies . at fixed density this amplitude of the source terms \n are thus maximized . \n conversely , the _ initial _ power generated will decrease with the inflationary scale , since the quadruple and higher moments will be smaller . \n however , the overall expansion of the universe between preheating and the present day is also reduced in these scenarios . \n the energy density in gravitational waves scales like radiation , so @xmath29  and the combination of these two factors cancels , leading to a maximal amplitude of @xmath30  a number also seen in bubble collision calculations @xcite . \n a second , and more recently explored , mechanism which may generate gravitational waves in the post - inflationary universe is hawking radiation from decaying primordial black holes [ pbh ] @xcite . \n this analysis focusses on very small black holes , which decay before the onset of nucleosynthesis , and whose initial abundance is otherwise very weakly constrained . \n it has long been recognized that gravitons would be emitted as these black holes decay , although the precise rate is significantly modified by grey body corrections @xcite . \n assume a pbh population whose mass is equal to the energy contained inside the hubble volume at the instant they collapse . \n recalling that @xmath31 , and defining @xmath32 , @xmath33 which is the mass contained inside a sphere of radius @xmath34 . \n including grey body corrections @xmath35 a schwarzschild black hole emits ( massless ) particles with momentum @xmath36 , reducing its total energy as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the _ effective _ number of ( bosonic ) degrees of freedom , after integrating over grey body corrections @xcite . here \n @xmath36 is the _ physical _ wavenumber and the black hole lifetime is @xmath39 an upper bound on @xmath40 comes from the inflationary energy scale , which is constrained by the non - detection of a primordial gravitational wave background in the cmb . since we are interested in black holes which decay prior to nucleosynthesis with time to spare for thermalization , we need @xmath41  s. with @xmath42  gev , @xmath43  s , and the initial temperature is @xmath44  tev . \n standard model states alone give @xmath45 . \n @xmath46 with ( from left to right ) @xmath47 , and @xmath48 gev . in all cases \n @xmath49 and @xmath50 . , width=288 ] \n the mass - fraction of pbh is denoted @xmath51 . \n initially @xmath52 . \n we assume @xmath53 and that the remaining matter consists of radiation . denoting the number density of pbh by @xmath54 , the energy density @xmath55 we get the following set of equations @xmath56^{1/2 } \\ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] along with equation  ( [ eqn : kt ] ) from which one obtains @xmath57 by an appropriate rescaling . \n we again express our results in terms of the present - day spectral energy density of gravitational radiation @xcite . \n figure  [ fig : e ] shows the present - day power in gravitational radiation as a function of @xmath40 . \n the gravitational wave power is substantial , and found at very high frequencies , relative both to any preheating signal , and the electromagnetic radiation in the cmb . roughly speaking \n , the temperature of the universe scales as @xmath58 . \n a decaying black hole is much hotter than the surrounding universe , but the emitted gravitational waves are redshifted by the same factor as other radiation . \n consequently , these gravitational waves will necessarily have a higher frequency than the present - day cmb , which peaks around @xmath59  ghz . \n lowering @xmath40 increases the pbh lifetime , enhancing this discrepancy and pushing the gravitational wave signal to higher ( present day ) frequencies . \n the signal also depends on @xmath38 and @xmath60 , as explained in @xcite . \n these primordial black holes survive for many hubble times , and since their density scales like matter , even a small initial population can lead to a universe that undergoes a transient period of matter domination before the black holes decay , which then rethermalizes the universe . \n the additional phenomenology arising from any such matter dominated stage has not been fully explored , and remains a topic for future enquiry . \n i have reviewed two different mechanisms for generating gravitational waves at the end of inflation  via parametric resonance or preheating , and graviton emission from decaying primordial black holes . \n physically these mechanisms are very different  the first is driven by the higher moments of the matter distribution and thus operates in the purely classical limit . \n conversely , hawking radiation is intrinsically quantum mechanical , and would not take place if @xmath61 . \n however , both mechanisms depend critically on the detailed behavior of the universe makes the transition between inflationary and `` regular '' expansion . \n parametric resonance and preheating depends sensitively on the couplings between the inflaton and other particles , whereas primordial black holes only form in models with a sharp rise in the primordial perturbation spectrum as inflation comes to an end .    in most cases , the frequencies of these gravitational wave backgrounds far exceed those which modern experiments such as ligo or virgo , and space - based successors such as lisa , are designed to detect . consequently , if meaningful constraints are to be placed on the backgrounds , new detector technologies are likely to be required . \n the one exception to this statement is if preheating occurs after low scale ( ie tev ) inflation , in which case the gravitational wave signal could be visible in proposed space - based interferometric detectors . \n this is particularly relevant to bbo , which has been designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave signal generated during gut scale inflation . \n this signal is invisible in low scale models , and the preheating signal provides an alternative source for a stochastic background , widening the set of inflationary models a bbo style experiment would constrain .    finally , it is clear that these signals are all `` futuristic '' in that placing meaningful constraints on their amplitude would require second or third generation gravitational wave experiments , and at the time of writing no direct gravitational wave detections have been reported . however , from a philosophical standpoint they serve to underline the rich phenomenology that can be associated with inflationary models , and the importance of fully exploring their consequences and possible observable fingerprints . \n r.  easther , j.  t. giblin , and e.  a. lim , phys . rev . * \n d77 * , 103519 ( 2008 ) , 0712.2991 . \n r.  anantua , r.  easther , and j.  giblin , john  t. , ( 2008 ) , 0812.0825 . \n quad , m.  l. brown _ et  al . \n _ , ( 2009 ) , 0906.1003 . \n wmap , e.  komatsu _ et  al . \n _ , astrophys . j. suppl . * 180 * , 330 ( 2009 ) , 0803.0547 . \n h.  v. peiris and r.  easther , jcap * 0807 * , 024 ( 2008 ) , 0805.2154 . \n h.  c. chiang _ \n _ , ( 2009 ) , 0906.1181 . \n cmbpol study team , d.  baumann _ et  al . \n _ , ( 2008 ) , 0811.3919 . \n r.  easther and e.  a. lim , jcap * 0604 * , 010 ( 2006 ) , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3274, "GeneratedTokens": 78, "SynthesizedBody": "over the past several months , many results on event - by - event fluctuation and correlation observables have been made available by experiments at the sps and at rhic . \n this article will review the most recent results on three of these observables : net charge fluctuations , balance functions in pseudorapidity , and average transverse momentum fluctuations . \n each of these observables is designed to probe a specific property of the system : net charge fluctuations are sensitive to the charge distribution within the collision volume , balance functions are sensitive to the hadronization time of the system , and average @xmath0 fluctuations are sensitive to critical fluctuations of the temperature of the system which may be present during a phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . however , as with any measurement , the results can be contaminated by known processes such as charge conservation , resonance decays , elliptic flow , or even hard scattering processes . \n therefore , the contribution of any known processes must be thoroughly examined prior to formulating a reliable interpretation of the results . \n detailed background information on the theory behind various event - by - event observables can be found in other recent reviews @xcite . \n a promising signature for the presence of a qgp is the observation of event - by - event fluctuations in the net charge of produced particles . \n it is hypothesized that fluctuations in the net charge would be significantly reduced in a qgp scenario . \n this is due to the fact that in a qgp , the fractional electric charges of the quarks are more evenly spread throughout the qgp volume than the unit electric charges of the hadrons in a hadronic gas volume . as a result \n , the fluctuations of the net charge in a given region of phase - space would be significantly reduced in a qgp @xcite . \n there has been much debate on the choice of the most appropriate observable to quote for the magnitude of net charge fluctuations . \n a standard is yet to be agreed upon in the literature , so phenix @xcite quotes the normalized net charge variance , @xmath1 , star @xcite quotes a measure for dynamical fluctuations , @xmath2 , and na49 @xcite quotes the variable @xmath3 . \n the latter will be quoted here . \n fortunately , all of the variables listed above can be related to each other with some very reasonable assumptions @xcite . \n the baseline for the measurement of net charge fluctuations is that of independent particle emission ( where @xmath1 = 1.0 , @xmath2 = 0.0 , and @xmath4 = 0.0 ) . \n predictions for the magnitudes of these three fluctuation variables for a variety of physical scenarios are listed in table 1 . \n keep in mind that these values are valid only for small samplings of the total number of produced charged particles since charge conservation can contribute to any observed fluctuations . \n net charge fluctuation measurements can be corrected for charge conservation based upon the fraction of the total number of particles in the sample as follows @xcite : @xmath5    @lllll scenario&v(q)&@xmath2 ( star)&@xmath2 ( phenix ) & @xmath4 + independent emission&1.0&0.0&0.0&0.0 + resonance gas&0.75&-0.0013&-0.006&-0.125 + quark coalescence&0.83&-0.0008&-0.004&-0.084 + quark -

by - event fluctuations in the average transverse momentum may be sensitive to temperature fluctuations near the qcd tri - critical point @xcite . \n there have been many recent results from the sps ( na49 @xcite and ceres @xcite ) and rhic ( phenix @xcite and star @xcite ) experiments . \n all experiments report a positive signal of non - random fluctuations , each with an apparent maximum in mid - peripheral collisions , as shown in figure 3 . as with the charge fluctuation measurements , \n a standard observable has not been agreed upon in the literature , and each experiment quotes a different variable to describe the magnitude of the fluctuations : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . \n fortunately , the variables can all be related with very reasonable assumptions @xcite . \n all of the variables measure the difference in the width of the event - by - event average @xmath23 distribution , @xmath24 , from a random expectation , which can be expressed as a gamma distribution that is directly calculable using the inclusive @xmath23 and number of particles per event , n , distributions @xcite . \n since a positive signal is observed and confirmed , contributions to the signal from known sources should first be studied . \n the various analyses have addressed this with respect to contributions from hbt , resonance decays , and elliptic flow . \n the contributions from all of these sources have been found to be very small or negligible , each confirmed by independent analyses . \n another possible source to the signal is that from hard scattering processes , which would be expected to produce correlations in @xmath23 with a stronger contribution at higher @xmath23 . in this context , \n both phenix and ceres observe that the majority of the contribution to the non - random fluctuations occur at high @xmath23 . \n phenix observes a large 243% increase in the signal when the maximum of the @xmath23 range over which the average @xmath23 is calculated increases from 1.0 to 2.0 gev / c . \n this very large increase can not be attributed to number fluctuations since the number of particles increases by less than 15% over that range .    in order to investigate possible contributions due to jet production \n , phenix has applied a two - component model consisting of 1 ) a simulation of soft processes by reproducing the inclusive @xmath23 and n distributions as a function of centrality , and 2 ) a simulation of hard scattering processes by embedding pythia jet events at a given rate per produced particle in step 1 ( while strictly conserving the n distribution so as not to introduce unnecessary number fluctuations ) . \n the simulation is performed as a function of centrality within the detector acceptance in two modes : a ) with the pythia event embedding rate kept constant for all centralities , and b ) with the pythia event embedding rate scaled by the nuclear modification factor , @xmath25 , for each centrality bin . \n the result of the simulation superimposed with the phenix data is shown in the bottom plot of figure 3 . \n the simulation with the @xmath25-scaled rate agrees with the centrality - dependent ( and also the @xmath23-dependent @xcite ) data trends remarkably well . within this simulation , the decrease of fluctuations in the most peripheral collisions \n is attributed to the fact that the signal begins to compete with the magnitude of the number fluctuations , while most of the decrease of fluctuations in the most central collisions can be attributed to the onset of jet suppression . when the simulation is performed at @xmath6 = 130 gev within the star acceptance with the same pythia event embedding rate that reproduces the phenix data , agreement with the star \n more central data is achieved within errors . \n the simulation predicts a 15 - 20% increase in the fluctuation signal from star at @xmath6 = 200 gev . \n although the jet production cross section is much reduced at sps energies , it is non - zero , and there may also be a residual jet contribution present . \n the identical simulation performed at @xmath6 = 17 gev within the na49 acceptance can also reproduce the trend of the na49 data as a function of centrality \n .    a promising method in which to directly compare the fluctuation measurements from all four experiments is to estimate the magnitude of any residual event - by - event temperature fluctuations present using the prescription outlined in @xcite . \n the most central fluctuation values thus correspond to temperature fluctuations of 1.8% in phenix , 1.7% in star , 1.3% in ceres , and 0.6% in na49 . \n the residual temperature fluctuations are small and do not significantly increase between sps and rhic energies . \n alternative interpretations of the observed average @xmath23 signal have been presented . \n one such interpretation is that the signal may be due to the onset of thermal equilibrium within the system @xcite . \n this model is successful in reproducing both the centrality - dependence of the fluctuation signal and the inclusive @xmath26 distributions from star and phenix . \n fluctuations as a function of centrality for a ) @xmath6 = 17 gev pb+pb collisions from na49 @xcite , b ) @xmath6 = 130 gev au+au collisions from star @xcite , and c ) @xmath6 = 200 gev au+au collisions from phenix @xcite . the error bars include statistical and systematic errors . \n the curves are the results of a model that estimates the relative contribution due to jet production as a function of centrality @xcite for a fixed pythia event embedding rate ( dashed lines ) and for an @xmath25-scaled embedding rate ( solid lines ) . \n uncertainties on the simulation are 0.3 mev / c for na49 , 2.1 mev / c for star , and 1.0 mev / c for phenix . \n [ fig:3 ] ] \n there has been nearly a doubling in the quantity of preliminary or published results on event -

particles which interact only weakly in the bulk can segregate and form two - dimensional clusters once they are captured by the interface ( see fig . \n [ fig : experiment ] ) . \n the appearance of additional interface induced features in the interaction between colloidal particles can be expected from analogous phenomena at interfaces of simple fluids  @xcite which , however , still pose unresolved challenges in understanding  @xcite . in liquid crystals the situation is even more complicated . \n the director deformations extend into the nematic phase , i.  e. , in addition to interfacial energies , the bulk elasticity contributes to the total free energy of the system . \n the effective surface tension ( provided it can be introduced in the first place ) depends on the orientation of the director , which in turn varies along the interface . \n the boundary conditions for the director at the particle surfaces give rise to topological defects accompanying the particles . in order to minimize the free energy associated with the director distortions as well as the free energy of the defect cores , the defects often merge with the isotropic phase  @xcite or with each other . \n the combination of the above - mentioned effects enriches the phenomena significantly but complicates their theoretical understanding enormously : expressions for the director field , the free energy , or force - distance profiles can hardly be obtained analytically . \n numerical calculations are also not straightforward because the interfacial width and the size of the defect cores are normally much smaller that the size of the colloidal particle , so that there are several rather different length - scales involved \n . therefore significant computational efforts involving finite - element methods with adaptive meshes are required to address even static problems  @xcite .    in the following \n we study the interaction of two long parallel cylindrical colloids trapped at a ( initially ) flat nematic - isotropic interface . \n we find that their effective interaction is rather complex : the force - distance profiles can exhibit jumps and hysteresis upon approach or separation . \n the particles can either repel or attract each other depending on the material parameters and the geometry . \n finally , we propose a simple effective pair potential which can be exploited to study clustering and self - organization of colloids at ni interfaces . \n two identical colloidal particles , each of which we take to be a long cylinder of radius @xmath1 with the symmetry axis parallel to the @xmath2 axis , are immersed into a nematic liquid crystal at a separation @xmath3 , see fig . \n [ fig : geometry ] . \n the nematic order parameter tensor at the boundaries is fixed in a such a way that without the colloids a flat nematic - isotropic interface is formed at @xmath4 . \n the order parameter at the top wall is fixed to zero ;

@xmath21 . \n we consider both rigid homeotropic and finite anchoring boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces . in the latter case \n the surface free energy density is taken as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the anchoring coefficient and @xmath24 is the preferred tensor order parameter at the colloid surface with @xmath25 as the unit vector along the easy axis direction .    for the constants entering the free energy density ( eq . \n ( [ eq : nem_free_en ] ) ) we use typical values for a nematic compound 5cb  @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . \n the choices for @xmath12 will be given below . \n the nematic - isotropic transition temperature for 5cb is @xmath31 . at coexistence the nematic coherence length ( \n i.e. , the thickness of the nematic - isotropic interface ) is @xmath32 which sets the smallest length - scale of our description . \n the equilibrium distribution of the tensor order parameter @xmath33 is obtained by minimizing the free energy functional  ( [ eq : nem_free_en ] ) numerically using finite elements with adaptive meshing . \n the area @xmath34 is triangulated and the functions @xmath33 are linearly interpolated within each triangle . \n for this case we chose the anisotropy of the elastic constants as @xmath35 , favoring director alignment parallel to the ni interface and in the plane @xmath36 . \n we use rigid homeotropic boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces . upon minimizing the free energy we have identified two stable orientational configurations . at sufficiently large separations \n @xmath3 both colloids are accompanied by a defect of strength @xmath37 ( fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](b ) ) . \n if the particles move closer , the two defects merge and form a single , but rather extended , defect positioned between the colloids ( fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](a ) ) . \n we have also observed three metastable configurations . \n here either one of the defects , fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](c ) , or even both defects , fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](d ) and ( e ) , merge with the isotropic phase : the system is trying to reduce its free energy by annihilating the defects . \n however , the interface has to bend and almost wrap the particles in order to reach the defects . \n this of course increases the interfacial energy , which is roughly proportional to the area of the interface . for small separations , among the metastable configurations only the one shown in fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](c ) is possible : due to strong anchoring at the particle surfaces the nematic phase forms a bridge between the particles , preventing the isotropic phase from reaching also the second defect . for larger separations , \n the isotropic phase can extend partially around the colloids and merge with the second defect . \n this can occur asymmetrically , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](d ) , or symmetrically , see fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](e ) . \n the effective pair potential @xmath38 defined as the free energy per length of the colloidal particles is presented in fig .  [ fig : energy_planar ] . in all cases \n the particles repel each other . the branch of @xmath38 which corresponds to the _ stable _ configurations , reveals practically no breaks in slope , even though at @xmath39 the director field around the particles changes abruptly between the configurations ( a ) and ( b ) . \n however , if one of the metastable configurations is present in the system , transitions between different branches can occur giving rise to jumps and hysteresis in the force - distance curves upon particle approach / separation . \n the choice @xmath40 for the anisotropy of the elastic constants favors director alignment perpendicular to the ni interface in the plane @xmath36 . in this case \n we have found only two , stable configurations . \n the first one , containing a defect , is shown in fig . \n [ fig : config_hom](a ) \n . it occurs at small separations , where the nematic bridge between the particles forces the director to be parallel to the interface . \n the other configuration has no defects , because the nematic bridge with director orientation parallel to the interface disappears and the defect merges with the isotropic phase . \n the corresponding effective potential @xmath38 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : energy_hom ] . as in the previous case , \n the particles repel each other at small separations where there are large director distortions in the inter - particle region . \n however , contrary to the case with planar anchoring , there is a strong attraction between the particles for @xmath41 , where the configuration with the defect is stable . \n the branch without the defect results in weak repulsion , as for planar anchoring . \n minimization of the free energy is a computationally expensive task , which can not be used , for example , to calculate the forces on the particles each time their positions are advanced using molecular dynamics or monte - carlo algorithms for their kinetics . \n use of effective potentials is a typical solution to this problem . in order to find such an appropriate potential \n we have calculated the free energy per unit length for particles of different radii , @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 . \n since colloids are rather small , the finite director anchoring at the particle surfaces has to be taken into account . \n we have used a value appropriate for 5cb on a polymer surface  @xcite , @xmath44 ; for this energy the dimensionless anchoring parameter @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath46 . \n minimization results for both planar and homeotropic anchoring of the director at the interface are shown in fig . \n [ fig : energy_fit ] ( a ) and ( b ) . \n the strong repulsion close to contact ( @xmath47 ) has become smoother for planar and disappeared for homeotropic anchoring at the interface , due to the finite director anchoring at the colloid surfaces . \n it turns out that in both cases the following shape of the potential fits the numerical data very well : @xmath48 , & 0 \\le d \\le d_c \\\\ u(\\infty ) + u_0 \\bigl ( \\exp   \\left [ -\\alpha \\left ( { d}/{\\xi }   \\right)^{-\\beta } \\right ] - 1\\bigr ) , & d > \n d_c , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq : fit}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are ( positive ) fitting parameters . \n the first part of the potential ( @xmath50 ) describes a simple harmonic - type attraction between the particles , which we observed for the _ homeotropic _ anchoring ; for _ planar _ interfacial anchoring @xmath51 . in the case of homeotropic anchoring @xmath52 \n is a critical distance at which the defect annihilates ( see figs . \n [ fig : config_hom ] and [ fig : energy_hom ] ) . \n we have no analytical support for the functional form of the effective potential ( [ eq : fit ] ) . \n however , qualitatively , the effective interaction of the colloidal particles in a bulk nematic phase is known to exhibit a power - law decay at large distances  @xcite . in our case , \n the leading term of the expansion for @xmath53 is indeed @xmath54 . on the other hand , if two colloids are sufficientlly close , so that the regions where the _ order parameter _ changes from their surface to the bulk value start to overlap , and where the defects ( if present ) interact with each other and the particles  @xcite , the functional form of the potential changes . normally , the distortions of the order parameter relax exponentially ( similar to the variations of the order parameter through the nematic - isotropic interface ) resulting in an exponentially varying strength of the interaction . \n this is also captured qualitatively by the potential given in eq . \n ( [ eq : fit ] ) .    the fitting curves are also shown in fig . \n [ fig : energy_fit ] ( a ) and ( b ) . for planar anchoring @xmath55 ; for homeotropic anchoring @xmath56 , i.  e. , in both cases the interaction potential is long - ranged . in case of homeotropic anchoring there is a critical size of colloidal particles ( of the order of interfacial width ) below which the discontinuous structural transition between the configurations with and without the defect disappears . \n similar phenomena , named capillary bridging , can be observed in granular materials , liquid crystals , and binary mixtures  @xcite . in all cases , \n one of the phases ( otherwise metastable in the bulk ) condenses out and forms a bridge between the particles . \n this transition is discontinuous and ends in a critical point for small particle radii . in our case , the nematic phase located between the isotropic phase and the defect forms a bridge between the particles and results in their attraction . \n in conclusion , within the landau - de gennes formalism we have studied the effective pair interaction between two cylindrical parallel colloids trapped at the nematic - isotropic interface . \n this pairwise interparticle force depends sensitively on the radii of colloids , the orientation of the director at the ni interface , and the anchoring strength , i.e. , the nematic elasticity is an essential ingredient of the interaction . \n the formation or annihilation of defects influences the effective pair potential \n . it also changes the repulsive character of the interaction at large separations to an attractive one at intermediate or small separations . \n therefore , one should expect that many - body interactions are relevant to describe collective colloidal ordering at the interface . \n another implication of our work is that the interface is able to rearrange the nucleation centers of , for example , phase - separating polymer network and help to design composite materials of extraordinary properties .", "StartTimeOffset": 445509343254, "RequestID": "9ee4d17362185a736ef8ed74f6c703dbe2e16ce3", "TotalTokens": 3550}
{"ContextTokens": 3983, "GeneratedTokens": 255, "SynthesizedBody": "experiments such as macho @xcite and point - agape @xcite have detected microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the m31 , supporting the view that some fraction of the milky way dark halo may be comprised of massive astronomical compact halo objects ( machos ) . the fraction of the dark halo mass in machos , as well as the nature of these lensing objects and their individual masses can be constrained to some extent by combining observations of microlensing events with analytical models of the dark halo ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n however , the real dark halo might not be as simple as in analytical models , which typically have spherical or azimuthal symmetry and , in particular , smoothly distributed matter . \n cosmological simulations indicate that dark matter haloes are _ neither _ isotropic nor homogeneous but are rather triaxial ( e.g. @xcite ) and contain a notable amount of substructure ( e.g. @xcite ) . even for the milky way it is still unclear if the enveloping dark matter halo has spherical or triaxial morphology : a detailed investigation of the tidal tail of the sgr dwarf galaxy supports the notion of a nearly spherical galactic potential ( @xcite ; @xcite ) whereas that the data are also claimed to be consistent with a prolate or oblate halo @xcite . \n the shape of the halo has an effect on the predicted number of microlenses along different lines - of - sight , for comparison with the results of microlensing experiments .    in this paper \n , we examine the effects of dark halo morphology and dark halo clumpiness on microlensing surveys conducted by hypothetical observers located in eight @xmath0-body dark matter haloes formed fully self - consistently in cosmological simulations of the concordance  model . \n the eight haloes are scaled to approximately match the milky way s dark halo in mass and rotation curve properties , and hypothetical observers are placed on the surface of a `` solar sphere '' ( i.e. 8.5 kpc from the dark halo s centre ) from where they conduct microlensing experiments along lines - of - sight simulating the sun s line - of - sight to the lmc . \n the effects on microlensing of triaxiality and clumping in the haloes are examined . \n the paper expands upon work in a study by @xcite although we take a slightly different point of view . instead of studying the errors caused by different analytical models fitted to an @xmath0-body halo , we analyse the microlensing survey properties of the simulated haloes directly . \n that is , we do not try to gauge the credibility of analytical microlensing descriptions but rather use our self - consistent haloes for the _ inverse problem in microlensing _ @xcite . in other words , the free parameters ( the macho mass and the fraction of matter in machos ) are determined from the observations via the optical depth , event duration and event rate predictions of the models . \n this not only allows us to make predictions for these parameters based upon fully self - consistent halo models but also to investigate the importance of shape and substructure content of the haloes . \n the paper is structured as follows . \n we describe the @xmath0-body haloes and their preparation in section 2 , the simulation details are covered in section 3 , equations for the observables are derived in section 4 , results are given in section 5 , some discussion is presented in section 6 , final conclusions are in section 7 . \n our analysis is based on a suite of eight high - resolution  simulations @xcite carried out using the publicly available adaptive mesh refinement code ` mlapm `  @xcite in a standard cosmology ( @xmath11 ) . \n each run focuses on the formation and evolution of galaxy cluster sized object containing of order one million collisionless , dark matter particles , with mass resolution @xmath12  and force resolution @xmath132  ( of order 0.05% of the host s virial radius ) . \n the simulations have sufficient resolution to follow the orbits of satellites within the very central regions of the host potential ( @xmath14 510 % of the virial radius ) and the time resolution to resolve the satellite orbits with good accuracy ( snapshots are stored with a temporal spacing of @xmath15 170 myr ) . \n such temporal resolution provides of order 10 - 20 timesteps per orbit per satellite galaxy , thus allowing these simulations to be used in a previous paper to accurately measure the orbital parameters of each individual satellite galaxy @xcite . \n the clusters were chosen to sample a variety of environments . \n we define the virial radius @xmath16 as the point where the density of the host ( measured in terms of the cosmological background density @xmath17 ) drops below the virial overdensity @xmath18 . \n this choice for @xmath19 is based upon the dissipationless spherical top - hat collapse model and is a function of both cosmological model and time . \n we further applied a lower mass cut for all the satellite galaxies of @xmath20  ( 100 particles ) . \n further specific details of the host haloes , such as masses , density profiles , triaxialities , environment and merger histories , can be found in @xcite and @xcite . \n table  [ halodetails ] gives a summary of a number of relevant global properties of our halo sample . \n there is a prominent spread not only in the number of satellites with mass @xmath21  but also in age , reflecting the different dynamical states of the systems under consideration .    . \n summary of the eight host dark matter haloes . \n the superscript @xmath22 indicates that the values are for the unscaled clusters . \n column 2 shows the virial radius , @xmath16 ; column 3 the virial mass , @xmath23 ; column 4 the redshift of formation , ; column 5 the age in gyr ; and the final column an estimate of the number of satellites ( subhaloes ) in each halo , @xmath24 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n the benefits of using @xmath0-body haloes instead of analytical models are : ( i ) we do not have to make any initial assumptions about the velocity distribution of the matter ( other than limiting the circular velocity to 220 km / s ) , whereas analytical models have to adopt a maxwellian distribution . ( ii ) \n we do not have to make any initial assumptions about the shape of the halo , whereas analytical models are always educated guesses about the shape in form of some given parameters ( e.g. triaxiality , density profile , etc . ) . \n @xcite used a so called microlensing tube to get better number statistics for their event rates , and as they note , this `` distorts the geometry of a realistic microlensing experiment '' . \n however , our solution ( the introduction of subparticles in accordance to the tsc mass assigment scheme ) to the insufficient mass resolution of the cosmological simulation _ preserves _ the geometry . \n the downsides of using @xmath0-body haloes are : ( i ) we assume that the spatial and velocity distribution of machos follows dark matter . \n ( ii ) the clusters we use are not as old as the milky way . \n our models are based upon pure dark matter simulations which may not be appropriate if a significant fraction of the dark matter is composed of machos , since they are composed of baryons , and baryonic physics has been explicitly ignored ! \n we thus implicitly assume that the spatial and velocity distribution of machos follows the respective distributions of the underlying dark matter . \n based upon these assumptions dark satellites comprised of machos would be detectable through excess optical depth values and event duration anomalies in microlensing experiments . \n simulations suggest that the majority of these dark satellites can be located as far as 400 kpc from the halo centre . \n thus , multiple background sources at distances _ over _ 400 kpc would be needed to detect possible dark subhaloes in a milky way sized dark halo . \n for example , point - agape ( @xcite , @xcite ) is a survey that is in principle able to detect even a dark macho satellite , on top of `` free '' machos in the dark halo , because its source , m31 , is distant enough .    from the results \n , we can see that halo # 8 is too young to be used as a milky way dark halo model , but all the other haloes seem to behave well . the fact that halo # 8 consists of three merging smaller haloes explains the peculiar values it produces . \n the other haloes are not experiencing any violent dynamical changes  a requirement we would expect a model of the milky way dark halo to fulfill .    obviously , our macho mass function is a @xmath25-function . \n a more complex function would force us to calculate event durations and rates for individual machos instead of subparticles . in this sense , \n subparticle values are only averages and some of the variation in the observables is lost . \n we chose not to use a complex macho mass function in this study because we wanted to concentrate on the halo structure effects . \n the variations of @xmath6 and @xmath26 would be larger if we would use a macho mass function covering a large range of mass values . \n thus , our results are as conservative as possible , and in real experiments even larger variations of event rates and durations could be expected . \n we recognize the fact that in the macho - lens scenario some of the lensing events towards the lmc could well be assigned to machos within the dark halo of the lmc itself . \n we have excluded the lmc s macho population in this study , but intend to investigate the characteristics and implications of such lens population in a separate , future study . \n our plan is to model the dark matter halo of the lmc with some of the @xmath27 subhalos found near the cores of our @xmath0-body haloes . \n the purpose of this paper is to investigate the main microlensing characteristics of @xmath0-body dark matter haloes , extracted from cosmological simulations and downscaled in size and mass to represent the dark halo of the milky way . \n we argue that analytical halo models are too simplified in a number of ways in the case of microlensing where internal structures ( in density or velocity distributions ) or irregular halo shapes can alter the observed values significantly . \n we find that in general observables behave as expected from analytical models , resulting in fairly consistent values with seven out of the eight haloes with the `` outsider '' being exceptionally young ( 3.42 gyr ) and undergoing a major merger of three smaller entties . as a result , \n this particular halo shows irregular behaviour in all tests and can not be considered as a valid model for the milky way dark halo . \n when individual experiments are examined in detail , we find that triaxiality and substructures can have a large effect on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in some haloes , triaxiality can change the observed values by a factor as large as three . \n substructure within haloes can also change @xmath5 and @xmath6 by a factor of two and furthermore reshape the event duration distribution notably . \n we also use our simulated values together with the macho collaboration s observations to find a preferred halo macho fraction ( @xmath9 ) and individual macho mass ( @xmath10 ) . \n our results are similar to the macho collaboration s own analysis where they used several different analytical models . in our analysis of @xmath9 and @xmath10 \n , the scatter between different microlensing experiments is mainly due to triaxiality and no clear signs of frequent substructure signals can be seen . \n the cosmological simulations used in this paper were carried out on the beowulf cluster at the centre for astrophysics & supercomputing , swinburne university .      the financial support of the australian research council ; the jenny and antti wihuri foundation ; the magnus ehrnrooth foundation ; finnish academy of science and letters , vilho , yrj and kalle visl foundation and the academy of finland are gratefully acknowledged . \n jh gratefully acknowledges the hospitality of swinburne university , where the inital part of this work was performed , with especial thanks to bg , and the astrophysical institute of potsdam with especial thanks to ak . \n 99 alcock c. et al . \n ( macho collaboration ) , 2000 , apj , 542 , 281 belokurov v. et al . \n , 2005 , mnras , 357 , 17b calchi novati s. et al . , 2005 , \n a&a , 443 , 911c cardone v. f. , de ritis r. and marino a. a. , 2001 , a&a , 374 , 494 diemand j. , moore b. , stadel j. , 2004 , mnras , 352 , 535 dubinski , j. 1994 , apj , 431 , 617 evrard , a. e. , summers , f. j. , & davis , m. 1994 , apj , 422 , 11 gao l. , white s. d. m. , jenkins a. , stoehr f. , springel v. , 2004 , mnras , 355 , 819 ghigna s. , moore b. , governato f. , lake g. , quinn t. , stadel j. , 2000 , apj , 544 , 616 gill s. p. d. , knebe a. , gibson b. k. , 2004 , mnras , 351 , 399 gill s. p. d. , knebe a. , gibson b. k. , dopita , m. a. , mnras , 351 , 410 helmi a. , 2004 , mnras , 351 , 643 helmi a. , white s. & springel v. , 2003 , mnras , 339 , 834 hockney r. w. , eastwood j. w. , 1981 , computer simulation using particles . \n mcgraw -

distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes \n is to be established . as originally suggested by acin , cirac and lewenstein @xcite , methods of classical percolation theory @xcite can be employed to find the best strategy for entanglement distribution in a network of particular configuration leading to the notion of classical entanglement percolation . within this notion \n the communication capacity of a network is described by its percolation transition point , before which the probability to establish a path of perfect entanglement links between two remote nodes is exponentially small , while this probability has a finite asymptotic limit right after it . \n since each network configuration relates to the transition point , classical entanglement percolation imposes the fundamental limit on the communication capacity of the network . \n this limit can be overcame by global change of the network configuration with local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite . \n in particular , by implementing locc on a fraction of selected nodes of the network of initial configuration , such as a honeycomb lattice , one may redistribute the entanglement between the nodes of a network of final configuration , e.g. triangular lattice @xcite . \n this quantum network reconfiguration reduces the percolation transition point making quantum communication possible at large scale even with initially insufficient amount of distributed entanglement . \n the price for this advantage is that the selected nodes become disconnected from the network of final configuration . in other words , \n the selected nodes of the initial network must sacrifice their connectivity for communication benefit of the final network . from communication viewpoint , this may not be always appreciated at large scale and especially by the selected nodes . \n in addition , such a strategy can not be implemented on a network of arbitrary initial configuration . for example , given a triangular lattice or a 1d chain there is no way to execute the above procedure . \n here we suggest a different approach to overcome the limitations of the classical entanglement percolation . \n we employ locc to create complex quantum networks with new percolation properties on networks of simple initial configuration . \n our approach is based on multiple applications of locc and is free of sacrificing nodes of the initial network . \n we show , in particular , that the simplest 1d quantum network with the percolation transition point at unity , can be modified to the complex so - called hierarchical network @xcite with the transition point at @xmath0 using at most polynomial number of locc . in the following section \n we show first how to transform the 1d chain into the hierarchical network using locc . \n then , we give an account on physical resources required for the transformation in section  [ sec:3 ] and conclude in section  [ sec:4 ] . \n let us consider a 1d chain , where nodes are placed on a line at fixed distances from each other and are connected by channels . \n two neighboring nodes may exchange photons through the channels and thus share pure entangled states of qubits , which may be written in the computational basis @xcite as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the schmidt coefficients conditioned by @xmath4 and @xmath5 . a perfect entangled pair with @xmath6 \n can be converted from the above state with the singlet conversion probability @xmath7 by measurement of one of the qubits from the pair with operators @xcite @xmath8    in quantum communication the singlet conversion probability plays the exact role of link occupation probability in percolation theory . \n indeed , if the imperfect entangled pairs are distributed between the nodes of a quantum network , each of the pairs is converted to the perfect entanglement link with probability @xmath9 or vanish with probability @xmath10 . by analogy with the percolation theory , we say that perfect entanglement is established between two remote nodes if there is a path of connected perfect entanglement links between the nodes . \n while the singlet conversion probability is a natural choice to study the entanglement percolation , we shall also use another measure of entanglement to characterize the process of entanglement distribution  the concurrence @xcite . \n the concurrence for the entangled qubit pair ( [ states ] ) is given by @xmath11 . \n perfect entanglement with concurrence @xmath12 is established between two distant nodes if only there is a path of connected entanglement links of concurrence @xmath12 each \n .     leads to the creation of a non - local entanglement link connecting two physically disconnected nodes . ] \n the main ingredient for the advanced quantum information processing is the entanglement swapping @xcite . if three nodes @xmath13 are chained together and the node @xmath14 shares two qubit pairs in state ( [ states ] ) with the neighbors , the optimal entanglement swapping @xcite consists of the measurement of the two qubits from the two different entangled pairs at node @xmath14 in the bell basis @xmath15 \\ket{\\phi^{\\pm } } & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left ( \\ket{01 } \\pm \\ket{10 } \\right ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with subsequent classical communication of the results of the measurement to nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) . \n the two local entanglement links transform into a single non - local entanglement link with the final state given by @xmath18   \\label{final - swapping-2 } \\ket{\\phi^{\\pm } } & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left ( \\ket{01 } \\pm \\ket{10 } \\right ) \\ \n , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with corresponding probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the entanglement swapping does nt change the average singlet conversion probability @xmath21 @xcite and reduce concurrence @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 . \n the possibility to use locc to create a non - local entanglement link , which is beyond the initial network configuration , allows us to create a complex quantum network with highly unexpected large - scale behavior as we show next . \n nodes with @xmath24 entangled pairs between neighboring nodes ( top ) is modified with the entanglement swapping at each node - ignoring the borders - to the quantum network with @xmath25 levels of hierarchy ( bottom ) . ] \n let us consider a 1d chain consisting of @xmath26 nodes . \n let each pair of neighboring nodes initially share @xmath27 qubit pairs in the state ( [ states ] ) . \n let us take @xmath28 qubit pairs and perform entanglement swapping at each second node . \n after that we take @xmath29 qubit pairs and apply the entanglement swapping at each third node . repeating the above procedure with the entanglement swapping at @xmath30 nodes for @xmath31 \n , we construct @xmath28 levels of hierarchy of non - local entanglement links over the initial 1d chain formed with local links , as exemplified in fig . \n [ fig-2 ] . \n this hierarchical network was introduced by boettcher , goncalves and guclu @xcite to study the behavior of the so - called small - world systems @xcite . \n but , because the non - local entanglement links are created with locc only and do not require any non - local interactions between the nodes , they can not be attributed to the small - world links in a common classical sense . \n moreover , the non - local links do nt correspond to physical communication channels : the physical connectivity of the chain is still one - dimensional . \n thus , created hierarchical network of entanglement links has no classical analog and may be called a genuine quantum network constructed on a 1d chain , while the entanglement percolation in such a network  the quantum entanglement percolation . \n the suggested approach demands creating non - local entanglement links beyond the given network configuration and can not be implemented classically . \n now , we show that quantum entanglement percolation in the hierarchical quantum network is of exponential benefit over the entanglement percolation in 1d chain . in the 1d chain with \n @xmath27 entangled pairs between to neighboring nodes , perfect entanglement between two neighboring nodes is established with probability @xmath32 . the condition for connecting two infinitely distant nodes with a perfect entanglement link reads as @xmath33 where @xmath26 is the number of nodes between the nodes to be connected . \n the condition holds true only for @xmath34 giving us the well - known percolation transition point in the classical 1d chain @xmath35 , i.e. in 1d configuration the perfect entanglement can be created between two infinitely distant nodes if only the perfect entanglement is established between each pair of neighboring nodes .    for the quantum hierarchical network , \n the probability to connect two neighboring nodes is @xmath36 , while for three nodes @xmath37 , where we used the fact that the entanglement swapping does nt change the singlet conversion probability . \n taking into account self - similarity of the chain , we arrive to the recursive formula to find the probability of connecting the border nodes with a path of perfect entangled pairs @xcite @xmath38 for @xmath31 . in the infinite chain @xmath39 , thus @xmath40 and @xmath41 . \n the quadratic equation has two solutions interconnected at the non - classical percolation transition point @xmath42 . \n it is important to stress that , in contrast to standard percolation @xcite , before the percolation transition point @xmath43 there is a finite probability of connecting the border nodes @xmath44 . \n however , further analysis @xcite shows , that the probability to connect an arbitrary two nodes of the network with a path of perfect entanglement links is still exponentially small due to exponentially small size of the giant component with respect to the network size . for @xmath45 \n a path between arbitrary two nodes in the network exists with a finite probability @xcite . \n thus the initially distributed entangled states ( [ states ] ) in the hierarchical network with the singlet conversion probability of @xmath46 are sufficient to establish a path of perfect entanglement links between arbitrary two nodes irrespective of the chain length . \n taking into account that in the 1d chain the perfect entanglement path exists only if @xmath47 ( and otherwise @xmath48 ) , for any @xmath45 quantum entanglement percolation is superior exponentially to the classical entanglement percolation as was announced .    in eq . \n ( [ recursion ] ) we implicitly assumed that the average singlet conversion probability does nt change after multiple entanglement swapping operations . \n but , this is not the case , because after a single entanglement swapping with the bell measurements ( [ bell - measurements ] ) , the pure state ( [ bell - measurements ] ) transforms into a mixture of states ( [ final - swapping-1 ] ) and ( [ final - swapping-2 ] ) . \n further application of the entanglement swapping on the mixed state leads to the decrease of the average singlet conversion probability . \n since the entanglement swapping is a locc and the entanglement does nt increase under locc , there must be an optimal measurement that preserves the entanglement under multiple application of the entanglement swapping . \n but , as the optimal measurement is unknown yet @xcite , in the next section we shall estimate the amount of initial entangled pairs ( [ states ] ) and number of simple entanglement swapping operations with the bell measurements ( [ bell - measurements ] ) to create the hierarchical network on the 1d chain . \n before we proceed with the percolation properties of the quantum network , we would like to stress that each of the @xmath28 levels of hierarchy connects @xmath49 nodes into loops with one entangled link between the border nodes . \n thus to construct a network of maximal hierarchy on @xmath26 nodes ( i.e. to connect the border nodes with a single entanglement link ) one needs to distribute initially at least @xmath50 imperfect entangled pairs between each pair of neighboring nodes in the initial 1d chain . \n the total number of the imperfect entangled states in the hierarchical network of @xmath26 nodes thus scales as @xmath51 , which is practically feasible . \n studying the quantum entanglement percolation with concurrence gives us further insight into the process of entanglement distribution in the quantum network . because single entanglement swapping reduces the concurrence of the initial states @xmath52 times , the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) is modified as @xmath53 where @xmath54 . because @xmath55 as @xmath56 , the percolation properties of the hierarchical network reduce to the percolation properties of the classical 1d chain @xmath57 with the classical percolation transition point at @xmath58 . \n the reason for the reduction is the decay of entanglement in the non - local entanglement links of higher hierarchy due to multiple entanglement swapping . \n the decay is exponential with respect to the hierarchy level @xmath28 , which implies polynomial decay of entanglement with respect to the chain length @xmath26 , because @xmath59 and @xmath60 . \n the effect of the polynomial decay of entanglement can be eliminated using standard protocol for entanglement distillation @xcite . \n reminding that any two - qubit state is distillable if entangled @xcite , let us estimate the amount of initial entanglement to implement the distillation in the hierarchical network . \n let us consider the initial network configuration with @xmath27 entangled pairs between the neighboring nodes and assuming that all qubit pairs ( [ states ] ) have the amount of entanglement of @xmath61 , which corresponds to the states with schmidt coefficients @xmath62 . \n these states could be unitary transformed into werner states @xcite with fidelity of the each of the states @xmath63 . a single entanglement swapping at an arbitrary node of the 1d chain results into one of the two states ( [ final - swapping-1])-([final - swapping-2 ] ) . while the state ( [ final - swapping-2 ] ) requires no distillation , the fidelity of the state ( [ final - swapping-1 ] ) \n is given by @xmath64 . \n using the iterative formula for the entanglement distillation @xmath65 we find that @xmath66 , i.e. the entanglement distillation protocol allows to restore the fidelity to the level before the entanglement swapping in just eight iterations . \n taking into account that the success probability of the distillation protocol approximates @xmath67 , @xmath68 entangled pairs are required to distill a single entanglement link after an entanglement swapping . in a network with @xmath28 levels of hierarchy , the number of entangled pairs before distillation thus scales exponentially as @xmath69 , but because @xmath70 , the total number of initial states to construct the hierarchical network with the average concurrence @xmath71 per entanglement link scales just polynomially @xmath72 . \n the distillation procedure is efficient , because targets achieving states with non - unit fidelity @xmath73 at each entanglement link . \n if each entanglement link in the hierarchical quantum network has the average concurrence @xmath71 , the probability to establish a perfect entanglement path between two arbitrary distant nodes is strictly higher then zero as suggested by the percolation properties of the quantum network \n .    suggested distillation procedure is not optimal and is shown to demonstrate practically appropriate ( i.e. polynomial ) scaling of the initial resources with the network size . \n more advanced distillation protocols @xcite may lead to even better scaling . the optimal strategy for the entanglement distillation \n depends on the optimal strategy for the hierarchical network construction , which is unknown yet , as we mentioned early . \n we introduced quantum networks created with locc , which exhibit non - classical percolation properties and have quantum communication advantages over corresponding classical networks . using the notion of quantum entanglement percolation we showed how to establish long - distance perfect entanglement between arbitrary two nodes in 1d chain with imperfect entangled pairs . \n apart from the quantum communication benefits , we clearly demonstrated the distinction between the percolation properties of the physical network configuration ( composed of nodes and channels ) and the quantum network configuration ( consisting of nodes and entanglement links ) . \n we showed that the percolation properties of these networks are dramatically different , although they both correspond to the physical 1d configuration . \n this result suggests a study of structural complexity of entanglement graphs that can be simulated on a given quantum network @xcite . \n presented approach of constructing the non - local hierarchical levels on simple underlying classical networks can be extended beyond 1d network configuration @xcite . \n in particular , the 2d square lattice with the classical percolation transition point at @xmath74 can be modified to a hierarchical network with the percolation transition point at @xmath75 . \n general analysis of the hierarchical networks is , however , challenging and requires development of new theoretical and numerical tools .    the hierarchical networks exhibit property of explosive percolation @xcite  the sudden emergence of large - scale connectivity in a network @xcite . \n the fact that the hierarchical networks may be created and operated locally opens intriguing possibilities for experimental testing of the explosive percolation .    finally because the quantum networks exhibit new percolation transition points \n , we may expect all - new percolation properties , which may lead to the construction of new local theory of percolation in quantum networks with new unexpected technological applications .", "StartTimeOffset": 457483896948, "RequestID": "436d047c34d4d319e853f46193daf20592960a4c", "TotalTokens": 4101}

markovian effects are most pronounced . in figure 1 \n all three reservoirs are shown for @xmath42 . with this choice of the parameters the time scale of the system dynamics , given by @xmath43 , \n is much shorter than the relevant reservoir time scales @xmath44 . \n for this reason one would expect the non - markovian effects to be strong . \n the wigner function is a phase space representation of the density matrix of the system and is thus a complete description of the state of the system . \n the solution of the master equation ( [ eq : mainme ] ) , based on algebraic properties of superoperators presented in @xcite , is used here because it provides a solution in terms of the quantum characteristic function @xmath45,\\ ] ] which can then be directly used to obtain the wigner function . here \n @xmath46 is the initial quantum characteristic function , @xmath47 is a complex variable , and @xmath48 we want to study initial squeezed coherent states . \n these states are obtained from the vacuum by operating first with the displacement operator @xmath49 to obtain a coherent state , and then with the squeezing operator @xmath50 , @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the squeezing parameter . \n the quantum characteristic function for an initial squeezed coherent state is @xmath53,\\label{eq : char}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . by taking the fourier transform of the quantum characteristic function ( [ eq : chi ] ) , with the help of equation ( [ eq : char ] ) \n , we obtain the wigner function for the initially squeezed and displaced vacuum state ( @xmath56 ) with squeezing angle @xmath57 @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 are the variances of the dimensionless quadratures @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a time - dependent normalization constant @xcite . \n [ fig : varianssit ]   for a ) ohmic , b ) super - ohmic and c ) sub - ohmic reservoir . \n markovian result is given by dashed line . in b ) \n the markovian dynamics is so fast it appears here as an almost vertical line . \n the parameters are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    at the initial time @xmath67 we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the following \n i consider the squeezing dynamics in the @xmath0 quadrature . \n the squeezing condition is @xmath70 . for larger variances \n the state is not squeezed . \n an example of the squeezing dynamics for the ohmic , super - ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir is shown in figure 2 .    oscillations in the squeezing for non - markovian times appear for ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs . \n they are induced by the temporarily negative values of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 which are known to occur at high @xmath22 and for @xmath73 , as in the case considered here . in this region , \n virtual exchanges of excitations between the system and the reservoir characterize the dynamics @xcite . \n these virtual processes are causing the non - markovian oscillations in the squeezing . \n the markovian behaviour of the squeezing is plotted for comparison as a dashed line . \n the markovian squeezing is obtained by inserting into equation ( [ eq : variance ] ) the markovian values of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are given as @xmath74 and @xmath75 . \n the parameters affecting the squeezing oscillations are the reservoir type , reservoir temperature and initial squeezing @xmath76 . \n the reservoir type is mostly responsible for the form of the curve , while the temperature and initial squeezing merely shift the curve with respect to the squeezing  non - squeezing border , @xmath77 . \n the variance @xmath78 exhibits very similar behaviour when coupled to ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir but is different in character for the super - ohmic case . \n the super - ohmic reservoir induces non - monotonic dynamics in the variance , but for the choice of parameters used in the figures the squeezing oscillations do not appear . from the form of the curves we see that for all parameters , the super - ohmic reservoir leads to a non - squeezed state in the shortest time . \n oscillations in the quadrature variance persist only as long as the decay rate @xmath71 attains negative values . \n for the super - ohmic reservoir and @xmath73 the decay rates attain positive values faster than the other two reservoirs @xcite . \n the differences between the squeezing for the super - ohmic reservoir and for the ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs can be traced back to the reservoir properties . by comparing the figure 1 of the reservoirs with the squeezing plots in figure 2 we can easily come to the same conclusion as in @xcite when considering the heating function . \n namely , that the low frequency part of the spectrum @xmath79 affects strongly the non - markovian features . \n this means that when the spectrum is more tightly confined to the low frequencies ( with respect to @xmath12 ) , longer lasting oscillations both in squeezing and heating are present . \n in this paper i have studied the non - markovian squeezing dynamics of an initially squeezed coherent state . \n analytic expressions for the variances of the quadratures depend on the reservoir structure . \n the effect of different reservoirs was studied for the system coupled to differently structured reservoirs . depending on the reservoir type and other parameters , the initially squeezed state showed non - markovian oscillations between squeezed and non - squeezed states . \n the quantum brownian motion model describes a large number of different physical systems @xcite . \n thus , understanding the short - time dynamics of this system contributes to a wide variety of experimental and theoretical scenarios . \n reservoir engineering techniques allow in principle to tune the reservoir parameters , especially the parameter @xmath80 , in order to reach the oscillatory regime @xmath73 here illustrated @xcite . \n the squeezing oscillations are connected to oscillations in the width of the wigner function @xcite , which can be measured with homodyne detection . \n therefore the experimental detection of the non - markovian squeezing dynamics is , in principle , possible . \n the fact that non - markovian dynamics are different for differently structured reservoirs may prove useful when considering implementing quantum devices with different physical setups , e.g. trapped ions or solid state materials . in any case understanding the effects of the environment on a quantum system is important also from a purely theoretical point of view . \n the author thanks sabrina maniscalco for helpful discussions and comments on the paper . financial support from the visl foundation \n is acknowledged . \n 9      quang t , woldeyohannes m , john s and agarwal g s 1997 _ phys . \n lett . _ * 79 * 5238 hope j j , moy g m , collett m j and savage c m 2000 _ phys . \n rev . a _ * 61 * 023603 alicki r , horodecki m , horodecki p and horodecki r 2002 _ phys . \n rev . a _ * 65 * 062101            furusawa a , srensen j l , braunstein s l , fuchs c a , kimble h j and polzik e s 1998 _ sciene _ * 282 * 706 bowen w p , treps n , buchler b c , schnabel r , ralph t c , bachor h -

{"ContextTokens": 2634, "GeneratedTokens": 199, "SynthesizedBody": "a variety of detector concepts for space - based gravitational wave interferometers have been proposed , the most well studied concept being lisa@xcite . \n it was understood early on that the most numerous source class radiating in the band covered by lisa - like detectors will be the galactic population of ultra - compact binaries ( ucbs ) comprised of pairs of stellar remnants : white dwarfs , neutron stars or black holes \n . the gravitational radiation from these ucbs will be the dominant signal in the frequency band covered by lisa - like detectors . \n early estimates of the composite signal from the ucbs @xcite demonstrated that the signals of the vast majority of the galactic binaries will overlap and be unresolvable from one another , forming a limiting foreground ( or `` confusion noise '' ) for space - based gravitational wave detectors . \n later studies based on population synthesis @xcite have borne this expectation out . \n detailed data analysis studies have shown that @xmath1 individual binaries could be resolved out of the foreground by a gravitational wave observatory like lisa @xcite \n .    a subset of the resolvable binaries will be detectable electromagnetically . \n the purpose of this work is to assess the multi - messenger potential for different space - based detectors spanning the trade - space of future mission designs . \n this builds off previous work @xcite demonstrating the feasibility of follow - up observations for high - frequency ucb sources . \n we estimate the total number of multi - messenger sources by beginning with a population synthesis model of the galaxy @xcite , complete with optical magnitudes . from this \n we produce a magnitude limited source catalog , then estimate how well each system will be localized on the sky by different gravitational wave detector configurations . using hundreds of monte carlo realizations over the spatial distribution of the galaxy and the ucb orientations , \n we find tens to hundreds of sources that can be observed both electromagnetically and gravitationally . \n the information encoded about the ucbs in each of the two spectrums is highly complementary , enabling tests of general relativity , full measurement of the physical parameters enabling constraints on binary synthesis channels , and new methods of probing the close interaction dynamics of the compact stars @xcite . \n for a gravitational wave observatory , the limiting sensitivity as a function of frequency is dominated at low frequencies by acceleration noise @xmath2 , while the `` floor '' , where the detector is most sensitive , is dominated by position measurement noise @xmath3 . table [ tbl.detectors ] contains the parameters used for the detector configurations in this study . \n these parameters can be used to compute the noise power spectral density @xmath4 ,     \\label{eqn.sn }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the contribution to the instrument noise from the unresolved ucb foreground  @xcite . \n the configurations we will highlight correspond to the classic lisa design ( @xmath7 gm ) , as well as two shorter arm - length configurations ( @xmath8 gm and @xmath9 gm ) in order to cover a variety of plausible mission configurations . the 1 gm configuration is similar to the elisa mission being considered by the european space agency  @xcite . \n we use an observation time of two years for each configuration . \n this suite of detectors provides a broad palette to illustrate the observational capabilities of these instruments with regards to the ucbs . \n a classic depiction of the performance for these interferometers is a plot of the average sensitivity curve in strain spectral density versus frequency @xcite , as shown in fig . \n [ fig.detectorpsd ] . \n the elisa concept is the only one which uses a 4-link configuration . \n the doppler ranging between each spacecraft in the constellation is accomplished using two laser links . \n thus the 4-link design is a single - vertex interferometer , while the 6-link designs allow for three ( coupled ) interferometers . \n this difference accounts for an additional improvement in the 6-link sensitivity curves by a factor of @xmath10 at frequencies where the ucbs are found .    . \n the solid lines show the sensitivity set by the measurment noise while the dashed curves include an estimate of the ucb confusion - limited foreground . \n over - plotted are the brightest ucbs in our simulated catalog ( green crosses ) , and the known verification binaries ( blue stars),scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .gravitational wave detector configurations used in this study . \n configuration 1 corresponds to elisa . \n configuration 5 is the classic lisa design . \n all simulations were for two year mission lifetimes . \n [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we now consider how to select candidates for follow - up observations from the full gw catalog . pointing telescopes at all of the gw sources localized within the adopted threshold would be inefficient , as we find between @xmath11 and @xmath12 gw sources in the full catalog will meet the @xmath13 deg@xmath0 threshold , while @xmath14 are likely to be brighter than @xmath15 , and only @xmath16 pass the @xmath17 cut . \n additional considerations need to be made to increase the efficiency of follow - up observing campaigns . \n we illustrate two simple ways to isolate the gw sources that may be electromagnetically observable . \n these suggestions are supported by calculations shown in table  [ tbl.strategy ] . \n first , the large majority of ucb sources are confined within the galactic plane . \n conversely , the magnitude limited catalogs sample the local galaxy , which is much more uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere . \n therefore , as a rough cut on the gw catalog , any binaries that are well localized but out of the galactic plane are good candidates . \n these are additionally attractive sources , as there will be less optical background and extinction against which the observing campaign will have to compete . \n we find between @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the well - localized binaries in the 20@xmath20 to 24@xmath20 magnitude - limited catalogs have galactic latitudes @xmath21 , while that fraction is reduced to @xmath22 for the full gw catalog . \n a uniform distribution of stars on the celestial sphere would have 66% of the stars with @xmath21    the other strategy for identifying optical counterparts relies on estimates of the distance to the galactic binary . \n typical ucb sources will undergo very little evolution of their orbital period during a space - borne gw detector s lifetime . without measurement of the rate of change of the gravitational wave frequency @xmath23 \n the gw observation only constrains the overall amplitude of the signal without decoupling the chirp - mass and the luminosity distance @xmath24 @xcite . for @xmath25 of the multi - messenger sources we sufficiently constrain @xmath23 and @xmath26 to measure @xmath24 to within 20% , but astrophysical effects such as tides may impact the orbital evolution and thus bias the distance estimate . for the remaining systems in the gw catalog , we can use reasonable priors on the mass and mass ratio of white dwarf binaries to put meaningful constraints on @xmath24 from the amplitude measurement alone . \n using only the amplitude , frequency and priors on the masses constructed from the population synthesis simulation , we find that the distribution of the most likely ( ml ) luminosity distances @xmath27 is strongly peaked between 0 and 8 kpc  the distance to the galactic center  for the magnitude limited catalogs . \n the @xmath28 distributions for the full well - localized catalog with no magnitude cut is more uniformly distributed over a larger range . \n our final consideration pertains to the expected optical light curves for ucb systems identified in the gw catalog . \n the population synthesis galaxy in our study is restricted to detached white dwarf binaries , as opposed to interacting am cvn systems . without mass transferring from one star to the other in the binary , \n photometric variability is not guaranteed . \n the systems in the gw catalog that are best constrained are typically those at the high - frequency end of the population . \n this is to our advantage , because the shorter period binaries have a higher probability of eclipsing one another during an orbital cycle . \n we can put an additional cut on our em / gw catalog by requiring the binaries to be eclipsing . \n ( see the right - hand panel of figs . \n [ fig.numbersources1 ]  and  [ fig.numbersources10 ] ) . from simple geometrical arguments @xcite the minimum inclination angle with respect to our line of sight that will produce eclipsing light curves is @xmath29 assuming all binaries have mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 . \n if we only consider binaries in the multimessenger catalog with inclination angle less than @xmath32 , we reduce the total number of candidates by a factor of @xmath33 . \n nevertheless , we still find upwards of @xmath34 candidates for the large gw detector configurations and deep , wide field , optical surveys . \n requiring eclipsing light curves significantly degrades the multimessenger potential for the 1 gm configuration using catalogs limited to 20@xmath20 magnitude and dimmer  such em follow - up surveys could come up empty . \n we conclude that space - based gravitational wave detectors will be useful observatories for discovering new ucbs in the galaxy that could be observed electromagnetically , though deep , wide field , optical surveys may be required to produce large catalogs . \n we reach this verdict by considering a range of plausible near - future space - based gravitational wave detector concepts , and assess their measurement capabilities for magnitude limited catalogs of ucbs . \n magnitudes for the constituents of each binary were derived from the population synthesis simulations , and the gravitational wave measurement capabilities were estimated using the fisher information matrix . \n any ucbs that were brighter than our chosen magnitude limits ( 18 - 24 ) and located on the sky by the gravitational wave detector to within angular resolution @xmath35 were considered multi - messenger candidates . \n we estimated the multi - messenger catalog sizes for both @xmath36 and 10 deg@xmath0 .    at the pessimistic end \n , we consider magnitude 18 limited catalogs , and single - vertex interferometers with 1 gm arm - lengths . the best scenario considered the classic lisa design and an optical telescope limited at @xmath37 magnitude . \n the number of multi - messenger candidates was anywhere from a few to several hundreds over that range of detector capabilities . \n if we put on the additional constraint that the sources must be eclipsing to allow for electromagnetic observation the counts were reduced by a factor of @xmath33 . \n while most of the known verification binaries are am cvn type stars , our study only considered detached white dwarf binaries , thus providing a very complimentary catalog of ucb multi - messenger systems . \n this work considered a conservative approach to finding multi - messenger ucbs , with competing criteria that strongly affect the expected population of systems detectable in both spectrums . \n electromagnetic detections are most strongly affected by the magnitude limit of the detection survey , a function of telescope aperture . by contrast , the gravitational wave detection catalogs of ucbs are expected to have thousands of systems in them ; most will be too faint to be detectable by any electromagnetic survey . \n however the gravitational wave localization criterion is a strong constraint on the multi - messenger catalog . \n we find that wide - field surveys ( @xmath13 deg@xmath0 ) yield more candidates than more narrow fields of view ( @xmath38 deg@xmath39 ) by 50 - 100% for the full catalogs , and by a factor of 2 - 4 for the eclipsing binaries . \n we have estimated the number of ucb multi - messenger candidates without considering what could be done with joint gw and em observations . \n our follow - on effort will consider the science yield from joint observations of both the known verification binaries \n mostly mass - transferring systems  and the close , detached binaries that will be discovered by space - borne gravitational wave detectors . \n this work was supported by nasa grants 08- atfp08 - 0126 ( tbl ) , nnx12ag30 g ( sll ) , and nnx10ah15 g ( njc ) . \n gn acknowledges support from the dutch foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) . \n g.  nelemans maintains a wiki with the most up to date list of verification binary parameters at link:<www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans / dokuwiki / doku.php?id = lisa_wiki>[<www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans / dokuwiki / doku.php?id = lisa_wiki > ] ; cited 2 september 2011", "StartTimeOffset": 470296870914, "RequestID": "f2c984a4f20f75da34ed9a81e0c62664d92125b1", "TotalTokens": 2833}

control of matter or any type of light - mediated manipulation of molecular- and cluster- materials . \n derivatives of the polarizability tensor with respect to normal - mode displacement also determine the intensity of the raman shifts of a given molecule or cluster  @xcite .    because of the central role that polarizabilities play in materials science and chemistry \n there have been significant efforts aimed at experimentally validating theoretically predicted polarizabilities . \n however , such experiments are themselves very difficult to interpret for a variety of reasons . from the standpoint of comparison to experiments on bulk systems \n , the polarizability of an array of nonoverlapping polarizable molecules may be approximated from the clausius - mossotti relation . \n such comparisons have been performed with some success on very idealized systems such as fullerene molecules  @xcite . \n however , for pure - metal clusters the polarizability may not be determined from such a means because the individual clusters would coalesce into the the bulk material if placed upon a lattice . \n as such the preferred experimental approach for measurement of metal - cluster polarizabilities rely upon the electrostatic equivalent of a stern - gerlach experiment in which a beam of metal clusters traverse a nonuniform electric field and are deflected due to the the induced polarization of the cluster  @xcite . \n again , for simple systems such a fullerene molecules quantitative agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved . however , for metallic clusters deviations exist between different experiments and also between experiment and theory . \n generally , it appears that the theoretically predicted polarizabilties display a more monotonic and smooth behavior than the experimental measurements . \n moreover , earlier comparisons suggested that the experimental polarizabilities tended to be larger than theory . \n such discrepancies are now largely understood to be due to temperature dependent corrections that depend upon the permanent dipole of the clusters . \n however , some discrepancies still exist and it is not understood why . \n one possibility that we attempt to investigate here is that different low - lying geometries of a cluster may have significantly different polarizabilites or anisotropies in their polarizabilities \n .    experimental measurements of polarizability of li clusters containing up to 22 atoms have been reported  @xcite . here , we present and compare our density functional predictions of polarizabilities of li clusters with the avialable experimental data . \n the calculations are performed for clusters in the size range 8 - 22 as number of studies have already addressed polarizabilities up to size 8  @xcite . rather than concentrate on the _ ground state _ for each size regime we have adopted a different approach that relies on the generation of several low - energy structures . \n the polarizability of each structure is subsequently calculated to determine whether conformer - induced changes in polarization are expected to be observable . \n the determination of lowest energy structure of clusters is a nontrivial task . to obtain the candidate structures for the ground state of li clusters , \n we make use of a recently determined database of sodium clusters  @xcite . \n this database is generated using a global optimization technique such as the basin hopping algorithm using the interatomic potential determined within the kohn - sham dft framework . \n this numerical ks dft provides very good description of sodium clusters  @xcite . using starting geometries from this database and bachelet - hamman - schluter pseudo potential method  @xcite \n we quickly generate low - energy structures for li clusters using conjugate - gradient technique . \n a set of few lowest - energy geometries are then selected for further optimization at the all - electron level until forces on all atoms are below the 0.001 hartree / bohr . \n for each of these equilibrium geometries we have then performed six additional calculations with electric fields turned on . \n the included fields are ( e,0,0 ) , ( -e,0,0 ) , ( 0,e,0 ) , ( 0,-e,0 ) , ( 0,0,e ) and ( 0,0,-e ) with e=0.001 atomic units . from the standard relation between the dipole \n moment , polarizability , and applied electric field : @xmath3 we determine the polarizability tensor using a central differencing method . \n additional discussion of this procedure may be found in ref . \n @xcite . from the above expression it is possible to determine the central - difference off - diagonal elements ( @xmath4 ) from either @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the limit of a vanishingly small - field or an exactly harmonic polarizability tensor \n , the values obtained in the two different ways would agree perfectly ( regardless of issues related to basis sets ) . \n this exact relation provides one way of estimating whether the applied electric field is small enough to accurately determine the polarizability tensor . \n we find that the off - diagonal elements are small but agree to approximately 1 - 5% . \n of course , the size of the off - diagonal element depends on the original choice of coordinate system . \n our original coordinate system uses the principal axes of inertia . to determine the principal polarizability axes we then diagonalize the polarizability tensor and rotate the molecule so that the molecular x , y and z axes coincide with the predicted principle polarizability axes . as a final check we have ascertained for several cases that the predicted polarizabilities are accurate and uncontaminated by higher - order polarizabilities . for these tests , we perform an analysis similar to that of quong and pederson for the c@xmath9 and benzene polarizabilites  @xcite . that is , we have determined that the polarizabilities obtained from either energies or dipole moments agree .    to perform the electronic - structure calculations we have used the nrlmol suite of codes due to pederson _ \n et al . _ \n this all - electron method uses gaussian - type orbitals to represent both the core , valence and unoccupied electrons . \n a highly accurate variational integration mesh  @xcite is used to calculate matrix elements required for the secular equation . \n the coulomb potential is calculated analytically ( in terms of incomplete gamma functions )  @xcite on this mesh . \n the exchange - correlation potential and energy kernel is also calculated analytically on this mesh . for the work discussed here we use the perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite generalized gradient approximation . \n the basis sets here have been specifically optimized for this functional . for li \n , we use a total of ten single - gaussians to construct 5 contracted s - type orbitals , 3 contracted p - type orbitals and 1-contracted d - type orbital . \n each d - type orbital used also contributes a spherical s - type orbital with an @xmath10 prefactor . \n this basis set is used for optimizing the geometry . \n .gaussian decay parameter , @xmath11 in bohr@xmath12 , and contraction coefficients , c(1s ) and c(2s ) , used in this work . as discussed in the text \n , the default basis set also contains single gaussians . for the s functions we use @xmath13-@xmath14 . \n the p functions use @xmath15-@xmath16 . \n the d functions use @xmath15 . for the polarizability calculations , we also include @xmath14 and @xmath17 for the p- and d- functions respectively . [ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ] \n in this paper we have discussed a relatively automated procedure for investigating polarizabilities of clusters as a function of size and conformation . \n this procedure has been tested on lithium clusters in the n=8 - 22 range due to availability of experimental data . \n while the binding energy per atom and average polarizability show very little nonmonotonic behavior in this range , there are significant departures from isotropic polarizabilities in these clusters . as expected from jellium models it is only for n=20 , the polarizability tensor is found to be significantly isotropic . \n the calculated polarizabilities show smoother decrease with increase in cluster size than the experimental values . \n the spin polarized calculations indicate that all even size clusters as expected have zero moments ( no unpaired electron ) . \n however , a few odd size clusters are found to show higher ( 3 @xmath18 ) spin states . \n we thank dr . \n p. calaminici and dr . \n g. maroulis for encouraging us to complete the present work for this issue . \n this work is supported in part by the national science foundation through crest grant , by the university of texas at el paso ( utep startup funds ) and in part by the office of naval research , directly ( onr 05pr07548 - 00 ) and through the naval research laboratory . \n computational support was provided by the dod high performance computing modernization office . \n m. r. pederson , r. a. heaton , j. g. harrison and c. c. lin , metallic state of the free - electron gas within the self - interaction - corrected local - spin - density approximation , phys . \n b * 39 * , 1581 ( 1989 ) .              m.r . \n pederson and t. baruah , molecular polarizabilities from density - functional theory : from small molecules to light - harvesting complexes , in _ lecture series on computer and computational sciences _ , vol 3 pp 156 - 167 ( 2005 ) . \n pederson , t. baruah , p. b. allen and c. schmidt , density - functional - based determination of vibrational polarizabilities in molecules within the double - harmonic approximation : derivation and application , \n _ j. chem . theory and comp . _ * 4 * , 590 ( 2005 ) . \n e. benichou , r. antoine , d. rayane , b. vezin , f. w. dalby , ph . \n dugourd , m. broyer c. ristori , f. chandezon , b. a. huber , j. c. rocco , s. a. blundell , and c. guet , measurement of static electric dipole polarizabilities of lithium clusters : consistency with measured dynamic polarizabilities , _ phys . \n rev . a _ * 59 * , r1 ( 1999 ) . \n g. maroulis and d. xenides , enhanced linear and nonlinear polarizabilities for the li4 cluster . \n how satisfactory is the agreement between theory and experiment for the static dipole polarizability ? \n _ j. phys . \n a _ * 103 * , 4590 ( 1999 ) .              a. vichare , d. g. kanehre , and s. a. blundell , model dependence of the thermodynamic properties of na8 and na20 clusters studied with ab initio electronic structure methods , _ phys . \n b _ * 64 * , 045408 ( 2001 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 489875141640, "RequestID": "21ae1d5b86a3511e30a37297ca91cf7d02d9fb58", "TotalTokens": 3094}
{"ContextTokens": 3534, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "solute dispersion in porous media is of importance in many fields of science , such as chemistry , groundwater hydrology , oil recovery , etc . \n tracers , dissolved in a fluid flowing through a porous material , will experience dispersion in both the longitudinal ( downstream ) and transverse directions , due to thermal or fickian diffusion and the variability in both flow velocity and direction in the pores . \n tracers injected at one point ( e.g. , a leaking tank polluting groundwater ) will thus spread out into a plume .    over the past decades \n , many models have been proposed to model tracer transport . \n most models relate the dispersion coefficients to the flow velocity ( @xmath0 ) , a characteristic length scale ( the grain size or pore length @xmath1 ) , and the molecular diffusion coefficient ( @xmath2 ) via the dimensionless pclet number pe @xmath3 . due to the use of the microscale @xmath1 , the pclet number is a microscopic property . \n the most basic approach to computing the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration of tracers is provided by the advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) , using separate values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the dispersion coefficients in the longitudinal and transverse direction , respectively . \n to explain the apparently anomalous behavior of the dispersion coefficients observed in experiments , more sophisticated models have been developed , e.g. , flow through random capillaries  @xcite . \n the analysis of  @xcite provided an initial approach to evaluate the macroscopic effects of microscopic pore geometry by means of an averaging procedure . \n percolation theory and continuous time random walks allowed handling long range correlations  @xcite . \n a range of numerical methods have also been applied to the problem , such as network models in which pore connectivity plays an essential role ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n finally , full microscopic modeling of incompressible flow through porous materials has become feasible thanks to modern computing , and considerable successes have been obtained with this method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper \n we propose a new approach to understand the first - order relationship between dispersion and flow velocity ( and hence pclet number ) . \n it is based on a straightforward physical argument involving the competition of diffusion and advection in the pore channels , and leads to an accurate prediction of the observed behavior over the full relevant range of pclet numbers . \n the analysis also reveals the existence of a new material property related to the cited competition and the mesoscopic structure of pore geometry . \n consider the laminar flow of fluid through a regular or random homogeneous porous material . \n the flow is produced by a pressure difference ( head ) applied at opposite ends of the sample of porous material . \n this pressure difference induces a complex flow pattern inside the pores that can be computed exactly using the appropriate equations for an incompressible fluid , with appropriate boundary conditions , cf . \n @xcite .    due to the complexity of the pore structure , \n the flow lines go apart and come together again as they traverse the material , dictated by the pressure head and the pore structure , so that the dispersion of the longitudinal distance @xmath6 among different flow lines tends to grow linearly as a function of the mean longitudinal distance @xmath7 , taken in the direction of the negative pressure gradient . \n regardless of the complexity of the flow pattern inside the porous material , the incompressible flow at every point is linear in the applied pressure head , so the geometry of this flow pattern does not vary as the head is varied . \n this leads to what is known as ` mechanical ' dispersion , with a diffusion coefficient given by @xmath8 where the mean longitudinal flow velocity @xmath9 has been taken as a measure for the pressure head , and @xmath10 is a geometric proportionality constant . \n thus , the longitudinal dispersion @xmath4 is linear in the mean longitudinal flow velocity @xmath0 . a similar argument \n can also be applied to the transverse dispersion , that is likewise linear in the flow velocity , but with a different ( smaller ) proportionality constant due to the significant geometrical angle between the direction of the mean pressure gradient and the direction of the transport : @xmath11 .    into this flow , \n tracers are injected . \n these tracers are not merely advected with the flow , but in addition are subject to random ( thermal ) brownian motion . at zero or very small flow , \n pure thermal diffusion will result , with diffusion coefficient @xmath12 . at large flow velocity , but still in the laminar flow regime , the thermal motion of the tracers can be neglected with respect to the advection , and nearly pure ` mechanical ' dispersion will result , @xmath13 or @xmath5 . \n we expect there to be an intermediate or transitional regime , in which global tracer dispersion should lie somewhere between the thermal and mechanical diffusion limits , but _ a priori _ it is not clear how exactly this dispersion scales with flow velocity .    following a tracer path through the pore channels of the porous material , there will be channels oriented at a small angle to the driving force , in which the mechanical dispersion will tend to dominate over thermal diffusion . \n other channels will be oriented nearly at right angles to the driving force , and there , thermal diffusion will tend to dominate over mechanical diffusion . \n thus , we propose modeling the mixed behavior in this intermediate regime by assuming that transport in each of the successive pore channels traversed by a tracer is dominated by one of the two mechanisms . \n in other words , we assume that a tracer alternately experiences thermal and mechanical diffusion . \n thus , the tracer experiences thermal diffusion for a fraction of time @xmath14 , with thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath15 . alternating with these phases of thermal diffusion \n , the tracer is advected by the flow for a fraction of time @xmath16 , during which it experiences a mechanical dispersion @xmath4 ( proportional to @xmath0 ) . therefore , the total dispersion of the longitudinal distance is the weighted sum of these two : @xmath17 so the net or total longitudinal diffusion is @xmath18 now , as the net longitudinal flow velocity @xmath0 increases , we make the essential assumption that the time fraction @xmath16 becomes progressively longer with respect to @xmath14 as @xmath0 increases . \n this is motivated as follows . as the drive is increased , transport in ever more pore channels \n becomes dominated by mechanical dispersion . \n so the time fraction ratio of mechanical to thermal dispersion a tracer experiences will be an increasing function of the velocity : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a critical velocity ( the velocity where mechanical diffusion starts to dominate globally over thermal diffusion ) . in the limit @xmath25 , one has @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in the limit @xmath28 \n , one has @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . \n both these limits agree with expectation . in the following \n , we will set @xmath31 for simplicity , but leave open the possibility that future studies may reveal more complex functional dependencies . \n to better understand the intermediate regime , we insert @xmath32 , and find @xmath33 which is recognized as a pad approximation . \n ( [ longitudinal ] ) has _ \n asymptotic behavior . for @xmath34 , \n one has @xmath35 . for @xmath36 , \n one has @xmath37 . \n but there is also an intermediate regime where @xmath38 . \n this regime occurs for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . summarizing : @xmath41 the intermediate asymptote only appears in full when the two corresponding limits are sufficiently far apart , i.e. , when @xmath42 . \n physically , the left and right asymptotes correspond to the limits in which one of the transport mechanisms ( thermal diffusion and mechanical dispersion , respectively ) dominates . \n the intermediate regime arises when the strength of the mechanical dispersion increases simultaneously with the fraction of time @xmath43 that the tracer is experiencing mechanical dispersion as compared to thermal diffusion . \n experimental data are commonly expressed in terms of @xmath44 versus pe , where @xmath2 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and pe is the dimensionless pclet number . \n the above expressions can be recast in this dimensionless form by substituting @xmath45 and @xmath46 \\{pe , pe@xmath47}. thus , the dimensionless form of eq . \n ( [ longitudinal ] ) is : @xmath48    to test the validity of eq . \n ( [ longitudinal_dl ] ) , we have fitted our expression to the numerical simulation data of @xcite and @xcite ( based on micro computer tomography ( ct ) scans of porous sandstone ) . due to the very low noise level of the numerical simulation , \n this test is probably more stringent than testing the model against data from laboratory experiments . \n the fits , shown in fig . \n [ ovaysi ] , are a very good match to the simulated data . \n note , in particular , that the intermediate region ( with logarithmic slope @xmath49 ) is reproduced in full detail . \n transverse dispersion is different from longitudinal dispersion in that the drive is not very efficient in the transverse direction . \n therefore , the transverse mechanical dispersion is not able to compete with thermal diffusion , and thermal diffusion can not be neglected along any part of the tracer trajectory . \n the drive , however , is only effective in pore channels directed at angles less than 90@xmath50 with respect to the mean flow vector , during a fraction of time @xmath16 . \n thus , we get @xmath51 which expresses that thermal diffusion is always operative in the transverse direction , while mechanical dispersion ( with characteristic diffusion coefficient @xmath5 ) is operative only in specific channels , i.e. , for a fraction of the total time . due to the relative inefficiency of the drive \n , this approach is expected to yield less precise results than eq . \n ( [ longitudinal ] ) , and minor corrections to this expression may be needed  @xcite . \n this is left to future work . \n following the same reasoning as before , we immediately find @xmath52    we have assumed that @xmath16 ( or @xmath24 ) has the same value here as with longitudinal dispersion , based on the assumption that the geometrical flow pattern is one and the same for longitudinal and transverse dispersion , although this is only strictly true in the limit of small thermal diffusion . \n the transverse dispersion has two extreme asymptotes that are equivalent to those of longitudinal dispersion , namely : for @xmath34 , one has @xmath53 , and for @xmath36 , one has @xmath54 . \n however , here there is no ` intermediate asymptote ' , but only a very gradual transition from one asymptote to the other , specified via the factor containing @xmath55 in eq . \n ( [ transverse ] ) . \n the transition between asymptotes occurs around @xmath56 .     in dimensionless form , eq . \n ( [ transverse ] ) becomes : @xmath57    a fit of the analytic expressions to an ample collection of measurement data is shown in fig . \n [ delgado ] . \n the figure contains data from 18 different experiments on longitudinal dispersion and 15 on transverse dispersion , spanning an ample range of the schmidt number , @xmath58  @xcite . \n the parameters @xmath59 , pe@xmath47 and @xmath60 were determined from a least - squares fit to the longitudinal dataset . for the transverse dataset , \n the parameters @xmath59 and pe@xmath47 were held fixed at these values , while only @xmath61 was varied . by making a joint fit to all data , \n the obtained parameters represent mean values over the various individual datasets . \n this procedure illustrates the generic dispersional behavior , covering a range of different materials . \n but much better results , with less scatter , are to be expected for fits to an individual dataset .    to illustrate the preceding remark , fig . \n [ carvalho ] shows an example of a fit to an individual longitudinal dispersion dataset . \n the fit is rather satisfactory . \n in previous work @xcite , the available experimental data were analyzed by subdividing the range of pe numbers into individual regimes and describing the dispersional behavior in each of these sections heuristically ( using , e.g. , power - law expressions  @xcite ) .    in fig . \n [ exponent ] we show ( top ) the typical shape of the analytical curves , eqs . \n ( [ longitudinal_dl ] ) and ( [ transverse_dl ] ) , with parameters similar to those used in the examples above ( @xmath62 , pe@xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) . \n the bottom panel in this figure shows the local power - law exponent , computed as @xmath66 the evolution of the local power - law exponent with pe number displays roughly the same behavior as the successive regimes described in @xcite . \n the intermediate regime does not develop fully as the condition @xmath67pe@xmath68 is only marginally fulfilled . thus , the intermediate power - law exponent for longitudinal dispersion only reaches a value of about 1.2 , instead of the maximum of 2 predicted by the model . \n this value ( 1.2 ) is consistent with the value cited in literature for the corresponding range of pe numbers  @xcite . \n in this work , we present a unified model for longitudinal and transverse tracer dispersion in laminar flow in porous media . based on a straightforward physical argument , an analytical expression is obtained that describes the observed behavior over the full available range of laminar flow velocities or pclet numbers .    in literature , it has been customary to use power - law scalings to describe the behavior of @xmath69 , each of which being valid only in a limited range of pe values  @xcite . \n the generic appearance of power - law scalings seemed to indicate that tracer dispersion in porous media was an anomalous transport process , characterized by fractional exponents  @xcite . \n however , in view of the present work , it seems that no anomalous transport mechanisms need be invoked to explain the observed behavior . \n this is a very satisfactory situation , at least for sandbox or glass bead experiments , in which the structure of the medium is not patently fractal . \n the present work has revealed the existence of two numbers that determine the dispersion curves : the critical velocity or pclet number ( @xmath24 or pe@xmath47 ) and @xmath70 . \n pe@xmath47 is a material property that depends on the pore geometry , so that different materials will have different pe@xmath47 values . \n the exploration of the dependence of pe@xmath47 on other material properties may provide further insight into its significance . \n it is of interest to note that we generally find that pe@xmath71 , rather than equal to one , as one might expect for the transition from dominant diffusive to dominant advective transport  @xcite . \n this indicates that the scale at which this transition occurs is larger ( by a factor pe@xmath47 ) than the grain or pore scale @xmath1 . \n also note that the family of three - parameter curves given by @xmath72 and @xmath10 may explain a significant part of the observed data spread mentioned in e.g.  @xcite . \n finally , the intermediate region and the maximum value of the local longitudinal power - law exponent depend exclusively on @xmath70 . \n the analysis we present is consistent with the idea , proposed also by other authors  @xcite , that the main effects of porosity on dispersion can be modelled using a single characteristic mesoscopic length scale ( pe@xmath73 ) , and that the details of the microscopic pore geometry and inertial effects only lead to corrections to this generic behavior . \n the present modeling approach allows determining this mesoscale from the dispersion data . the present work does not pretend to provide the same modeling precision as the empirical scalings provided in the ample literature , but merely to provide improved insight into the generic behavior of tracer dispersion in driven laminar flow through porous media \n this study was carried out within the framework of dgmk ( german society for petroleum and coal science and technology ) research

{"ContextTokens": 3306, "GeneratedTokens": 104, "SynthesizedBody": "silicon photomultipliers ( sipm ) have excellent time and photon counting resolutions , among other qualities . \n however , crosstalk and afterpulsing seriously limit the performance of these photon detectors . \n these phenomena are the production of parasitic avalanches in either the pixel where a primary avalanche was triggered ( afterpulsing ) or a neighboring one ( crosstalk ) . \n their main effects are to increase both the count rate and the total charge collected for an input light pulse , e.g. , from a scintillator . \n the physical processes considered in our analysis are illustrated in figure [ fig : processes ] . in the first place , a charge carrier of a primary avalanche \n can be trapped in a crystal defect within the pixel , then when the avalanche has already been quenched , the carrier may be released triggering a new avalanche . \n we refer to this process as afterpulsing due to traps ( ap - traps ) and it has as many components as types of traps in the silicon lattice . in the second place , secondary photons of the primary avalanche may reach neighboring pixels triggering almost simultaneously other avalanches . \n this is the so - called optical crosstalk ( ct - opt ) . \n some sipms incorporate trenches filled with an optical absorber surrounding pixels to prevent this effect , but ct - opt can still be produced by photons reflected on the bottom surface of the detector . \n finally , minority carriers generated in the silicon substrate by secondary photons of the primary avalanche can diffuse back to either the primary pixel or to a neighboring one , contributing respectively to crosstalk ( ct - diff ) or afterpulsing ( ap - diff ) . \n the ct - diff is usually referred to as delayed crosstalk because of the relatively long diffusion times , in contrast to the ct - opt , which is also called prompt crosstalk . \n we presented in @xcite an experimental method and an analytical model to describe the ct - opt in a sipm fabricated by hamamatsu . in the present work \n , our study has been extended with new measurements for the same sipm as well as for a second sipm , also from hamamatsu . \n in addition , we have constructed a statistical model accounting for ap - traps , ct - diff and ap - diff , and preliminary measurements to validate it are shown . \n a similar analysis of afterpulsing and ct - diff in a stmicroelectronics sipm has recently been presented in @xcite . \n the experimental method has been described in detail in @xcite , and only an overview is given here . \n the setup consists of the sipm with the associated bias circuit , a fast amplifier , and a digital oscilloscope to register and store the signals for later analysis . \n two sipms from hamamatsu were tested : the s10362 - 11 - 100c ( the one previously used in @xcite ) and the s10362 - 33 - 100c . \n both detectors have a pixel pitch of 100  @xmath0 m and basically the same characteristics , but the first sipm has 100 pixels while the second one has 900 pixels . \n measurements were performed at dark conditions , that is , an only primary pixel is expected to be triggered at a time . \n so far , we have characterized the intrinsic crosstalk and afterpulsing ( i.e. , no scintillator was attached to the detector ) at room temperature . \n an algorithm has been developed to perform a detailed waveform analysis of the recorded signals . \n this dedicated software calculates numerically the deconvolution of the signal with a negative exponential function that describes the decay of pulses ( time constant of 23  ns for both detectors ) . this way , \n pulses are identified as distinct peaks in the deconvolved signal even if they overlap in the original signal . \n the position and height of the deconvolution peak provide us relative measures of the arrival time and amplitude of each pulse . \n the algorithm resolves and measures the parameters of pulses as close as 6  ns . \n in addition , events with two or more pulses with smaller time differences ( down to @xmath1  ns ) are identified by analyzing the shape and width at threshold level of the deconvolved signal . \n this allowed us to characterize separately the nearly instantaneous ct - opt and the other phenomena that result in delayed secondary pulses . \n a more precise measurement of the pulse amplitude is obtained as the pulse height with baseline substraction . to do that \n , the software performs an exponential extrapolation of the original signal in a small region prior to each pulse . \n the ct - opt gives rise to pulses with amplitudes two or more times higher than that corresponding to only one triggered pixel . \n the relative intensities of the pulse amplitude spectrum measured at dark conditions thus provides the probability distribution @xmath2 of the total number @xmath3 of simultaneously triggered pixels per primary avalanche , i.e. , @xmath4 ct - opt excitations . \n we produced this spectrum using the pulse height with baseline substraction to optimize the resolution in @xmath3 . \n in addition , quality cuts were applied to reject low - amplitude pulses due to pixels that were triggered while being recharged after the last avalanche breakdown . \n we presented in @xcite a statistical model based on the assumption that secondary photons can only reach a certain neighborhood of pixels around the primary one . \n cascades of ct - opt excitations propagating through the whole array of pixels were included , but taking into account that pixels that have already been triggered can not be triggered twice . \n the @xmath2 distribution was then calculated by identifying all the ct - opt `` histories '' that contribute to each probability considering four possible arrangements of neighbors : the 4 nearest neighbors , the 8 nearest neighbors , the 8 l - connected neighbors and all neighbors ( see @xcite for details ) . for simplicity \n , we assumed the same ct - opt probability for any neighbor and ignored the boundaries of the array of pixels for the calculations . \n analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the @xmath2 distribution were also obtained .    in figure \n [ fig : crosstalk ] , the model predictions for the four arrangements of neighbors are compared with the experimental probabilities obtained at a given bias voltage for both the s10362 -

11 - 100c detector as a function of the overall ct - opt probability , defined as @xmath6 . \n the overvoltage , i.e. , bias voltage minus breakdown voltage , at which measurements were performed is also indicated for each data point ( the overall ct - opt probability grows quadratically with overvoltage ) .    the comparisons shown in figures [ fig : crosstalk ] and [ fig : crosstalk_v ] reveal that the only model consistent with our experimental data is the one assuming that ct - opt solely takes place in the 4 nearest neighbors of each pixel . \n this is the case for both tested detectors , which have different array sizes . \n therefore , it can also be concluded that border effects are unimportant to describe ct - opt effects at these conditions . \n at dark conditions , the distribution of the pulse arrival time measured with respect to the previous pulse is a combination of the contributions of both uncorrelated dark noise and correlated secondary pulses ( i.e. , ap - traps , ap - diff and ct - diff ) . \n since we were interested in measuring the probability of secondary pulses per primary avalanche , we obtained this time distribution selecting pairs of pulses in which the first one ( the primary ) has an amplitude corresponding to one only triggered pixel , that is , without ct - opt . \n in addition , this first pulse of the pair was required to be at least 500  ns far from previous pulses to avoid mixing contributions of secondary pulses from different primaries . \n assuming that the total number of secondary pulses of each type per primary avalanche is poisson distributed , the above time distribution can be expressed as    @xmath7 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\left[r_{\\rm dc}+\\sum_i\\lambda_i\\cdot f_i(t)\\right]\\cdot{\\rm d}t\\ , , \\label{eq : afterpulsing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8  ns is the minimum time difference allowed between pulses due to analysis limitations , @xmath9 is the dark count rate , @xmath10 is the mean number of secondary pulses of type @xmath11 per primary avalanche , and @xmath12 is the corresponding normalized time distribution . \n the details of this model , in particular the parameterization of the @xmath12 functions , are still under progress and will be explained in a paper in preparation . \n only the general aspects are given below . \n the @xmath13 distribution for ap - traps was characterized by the product of three factors : a negative exponential distribution describing the release of trapped carriers ; the exponential pixel recharging after the primary avalanche , which is proportional to both the gain and the probability of the secondary avalanche ; and the @xmath14-dependent fraction of afterpulses ( of any type ) with amplitudes above the detection threshold applied in the analysis software . \n the last two factors , which are also applicable to the @xmath13 distribution for ap - diff , account for the steep break of the experimental time distribution between 20 and 30  ns ( see figure [ fig : afterpulsing ] ) and were determined from the time - amplitude information of afterpulses with short delay . \n a monte carlo simulation was carried out to describe the timing and relative contributions of the ap - diff and ct - diff effects ( bottom plot of figure [ fig : processes ] ) . \n values for the physical parameters related to the emission and absorption of secondary photons , the diffusion of minority carriers and the layer configuration of the chip were varied within a wide interval around typical data taken from the literature ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . \n preliminary simulation results showed that the transient time distribution can be properly described by the product of the exponential decay of the number of minority carriers due to recombination mechanisms and a negative power law . \n also , the relative contributions of ap - diff and ct - diff were found to be strongly dependent on the pixel pitch . \n for instance , for a very small pixel pitch of 10  @xmath0 m , the ap - diff component is negligible compared to the ct - diff one , while both components are significant for a pixel pitch of 100  @xmath0 m ( present case ) . \n a fit of our model to experimental data for the s10362 - 11 - 100c detector at an overvoltage of @xmath1  v is shown in figure [ fig : afterpulsing ] , where the contributions of the different types of secondary pulses and of dark counts are represented by thin lines . \n the corresponding accumulated contributions are also shown in the inset of the figure in a linear scale . \n this result corresponds to a given set of parameters assumed in the above simulation , which involves that the @xmath13 distributions and the relative contributions of ap - diff and ct - diff are fixed ( i.e. , only one @xmath15 parameter for both components is let free in the fit ) . in this case , \n two ap - traps components with different mean release time @xmath16 were necessary to describe the data : a fast component with @xmath17  ns and a slow one with @xmath18  ns . \n on the other hand , when letting all the parameters related to ap - diff and ct - diff free , good quality fits were also obtained even omitting any ap - traps component . \n similar results were obtained for the s10362 - 33 - 100c detector ( not shown here ) . \n we are making the simulation more realistic in order to be more restrictive on the fitting parameters . \n ns are also shown in the inset ( linear scale ) . ]    even though the number of ap components has not been determined yet , the sum of the @xmath15 parameters of all the ap components was found to be nearly independent of the assumptions made on the fit . \n the @xmath15 parameter associated to the ct - diff was roughly fit independent as well , because it is basically determined by data at @xmath19  ns , where ap contributions can be neglected . \n these @xmath15 parameters , i.e. , the one for the total contribution of afterpulsing and the one for ct - diff , are represented in figure [ fig : afterpulsing_v ] as a function of overvoltage , showing a pure quadratic behavior , as expected . \n parameters , but using the @xmath13 distributions determined in the fit shown in figure [ fig : afterpulsing ] at a given bias voltage . \n appropriate corrections were applied to account for the overvoltage dependence of the detection threshold effects on the afterpulsing measurements . ]    . \n the uncertainties are statistical only . ] \n we have developed an experimental method based on a waveform analysis to characterize the crosstalk and afterpulsing in sipms . \n results were obtained for the s10362 - 11 - 100c and s10362 - 33 - 100c detectors from hamamatsu at dark conditions and room temperature . \n measurements of optical crosstalk have been compared with an analytical model that we presented in a previous publication . \n our data for both detectors are consistent with the hypothesis that optical crosstalk is only possible between adjacent pixels .    a statistical model of afterpulsing and \n delayed crosstalk has been constructed including a detailed parameterization of the time distributions of the different types of secondary pulses . \n our preliminary results show a significant probability of afterpulsing in both detectors , although the characterization of its components is still under study . \n the delayed crosstalk was also found to be important , mostly at short time . \n these studies are being extended to characterize other sipms and for a larger variety of conditions . \n we intend to apply our models to describe crosstalk and afterpulsing effects on particular experimental cases . \n this work was supported by mineco ( fpa2012 -

{"ContextTokens": 2106, "GeneratedTokens": 231, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , two sets of observations have allowed us to gain a better understanding of the interaction between agns and their host galaxies . \n these are observations of high  velocity wide  angle winds emanating from the vicinity of the smbh , which have been detected in a large fraction of agns ; and detection of kpc  scale quasi  spherical outflows in active galaxies , with enough power and mass flow to sweep their host galaxies clear of gas . \n these outflows have kinetic power equal to a few percent of the eddington luminosity of the central black hole and their momentum flow rate is approximately an order of magnitude greater than @xmath7 .    in this paper , we show how the two types of flows can be explained within the framework of agn wind feedback . \n radiation pressure from an accreting smbh expels gas in form of a wind from the nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , which then pushes the ambient gas in the host galaxy and produces an outflow . in recent work \n @xcite we have shown that large  scale energy  driven flows ( see section [ sec : outflow ] ) can indeed drive much of the interstellar gas out of a galaxy bulge on a dynamical timescale @xmath8  yr , leaving it red and dead . \n the remaining mass of the bulge is then similar to the value set by the observed black  hole \n mass relation ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n the observable features of such outflows  velocities , kinetic powers and mass and momentum flow rates  are consistent with observations . \n therefore agn outflows appear capable of sweeping galaxies clear of gas . \n radiation pressure from an agn accreting at close to its eddington limit can expel gas from the vicinity of the nucleus with a momentum rate @xmath9 as the wind on average has scattering optical depth @xmath10 and absorbs all of the radiation momentum . \n this creates a mildly relativistic diffuse wind ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the accretion radiative efficiency * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n observations of blueshifted x  ray iron absorption lines corresponding to velocities @xmath14 reveal that the majority of quasars produce such winds . \n the winds have momentum and energy rates @xmath15 \n it is clear that the wind has enough kinetic power to drive the observed large scale outflow , provided that it can efficiently transfer this power to the ism . in order for this to happen \n , two conditions must be satified . \n first , most of the sightlines from the smbh must be covered with diffuse medium . \n second , the wind can not cool efficiently . as the wind hits the ism , it shocks and heats to @xmath16 \n k. at this temperature , the most efficient cooling process is inverse compton scattering of the photons in the agn radiation field @xcite . \n the efficiency of this process drops with increasing shock radius , thus the cooling timescale increases as @xmath17 . \n since the outflow velocity does not depend strongly on radius @xcite , the flow timescale only increases as @xmath18 . \n therefore , there is a critical radius , @xmath19  kpc , within which the shock can be cooled efficiently , whereas outside most of its energy is retained and transferred to the outflow . \n the two cases are called momentum  driven and energy  driven flows , respectively ; their salient features are shown schematically in figure [ fig : outflow ] . \n an efficiently cooled shocked wind gas is compressed to high density and radiates away almost all of its original kinetic energy , retaining and communicating only its pressure , which is equal to the pre  shock ram pressure @xmath20 , to the host ism . \n for an isothermal ism density distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath21 and gas fraction @xmath22 ( the ratio of gas density to background potential density ) the behaviour of the flow depends on the black hole mass @xmath23 @xcite . for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the wind momentum is too weak to drive away \n the swept  up ism , and the flow stalls . for @xmath28 \n the wind drives the swept  up ism far from the nucleus , quenching its own gas supply and further accretion . \n therefore , @xmath29 represents an approximate upper limit to the smbh mass distribution ( see * ?

[ msig ] ) . \n the outflow persists for an order of magnitude longer than the duration of the quasar outburst that is driving it , and reaches radii of @xmath39  pc . \n it is evident that energy \n driven outflows are capable of sweeping gas out of galaxies , quenching further star formation and establishing the smbh  bulge mass relationship @xcite . \n the solutions ( [ ve ] , [ dotr ] ) describe the motion of the contact discontinuity see figure [ fig : outflow ] ) . \n outflows are usually observed in molecular gas , which is embedded in the outflowing shell ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) , which moves with velocity @xmath40 from adiabatic shock conditions , using @xmath41 , and the mass outflow rate is @xmath42 assuming @xmath43 . if the agn luminosity is still close to eddington and @xmath44 , the mass loading factor ( @xmath45 ) and mass outflow rates are @xmath46 if the central quasar is no longer active , @xmath47 is lower by @xmath48 , with @xmath49 given by eq . \n ( [ dotr ] ) . \n one can show from equations ( [ vout ] ) and ( [ eq : flmout ] ) that @xmath50 , i.e. most of the wind kinetic energy is transferred to the outflow , as expected for energy driving ( more precisely , while the quasar is active , the outflow contains @xmath51rds of the total energy ) . \n we can also derive an expression for the momentum flow rate @xmath52 in the outflow : @xmath53    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first two columns : observed mass flow rate ( in @xmath54  yr@xmath5 ) and velocity ( in km s@xmath5 ) of large  scale outflows in molecular ( mrk231 , iras 08572 + 3915 and iras 131205453 ) and warm ionised gas ( mrk1157 ) . \n middle three columns : quantities derived from observations . \n last three columns : mass flow rate , velocity and mass loading factor derived from our equations ( [ vout ] ) and ( [ eq : flmout ] ) . all derived quantities show good agreement with those observed and with each other .    references : @xmath55 - @xcite ; @xmath56 - ; @xmath57 - @xcite .

{"ContextTokens": 3271, "GeneratedTokens": 134, "SynthesizedBody": "exponential sensitivity to small perturbations is a defining property of classical chaos . determining whether quantum systems exhibit the same property is important for understanding both quantum chaos as such and its role in the foundations of statistical mechanics . \n many studies have been looking for static or dynamic manifestations of sensitivity to small perturbations in quantum systems that have chaotic classical limit @xcite . \n there are conflicting opinions about whether nonintegrable quantum systems can exhibit exponential sensitivity to perturbations . \n the often - mentioned argument in favour of the absence of exponential sensitivity is that quantum mechanics is intrinsically linear , and , therefore , quantum amplitudes , which define all measurable properties , are not subject to nonlinear dynamics , which , in turn is required for the onset of classical chaos . moreover , in bound quantum systems , the discreteness of the energy spectrum makes the evolution of any observable periodic or quasi - periodic in contrast to the random behavior generated by the lyapunov instability in the classical domain . \n a related argument is that the heisenberg uncertainty relation does not allow one to define phase space trajectories , which , in turn , makes the notion of diverging phase space trajectories meaningless .    on the other hand \n , it is widely believed that the classical behavior should be restored from the quantum laws of motion in the limit of large quantum numbers . \n if a quantum system has a chaotic classical limit , and if its initial wave function is a very narrow wavepacket , then the subsequent evolution of this wavepacket should follow the classical trajectory for a finite time interval and hence exhibit hypersensitivity to the perturbations of initial conditions . \n the late - time recurrences exhibited by the wavefunction due to the discreteness of the energy levels do not contradict the possible initial instability . \n this is similar to the situation in a bounded classical chaotic system where the local lyapunov instability in the phase space does not prevent two initially diverging trajectories from coming arbitrary close to each other at a later time @xcite . for a macroscopic number of particles , astronomical time scales \n will not be sufficient to observe the above recurrences - quantum or classical . from a somewhat different perspective \n , it can also be argued that the linearity of quantum mechanics should suppress sensitivity to small perturbations only as much as the linearity of liouville s equation does for classical systems @xcite . \n more discussion of related issues can be found , for example , in ref . \n @xcite .    particularly difficult in the above respect \n are nonintegrable macroscopic systems of spins 1/2 , where macroscopic observables , such as the total magnetization , are expected to behave classically , but the individual microscopic constituents , i.e. spins 1/2 , are as far from the classical limit as a quantum system can only be . \n it is natural in the context of this difficulty to adopt the following approach . \n one first substitutes spins 1/2 with classical spins and identifies the signatures of microscopic chaos in the behaviour of a macroscopic observable of the resulting classical system . \n then one looks at the behavior of the same observable for the original spin-1/2 system to see whether it exhibits similar signature . \n the task of identifying macroscopic signatures of microscopic chaos even for purely classical systems has been a long - standing challenge for the statistical physics community . \n one prominent approach was to try to extract the value of kolmogorov - sinai entropy ( the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents of the system ) from the behaviour of a macroscopic observable @xcite . \n this effort did not bring a conclusive outcome , because the true value of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy for macroscopic systems is not accessible either numerically or experimentally@xcite . \n another approach was to look for the the exponential tails of relaxation functions@xcite and power spectra@xcite as signatures of microscopic chaos . \n it led to a number of experimentally verified predictions@xcite . \n however , the difficulty of this approach is that , even though the above tails are indeed generic for chaotic many - particle systems , no quantitative connection is known between the exponential decay constants of these tails and the primary characteristics of chaos , namely , lyapunov exponents of the system . \n recently , we were able to make progress on the above agenda by first investigating the lyapunov spectra of classical spin lattices@xcite and then identifying an experimentally feasible manipulation of a classical spin system that would be able to access system s largest lyapunov exponent@xcite . \n this manipulation is a weakly perturbed time reversal known in statistical physics as `` loschmidt echo '' @xcite and in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) as  magic echo\"@xcite . \n the outcome of our analysis was that loschmidt echoes in classical spin systems exhibit exponential sensitivity to small perturbations of perfect time reversal . \n the constant characterising this sensitivity is equal to twice the value of the largest lyapunov exponent of the system . at the same time \n , we have shown that the corresponding spin-1/2 systems are not exponentially sensitive to small perturbations even in the macroscopic limit , and , therefore , lyapunov exponents can not be defined for them . \n the above conclusions were supported by numerical simulations of loschmidt echoes for spin-1/2 and for classical spin systems . \n the question then arises how the transition from non - exponential to exponential sensitivity of loschmidt echoes proceeds . \n it is known@xcite that the classical limit of quantum spin systems can be obtained by increasing the quantum spin number with the proper normalization of spin operators . \n as far as the loschmidt echoes are concerned , our qualitative reasoning in ref . \n @xcite was that spin-1/2 systems are not exponentially sensitive to small perturbations , because one can not slightly perturb an individual spin projection : any small perturbation creates a superposition of completely unperturbed state and a strongly perturbed state where the spin projection changes by 1 , which means that the spin 1/2 flips entirely . from the above perspective \n , a larger quantum spin @xmath1 has @xmath2 possible values , which means that , if the spin projection is perturbed by 1 , then there is still a range of values for the difference between unperturbed and perturbed evolution to grow before reaching the maximum value of the order of @xmath3 . \n therefore , we expect that the range of nearly exponential sensitivity of loschmidt echoes for systems of macroscopic number of spins @xmath1 to be of the order of @xmath4 . \n the goal of the present article is to verify numerically the presence of the above nearly exponential growth numerically . \n ( 88 , 107 ) ( 3 , 55 ) ( 3 , 0 ) ( 2 , 50)(b ) ( 2 , 100)(a )    in the following , we compute loschmidt echoes for quantum ( @xmath5 ) and classical spin chains consisting of 6 spins with periodic boundary conditions . \n the spins interact with the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents either the quantum operator of the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) projection of a quantum spin on @xmath12 lattice site or the corresponding projection of a vector of length 1 representing a classical spin . \n we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the classical hamiltonian , while for the quantum hamiltonian we divide these values by the factor @xmath15 to match the characteristic timescale of the dynamics with the classical counterpart . \n our loschmidt echo manipulation is similar to nmr magic echo @xcite . \n the system is initially slightly polarized in the @xmath9-direction in the vicinity of the infinite temperature equilibrium and then allowed to evolve under the action of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) for a certain time @xmath16 . at time @xmath16 , the sign of the hamiltonian is reversed , and the system evolves under the action of the reversed hamiltonian for another time interval @xmath16 . \n afterwards , the value of the total magnetization in the @xmath9- direction @xmath17 is registered .    in real experiments , \n the reversal of the sign of the hamiltonian is not perfect @xcite . in our simulations , we intentionally introduce violations of the perfect time reversal by two methods :    \\(a ) we apply small random rotations to the spins of the system at the moment of the hamiltonian reversal . specifically , each spin is rotated around the @xmath11-axis by an angle randomly selected from the interval @xmath18 $ ] . \n \\(b ) we add a small random - field perturbation @xmath19 to the hamiltonian @xmath20 during the backward evolution . \n the fields @xmath21 are randomly selected from the interval @xmath22 $ ] . \n we characterize the loschmidt echo response by function @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the averages computed with respect to the probability distributions or density matrices for the initial and the final states of the system respectively . \n it was shown in ref . \n @xcite that for sufficiently small perturbations in chaotic classical spin systems , there is a regime of exponential departure from the perfect time reversal : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system . the above regime sets in after time @xmath16 of the order of @xmath28 required to suppress contributions from smaller lyapunov exponents \n . the smallness of the initial perturbations should be such that @xmath29 in the regime exponential growth . \n eventually , as @xmath16 increases , the system leaves the regime of small perturbations and enters the saturation regime characterized by @xmath30 .    for quantum systems , \n the initial perturbation should be large enough to ( ideally ) make the overlap of perturbed and unperturbed wave functions equal to zero , but , at the same time , small enough to avoid entering the saturation regime immediately . \n the former restriction is of particular concern for finite - size numerical simulations : together with the latter one , it leaves a rather limited growth range for the regime @xmath29 . for macroscopic systems , \n the former restriction is consistent with virtually any physically realizable small perturbations of either external fields or the interaction hamiltonian . \n we computed @xmath31 for the ring of 6 classical spins and the ring of 6 quantum spins @xmath32 described above . in both cases , \n the initial nonequilibrium polarization along the @xmath9-axis was equal to 5% of the maximum polarization . for the classical system , we averaged over an ensemble of @xmath33 different initial conditions for both perturbations ( a ) and ( b ) . \n for the quantum system , it was sufficient , based on the recent results on quantum typicality@xcite , to use one initial quantum superposition state . \n the equations of motion in both the classical and the quantum cases are propagated numerically by a fourth -

of - plane direction @xcite . \n it is anticipated that both materials host quantum spin hall @xcite , quantum anomalous hall @xcite , and valley polarized quantum anomalous hall @xcite phases . \n silicene has been prepared on various substrates @xcite , while it is questionable whether it can exist in freestanding form ( which also applies to germanene ) . \n this is the reason why various theoretical results on the interaction with possible substrates are found in the literature , including the insulator @xmath1-bn @xcite , the semiconductor gaas @xcite , and the metals ca @xcite , ag @xcite , and ir @xcite . \n while on metallic substrates the dirac behavior of silicene typically is not maintained @xcite , transition metal dichalcogenides are characterized by a weak interaction @xcite . from a different perspective , the latter class of materials is receiving great interest in recent days due to the fact that it realizes band gaps in a technologically attractive range @xcite . \n transition metal dichalcogenides also have proven to be suitable hosts for graphene @xcite and it has been demonstrated that the soc of graphene can be enhanced by three orders of magnitude to about 17 mev on ws@xmath0 due to proximity effects @xcite . \n valleytronics is emerging as a new and exciting area of research , aiming to exploit the valley degree of freedom in dirac materials @xcite . \n an essential prerequisite of valleytronics , of course , is the availability of materials with valley polarization , i.e. , the energetical degeneracy of the valleys at the high symmetry k and k@xmath2 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone must be lifted . while this is difficult to realize in graphene , the stronger soc and buckled lattice of silicene / germanene provide an avenue to access and control the valley degree of freedom @xcite . \n spin and valley polarization can be achieved by means of doping and decoration with certain @xmath3 or @xmath4 transition metals @xcite as well as by an external electric field @xcite . \n however , interaction with the substrate is typically detrimental , because the electronic states are perturbed @xcite . besides the need to reduce the interaction with the substrate , it would be a great advantage if the substrate itself can be used to induce the required valley polarization , in order to reduce the complexity of the system . in this context , we show in the present work that proximity effects between silicene / germanene and ws@xmath0 can be utilized to obtain a suitable platform to explore spin and valley physics . \n we first discuss the band characteristics and spin splitting in silicene / germanene induced by the strong soc in ws@xmath0 and afterwards demonstrate that the spin polarization in f - doped ws@xmath0 generates spin - valley polarization .    : ( a ) top view and ( b ) side view.,scaledwidth=50.0% ] \n we use the vienna ab - initio simulation package to perform first - principles calculations based on density functional theory @xcite . \n the exchange correlation potential is described in the generalized gradient approximation , using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof scheme , and the plane wave cutoff energy is set to a sufficiently large value of 475 ev . \n moreover , the soc is taken into account in all calculations and the van der waals interaction is incorporated using the dft - d3 method @xcite . \n the optimized lattice constants of silicene , germanene , and ws@xmath0 are 3.86  , 4.05  , and 3.18  . in order to reduce the lattice mismatch to 2.9% and 1.9% , respectively , \n a @xmath5 supercells of silicene and germanene are placed on top of a @xmath6 supercell of ws@xmath0 . \n vacuum slabs of 15   thickness are used to obtain two - dimensional models . for the brillouin zone integration , monkhorst - pack @xmath7 and @xmath8 k - meshes \n are employed in the structure relaxations and band structure calculations , respectively . \n we achieve in each case at least an energy convergence of @xmath9 ev and an atomic force convergence of @xmath10 ev /  . \n the optimized crystal structure of silicene on top of monolayer ws@xmath0 is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] . a corresponding figure for germanene looks very similar and therefore is not shown . for different stackings of silicene \n / germanene on top of ws@xmath0 ( different lateral shifts ) we obtain very small ( few mev ) total energy differences , showing that the materials can easily slide on each other . \n the distance between the two component materials turns out to be 3.13   in the case of silicene and 2.90 in the case of germanene . \n while the buckling of silicene is hardly affected by the interaction with ws@xmath0 ( 0.46  ) , it is slightly enhanced to 0.74   for germanene ( 0.65   in the freestanding case ) . \n the smaller interlayer distance and the enhancement of the buckling demonstrate that ws@xmath0 interacts more with germanene than with silicene , though the coupling is still weak . in order to quantify the interaction , \n we calculate the binding energy @xmath11 , given by the total energies of the combined system , freestanding silicene / germanene , and freestanding monolayer ws@xmath0 . \n furthermore , @xmath12 is the number of si / ge atoms . \n we obtain values of @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 mev for silicene and germanene , respectively , confirming our conclusion that the interaction is stronger in the latter case .      the electronic band structures in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] show that both silicene and germanene on ws@xmath0 maintain a linear dispersion of the @xmath15 bands in the vicinity of the fermi energy . \n this is the case both when the soc is neglected and when it is taken into account . without soc we obtain band gaps of 29 mev and 38 mev , see fig . \n [ fig : fig2](a / c ) , for silicene and germanene on ws@xmath0 , respectively , which is comparable to the thermal energy at room temperature . \n the reason for the opening of a band gap is the broken inversion symmetry in the presence of ws@xmath0 . \n soc lifts the spin degeneracy at the k and k@xmath2 points and results in spin splittings of 8 mev and 32 mev in the valence band of silicene and germanene , respectively , and 3 mev and 19 mev in the conduction band , see fig . \n [ fig : fig2](b / d ) . \n the effect of the soc is enhanced in the presence of ws@xmath0 as a consequence of tiny hybridization between the si / ge @xmath16 and w @xmath17 orbitals . \n ws@xmath0 indeed is characterized by very strong soc , as reflected by spin splittings of 431 mev ( valence band ) and 29 mev ( conduction band ) in a freestanding monolayer @xcite . \n the enhancement mechanism by proximity soc is similar to the case of graphene on transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite , but due to the buckling of silicene / germanene the magnitude of spin splitting here is different in the valence and conduction bands . as a consequence of the lifted spin degeneracy , we obtain reduced band gaps of 23 mev and 14 mev for silicene and germanene on ws@xmath0 , respectively .      in the following \n we will argue that silicene / germanene on f - doped ws@xmath0 develops energetically inequivalent band edges at the k and k@xmath2 points , i.e. , spin - valley polarization . \n the advantage of doping the substrate instead of the electronically active material ( the material giving rise to the states close to the fermi energy ) is that impurity scattering is avoided . \n specifically , we replace one s atom in the @xmath6 supercell of ws@xmath0 with an f atom , corresponding to a doping concentration of 2% , in order to simulate the dilute doping limit . \n an earlier study has shown that substitutional f doping at the s site is possible in mos@xmath0 @xcite . \n we calculate the binding energies @xmath18 and obtain values of 4.3 ev for x = f and 6.1 ev for x = s , where @xmath19 is the energy of a relaxed ws@xmath0 monolayer with one s vacancy , @xmath20 is the energy of an x atom , and @xmath21 is the energy of a relaxed ws@xmath0 monolayer with one s atom replaced by an x atom . \n since the binding energies of f and s are similar , it is likely that substitutional f doping at the s site is also possible in ws@xmath0 . \n experimental support for this conclusion comes from the realization of p doping in mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 @xcite and cl doping in mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 @xcite . by comparing spin degenerate and polarized calculations for the doped supercell \n , we obtain an energy gain of 134 mev in the spin polarized case and a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 . \n next to the f atom the charge transfer from the three neighbouring w atoms is reduced from two electrons to one electron ( f@xmath23 state instead of s@xmath24 state ) . \n the remaining electron is located on one of the three w atoms and gives rise to the spatial distribution of spin density shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] . \n we obtain a small f magnetic moment of 0.05 @xmath22 , which is also reflected by fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] .    . \n corresponding results for interaction with f - doped ws@xmath0 are given in ( c / d ) . \n yellow and red colors represent charge accumulation and depletion , respectively . \n the plot takes into account the si / ge @xmath16 , w @xmath17 , and s @xmath16 states , showing the @xmath25 electrons / bohr@xmath26 isosurface.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      we obtain for silicene and germanene on top of f - doped ws@xmath0 smaller distances between the component materials , 3.06   and 2.79  , respectively , as compared to the case of pristine ws@xmath0 . \n this fact can be attributed to the additional magnetic coupling . \n a comparison of the interaction in the cases of pristine and f - doped ws@xmath0 is given in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] in terms of charge density difference plots . \n while the charge redistribution in the van der waals gap is only slightly modified after f doping , compare the top to the bottom row of fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] , the dopant atom is strongly affected , supporting the idea of magnetic coupling . \n we obtain still a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 , carried largely by one w atom . \n this atom realizes a larger distance ( 2.70  ) to the f atom than the other two neighbouring w atoms ( 2.30  ) , very similar to the situation without silicene / germanene . \n in addition , the f magnetic moment is reduced to @xmath27 @xmath22 . \n the band structure of silicene / germanene shows significant alterations in contact with f - doped ws@xmath0 , see fig . \n [ fig : fig5 ] . without soc , \n the spin splitting in the valence band is enhanced to 36/91 mev and that in the conduction band to 25/9 mev . \n this fact is expected to simply reduce the band gaps , however , we observe in both cases the creation of an in - gap band just below the fermi energy . \n analysis of the orbital character of this band shows that it arises almost purely from the f impurity . \n for the 2 k and 2 k@xmath2 points not covered by fig . \n [ fig : fig5](a / b ) . \n the soc is neglected ( left ) or taken into account ( right ) . \n the f impurity band is shown in black color . \n , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +   for the 2 k and 2 k@xmath2 points not covered by fig . \n [ fig : fig5](a / b ) . \n the soc is neglected ( left ) or taken into account ( right ) . \n the f impurity band is shown in black color . \n , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    broken time - reversal symmetry due to the spin polarization in f - doped ws@xmath0 induces spin - valley polarization in silicene / germanene when the soc is taken into account , see fig . \n [ fig : fig5](b / d ) . \n specifically , the spin splitting in the valence / conduction band ( not counting the f impurity band ) is smaller / larger at the k than at the k@xmath2 point . for silicene \n we obtain values of 28 mev and 40 mev for the valence band and 27 and 24 mev for the conduction band , respectively . \n more importantly , valley polarization of 7 mev is created in the silicene valence band and one of 2 mev in the conduction band . for germanene these effects \n are enhanced , with spin splittings of 74 mev and 111 mev ( valence band ) as well as 4 mev and 5 mev ( conduction band ) at the k and k@xmath2 points , respectively . \n the valley polarization here amounts to 28 mev and 16 mev for the germanene valence and conduction bands , respectively , which opens a route to spin - valley polarization even at room temperature . in order to demonstrate that the k and k@xmath2 valleys are virtually not affected by the symmetry breaking in f - doped ws@xmath0 , \n as they belong almost purely to silicene / germanene , we show in fig . \n [ fig : fig6 ] for the silicene system the band structures of the 2 k and 2 k@xmath2 points not covered by fig . \n [ fig : fig5](a / b ) . \n we observe no lifting of the valley degeneracy in the case without soc and exactly the same valley structure as before in the case with soc . \n we also have checked that the spin hybridization at the valleys is negligible . moreover , while the f impurity band is located next to the fermi energy , the f states are spatially separated from the si / ge states and therefore do not limit exploitation of the spin - valley polarization .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that silicene and germanene in proximity to monolayer ws@xmath0 develop sizeable band gaps ( due to inversion symmetry breaking ) and spin splittings ( due to proximity soc ) . \n f doping of ws@xmath0 results in spin polarization with a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 , since the charge transfer from the three neighbouring w atoms is reduced . \n the remaining spin polarized electron is largely located on one w atom . \n our main finding is that f - doped ws@xmath0 makes it possible to achieve substantial spin - valley polarization in silicene and germanene . \n in contrast to silicene , germanene even can enable valleytronics devices operating at ambient conditions . \n t. georgiou , r. jalil , b. d. belle , l. britnell , r. v. gorbachev , s. v. morozov , y. j. kim , a. gholinia , s. j. haigh , o. makarovsky , l. eaves , l. a. ponomarenko , a. k. geim , k. s. novoselov , and a. mishchenko , nat . nanotech . \n * 8 * , 100 ( 2013 ) . \n a. avsar , j. y. tan , t. taychatanapat , j. balakrishnan , g. k. w. koon , y. yeo , j. lahiri , a. carvalho , a. s. rodin , e. c. t. ofarrel , g. eda , a. h. castro neto , and b. zyilmaz , nat . commun . * 5 * , 4875 ( 2014 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 548141563086, "RequestID": "15ae848596bd9435c15aeb863f0e93baa316a9bb", "TotalTokens": 3838}
{"ContextTokens": 2387, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "for many years people have wondered about how our sun compares to other stars and to whether our existence is related to special properties of our solar system . \n angelo secchi compared the sun to many bright stars ( secchi 1868 ) . \n he classified the stars in three types : type i which is the modern class a and early f , type ii which are m stars , and type iii comprising modern class g , k and early f , and called by secchi _ tipo solare _ \n ( solar type ) , due to their spectroscopic similarity to the sun . \n furthermore , he concluded that `` _ le stelle di questo terzo tipo mostrano di avere una composizione identica a quella del nostro sole _ '' ( secchi 1868 ) , meaning that solar type stars have identical composition to our sun . \n further works ( e.g. payne 1925 ; edvardsson et al . 1993 ; reddy et al . \n 2003 ) have not conclusively shown whether the sun has a normal composition or not , due to the relatively large ( @xmath2 0.05 ) remaining systematic errors ( gustafsson 2008 ) . \n thus , for more than 140 years father secchi s conclusion on the `` universal '' solar composition of the sun has remained valid . in order to make further progress , it is important to eliminate many of the systematic errors ( @xmath3 0.05 - 0.1 dex ) that plague stellar chemical composition analyses ( asplund 2005 ) . \n solar analogs , which are g0-g5 dwarfs , and solar twins , stars almost identical to the sun ( cayrel de strobel 1996 ) , are important in this context , in particular solar twins , because due to their similarity to the sun a highly differential analysis will cancel most systematic errors .    thus , the first step in accurate comparisons of the sun to other stars is to find solar twins . \n after many years of intensive search ( see review by cayrel de strobel 1996 ) , porto de mello & da silva ( 1997 ) found the first solar twin , 18 sco [ hd 146233 ] , which is much closer to the sun than previous candidates like 16 cyg b [ hd 186427 ] ( see e.g. fig . 2 of melndez et al . 2006 ) . \n more recent surveys have largely increased the number of solar twins in the field ( melndez et al . \n 2006 ; melndez & ramrez 2007 ; takeda et al . 2007 ; \n melndez et al . \n 2009 ; ramrez et al . 2009 ) as well as in the open cluster m67 ( pasquini et al . \n the most productive survey at high resolution ( r @xmath3 60,000 - 110,000 ) is being undertaken by our group . \n most northern solar twin candidates were observed with the 2.7 m telescope at the mcdonald observatory , and complemented with data obtained at the keck observatory . \n the southern targets were observed using the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope at las campanas , complemented with recent ( august 2009 ) vlt observations .    our solar twin project started in 2002 , when only one solar twin was known . in order to improve our chances of finding solar twins , we first expanded the color - temperature relations of alonso et al . \n ( 1996 ) to other photometric systems ( melndez & ramrez 2003 ) , allowing us to use existing photometry in other systems ( e.g. geneva ) to select the best targets . \n we later improved the calibrations adding more stars and including new homogeneous systems like tycho ( @xmath4 ) and 2mass ( ramrez & melndez 2005 ) . \n although our first solar twin proposal in 2004 did not fly , the same year a more `` exciting '' proposal on li in halo stars was granted a few nights with keck . a small amount of that observing time was devoted to twin candidates , resulting in the discovery of the second solar twin ( hd 98618 ; melndez et al . 2006 ) and revealing that our temperature scale ( and that of alonso et al . \n 1996 ) , although precise , have probably a zero - point issue . \n our new selection of candidates from the hipparcos catalog took into account a preliminary zero - point offset , which has been recently confirmed by analyses of solar twins and used for improved temperature calibrations ( casagrande et al . \n 2009 ) . \n new solar twin proposals at mcdonald and magellan at las campanas ( through australian access ) during 2006 were successful . \n the first observing run at mcdonald in april 2007 allowed us to identify the best solar twin known to date , hip 56948 ( melndez & ramrez 2007 ) , which is not only very similar to the sun physically , but has also a low li abundance similar to solar . \n its status of best solar twin has been recently confirmed by takeda & tajitsu ( 2009 ) . on the other hand , \n the magellan observations at las campanas are opening new windows for astrophysics of the 0.01 dex level in chemical abundance accuracy . \n new observations taken recently at the vlt with uves and crires , promise to achieve even better precision ( 0.005 dex , @xmath31% ) , and to use solar twins to set tight constraints on li and be depletion in the sun ( e.g. do nascimento et al . \n 2009 ) .     of the sun and the mean values in the solar twins as a function of @xmath5 . \n the abundance pattern shows a break at @xmath5 @xmath6 k. the solid lines are fits to the abundance pattern , while the dashed lines represent the standard deviation from the fits . \n the low element - to - element scatter from the fits for the refractory ( @xmath7 dex ) and volatile ( @xmath8 dex ) elements confirms the high precision of our work . \n observational errors ( including errors in both the sun and solar twins ) are shown with dotted error bars , while the errors in the mean abundance of the solar twins are shown with solid error bars . , \n our observations taken with the mike spectrograph and the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope at las campanas , have definitely shown , for the first time , that the sun has a peculiar chemical composition ( melndez et al . \n 2009 ) . as can be seen in fig . \n 1 , the difference in chemical abundances between the sun and the mean value of the solar twins does not cluster around zero . \n instead , the abundance differences have a remarkable correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements ( lodders 2003 ) . \n this peculiarity has been recently verified by ramrez et al . \n ( 2009 ) using mcdonald observations .    a fascinating possibility to explain the chemical anomalies of the sun is that they are related to its properties as a host of terrestrial planets . \n a particularly striking circumstance is that the inner solar system planets and meteorites are enriched in refractories compared to volatiles ( e.g. alexander et al . \n 2001 ) , with a break at @xmath5 @xmath31200 k , identical to the break at @xmath5 @xmath31200 - 1250 k detected in the solar abundance pattern ( fig . \n 1 ) . the abundance pattern of meteorites is a mirror - image of the solar pattern relative to the solar twins . \n also , a radial gradient exists , with greater enhancement of refractories at smaller heliocentric distances ( palme 2000 ) . \n the break in the chemical abundance pattern at @xmath9 k ( fig . \n 1 ) , suggests that the volatiles retained their original abundances both in the sun and the solar twins . \n such temperatures are only encountered in the inner parts ( @xmath10 au ) of proto - planetary disks ( ciesla 2008 ) , which also suggests that the abundance pattern is related to the presence of terrestrial planets . \n furthermore , iron meteorites ( like those we see in museums around the world ) were probably formed in the terrestrial planet region and may be a remnant of earth forming material ( bottke et al . \n 2006 ) , hence being perhaps formed from the iron missing in the sun . \n the amount of dust - depleted gas required to explain the solar abundances is similar to the mass of refractories locked up in mercury , venus , earth and mars ( melndez et al . \n thus , it is tempting to speculate that the formation of the terrestrial planets might have given the sun its special surface composition . \n the disk masses during the t tauri phase are @xmath11 @xmath12 but larger values are possible , providing thus enough material to change the solar photospheric composition \n . however it may be a problem with time - scales since proto - planetary disks are observed to have typical life - times @xmath13 myr ( sicilia - aguilar et al . \n 2006 ) , but the deep solar convection zone at that time would have erased the planetary signatures , unless the proto - solar nebula was abnormally long lived so that the dust - depleted gas was accreted @xmath320 myr later when the solar convection zone was thin . \n another possibility is that the early sun was never fully convective , as shown by the dynamical star - formation calculations with a time - dependent convection treatment of @xcite and @xcite , making it easier to imprint the signatures of other earths ( nordlund 2009 ) . \n we have also analyzed a sample of 10 solar analogs from planet surveys , four having inner giant planets , while for the other six no planets have been detected yet . \n our analysis shows that all solar analogs with giant planets differ from the sun but closely resemble most solar twins . \n thus , the odd solar composition is not due to giant planets as such , but probably related to terrestrial planets . \n indeed , only two of the six solar analogs without close - in giant planets have abundances that differ significantly from the solar pattern . \n the fraction of stars with the solar pattern seems thus tentatively related to the presence of giant planets on close orbits : @xmath14% when having such planets and @xmath15% for solar - type stars in general , and @xmath350%-70% without close - in giant planets . \n although the statistics has to be improved considerably , the numbers are clearly tantalizing . \n although the samples are still relatively small , considering both the magellan ( melndez et al . 2009 ) and mcdonald ( ramrez et al . 2009 ) samples , we conclude that about 10 - 20% of stars _ physically _ similar to the sun have also _ chemical _ similarities to our sun and therefore they may be hosting terrestrial planets like our own earth .    a complete high precision spectroscopic survey of solar twins is urgently needed in order to know which stars may be the best candidates of hosting solar system twins and to improve the statistics on the fraction of stars hosting other earths and perhaps life .", "StartTimeOffset": 558476193702, "RequestID": "92ccbd6645d424ad0a7e92d3b9776b4457967c47", "TotalTokens": 2557}

to - noise ratio , on the coherence of the radio signal , and on the goodness of the fit for the radio lateral distribution function , over 200 events remains for the analysis . on average , \n the primary energy is of @xmath1ev , the zenith angle is less than 40 degrees , and the maximum shower core distance is 90 m. + for each lopes measured event , one proton - generated air shower and one iron - generated air shower is produced with coreas @xcite ( qgsjet ii.03 is used as hadronic interaction model ) . for the purpose of this analysis , \n the simulations are created in order to reproduce a realistic case : on the one hand , information about the lopes selected events , such as core position , primary energy , and incoming direction reconstructed by kascade - grande are used as input parameters for the corsika showers @xcite . on the other hand , shower - to - shower fluctuations \n are included , since there is no pre - selection of a typical shower , i.e. shower with a typical x@xmath0 . \n + in order to represent best the recorded event , a further step is made in the pre - selection of the corsika showers : the number of muons ( n@xmath2 ) measured by kascade - grande is used as discriminator for this purpose . \n 200 conex showers for proton and 100 for iron are simulated with qgsjet ii.03 and urqmd respectively for high and low energy interaction @xcite . the conex shower which can best reproduce the measured n@xmath2 \n is chosen and simulated with coreas . in this way a specific shower similar to what has been detected by kascade - grande is used . \n + moreover , the observer positions for the coreas - simulated ldf represent the real arrangement of the lopes antennas in the field with respect to the core of the shower . + \n coreas simulations are one of the last achievements of a better understanding and an improved modelling of the radio emission mechanisms from air showers @xcite . with a realistic treatment of the refractive index of the atmosphere , \n coreas simulations are more complete than the predecessors and take into account the cherenkov - like behaviour of the radio emission , which is the main reason for the flattening of the radio lateral distribution function close to the shower axis @xcite . \n the flattening strongly depends on both the geometry of the air shower and on the primary type . \n a comparison between coreas simulations and lopes measurements is presented in @xcite . \n + with the coreas simulations , i.e. the realistic treatment of the atmospheric refractive - index , the radio lateral distributions function ( ldf ) at the distances probed by the lopes experiment becomes much more complex . \n for the purpose of this analysis , we use the gauss - function @xmath3 with @xmath4 [ @xmath2v / m / mhz ] , @xmath5 [ m ] , and @xmath6 [ m ] the free parameters to fit the lopes ldf . \n eq.[eqldf ] describes the lateral distributions better than the simple ( two - parameter ) exponential function used in other lopes analyses @xcite . \n + the influence on the ldf slope of the zenith angle is taken into account by separately looking at 5 different zenith angle bins . \n the first , which includes zeniths between 0 and @xmath720 degrees , is shown in this paper as example . + \n this method aims to compare ldfs of events with different primary energies and arrival directions , thus normalizations for the radio amplitudes are required ( fig.[ldf ] ) . the primary energy reconstructed by kascade - grande \n is used for the energy normalization . with the reasonable assumption that the predominant contribution to the radio emission in air showers has geomagnetic origin @xcite , \n the arrival direction is taken into account by correcting for * p@xmath8 * , the east - west component of the vector @xmath9 , with @xmath10 velocity and @xmath11 the geomagnetic field vector . +      , with k the free parameter of the fit . \n the radio amplitude is normalized by the east - west component of the @xmath9 vector . \n the rms - spread is @xmath12.,scaledwidth=100.0%,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    similar to our previous analysis @xcite , a specific distance from the shower axis ( d@xmath13 ) is identified where the ldf profiles exhibit the smallest rms spread . in d@xmath13 the radio amplitude is barely affected by shower - to - shower fluctuations and it does not carry any information about the primary type @xcite . \n this region is identified by looking at the rms spread of the ldf fits at several distances from the shower core and picking the distance with the smallest rms value . for the lopes events d@xmath14 lies in the distance range between 70 m and 100 m from the shower axis depending on the zenith angle bin . for the events with zenith smaller than 20 deg , \n d@xmath14 is marked by the dashed line in fig.[ldf ] , ( 70 m ) . \n + a direct correlation between the radio amplitude in d@xmath14 - normalized for the arrival direction - and the energy of the primary is expected @xcite . \n + for the lopes simulated events a linear correlation with the reconstructed primary energy from kascade - grande is shown in fig.[reas_energy_lin ] . \n the spread around the linear fit in fig.[reas_energy_lin ] indicates the intrinsic uncertainty of the slope method in determining the primary energy . \n for the complete lopes selection , including all zenith angle bins , an average rms spread of @xmath15 is found .       from corsika simulations and the radio simulated ldf slope . \n the rms - spread is of 52  g/@xmath16.,scaledwidth=100.0%,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the slope of the radio ldf is the feature of the gauss - fit which best correlates with the depth of the shower maximum ( x@xmath0 ) . \n the slope is defined as the ratio of the radio amplitudes at d@xmath13 and at 200 m from the shower axis ( @xmath17 ) . \n the dependence of the slope on the zenith angle is not clearly identified , therefore the usual five zenith angle bins are used . \n the correlation of fig.[xmax_fit_1bin ] has been fit with @xmath18^{c } \\label{xmaxformula}\\ ] ] already successful in previous analyses @xcite . \n + for the complete zenith angle range an uncertainty of 50 - 70  g/@xmath16 is predicted ( rms - spread of the fit ) , with the larger values due to the larger zenith angles . + \n in order to better constrain the fit and to improve the predicted uncertainty (  50  g/@xmath16 ) , an analysis which includes higher statistics for coreas simulations is planned . \n + the values for the three fitting parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) will be used in the following to reconstruct x@xmath0 with the lopes measurements . \n is predicted around 50 m. , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=110.0%,scaledwidth=70.0% ]   is predicted around 50 m. , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    one important goal of this analysis is the confirmation in the lopes data of d@xmath14 as the best distance from the shower axis for the radio amplitude  energy correlation . \n indeed , at such distance , the highest precision on the energy reconstruction may be achieved . \n each lopes ldf is fit with a gauss function as well . \n the radio amplitude at a specific distance from the shower axis , derived from the fit value at such distance , is correlated with the primary energy reconstructed by kascade - grande ( in fig.[figenergy]top is reported as example the radio amplitude taken at 50  m from the shower axis ) . \n several distances from the shower axis are considered , and for each the corresponding radio amplitude - energy linear correlation . \n the rms - spread around each linear fit is again an indicator of the precision for the primary energy reconstruction achievable at each distance . \n the rms - spreads obtained for these several distances , and averaged on the 5 zenith angle bins , are shown in fig.[figenergy]bottom . the minimum value , of about 26% \n , is reached at distances less than 100 m , as expected from the coreas simulations , confirming the importance of d@xmath14 for the primary energy investigation . \n moreover , the minimum spread of about 26% , which contains the combination of the lopes and of the kascade - grande energy uncertainties , it is still comparable with the statistical uncertainty of kascade ( 20%40% ) @xcite . \n +     reconstructed with the slope method for the lopes measurements ( black ) and for coreas simulations ( proton ( dashed - blue ) and iron ( light - red ) ) of the same events , for the complete zenith angle range- 0 - 40 deg.,scaledwidth=140.0% ]    the x@xmath0 for lopes is reconstructed by using eq.[xmaxformula ] and the @xmath19 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters derived with the coreas simulations . in fig.[xmax_histo ] , x@xmath20 = 628.1 @xmath21 96  g/@xmath16 , i.e. mean and standard deviation values . compared to previous analysis @xcite , the expected improvement by using the most complete coreas simulations , is clearly achieved : the systematic shift shown in @xcite was definitively caused by the still existing discrepancy between the simulated and the measured ldf slope , due to the lack of refractive index effect in the previous analyses . \n these lopes reconstructed x@xmath0 are compatible with the expectations from the cosmic ray nuclei and comparable with the coreas predicted values . \n the slope method has been successfully applied also on the most recent coreas simulations of the lopes events and , afterwards on the measurements themselves . once again \n , this method reveals itself to be a powerful tool for both primary energy and x@xmath0 investigations with the radio data . \n the specific distance from the shower axis d@xmath14 is re - confirmed with the lopes measurements to be the best place for the primary energy analysis . \n the uncertainty for the energy reconstruction achieved is the combined energy resolution of both kascade and lopes . the value is around 26% , and it is comparable to the statistical uncertainty of the kascade experiment . \n one can conclude that the energy resolution of lopes seams to be better than 26% .    by using the updated coreas simulations , the systematic shift in the x@xmath0 reconstruction to smaller x@xmath0 values , typical of older analysis , \n is solved . \n the x@xmath0 obtained for the lopes measurements are now comparable with expectations . \n + moreover , an upper - limit precision of 96  g/@xmath16 is found with the lopes measurements , being the highest precision on x@xmath0 sensitivity to date achieved with the radio data . \n higher precision is predicted by the slope method applied on pure simulations for both the energy ( @xmath15 ) and the x@xmath0 reconstruction ( @xmath750  g/@xmath16 ) . \n it may be achieved by experiments with a lower noise background . + \n this is the case for aera ( auger engineering radio array ) @xcite , located at the pierre auger observatory , and tunka - rex @xcite , located in siberia , which have the possibility to cross - check the reconstructed x@xmath0 values respectively with the fluorescence and the cherenkov detectors . \n t.  huege et al . , astrop . \n phys 30 ( 2008 ) 96 k.  de  vries et al . \n phys 34 ( 2010 ) 267 . \n m.  ludwig , t.  huege , astrop . \n phys 34 ( 2010 ) 438 . \n n.  palmieri et al . \n ( lopes collaboration ) , proc . \n 5th arena , erlangen , germany , aip conf . \n proc . 1535 , pp . \n 89 -

the wing and the northeastern part of the bar are closer than the southern parts ( westerlund @xcite ) . \n newly obtained large photometric data sets at different wavelengths and with improved sensitivity and spatial coverage allow us to investigate the large scale properties of the magellanic clouds . in particular , data in the near infrared allow us to access stages of stellar evolution that are marginally covered by optical data , such as the rgb and agb phases . \n very recently zaritsky et al . \n ( @xcite ) found that the asymmetric appearance of the smc is primarily caused by the distribution of young stars , and that the older stars have a very regular distribution . \n it is not possible from their figures to evaluate the behavior of the density towards the center of the cloud . \n weinberg & nikolaev ( @xcite ) point out the presence of intervening tidal debris up to @xmath3 kpc from the lmc . \n our morphological study of the magellanic cloud is based on a sample of stars extracted from the dcmc catalogue ( cioni et al . \n the sample includes all sources detected in both @xmath1 and @xmath4 , irrespective of detection in @xmath5 . \n the dcmc catalogue contains sources detected in at least two of the three denis bands ( @xmath1 : @xmath6 m , @xmath4 : @xmath7 m and @xmath5 : @xmath8 m ) within a surface area of @xmath9 square degrees centered on @xmath10,@xmath11 toward the lmc and @xmath12 square degrees centered on @xmath13,@xmath14 toward the smc ; j2000 coordinates are used throughout this paper . \n the observations have been performed with the denis instrument ( epchtein et al . \n @xcite ) on the 1m  eso telescope . \n we have used the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) colour  magnitude diagrams ( figure [ cml ] for the lmc only ) to select three classes of objects in each cloud . \n sources labelled ( a ) with @xmath15 represent the youngest population in the magellanic clouds : the brightest dwarf stars , blue  loop stars and supergiants ( third vertical sequence from the left ) , together with an unrelated foreground component of dwarfs and giants ( first two vertical sequences from the left ) . \n sources labelled ( b ) with @xmath16 , located above the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb  cioni et al . \n @xcite ) are mainly asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb ) . \n sources labelled ( c ) with @xmath16 located below the trgb are mostly red giant branch stars ( rgb ) and represent the oldest population in the clouds . \n for the sake of clarity , we have plotted in fig . \n [ cml ] only those sources that were detected in all three wave bands and that occur in the very central part of the cloud . \n sources detected only in @xmath1 and @xmath4 predominantly populate the lower part of the diagram . \n the position of the trgb is indicated by a horizontal line . \n the @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 sensitivity limits are @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mag respectively . \n photometric errors widen the sequences towards fainter magnitudes .    for each class of objects in each of the two clouds , \n we show their distribution in the plane of the sky by counting the sources in bins of @xmath20 , applying a light smoothing to the resulting structure ( figs . \n [ lmca][smcc ] ) ; the contour values increase logarithmically . \n regions corresponding to missing data ( strips at constant ra indicated by diamonds ) were filled in by interpolation . \n their effect is mostly negligible except in fig . \n [ lmcc ] where strips of possibly lower photometric quality may be causing discontinuities in the outermost contours . \n the contribution due to galactic foreground stars has not been subtracted from the maps . \n its influence is most clearly seen in fig . \n [ lmca ] in the direction of the galactic plane . in the other maps , \n the foreground contribution is rather constant and does not affect the morphology of the clouds .      the lower contours in figs . \n 24 show an almost circular outline ( axial ratios consistent with an inclination @xmath21 ) centered in all three cases near @xmath22 with major axis at about @xmath23 . \n westerlund ( 1997 ) gives a similar diameter for the stars of the old disk . \n this stellar disk also coincides in shape and extent with the hi disk ( kim et al . \n the center of the disk is offset from the center of the bar by about 30@xmath24 to the north ( see fig . \n we confirm the conclusion by westerlund ( 1997 ) that the lmc consists of two systems : a circular disk and an off center bar . \n half of the total number of stars are in the bar and this factor ( fig . \n [ lmca ] ) increases for younger objects . \n unless this is a transient configuration , it thus seems that the lmc must be embedded in a gravitational potential produced by an unseen mass component ( see also sofue 1999 ) . \n this is in agreement with the conclusion by stil ( 1999 ) that the class of dwarf galaxies to which the lmc belongs ( ` fast rotators ' ) is dominated by dark matter .    the youngest component ( younger than @xmath25 gyr ) is composed of very bright main - sequence dwarf stars , blue  loop stars and supergiants . \n their distribution ( fig .  [ lmca ] ) is clumpy and irregular . \n the bar , extending over about @xmath26 , is prominent and contains a well defined nuclear concentration at its center . \n the region of 30  dor is represented by the small feature just above the northeastern side of the bar , and the shapley constellation iii is the large structure at @xmath27 . \n elongations at either end of the bar indicate the presence of spiral arms most clearly seen in the northwest at the location of the giant hii region complex n  11 . \n similar structures are seen in the distribution of stellar complexes ( maragoudaki et al . \n @xcite ) , associations and hii regions ( bica et al . \n clusters ( bica et al . \n @xcite , kontizas et al . \n @xcite ) have a distribution more similar to the one of agb / rgb stars .    the distribution of agb stars ( fig . \n [ lmcb ] ) , also relatively young ( around @xmath28 gyr ) likewise reveals a prominent bar and nucleus . \n shapley constellation iii is inconspicuous in agb stars . \n a broad and faint spiral arm begins at the northwestern end of the bar and bifurcates around @xmath29 . \n the spiral arm feature originating at the southeastern end of the bar is clearly delineated in the agb star population and can easily be followed to @xmath30 . \n it was noted before by bothun & thompson ( @xcite ) in their surface photometry study of the magellanic clouds  see their @xmath31 diagram . \n at least this spiral arm might be due to tidal action , as it appears to be connected to the magellanic cloud bridge ( cf . \n staveley - smith et al . \n the outernmost contour well matches the carbon stars by kunkel et al . \n ( @xcite ) .    the oldest population ( from @xmath28 to @xmath32 gyr ) , \n represented by rgb stars ( fig . \n [ lmcc ] ) , once again reveals a prominent bar which is significantly broader than that defined by the younger populations . \n galactic foreground stars may affect the outermost contours . \n the southern spiral arm is inconspicuous , but the two faint northern spiral arms seen in fig . \n 3 ( agb ) have weak counterparts in the form of extensions at @xmath33 . \n bothun & thompson (  @xcite ) conclude that the lmc has a relatively large scale length more appropriate for galaxies with obvious spiral structure than for other dwarf galaxies . \n it is interesting that the asymmetric spiral structure delineated by the different components in figs . \n [ lmca][lmcc ] is in fairly good agreement with the hi map shown by gardiner et al . \n ( @xcite ) and is nicely reproduced by their dynamical model . \n the structure of the smc is still not understood ( westerlund 1997 ) . \n our maps show that populations of different age have different distributions . \n the youngest component has an asymmetric distribution(fig . \n [ smca ] ) elongated along a ne  sw axis ( pa @xmath34 ) . \n in the south , the outermost contour defines four protuberances which might be associated with tidal features : at least the eastern ( coincident with the smc wing ) and western protuberances are aligned with that of the magellanic cloud bridge ( cf . \n staveley - smith et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n higher contours show an extension in the northeast , aligned with the main body of the smc bar . \n the bar structure itself is similar to that seen in the distribution of young clusters ( bica & dutra @xcite ) and in the upper main - sequence map by zaritsky et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n clusters , associations and hii regions ( bica & schmitt @xcite ) are also found at the locations of the southern protuberances . \n the young stars are strongly concentrated in the southwestern part of the smc bar . outside the main body of the smc , \n the two galactic globular clusters ngc  104 = 47  tuc ( west ) and ngc  362 ( north ) can be discerned . \n the hi column density contours in the map presented by stanimirovic et al . \n ( @xcite ) outline the distribution of the young stars quite well . \n the agb stars have a more regular distribution ( fig .  [ smcb ] ) with two prominent central concentrations matching the carbon stars by hardy et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n the easternmost also coincides with the peak of the young  star distribution . \n the agb distribution axis is much less inclined ( pa @xmath35 ) than that of the younger and very similar to that of the rgb star distribution . \n as in the case of the lmc , the stellar distributions become more regular and smoother with increasing age , also apparent in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 band images by zaritsky et al . \n ( @xcite ) and for the outer contour in the carbon stars by kunkel et al . \n ( @xcite ) ; carbon stars by rebeirot et al . \n ( @xcite ) fill the second level countour ( fig . \n [ smcb ] ) .    the distribution of rgb stars ( fig . \n [ smcc ] ) is similar to that of the agb stars and also exhibits two major concentrations . \n the western most is more pronounced in rgb than in agb stars . \n the eastern concentration on average appears to be significantly younger than the western concentration dominated by the older stars . remarkably , the strongest hi concentration in the smc map by stanimirovic et al . \n ( @xcite ) appears to be just between the concentration of younger stars and that of older stars . \n it is also remarkable that the older star distribution extends over the full length of the suspected southwestern tidal feature , about @xmath38 from the main body of the bar . \n with respect to the overall distribution of the older stars , that of the hi appears to be displaced towards the east . \n the smc wing , prominent in hi and also traceable in the younger stellar population , has no counterpart in the older stars . \n counts of sources towards the magellanic clouds extracted from the dcmc ( cioni et al . \n @xcite ) allow differentiation in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) colour  magnitude diagram into three groups of objects with different mean ages . \n the spatial distribution of the three age groups is quite different : in either cloud , the youngest stars exhibit an irregular structure characterized by spiral arms and tidal features while the older stars are smoothly and regularly distributed . \n the distribution of younger stars is well  correlated with those of clusters , associations , hii regions and hi . \n the significant offset of the lmc bar with respect to the overall circular disk suggests that the lmc potential is dominated by dark matter \n . the well  defined southern spiral arm may be due to tidal interaction with the smc . \n the nature of the two northern spiral arms is uncertain . in the smc , the regular , but double  peaked , structure of the agb and rgb stars \n is remarkable , as is its offset from the hi distribution , and the mean age difference of the two maxima . \n relatively faint east \n west features in the younger star population ( including the wing ) are probably also due to tidal interaction . \n bica e.l.d . , \n dutra c.m . , 2000 , \n aj 119 , 1214 bica e.l.d . , \n schmitt h.r . , 1995 , \n ajs 101 , 41 bica e.l.d . , \n schmitt h.r . , et al . , 1999 , aj 117,238 bothun g.d . , \n thompson i.b . , 1988 , aj 96 , 877 caldwell j.a.r , coulson i.m . , 1986 , \n mnras 218 , 223 cioni m.r . \n , loup c. , habing h.j . , et al . , 2000 , \n a&as accepted cioni m.r . \n , van der marel r.p . \n , loup c. , habing h.j . , a&a submitted epchtein n. , de batz b. , et al . , 1997 , the messenger 87 , 27 gardiner l.t . , turfus c. , putman m.e . , 1998 , apj 507 , l35 hardy e. , suntzeff n.b . , azzopardi m. , 1989 , apj 344 , 210 kim s. , dopita m.a . , et al . \n , 1999 , aj 118 , 2797 kontizas m. , morgan d.h . , et al . , 1990 , \n a&ass 84 , 527 kunkel w.m . , demers s. , irwin m.j . , \n aj submitted kunkel w.m . \n , irwin m.j . , demers s. , 1997 , a&ass 122 , 463 maragoudaki f. , kontizas m. , et al . , 1998 , a&a 339 , l29 rebeirot e. , martin n. , mianes p. , et al . \n 1983 , a&as 51 , 277 sofue y. , 1999 , pasj 51 , 445 stanimirovic s. , staveley - smith l. , et al . , 1998 , \n mnras 302 , 417 staveley - smith l. , gibson b. , et al . , 2000 , iau 190 , p. 37 \n , 1999 ph . \n d thesis leiden university ( nl ) , ch . 4 weinberg m.d . , nikolaev s. , apj submitted westerlund b.e . , 1997 , the magellanic clouds , camb . \n astr . se . \n 29 zaritsky d. , harris j. , et al . \n , apj lett .  accepted", "StartTimeOffset": 574021588182, "RequestID": "5f0aef12951c18827c3b746f656a7890551a2495", "TotalTokens": 3663}

01203 , @xmath6  55@xmath7  15@xmath8 , @xmath27  12@xmath10  30@xmath11 , j2000.0 , @xmath28  mag ) . \n it was discovered to be a variable by @xcite . \n the spectral type a0 was presented in @xcite , while more detailed classification as a0+[g3iv ] was presented in @xcite .    according to this latter paper , \n the proposed temperature of the primary is circa 9400  k , and about 5800  k of the secondary . \n altogether there are 1704 observations . \n as one can see , the curve is not symmetric and the brightnesses near the phase -0.1 and near the phase 0.1 are not equal . \n this could be explained e.g. by the presence of a spot . if one assume the spot to be located on the primary component , the parameters of such a spot are the following :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final parameters of the light - curve fit are presented in table [ tablebig ] and the fit itself is plotted in fig.[figv1011cyg ] . \n the 3-d plot of the system is shown in fig.[fig3d ] . \n light curve of v1011  cyg.,width=529 ]    however , the presence of spot on the primary is not able to describe the light curve in detail and at least two spots are needed . \n one of them should be brighter and the other one dimmer than the surface of the star . \n there is a slight difference between the shapes of the light curves obtained at different epochs . \n the first observations from 2002 show larger difference in brightness near the phase -0.1 and 0.1 , while the observations from the following years show almost symmetric curve . \n this could indicate the time evolution of the spots . \n only further analysis would confirm the presence of the spots and their possible evolution . \n the light - curve analysis of three selected systems in cygnus constellation has been done . using the light curves observed by the integral satellite , one can estimate the basic physical parameters of these systems . despite this fact , the parameters are still only the preliminary ones , affected by relatively large errors and many of the relevant parameters \n were fixed at their suggested values . the detailed analysis is still needed , especially in different filters . \n together with a prospective radial - velocity study , the final picture of the systems could be done . \n particularly , the system v1011  cyg seems to be the most interesting one due to its asymmetric light curve . \n based on data from the omc archive at laeff , pre -

{"ContextTokens": 2279, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most important goals of high energy heavy ion physics is the formation and observation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . \n the discovery of a factor of @xmath5 suppression of high @xmath6 gev hadrons produced in central @xmath2 at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been interpreted as evidence for jet quenching of light quark and gluon jets . \n jet quenching was predicted  @xcite to occur due to radiative energy loss of high energy partons that propagate through ultra - dense qcd matter . \n the observed quenching pattern therefore provides a novel tomographic tool that can be used to map the evolution of the quark gluon plasma plasma ( qgp ) produced in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions . \n though the observed jet quenching for light partons strongly suggest that qgp has been formed at rhic , further detailed tests may provide the decisive proof for the discovery of qgp . \n it is believed that good test of qgp formation is the open charm suppression , which can now be measured at rhic by comparing @xmath7 distributions of @xmath8 mesons in @xmath9 and @xmath2 collisions .    the main effect which lead to open charm suppression is the radiative heavy quark energy loss in a dense qcd medium . \n the first estimates for heavy quark energy loss  @xcite proposed that similar quenching may occur for charm jets as for light partons . \n however , in ref . \n @xcite it was estimated that the heavy quark mass leads to a kinematical `` dead cone '' effect for @xmath10 that reduces significantly the induced radiative energy loss of heavy quarks . \n experimentally , the phenix data  @xcite on `` prompt '' single electron production in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 and @xmath11 agev provided a first rough look at heavy quark transverse momentum distributions at rhic . \n remarkably , no indication for a qcd medium effect was found within the admittedly large experimental errors . on the other hand , \n new star @xmath8 meson data may indicate large energy loss . \n fortunately , in the near future , data with much higher statistics and wider @xmath1 range will become accessible . \n in this proceedings we concentrate on the theory of heavy quark radiative energy loss , and how to use these results to present theoretical predictions that can be compared with upcoming experimental results . \n such comparisons may provide decisive test for qgp existence . \n only the main results for heavy quark energy loss are presented here . for more detailed version \n see  @xcite , and references therein . \n there are three important medium effects that control the radiative heavy quark energy loss in qcd matter .    here \n we first study the non - abelian analog of the ter - mikayelian  @xcite effect . \n the first estimates of the influence of a plasma frequency cutoff in qcd plasmas were reported in ref . \n @xcite using a constant plasmon mass . in our study \n , we extend those results by taking both longitudinal as well as transverse modes consistently into account via the frequency and wavenumber dependent hard thermal self energy  @xcite .    the detailed derivation of the qcd ter - mikayelian effect was presented in paper  @xcite . \n an important conclusion from  @xcite is that the effects due to the plasmon dispersion relation can be well approximated for high @xmath1 jets ignoring the longitudinal modes , and applying the asymptotic ( short wavelength transverse ) plasmon mass @xmath12 , where @xmath13 gev is chromoelectric debye screening . \n in addition to the ter - mikayelian effect , we also need to take into account that medium has finite size . \n additional radiation which occurs in the boundary between medium and vacuum has to be included . \n we will call this energy loss transition radiation . to estimate transition radiation we use the results from zakharov  @xcite , which assume of static medium . \n this calculation should be improved by considering the more realistic case of expanding medium .    on fig . \n 1 we show the numerical results for a medium characterized by a debye screening scale @xmath14 gev . \n we see that the transverse plasmon mass effect reduces the zeroth order energy loss by , @xmath15 , relative to the vacuum case . \n the gray region represents the additional energy loss which comes from transition radiation computed using  @xcite . \n this transition radiation lowers ter - mikayelian effect from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . \n therefore , these two effects would effectively _ enhance _ the yield of high transverse momentum charm quarks were it not for the extra medium induced radiation . \n the reduction of the zeroth order ( vacuum ) energy loss for charm quark due to the qcd ter - mikayelian and transition radiation effects is shown as a function of the charm quark energy . \n the upper curve shows the vacuum energy loss if gluons are treated as massless and transversely polarized . \n the lower solid curve shows medium modified ( but zeroth order in opacity ) transverse fractional energy loss . \n the dot - dashed curve shows the additional effect of transverse radiation .    the second part of our study is ( 1 ) to generalize the glv opacity series  @xcite to include massive quark kinematic effects and ( 2 ) to take into account the ter - mikayelian plasmon effects for gluons as described in  @xcite . \n the detailed study of this effect is presented in  @xcite . \n we have derived heavy quark medium induced radiative energy loss to all orders in opacity , @xmath0 . \n the analytic expression generalizes the glv opacity expansion for massless quanta to heavy quarks with mass @xmath17 in a qcd plasma with a gluon dispersion characterized by an asymptotic plasmon mass , @xmath12 . \n remarkably , we find that the general result is obtained by simply shifting all frequencies in the glv series by @xmath18 . \n the @xmath19 order in opacity fractional energy loss for heavy quarks is shown as a function of their energy . \n upper curve correspond to charm , and lower to bottom quarks in a plasma characterized by @xmath20 and @xmath21 fm . \n 4truemm    the numerical results for the first order induced radiative energy loss are shown on fig .  2 for charm and bottom quarks . \n we fix the effective static plasma opacity to be @xmath22 . \n we see that , in the energy range @xmath23 gev , the induced energy loss fraction is @xmath24 for charm quarks while only about half that is predicted for bottom . \n figure 3 shows the competition between the medium dependence of the induced energy loss and the zeroth order energy loss taking into account the ter - mikayelian effect and transition radiation . even in the absence of a medium \n ( @xmath25 , a charm quark with energy @xmath26 gev suffers an average energy loss , @xmath27 , due to the sudden change of the color current when it is formed in the vacuum . \n the dielectric plasmon effect reduces this to about @xmath28 . \n the additional transitional radiation lowers the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . \n the fractional energy loss for a 10 gev charm quark is plotted versus the effective static thickness @xmath31 of a plasma characterized by @xmath14 gev and @xmath32 fm . \n the dashed middle horizontal line corresponds to the energy loss in the vacuum taking into account the kinematic dead cone of radiation for heavy quarks  @xcite . \n the lower horizontal solid line shows our estimate of the reduction of the zeroth order energy loss due to the qcd analog of the ter - mikayelian effect . \n the dot - dashed middle curve shows the additional effect of transverse radiation . \n the upper solid curve corresponds to the net energy loss , @xmath33 .    by comparing the net energy loss in the medium ( @xmath34 ) with the naive vacuum value ( @xmath29 ) \n , we find that additional energy loss in the medium is approximately @xmath35 of initial energy of the quark .    to estimate the value of suppression that comes from this energy loss we use the method described in  @xcite . \n we assume that initial charm @xmath7 distribution is in the region @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constants , and that the medium opacity is in the region @xmath39 fm . \n charm @xmath7 suppression is shown as a function of @xmath7 .    from fig . \n 4 we see that the charm quark suppression will be small @xmath40 . \n such value is expected having in mind low value of additional energy loss @xmath41 . \n this prediction of suppression seems to be consistent with current phenix experimental single electron data  @xcite , but it is possibly inconsistent with star data . \n unfortunately , the problem with current data is that they have large error bars , and that single electrons are less sensitive to the heavy quark energy loss than @xmath8 mesons . \n therefore , high statistics @xmath8 meson data will allow us to make more reliable conclusions . \n the upcoming @xmath8 meson data for 200 gev @xmath9 and @xmath2 results will soon become available . according to our results , \n charm quark suppression should be small @xmath42 . \n therefore , this suppression should be definitely much smaller than the already observed pion suppression @xmath43 \n .    if our predictions are confirmed , then existence of qgp will pass another stringent test . \n together with already observed jet quenching and elliptic flow of light partons , this may provide decisive argument in the favor of the qgp production at rhic . \n we would like to thank r. vogt for carefully reading the paper and giving valuable suggestions . \n this work is supported by the director , office of science , office of high energy and nuclear physics , division of nuclear physics , of the u.s . \n department of energy under grant no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 3717, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "for more than 50 years statistical models of strong interactions @xcite have served as an important tool to investigate high energy nuclear collisions . \n the main subject of the past study has been the mean multiplicity of produced hadrons ( see e.g. refs . \n only recently first measurements of fluctuations of particle multiplicity @xcite and transverse momenta @xcite were performed . \n the growing interest in the study of fluctuations in strong interactions is motivated by expectations of anomalies in the vicinity of the onset of deconfinement @xcite and in the case when the expanding system goes through the transition line between quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas @xcite . \n in particular , a critical point of strongly interacting matter may be signaled by a characteristic power - law pattern in fluctuations @xcite . \n apart from being an important tool in an effort to study the critical behavior , the study of fluctuations within the statistical hadronization model constitutes an essential test of its validity . \n fluctuations are quantified by the ratio of variance of a multiplicity distribution to its mean value , the so - called scaled variance . \n there is a qualitative difference in the properties of mean multiplicity and scaled variance of multiplicity distributions in statistical models . in the case of mean multiplicity results obtained within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and micro - canonical ensemble ( mce ) approach each other in the large volume limit . \n one refers here to as the thermodynamical equivalence of statistical ensembles . \n it was recently pointed out @xcite , that corresponding results for the scaled variance are different in different ensembles , and thus the scaled variance is sensitive to conservation laws obeyed by a statistical system . \n the differences are preserved in the thermodynamic limit .    in this contribution we briefly summarize recent results @xcite on multiplicty fluctuations in the hadron resonance gas model . \n we will first discuss a simple example , accessible to analytical solutions , and then sketch how to generalize the procedure to a general multi - specie hadron gas . \n lastly a comparison of model calculations to recently released na49 data @xcite on charged particle multiplicity fluctuations is shown . \n the gce partition function of an ultra - relativistic gas composed of only neutral boltzmann particles is given by : @xmath0 = \\exp \\left [ vg \\frac{t^3}{\\pi^2}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the volume of the system , @xmath2 its temperature , and @xmath3 the degeneracy factor due to the particles internal spin . \n the number of gce micro - states with fixed particle number @xmath4 is given by the fourier integral over the generalized gce partition function : @xmath5 = \\frac{\\left(vg          \\frac{t^3}{\\pi^2}\\right)^n}{n!},\\ ] ] where the wick - rotated fugacity @xmath6 is introduced to fix particle number @xmath4 . \n the normalized multiplicity distribution , i.e. the probability to find the system in a state with exactly @xmath4 particles is then given by the ratio : @xmath7 similarly one can find the number of micro - states in gce with fixed particle number @xmath4 and fixed energy @xmath8 : @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\left(\\frac{gv}{\\pi^2 } \\right)^n ~\\frac{e^{3n-1}}{n!\\left(3n-1         \\right ) ! } ~ e^{-e / t}~=~ z^{mce } ( v , e , n)~ e^{-e / t}~ , \\label{massless_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the mce partition function . \n the number of micro - states with fixed energy @xmath8 , but arbitrary particle number @xmath4 is simply @xmath11 in gce , or @xmath12 in mce . \n the difference is just that the former includes the boltzmann weight @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 . consequently the mce multiplicity distribution is given by @xcite : @xmath15 phrased differently , the @xmath16 can be expressed as the conditional distribution @xmath17 . \n the scaled variance of a multiplicity distribution is defined as : @xmath18 it can be shown that in the large volume limit both distributions ( [ p_gce ] ) and ( [ p_mce ] ) have the same mean value @xmath19 , but rather different scaled variance @xcite . \n the scaled variance in mce converges to @xmath20 , while in gce it is equal to one , @xmath21 ( poisson distribution ) . \n above procedure can be easily generalized to a multi - specie hadron resonance gas . \n when enforcing conservation of three abelian charges , @xmath22 , as well as energy and three momentum , @xmath23 , the mce partition function is given by @xcite : @xmath24      \\bigg[\\prod \\limits _ { k=1}^4 \\int \\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\frac{d        \\phi_k}{2\\pi } e^{-ie^k   \\phi_k}\\bigg ]       \\!\\exp \\left[v \\sum \\limits_l \\psi_l ( \\phi_j , \\phi_k ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the single particle partition function is : @xmath25 and the charge vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 of particle species @xmath28 , are defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 . it can be shown that generally : @xmath31 particle number  conservation  would result in an additional integral \n .    above relation has two implications . \n the first one is technical . in mce calculations \n one has to deal with a heavily oscillating ( or even irregular ) integrand . \n the integrants of eqs.([massless_int ] , [ hrg_int ] ) are however very smooth . for large volume \n the main contribution comes from small region around the origin , and an analytical expansion is therefore possible @xcite . \n @xmath32 converges then to a multivariate - normal - distribution , while finite volume corrections can be given in the form of hermite polynomials of low order @xcite . \n the analytical approximation is valid only around the maximum of the distribution . \n the second implication is more subtle . rather than calculating the proper mce partition functions , one can also , as in eq.([p_mce ] ) , define @xmath16 through a joint distribution of energy , momentum , charges and particle number in gce . \n @xmath16 would then be called the conditional probability distribution , while @xmath33 is called the marginal distribution of the partition function ( [ hrg_int ] ) . \n in order to predict the energy depedence of @xmath34 along the chemical freeze - out line for pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions , the freeze - out parameters should be expressed as a function of collision energy . here \n we follow the procedure described in @xcite . \n the dependence of @xmath35 on the collision energy is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath36 where the c.m . \n nucleon - nucleon collision energy , @xmath37 , is taken in units of gev . \n the system is assumed to be net strangeness free , @xmath38 , and to have the charge to baryon ratio of the initial colliding nuclei , @xmath39 . \n these two conditions define the strange , @xmath40 , and electric , @xmath41 , chemical potentials . \n temperature is defined by the condition : average energy per particle is equal to @xmath42gev @xcite . \n finally , the strangeness saturation factor , @xmath43 , is parameterized as @xcite @xmath44 . \n this determines all parameters of the model . \n although various parameterizations are known in the literature @xcite , resulting differences for multiplicity fluctuations are small @xcite .    for the calculations , an extended version of the thermus framework @xcite was used . \n the thermus particle table includes all known hadrons and resonances up to a mass of about 2.5  gev and their respective decay channels . \n we use quantum statistics , but disregard breit - wigner width of resonances . \n we assume that in the studied reactions the system volume is large and finite volume corrections to fluctuations and mean values can be neglected . \n resonance decay has been dealt with as described in @xcite . \n the effect of finite experimental acceptance was taken into account by an  uncorrelated particle \n approximation @xcite . \n the results for multiplicity fluctuations of negatively charged hadrons in the full momentum space and a comparison to data in the na49 acceptance are shown in fig . \n [ omega ] . \n the multiplicity distributions in the na49 acceptance for central @xmath45 collisions at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 together with the predictions for the gce , ce , and mce versions of the model are shown in fig . \n [ data ] .    , both primordial and final , along the chemical freeze -

{"ContextTokens": 3357, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "despite having been studied for well over 20 years , the emission mechanisms active during the prompt phase in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remain unclear . \n a robust prediction of the fireball model for grbs@xcite is that the relativistic jet is initially opaque and therefore photospheric emission is inevitable . yet its strength is uncertain and it is therefore not necessarily detectable . in 1986 , both paczynski@xcite and goodman@xcite suggested a strong contribution of photospheric emission in grb spectra ; however , the observed spectra generally appear nonthermal and these models were therefore not considered viable . \n interest in the photospheric component resumed with observations of grbs using _ compton gamma - ray observatory_/batse ( 202000 kev ) . \n ryde@xcite found that in many individual emission pulses an equally good or better fit could be found by using a model comprising a planck function and a power - law , as compared to the traditional band function . \n additionally , it was found that the evolution of the planck function component during the prompt phase followed well defined and consistent characteristics . \n the planck component was interpreted as the photosphere of the grb . at present \n there is again mounting evidence from theoretical considerations that the photosphere of the relativistic outflow ( jet ) plays an important role@xcite .    in this paper the observational signs \n so far attributed to photospheric emission will be discussed and interpreted in light of models of subphotospheric dissipation , geometrical broadening and multi - zone emission . \n photospheric emission can give rise to many different spectral shapes , and pure blackbody emission is rarely expected . \n as noted above , predictions of photospheric emission came early in the study of grbs . \n yet it was not until the detailed spectral studies made possible by _ cgro_/batse that the first clear observational signs were seen . in part \n this may be due to the ambiguity in attributing spectral components to distinct physical processes . \n this has to some extent meant that the search for photospheric emission has become a search for blackbody ( or planckian ) components in the spectrum : while the photosphere can in principle give rise to many different shapes , a blackbody can only come from the photosphere . \n @xcite first reported the presence of a blackbody component in the initial phase of some grbs detected with _ \n @xcite also showed that some grbs could be well fit with single planck functions throughout the prompt phase . \n however , such cases are extremely rare . in the entire batse catalogue , only 6 out of @xmath0 grbs \n are well described by a pure blackbody . \n the situation is similar for the _ fermi _ catalogue : only 2 such bursts in over @xmath1 have reported @xcite . \n although these numbers may seem low , what is perhaps more surprising is that there are such cases at all . \n already from the start , it was shown that purely geometrical considerations meant that photospheric emission should be somewhat broader than a single temperature planck function . \n the fact that there are such narrow spectra is thus very constraining for theoretical models .    an interesting case for the study of photospheric emission is grb090902b , one of the brightest bursts seen by _ \n fermi_. during the first part of the emission episode , the main spectral peak is very narrow and well - fit by a multicolor blackbody @xcite . \n however , during later times in the pulse the spectrum broadens considerably . \n as the spectral evolution can be followed , it is clear that the same component is seen throughout the prompt phase . \n the blackbody - like spectrum at early times ties it to the photosphere , and grb090902b thus shows that photospheric emission is not necessarily planckian .        in summary : \n * observations of  blackbody - like spectra \" indicate that the photosphere is detected , and thereby also plays a role in grb prompt emission and the formation of spectra . \n * the fact that some spectra are well fit by single - temperature blackbodies has strong theoretical implications on the physical conditions of the emission region . * \n the slightly wider spectra allow us to probe the broadening mechanisms active in the outflow . \n this is particularly true for bursts such as grb090902b where width changes strongly during the pulse . \n however , most spectra are not well described by a single narrow component . \n nevertheless , evidence of photospheric emission in some grbs motivates us to search for its presence also in other bursts . \n one of the most striking results of the _ fermi _ satellite is the discovery of multiple components in the spectrum of grbs . \n bright bursts , where the signal - to - noise ratio is highest , show statistically significant deviations from a simple band function @xcite . \n one component commonly found is a power - law extending to high energies ( e.g. , grb 080916c ) . \n however , a few bursts also show features at lower energies ( @xmath2 kev ) , which are well - fit by a planck function . \n perhaps the strongest such example is grb110721a , where the significance of the extra component was greater than @xmath3 @xcite .    , \n width=321 ]    the results found with _ fermi _ match those previously seen in batse data . \n @xcite found that a model comprising a blackbody and a power - law provided a good fit to several grb spectra observed by batse . \n the power - law index was greater than -2 , so it was clear that there had to be a turn - over at higher energies . with the much broader energy range afforded by _ \n , the power - law seen in the batse data is revealed as the low - energy slope of the band component . it should be noted that also _ \n fermi _ has detected a power - law component in the spectra ; however , this feature is seen in addition the the band component , and the temporal behavior is very different . its origin is not yet understood , but may be related to the mechanism producing the temporally extended gev emission @xcite . \n another feature which strengthens the common origin of the blackbody components in batse and _ fermi _ spectra is their temporal evolution . \n the batse components showed a typical behavior where the temperature decayed with time as a broken power - law . \n this distinctive feature is also seen in the _ fermi _ data . \n the additional blackbody component detected is typically subdominant , in general contributing only 5 - 10% of the total flux . for this reason \n , its presence can only be firmly seen in very bright grbs . however , it may still be present in many more grbs , and this can have important consequences . \n when spectra are fit with models comprising a blackbody in addition to the main band component , the parameters of the band component change . \n this means that although a photospheric component may not be statistically detected , its presence can have a large impact on the interpretation of the bulk of the emission . \n for instance , the peak of the band component will shift to higher energies , and the measured value of the low - energy slope , @xmath4 , will soften @xcite . \n an example of this is shown in figure  [ peakshift ] , where the spectrum of grb120323 is fit with and without an additional blackbody component . \n the changed parameters may lead to the band component being more compatible with synchrotron emission , and thus change the theoretical interpretation also of the main emission component .    ]    as thermal emission is a well - known physical process , identifying such a component allows physical parameters of the outflow to be derived @xcite . \n these include the bulk lorentz factor , jet - launching radius and saturation radius . \n for instance , studies of grb110721a have found that the lorentz factor was initially around 1000 , then decreased throughout the pulse to values @xmath5 @xcite . \n the jet launching radius was instead found to increase from @xmath6 cm to @xmath7 cm @xcite . \n in the case of `` typical '' single - component grb spectra , it is generally assumed that a single process is giving rise to the emission . for spectra \n well - fit by a single or multi - temperature blackbody , the most likely candidate is photospheric emission .    for the multi - component grbs , \n the interpretation is less straight - forward . \n a natural first assumption is to connect the two components to different emission regions . \n the blackbody component is then attributed to thermal emission arising from the photosphere , and the band component related with non - thermal radiation further out in the jet . \n there are many different possible realizations of the scenario . \n for instance , the location of the photospheric radius in relation to the saturation radius will affect the strength of the blackbody and different magnetizations of the outflow will change the ratio between the two components @xcite .    as mentioned above , identifying a blackbody component in the spectrum can alleviate some of the difficulties facing interpretations suggesting a synchrotron origin for the band component . \n many observed grbs have hard spectra below their @xmath8 peaks . \n those with indices @xmath9 below this peak can not possess electrons that radiate synchrotron emission in the expected fast cooling regime , within this spectral window ; this is the so - called fast - cooling @xmath4 index limit @xcite . \n models including a low - energy blackbody component allow for softer slopes of the band component , thereby making the interpretation more compatible with synchrotron . \n spectra with hard @xmath4 slopes are however not the only issue facing synchrotron interpretations . studying the widths of spectra \n , it can be seen that most are too narrow to accommodate synchrotron emission from realistic electron distributions @xcite . \n this is shown in fig . \n [ widths ] . in these cases adding a blackbody component will not help , but rather worsen the issue ; the width of the band function component in a composite spectrum is if anything more narrow than the entire spectrum .    , \n width=321 ]    an alternative to multiple emission zones is that the entire spectrum arises from the photosphere . \n this of course requires a radical departure from the framework where photospheric emission is described by a ( single or multicolor ) blackbody . \n one suggested way of altering the spectrum is subphotospheric emission . in brief , in this scenario energy is dissipated below the photosphere , modifying the emergent spectrum . \n different models propose different origins , such as magnetic reconnection @xcite , internal shocks @xcite or collisional dissipation @xcite . by varying the amount of dissipation and parameters of the outflow \n , it is possible to produce a wide range of spectral shapes by such subphotospheric energy release @xcite .    as described by @xcite \n , geometrical effects will broaden the spectrum . considering relativistic limb darkening \n , @xcite used a combination of analytical model and monte carlo simulation to study the emergent spectrum from a jet . \n it was found that for a narrow jet , with opening angle is of the order of the relativistic beaming angle , a broadening of the photospheric spectrum is expected for any viewing angle . for a broader jet , \n the broadening effect is strong only if the viewing angle lies along the edge of the outflow , i.e. , is close to the jet angle . \n apart from increasing signal to noise in spectra , is there any way to distinguish between these scenarios ? \n recently , polarimetry has become the focus of attention , and does provide valuable extra information . in the case of non - thermal emission , synchrotron radiation is expected to have high degrees of polarization . yet also \n photospheric emission can be polarized , though polarization degrees @xmath10% are expected @xcite . predictions of correlations between spectra and polarization may thus allow us to determine the physics behind the prompt phase emission . \n unfortunately , there are at present very few reliable measurements of polarization in grbs . \n photospheric emission has been detected in a growing number of grbs , with planckian components appearing together with other components , or dominating the spectrum . \n this shows that the photosphere plays a part in the formation of the spectra . \n most grb spectra do not look thermal , and many instead having multiple components . \n this can be interpreted as radiation from two separate emission regions , or as pure photospheric emission . \n understanding the role of the photosphere is thus important to probe the physics of the outflow itself . \n polarimetry provides a possible way to determine the contribution of the photosphere . \n there are today several proposed missions capable of measuring polarization in grbs , which promises new insight into the physics of the relativistic jet . \n the _ fermi_-lat collaboration acknowledges support for lat development , operation and data analysis from nasa and doe ( united states ) ; cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs ( france ) ; asi and infn ( italy ) ; mext , kek , and jaxa ( japan ) ; and the k.a . \n wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board ( sweden ) . \n science analysis support in the operations phase from inaf ( italy ) and cnes ( france ) is also gratefully acknowledged . \n g. cavallo & m. j. rees 1978 , mnras,183 , 359 m. j. rees & p. mszros 1994 , apj , 430 , l93 b. paczyski 1986 , apj , 308 , l43 j. goodman 1986 , apj , 308 , l47 f. ryde 2004 , apj , 614 , 827 d. lazzati et al . \n 2010 , apj , 725 , 1137 i. vurm et al . \n 2011 , apj , 738 , 77 d. giannios 2011 , arxiv:1111.4258 b .- b . \n zhang et al . 2011 , apj , 730 , 141 g. ghirlanda et al . \n 2003 , a&a , 406 , 879 g. ghirlanda et al . \n 2013 , mnras , 432 , 3237 j. larsson et al . \n 2015 , apj , submitted . \n f. ryde et al . \n 2010 , apj , 709 , l172 m. ackermann et al . \n 2013 , apjs , 209 , 1 m. axelsson et al . \n 2012 , apj , 757 , l31 s. guiriec et al . \n 2013 , apj , 770 , 32 f. ryde & a. peer 2009 , apj , 702 , 1211 s. iyyani et al . \n 2013 , mnras , 433 , 2739 r. hascot et al . 2013 , a&a , 551 , 124 r. preece et al . \n 1998 , apj , 506 , 23 m. axelsson & l. borgonovo 2015 , mnras , 447 , 3150 d. giannios  2008 , a&a , 480 , 305 k. ioka  2010 , progr . \n phys . , 124 \n , 667 a. beloborodov  2010 , mnras , 407 , 1033 a. peer et al . \n 2006 , apj , 642 , 995 t. nymark et al . \n 2011 , arxiv:1111.0308 c. lundman et al . \n 2013 , mnras , 428 , 2430 c. lundman et al . \n 2014 , mnras , 440 , 3292", "StartTimeOffset": 591823510026, "RequestID": "aea45150509c3fbd65ced835ace832ce43140aa9", "TotalTokens": 3498}
{"ContextTokens": 3475, "GeneratedTokens": 225, "SynthesizedBody": "effects of an electron - electron interaction in electronic systems have become a focus of the condensed matter physics recently . in a three or higher dimensions \n , it is widely believed that landau s fermi liquid theory is valid and the effect of the interaction is absorbed into several phenomenological landau parameters . \n the system is metallic even with the interaction since the ground state is adiabatically connected to the free fermi sea where the excitations are given by an electron - hole _ \n excitation across the fermi surface . in one dimension , however , the ground state is unstable against a perturbation of the interaction and the ground state is given by the so - called tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid . although the fermi liquid theory is not valid in one dimension , the tl liquid is also metallic and the excitations are gapless . \n this tl liquid has been focused recently and there are huge number of studies by several techniques as the bosonization and the conformal field theory . in the paper , we are trying to investigate the breakdown of the tl liquid behavior in a simple fermionic system . in a system with periodic potential , \n that is , on a lattice as a model hamiltonian , the allowed kinetic energy is restricted by a finite band width . \n therefore the strong electron - electron interaction may bring an opening of the energy gap in electronic systems which is known as a mott transition . \n the opening of the energy gap implies a metal - insulator transition which has become a focus again recently in connection to new materials as metal - oxides , organic materials and the high-@xmath0 superconductors . \n as far as the conductivity of the electronic system is concerned , the mott transition can be understood as a freezing of the charge degree of freedom . \n there can be spin related phenomena in a small energy scale , however , the mott transition is a phenomenon of the order of the electron - electron interaction . \n noting this fact , we have focused on a charge degree of freedom and chosen a model hamiltonian of spinless fermions on a lattice    @xmath1    where the interaction can be long range . \n ( we set @xmath2 in the following . ) when the interaction is non - zero only for the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites , it is mapped to the spin @xmath3 antiferromagnetic xxz model by the jordan - wigner transformation . in this case , haldane investigated the model in detail by using the bethe ansatz solution of the xxz model@xcite . \n generic ground states of the nn model are the tl liquid without the energy gap except at a half filling where the model has a metal - insulator transition at @xmath4 . \n it is identified as an antiferromagnetic ising gap in term of the xxz spin model .    in this paper , we investigate the model , when the interaction is long range , with various filling factors of the fermion numbers . as shown later , it has a rich structure as a _ \n let us first consider a strong coupling limit @xmath5 of the model when the filling factor @xmath6 is rational where @xmath7 is the number of fermions and @xmath8 is the number of sites . \n we use a periodic boundary condition in the following . \n let us assume the interaction satisfies the downward convex condition , that is , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) to avoid a formation of charge clustering . \n ( see later . ) \n a possible form of the interaction which we use in the paper is @xmath11which reduced to a simple power law decaying interaction @xmath12 when @xmath13 in a sufficiently large system . \n the nearest neighbor interaction can be recovered also by taking @xmath14 and @xmath15 . when the interaction is sufficiently large , the ground state of the system for the rational filling @xmath16 with mutually prime integers @xmath17 and @xmath18 was known for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n it is given by a one dimensional wigner crystal with period @xmath18@xcite . \n although the ground state charge ordering ( crystal structure ) is complicated if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are large integers , it is explicitly given@xcite . in fig.[fig : chrg ] , shape of the charge ordering is shown for @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 as an example . as is expected for the formation of the charge ordering , there are some commensurate conditions to stabilize the system . \n this commensurability condition brings a fractal structure into the system as shown later . \n the chemical potential in the thermodynamic limit is evaluated by a similar consideration applied for the long range ising model@xcite . \n it is written as @xmath22 f_{[\\frac k\\rho]-1}^\\infty -   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]-1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]}^\\infty { \\rm \\ if\\ }   [ \\frac k\\rho ] = \\frac k\\rho   \\\\   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]+1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]}^\\infty -   [ \\frac k\\rho ]   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]+1 } ^\\infty { \\rm \\ otherwise }   \\end{array}\\right . \n \\nonumber   \\\\ \n e_-(k ) & = &    -[\\frac k\\rho ] f_{[\\frac k\\rho]+1}^\\infty +   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]+1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho ] } ^\\infty \\nonumber   % \\label{eq : chmpm}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath23 $ ] is a gauss symbol which denotes a least integer which is not larger that @xmath24 and @xmath25 is an order @xmath26 contribution mainly from the kinetic energy which is a smooth function of @xmath27 . in figs . \n [ fig : chem ] , the chemical potentials are evaluated for two different interactions . \n it is a devil s staircase which was first discussed by bak et al . in a context of the long range ising model@xcite . \n the discontinuity of the chemical potential , @xmath28 , which is a key quantity to judge whether the system is metallic ( @xmath29 ) or not ( @xmath30 ) is evaluated as @xmath31this is generically non - negative for the potential which satisfies the convex downward condition . \n ( if this condition is not satisfied , @xmath32 can be negative for some filling factor which causes an instability . \n it is identified as a charge clustering . ) \n it implies that the energy gap opens for any rational fillings if the interaction is strong enough . \n further , as can be seen from eq . \n ( [ eq : gap ] ) , the energy gap @xmath33 only depends on @xmath18 . \n its dependence is given by a power law @xmath34 . \n from the consideration in the strong coupling limit , to have a mott insulator phase in the system with filling factor @xmath19 , finite interaction range over @xmath18 sites is crucial . \n on the other hand , when the interaction is weak ( @xmath35 ) , the finite band width due to the lattice effect ( periodic potential ) is not so important . in this case \n , one can approximate the system as a continuous model with a long range @xmath36 interaction and with the periodic boundary condition@xcite . \n when @xmath37 , the continuum model is a sutherland model which has been studied extensively@xcite . if @xmath37 , the weak coupling model can be discussed using an information from the exact solutions . however , the strong coupling case , of course , neither the intermediate coupling case can not be discussed by the exact solutions . the ground state of the sutherland model is a tl liquid without an energy gap independent of the filling where the ground state is given by the jastraw wavefunction . \n noting that there is an energy gap in the strong coupling , it suggests that there is a finite value of the interaction where the energy gap opens . \n one possibility is that there is alway non - zero energy gap , that is , the critical value where the energy gap opens , @xmath38 . \n however , even in the nearest neighbor model where the energy gap can be most stable , there is a gapless tl phase ( xy phase in the xxz model ) . \n therefore we can expect that there are always finite regions of the gapless tl liquid phases in any filling factors and inevitably the mott transition . in the following , \n we give numerical results to confirm these consideration and study the critical region . \n as we have discussed , the ground state of the spinless fermions with long range interaction has two phases for any rational filling when the interaction strength is varied . \n the one is the tl liquid metallic phase and the other is the mott insulator phase . the transition between the two is a typical quantum phase transition at zero temperature . in this section \n , these phase transitions are demonstrated numerically . \n the main focus of the numerical calculations here is to investigate a critical behavior near the gap opening ( the transition point ) . \n our main strategy is to investigate the system from an insulator side . \n we use the exact diagonalization technique for systems with a periodic boundary condition . \n the hilbert space is divided into several sectors with different momentum quantum numbers and diagonalized within them to obtain the lowest few energies . for small systems , \n the full spectra are also obtained . \n due to the small system size available , it is not efficient to calculate the chemical potential directly . instead of it , \n we calculate an excitation gap @xmath39 which can be comparable with @xmath32 .    in fig . \n [ fig : disp1o2 ] and fig . \n [ fig : disp1o3 ] , lower parts of energy spectra are shown for systems with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively \n . when the interaction is sufficiently weak , one observes a behavior of the gapless tl liquid as shown in fig . \n [ fig : disp1o2](a ) and fig . \n [ fig : disp1o3](a ) . on the other hand , opening of the energy gap near @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath19 ) \n is clearly shown when the interaction is sufficiently strong ( see fig . \n [ fig : disp1o2](b ) and fig . \n [ fig : disp1o3](b ) ) . \n as is known from the strong coupling analysis , there is a discrete symmetry breaking ( translational symmetry ) in the strong coupling phase . for the @xmath19 case , \n this is a @xmath46 symmetry breaking . \n correspondingly there is almost @xmath18 degenerate ( ground ) states in a finite system . \n they have different total momentum @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) respectively . at these momentum sectors , \n the lowest energy state is given by one of the @xmath18 degenerate ground states . \n therefore the lowest energy gap , the energy difference between the lowest energy state at the momentum and the true ground state of the finite system ( usually @xmath49 ) , is related to an energy barrier between the degenerate @xmath18 ground states barrier as shown in eq . \n ( [ eq : gap - exp ] ) . the physical energy gap which we concern is the second lowest one as seen in the figures . in the fig . \n [ fig : soft1o3 ] , the lowest energy gap at @xmath50 for @xmath41 is plotted as a function of the system size for several values of the interaction strength . for @xmath51 , \n the gap size obeys a exponential law as @xmath52 which is a signature of the ( discrete ) symmetry breaking and @xmath53 is the order of the symmetry breaking potential . \n the discrete symmetry breaking is confirmed numerically for @xmath51 in fig .  [ \n fig : soft1o3 ] . to confirm the discrete symmetry breaking , \n we have also calculated a spectral flow , that is , the energy as a function of the aharonov - bohm flux through the periodical system ( ring)@xcite . in fig . \n [ fig : ab ] , the spectral flows of three different momentum sectors ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) for the @xmath41 system is shown where the @xmath56 symmetry breaking is expected . \n it is clearly shown that the @xmath57 low energy states are entangled with each other . \n that is , these three states are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit which is a signature of the discrete symmetry breaking . \n next let us investigate the critical region . \n for a nearest neighbor model at half filling , the behavior of the gap opening is known from the bethe ansatz solution and is given by @xmath58 which is essentially singular at the critical point@xcite . \n we have numerically investigate the behavior of the gap opening for several filing factors in our long range interaction model . in fig . \n [ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] , the excitation gap is plotted as a function of the interaction strength .    in the massless \n tl liquid phase and the mott insulator phase with @xmath59 symmetry breaking , @xmath60 converges to the true energy gap in the thermodynamic limit . \n therefore we extrapolate @xmath60 , the energy gap between the lowest energy at @xmath49 and @xmath61 to the infinite size limit by fitting them as a polynomial of the @xmath62 . \n an example of the fitting is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fit ] for @xmath41 case with several values of the interaction strength . \n the numerical results shown in fig . \n [ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] can be well fitted by the following essentially singular form as a function of the interaction strength @xmath63it implies that the transition is a generalized kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type . \n therefore the transition is of infinite order as a quantum phase transition . \n this kind of the singular behavior is expected in the conformal field theory for the off - critical behavior near the conformally invariant critical phase . in the @xmath64 invariant case , \n the exponent @xmath65 is evaluated by the renormalization group analysis to be @xmath66@xcite . at the critical point of the model \n has an apparent @xmath46 symmetry but may have higher symmetry . \n then one of the possible guesses for the exponent is @xmath67 . \n numerically it is difficult to determine @xmath68 and @xmath69 with sufficient accuracies due to the singular behavior of the energy gap . \n however one may use @xmath70 as a lower bound of the @xmath71 since it is plausible to expect the wigner crystal at the strong coupling melts near @xmath72 . \n this estimate agrees rather well with numerical results obtained ( figs . \n [ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] ) . in figs . \n [ fig : phase ] , we have shown possible ground state phase diagram using the above estimate . in the figure , the interaction strength is plotted in a nonlinear scale . \n it shows that there is alway insulator phase for any rational filling . \n since the @xmath73 curve is the devil s staircase , @xmath74 shows a fractal structure . \n correspondingly , the ground state phase diagram of the spinless fermions with long range interaction has a clear _ \n fractal structure_@xcite . \n the author thanks y. morita , m. kohmoto , m. takahshi , k. maki and d. lidsky for helpful discussions . \n this work was supported in part by grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , science and culture of japan . \n spin model with inverse square exchange with anisotropy also has a similar fractal structure@xcite by the similar argument given in the manuscript . since _ \n only a part _ of the eigenstates is obtained analytically@xcite , the fractal nature of the system is not captured by the analytical solutions@xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 601202156952, "RequestID": "472c6dfae968ce0eb13872f680d9b4996d42b9ad", "TotalTokens": 3700}

{"ContextTokens": 4031, "GeneratedTokens": 83, "SynthesizedBody": "during last years the dynamics of closed frw universe with massive minimally coupled real scalar field has become a subject of investigations . \n being one of the simplest cosmological models it has a peculiar property . \n namely the universe of this type can make a non - singular transition from contraction to expansion ( in other worlds a scale factor can posses a local minimum ) . \n such a transition is often referred to as bounce.    it turns out that a universe in principle can make an arbitrary number of bounces . \n page @xcite was the first who conjectured the presence of a fractal set of infinitely bouncing solutions , later cornish and shellard @xcite proved that this system is really chaotic . in \n later works @xcite@xcite , @xcite the chaotic properties of this and more complicated models were studied . \n numerical investigations have shown that the initial conditions space has a quasi - periodical structure : there are narrow zones which lead to bouncing solutions separated by wide zones which lead to singular solutions . \n these investigations also have shown that in former zones the solutions exhibits a sensible dependence of initial conditions  a property peculiar to the chaotic dynamical systems . moreover , starting from one of such zones a solution may pass after bounce through another zone of this type ( or through the same one ) and suffer a new bounce . \n after each bounce the situation is similar to the previous one . \n this lead to the existence of a fractal set of unstable infinitely bouncing solutions . in the dynamical chaos theory such set \n is called as a strange repellor  a structure which can be found with in many chaotic dynamical systems without dissipation . \n the presence of this fractal structure of solutions corresponds to the fractal structure of sets of initial conditions leading to bouncing solutions  @xcite . \n but the universe at the earliest stages of its evolution have not necessary had a metric close to frw one . \n so for studying the universe at this time one often invoke more general metrics . \n the simplest non  frw metric with positive curvature is the kantowski \n sachs one . however \n this case does not include the closed frw metric , and moreover there are no bouncing solutions in this case ( see appendix ) . \n more complicated metric is bianchi ix model . \n this is the only model that includes closed frw metric @xcite . \n so in this paper we investigate the bianchi ix universe with massive scalar field . \n the bianchi ix universe is well known due to its mixmaster approach to singularity @xcite . \n it worth to notice that mixmaster chaos @xcite principally differs from the studying one as in the case of mixmaster it is the evolution of anisotropic variables which exhibit chaotic properties while the overall volume of the universe decrease monotonically . \n in the considered case it is the evolution of the total volume of the universe which exhibit chaotic properties . \n let us consider a bianchi ix universe with minimally coupled massive scalar field with the action as follows ( we use units @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) : @xmath3    the metrics has the following form : @xmath4    where @xmath5    and @xmath6 are differential 1forms invariant under so(3 ) transformations . \n assuming @xmath7 to be a function of time variable only one can write the einstein s field equations in following form : @xmath8= \\frac{m^2}{4}\\varphi^2\\;,\\label{bkl1}\\ ] ] @xmath9= \\frac{m^2}{4}\\varphi^2\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath10= \\frac{m^2}{4}\\varphi^2\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath11    with the first integral of motion : @xmath12    where @xmath13 .    in our investigation \n it is more convenient to work with adm variables @xmath14 which are functions of a new time variable @xmath15 : @xmath16 . \n relations between adm variables and the old ones are : @xmath17 it is easily seen from ( [ conv ] ) that variable @xmath18 describes the volume of the universe while @xmath19 describes it s anisotropy . \n the considered dynamical system admits hamiltonian formalism . in terms of adm variables \n the hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 the hamiltonian equations leads to the following : @xmath22,\\\\ \\beta_-''&=&\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3 } e^{4\\omega}\\left \n [ e^{-2\\beta_+}\\sinh 2               \\sqrt{3}\\beta_- -e^{4\\beta_+}\\sinh 4\\sqrt{3}\\beta_-\\right],\\\\ \\varphi''&=&-\\varphi e^{6\\omega}\\label{matt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the constraint equation @xmath23 takes the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    to make further investigations we need to generalize the notion of bounce to bianchi ix case . \n being defined as a non - singular transition from contraction to expansion of the universe bounces thus corresponds to local minima of @xmath18 . \n that is why adm variables is more preferable choice for our purposes . \n substituting @xmath26 into constraint equation ( [ constr ] ) and combining it with the condition @xmath27 it is easily seen that bounces can occur only if : @xmath28 the above inequalities at least implies @xmath29 which can be satisfied only in a narrow region around the isotropic case @xmath30 where @xmath31 suffer it s minimum . \n this region is represented on fig .  1 where the levels @xmath32 are shown for the values of @xmath33(inner curve ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37(bold lines ) . \n the potential has a minimum in point @xmath38 ( isotropic case ) and @xmath39 . \n it also follows from ( [ constr ] ) that if a bounce occur the possible values of @xmath40 must satisfy criterion : @xmath41 as @xmath42 for all values of @xmath19 . \n = 0.65 = 0.65    [ veqv ]    before starting the next section it should be mentioned that belinsky and khalatnikov @xcite were the first who studied the bianchi ix model whith scalar field . \n thay considered only massless case and found that the presence of the scalar field of this type destroys the mixmaster oscillatory regime when the universe collapses to singularity . \n this results holds in massive case as an asymptotic regime . \n the equations of motion ( [ adm1])([matt2 ] ) can be solved numerically . in order to obtain numerical solution \n one need to fix eight initial conditions . \n the constraint equation allows to express one of them in terms of the others ( in our work we determined @xmath43 in this way ) . \n moreover as the considered system has at least one maximal expansion point ( i.e a point where @xmath18 suffer ( local ) maximum ) , one can fix @xmath44 without loss of generality .    for simplicity in our calculations \n we always fixed @xmath45 . \n so we studied the dependence of numerical solution from five initial conditions : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . \n the equations of motion have been solved numerically using bulirsch \n stoer method @xcite . as equations ( [ adm1])([matt2 ] ) requires evaluations of transcendental functions while equations ( [ bkl1]) ( [ matt1 ] ) requires only arithmetical operations we performed calculations in variables @xmath51 in order to speed - up them while the initial conditions and results were expressed in terms of @xmath52 . the constraint equation ( [ cnstr1 ] ) \n has been used to check the accuracy . \n first of all we tested our routines on already known fridmanian case . on fig .  2 we presented a first four closest to singularity simplest symmetric periodical solutions in a projection onto @xmath53 plane \n . term simplest means that all of the maximal expansion points for given solution coincide in this plane and symmetric means that these points lies on axis @xmath54 . \n the values of @xmath18 in the above mentioned points are : @xmath55 ( short dashed line ) , @xmath56 ( long dashed line ) , @xmath57 ( dot - dashed line ) , @xmath58 ( solid line ) . near each of these values @xmath59 \n there are narrow intervals which lead to bouncing solutions . \n = 0.55 = 0.55    [ periodic ]    as @xmath44 the initial values @xmath60 and @xmath61 have similar restrictions as in the case of bounce with the only exception that ( [ pb2 ] ) is no longer required . \n numerical investigations have shown the presence of bouncing solutions only in the case of sufficiently weak anisotropy near the corresponding fridmanian bouncing solutions . \n these investigations have also shown that for some ranges of initial values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath62 solutions exhibits sensible dependence of initial conditions .    to illustrate the structure of the sets of initial conditions which leads to bouncing solutions we calculated a 2d slices through the initial conditions space . for given value of @xmath46 each slice represents a @xmath63 grid in a plane of two of the anisotropy variables while the rest of them equals to zero . \n for each knot of the grid it has been calculated a numerical solution on a sufficiently large interval of @xmath64 $ ] . \n if a maximal value of @xmath18 on this solution after bounce @xmath65 is grater then @xmath66 we encoded corresponding dot in a black color . if @xmath67 we encoded it in a dim gray color . if @xmath68 we encoded it in a gray color and if @xmath69 we used a light gray color . \n we considered only solutions which satisfies criterion @xmath70 as they are of the most interest . \n we do not consider the trajectories with the next maximum expantion point lying closer to the singularity than the first bounce interval , becouse in this case the trajectory have only a zigzag , which can not change the fate of the trajectory falling into the singularity . \n we calculated such slices for subsequent values of @xmath18 with sufficiently small steps so that they can be viewed as a movie. such movies can be found at `` http://www.xray.sai.msu.su/~ustiansk/sciwork/gr-qc/001.html '' . \n examples of these slices are shown in fig.34 . \n numerical calculations have shown that there are narrow intervals of initial values @xmath18 that lead to bouncing solutions separated by wide intervals that lead to singular solutions in full analogy with the fridmanian case . for the closest to singularity interval ( an interval which contain @xmath71 ) in a @xmath72 plane \n one can observe the picture that follows . \n for the values @xmath73 there are no bouncing solutions . with \n the increase of @xmath18 bouncing solutions appears in a small region around isotropic case which grow with the growth of @xmath18 up to the value @xmath74 when a fraction of considered anisotropic bouncing solutions begins to decrease until they vanishes at @xmath75 .    in the case of @xmath76 and @xmath77 \n slices the general picture slightly differs . with @xmath18 increasing from the value @xmath78 anisotropic bouncing \n solutions appears and invoke isotropic case at already mentioned value @xmath79 . \n thus in considered case the interval of @xmath18 which allows bouncing solutions becomes slightly wider than in fridmanian one .    for the interval which contain @xmath80 \n the picture is following . \n for both studied planes @xmath72 and @xmath77 bouncing solutions appears when @xmath81 in a small region around isotropic case . with the growth of @xmath18 this region grows until @xmath82 . \n after that the value of @xmath65 becomes smaller than @xmath71 for initially anysotropy close to zero so such solutions were discarded and thus the region have a ring shape . \n for the values @xmath83 this regions vanishes . \n so in considered case the interval of @xmath18 is wider than in fridmanian one . \n the similar picture is valid for the interval that contain @xmath84 .    on several slices one can easily see a narrow rings ( one of them \n is pointed by two arrows in fig.4 ) inside the region of initial conditions that lead to bounces . \n the existence of these rings is caused by the fact that solutions which correspond to these rings suffers bounce and the next point of maximal expansion also occurs inside one of the regions that leads to bounce . \n so such solutions suffer at least two bounces . \n these rings forms a fractal structure . \n the example of such structure is shown in fig.5 . \n for the splits in @xmath72 it is possible to determine the mesure of bouncing solutions in a simple way if we start from @xmath45 . in this case \n the measure of all possible initial values of @xmath85 , being defined as the area bounded by the bold lines in fig.1 , equals @xmath86 . \n the maximal fractions of initial values of @xmath85 that lead to acceptable bouncing solutions to all posible initial values for first three subsequent intervales of @xmath18 are approximately @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 . \n in this paper we studed the bianki ix cosmological model with the massive scalar field . \n in particular the influence of initial shear on the possibility of transition from contraction to expansion was investigated . \n we show that only a very restricted set of initial conditions with shear can led to the bouncing trajectories . their mesure with respect to all physically admissible \n initial conditions for the first 3 zones are restricted by @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively . \n corresponding areas of the initial conditions were found numerically also for other cross - sections of the initial conditions space . in all cases , bounces are possible for a ruther narrow zones near corresponding friedmannian trajectory .    on the other hand , the structure of chaos is similar to known in the friedmann case : there are narrow intervals of initial values @xmath18 that lead to bouncing solutions separated by wide intervals that lead to singular solutions . \n the width of the bounce intervals may be enlarged up to @xmath93 times in comparition with the friedmann case for the several closest to the singularity intervals , but the qualitative picture is the same one . \n the equations of motion for the kantowski \n sachs universe filled by a scalar field are @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 with the constraint @xmath97 where @xmath98 - the scale factors , @xmath99 - a potential of the scalar field , and the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath100 . \n it is easy to see from the eq.(19 ) that in all the possible turning points with respect to @xmath101 ( i.e. the points in which @xmath102 ) , the corresponding acceleration @xmath103 is always nonpositive , so we can have only the points of maximal expansion for the scale factor @xmath101 .    combining eqs.(19 \n 20 ) we receive , on the other side , that the acceleration in the turning points with respect to @xmath104 is @xmath105 which is nonnegative for an arbitrary nonnegative scalar field potential @xmath99 , and we have only the points of minimal contraction for the scale

{"ContextTokens": 3534, "GeneratedTokens": 172, "SynthesizedBody": "ever after its initial discovery paper @xcite , hd 44179 , lovingly nick - named _ the red rectangle _ , has proven to be a truly enigmatic astrophysical object , and hosts many unique phenomena . \n hd 44179 is a post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star with a stellar companion and surrounded by a circumbinary disk and a biconical nebula . in the optical , \n hd 44179 shows the spectral signature of the broad extended red emission ( ere ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , of which the carrier is still unknown . \n superposed on this are sharper emission features which may be the diffuse interstellar bands normally seen in absorption @xcite . in the infrared the nebula exhibits remarkable evidence of a mixed chemistry : spectroscopy obtained with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , \n shows the presence of both oxygen - rich dust , in particular silicates , and carbon - rich components in the form of pahs @xcite . \n the authors suggest that the oxygen - rich dust predominantly resides in the disk , while narrow band imaging shows that the pah emission is extended and follows the outflows @xcite . \n the beautiful optical images obtained with the hubble space telescope @xcite show that the morphology of the nebula is far from homogeneous . \n regularly spaced brightness enhancements exist , perhaps related to the gas or dust density in the outflow . \n the iso spectroscopy presented by @xcite lacks the spatial resolution to show any correlation between the density enhancements seen in the hubble images and the chemical composition . in this work , \n we report spitzer space telescope observations of the red rectangle , to study spatial chemical variations in the outflow . \n we used the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) on spitzer @xcite to obtain high resolution spectroscopy of some positions in the outflow of the red rectangle . \n the observed regions in the outflow are about 30@xmath3 away from the central source , to avoid saturation by the central binary and its direct environment . here \n we report the first results obtained with the short high ( sh ) module of the irs in two lines - of - sight in the nebula ; a full description of the spitzer data will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( markwick - kemper et al . \n _ in prep . \n the first slit position probes the region just outside the biconical x , while the second one probes inside the biconical region ( fig . \n [ fig : slitpos ] ) . \n the coordinates of these slit positions are @xmath4 = 6@xmath519@xmath659.94@xmath7 , @xmath8 = @xmath910@xmath1037@xmath1156.0@xmath3 ( j2000 ) and @xmath4 = 6@xmath519@xmath659.18@xmath7 , @xmath8 = @xmath910@xmath1037@xmath1150.5@xmath3 ( j2000 ) , respectively . at both these positions we observed 2 cycles of 30 seconds . \n the sh module covers the 10.019.5 @xmath0 m wavelength range , with a spectral resolution of @xmath12 . \n the spectra were reduced using the smart package @xcite . \n we performed our data reduction on the products of pipeline version s9.5 . \n we worked with the _ droopres _ images , which is the least processed product available to the observer . \n the last few processing steps of the pipeline were repeated off - line and adjusted to the needs of our observations : first , we divided the _ droopres _ \n images by the flatfields , to get the equivalent of the basic calibrated dataproduct ( bcd ) . \n we applied s10.0 flatfields , which yielded less noisy results , to the s9.5 _ droopres _ data ; while no s10.0 _ droopres _ data were distributed to the observers . \n subsequently , full aperture extraction using smart was performed on these images , using the flux conversion and other calibration files provided by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) . \n bad pixels were removed by hand . finally , where the orders were overlapping in wavelength coverage we cut off the band edges according to the order optimalization provided by the ssc . \n in addition to the full aperture extraction , our data was sufficiently complex that performing sub - aperture extraction was necessary . \n this mode of extraction is not offered for the high - resolution modules in the standard smart version , however , modified the full - aperture extraction routine to extract a specified fraction of the aperture and produce a spectrum of the flux for that sub - aperture . \n we approximated the size of the two high resolution slits as five pixel widths in the spatial direction by two pixel widths in the dispersion direction . \n we then extracted five sub - apertures of an entire column in the dispersion direction with a width of one pixels in the spatial direction . \n the sum of the five sub - apertures is equal to the original full aperture extraction .    currently the irs data calibration is optimized for point sources , and little attention has been given so far to the extraction of spectra from extended sources . \n several problems arise when extended source calibration is attempted . \n first , no extended source flux conversion tables are available at this time . \n using the flux conversion tables for point sources affects the absolute flux levels to some extent , although we expect the relative flux levels to be reasonably accurate . \n second , it is not possible to use the measurements of the standards stars to calibrate the flux levels of extended sources , since it will cause fringing . \n a two - dimensional spectral response function is necessary to overcome this problem , but is not currently available . \n finally , geometric effects should be taken into account , since the slit projection on the detectors covers only 2@xmath135 pixels , and the point spread function is  depending on wavelength  about 3 pixels large , comparable in size to both the individual pixels as well as the entire slit . @xcite \n discuss the wavelength dependence of the point spread function , causing an additional slope in the spectra . \n for the high - resolution modules , the tilt of the slit with respect to the detector combined with the small number of pixels in the slit causes additional low - frequency fringing in the spectra . while the first geometric effect may be easily corrected , the second effect is fundamentally uncorrectable , since the spatial distribution of photons on a pixel is unknown . \n [ fig : full ] shows the full aperture extracted spectra of the two lines - of - sight of interest , inside and outside the biconical region . \n the observed variation in spectral features between the two positions is very large , and variations occur even on the scale of the pixel size . in fig . \n [ fig : sub ] , we show how the spectra change within both apertures , by extracting 3 pixel wide sub - aperture spectra while stepping along the slit one pixel at a time . \n it is straightforward to identify the features shortward of 13 @xmath0 m present in all lines - of - sight with the out - of - plane bending modes of the polycyclic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; e.g.   * ? ? ? \n * ) , but these features are dwarfed by the spectral features detected at wavelengths longer than 13 @xmath0 m . \n these new resonances show some interesting and unique characteristics . \n first of all , the bands are very broad ( several microns ) and are very strong with respect to the dust continuum . \n moreover , there is not a single set of well defined wavelengths at which these resonances occur , but instead the peak positions seem to vary spatially \n .    interestingly , inspection of the iso sws spectroscopy shows no evidence for the presence of the newly detected features , perhaps because in iso s large beam many lines - of - sight are averaged , and individual contributions at various wavelengths gets averaged out to a broad , shallow plateau , or alternatively , the carrier of these features may only be present in detectable amounts at considerable distance from the disk , a region not probed by iso s line - of - sight ( fig . \n [ fig : slitpos ] ) .    here we will explore possible carriers for the new features . \n although the outflow shows strong pah emission at 11.2 @xmath0 m even at this large distance from the central star , we can rule out pahs as the main carrier . \n emission from pahs in the 13 - 20 @xmath0 m wavelength range is known and is also variable @xcite . \n pah emission from 1520 @xmath0 m varies from a very broad plateau that perhaps can be disentangled into a number of completely separate resonances in the 1520 @xmath0 m range @xcite , which do not vary in peak position . \n although these pah bands fall in the correct wavelength range , they are much weaker than the 11.2 @xmath0 m pah band @xcite , and their fwhms do not match . \n the low intensities and the fixed wavelengths at which the components of the pah plateau are found , we rule out pahs as a significant contributor to the resonances observed .      the extreme breadth of the resonances observed in the 1320 @xmath0 m range is characteristic for solid state carriers , and the shift in the peak positions can be explained by variations in the temperature , composition , grain shape , grain size or lattice structure . \n the strong feature - to - continuum ratio dictates that the carrier has clean resonances without a strong continuum component , while the breadth implies an amorphous structure . moreover , the opacities in the uv and optical need to be high enough so that the grains heat to sufficiently high temperatures , while the band strength in the material needs to be strong enough so that the amount of dust required to explain the feature does not violate abundance constraints . \n although it is believed that the outflows of the red rectangle are dominated by carbon - rich components , the features from 1320 @xmath0 m show this picture is incomplete . \n simple mg - fe - oxides are a possible carrier for these new features . in fig . \n [ fig : sub ] the spectra from the region outside the biconical outflow are compared to a few mg - fe - oxide minerals calculated from optical properties measured by @xcite . \n indeed , peak strength and width are easily fitted , while the peak position suggests that a composition slightly more mg - rich than mg@xmath14fe@xmath15o is likely . \n the situation inside the biconical region seems quite different . \n there are two clear differences ; a distinct band centered near 15 @xmath0 m and a strong rise starting near 17 @xmath0 m . \n interestingly , features of both bands , such as peak position and onset of the rise , shift as a function of position in the slit , and the shift seems correlated . \n this is consistent with a changing fe - content in a relatively fe - rich oxide . using the correlation between composition and peak position for spherical grains ( fig . \n [ fig : fetrend ] ) it is possible to constrain more precisely the compositions of the oxides . \n we find that the oxides inside the biconical region have an fe - content mg@xmath16fe@xmath17o , while the oxides outside the biconical region have a more mg - rich composition of mg@xmath18fe@xmath19o . \n taking the mg - fe oxides as an example , we determine that oxide grains with a grain size of 0.1 @xmath0 m heat up to about 75 k at 30@xmath3 of the central star , using @xmath20 , @xmath21 k , @xmath22 pc @xcite and assuming no extinction toward the central star . to account for the observed flux levels in the features a dust mass of @xmath23 in the form of mg - fe - oxides \n is required in the aperture of each of the slit positions , an amount which seems large . \n the distance of 710 pc derived by @xcite might be an overestimation ( see e.g.   * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , which would affect the derived dust masses considerably . for a distance of 500 pc for instance , the dust can be heated to 150 k at 30@xmath3 , and an oxide mass of only @xmath24 g , which is comparable to the mass of our moon , is needed in each aperture to account for the observed emission features . \n the strong feature at 1317 @xmath0 m remains unidentified . \n however , because the peak position shifts with the change in onset of the feature longward of 17 @xmath0 m we conclude that the two carriers are related , and that perhaps the 1317 @xmath0 m feature is caused by a mixture of mg - fe - oxides with another material . \n a good candidate are spinels ( mgal@xmath25o@xmath26 ) , which have features in this wavelength range @xcite . \n their uv / optical opacity is too low to provide enough grain heating to explain the observed flux levels on their own , but when they are in thermal contact with oxides , the spinels may get warm enough to explain the observed flux level , while the changing fe - content still explains the shift in peak position . \n the detection of new mid - infrared features in the bipolar outflow of hd 44179 is surprising . \n these features are carried by oxygen - rich minerals , possibly including simple mg - fe - oxides . \n previously it was argued that the nature of the chemistry in these outflows is carbon - rich , while the dust in the circumbinary disk is oxygen - rich @xcite . \n independently obtained spatially resolved ground - based observations of the pah features in the infrared support this view ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n our work , along with the recent suggestion of small pahs in the circumbinary disk @xcite , indicate that the chemical distribution to the red rectangle may be more complicated than previously thought ; both the disk and the outflow are not strictly oxygen - rich or carbon - rich , and apparently mixed chemistry environments occur in both components of the system . \n there are clearly different episodes in mass ejection @xcite and these may be connected to changes in the chemical composition . \n the origin of the oxygen - rich dust in the outflow of hd 44179 remains speculative at best . \n it is possible that the oxides found in the outflow are remnants of an earlier , circumstellar mass loss phase , which is currently being overtaken by the bipolar outflow . \n simple oxides are found in the low density winds of semi - regular variables and early type miras @xcite , likely progenitors of a system like the red rectangle . \n these stars are known to develop a outflow velocity which is significantly lower than what is seen in later stages of the mass loss phase ( e.g.   * ? ? ? \n an alternate explanation is that the oxygen - rich dust found in the bipolar outflow originate from the circumbinary disk . \n interaction between the stellar wind and the disk may have eroded the disk and the wind may have dragged some of the disk material along in the collimated outflow directions . in this interaction , \n the oxygen - rich dust grains from the disk ( predominantly silicates ; * ? ? ? \n * ) may have partially or completely evaporated , and recondensed high above the disk . \n when recondensation occurs , the density will have dropped considerably , and the formation of significant amounts of anything beyond the simplest condensates may have been difficult , which could explain why the oxides are dominating the spectroscopy .    of course , whether mg - fe - oxides are indeed the carriers of these newly discovered oxygen - rich dust features remains to be seen , and further studies of the spectral appearance and spatial distribution of these features is required to further establish the nature of the dust . \n fmk is grateful for her time spent at ucla as a spitzer fellow , working with mike jura . \n his detailed knowledge of the red rectangle and his insightful comments were of crucial importance to this project . \n we also thank lou allamandola for sharing his thoughts on the origin of the spectral features discussed in this paper . \n we thank dan watson and ben sargent for aiding in developing irs data reduction tools , jan cami for careful reading of the manuscript and hans van winckel for making available the hst wfpc2 image of the red rectangle . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through the spitzer fellowship program , under award 011 808 - 001 ;

[ figures_lat ]     that property could be beneficial in two ways : regression testing , system description . \n first of all , for the context of regression testing it implements the algorithm to determine the classes of tests that fail . \n it could be considered in the following way . \n let us define set of attributes for all tests that are being run . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     implication list :    1 .   * if * iqv * then * iqp 2 .   * if * isv * then * isp 3 .   * if * iiv * then * iip 4 .   * \n if * = * then * ibs , not < , not > 5 .   * \n if * < * then * ibs , not = , not > 6 .   * \n if * ibs * then * not > 7 .   * \n if * not iqp * then * not iqv 8 . \n * if * not isp * then * not isv 9 .   * \n if * not iip * then * not iiv 10 . * \n if * not iiv , not isv , not iqv * then * not = , not < , not > , not ibs 11 . * \n if * not < , not = * then * not ibs 12 . * if * not > , iqv , iqp * then * ibs 13 . * if * not > , isv , isp * then * ibs 14 . * \n if * not > , iiv , iip * then * ibs 15 . * if * not > , not isv , not iqv , ibs * then * iiv 16 . * \n if * not > , not isv , not iiv , ibs * then * iqv 17 . \n * if * not > , not iiv , not iqv , ibs * then * isv 18 . * \n if * not > , not = , ibs * then * < 19 . * if * not > , not < , ibs * then * = 20 . \n * if * not ibs * then * not = , not < 21 . * if * not ibs , not < , not = , iqv , iqp * then * > 22 . * if * not ibs , not < , not = , isv , isp * then * > 23 . * \n if * not ibs , not < , not = , iiv , iip**then * * > 24 . * \n if * not ibs , not < , not = , > , not iqv , not isv**then * * iiv , iip 25 . * \n if * not ibs , not < , not = , > , not iiv , not iqv**then * * isv , isp 26 . * \n if * not ibs , not < , not = , > not iiv , not isv**then * * iqv , iqp 27 . * \n if * not ibs , not > , not = , not < * * then * * not iqv , not isv , not iiv \n the most important advantage of the proposed approach is the plug - in design . \n it can be easily incorporated in existing process of test - case generation . for manual test - case design \n one can develop test - cases in proposed system . \n moreover , the step of implication extraction could be postponed up to the review of obtained cases . \n it is important to notice that attribute exploration is a good technique to extract dependencies that could be formulated as requirements for the system under test . for the case of automatic test case generation , \n extraction of dependencies could eliminate the step of test debug and replace it with review of obtained implications and the model of the system under test . \n also the proposed technique is applicable to verify the correctness of defining type of model , precisely wiseness of it . since big values of @xmath60 in n - wise modeling impose more test cases and it results in the growing time of test run execution . \n formal concept analysis provides us with useful framework for software testing tasks . \n it is especially beneficial in regression testing meta report construction , feature navigation , test case analysis and derivation . \n it unites best practices of manual development and automatic generation of test scenarios . \n it provides sound and complete description of the investigated domain , based on expert knowledge . \n the output of the system consists of two main parts : the description of typical objects in the domain , and interdependence between parameters in terms of implications . \n an important advantage of proposed technique is extensibility . \n if we add a new attribute , we can just copy the previous examples into new formal context , assuming that new attribute is absent for all objects and proceed with the procedure of attribute exploration . \n it holds even for the very start of procedure . \n we can start with non - empty set of objects and implications simultaneously . \n the described algorithm could be used as a standalone solution for the test case design , as well as , tool to get exiting dependencies in the domain . \n the obtained implications could be valuable in pairwise testing to adjust the model description . \n however , we should admit that the current approach is limited in terms of attribute description . \n for now , it is highly dependent on the boolean nature of attributes . \n one of the main directions of future work is to work with descriptions of general form by means of patterns structures  @xcite , an extension of fca . \n ganter , b. and kuznetsov , s.o . , \n pattern structures and their projections . in : proc . \n g. stumme and h. delugach , eds . , 9th international conference on conceptual structures ( iccs 2001 ) , lecture notes in artificial intelligence ( springer ) , vol . 2120 , pp . \n 129 - 142 , 2001 . \n kuznetsov , s.o . , \n fitting pattern structures for knowledge discovery in big data . in : cellier , peggy ;

{"ContextTokens": 3843, "GeneratedTokens": 115, "SynthesizedBody": "opinions about the spatial distribution of classical novae in m31 and in our galaxy have been undergoing an interesting evolution . \n the major searches for novae in m31 ( hubble 1929 ; arp 1956 ; rosino 1964 , 1973 ; rosino et al . \n 1989 ) showed that in a general sense novae are distributed like the light of the galaxy , apart from a possible deficit of novae ( a  nova hole \" ) within the central few minutes of arc . by means of a ccd h@xmath0 \n survey , ciardullo et al . \n ( 1987 ) found novae in the innermost regions and concluded that the nova hole was just due to incompleteness caused by saturation on the photographic plates that had been used in the earlier nova surveys . \n ciardullo et al . also concluded that novae in m31 belong overwhelmingly to the bulge population . \n capaccioli et al . \n ( 1989 ) reached the same conclusion . \n at least partly because of the belief that m31 novae are overwhelmingly from its bulge population , it is often assumed that galactic novae also come mainly from the bulge ; for example , della valle & duerbeck ( 1993 ) and della valle & livio ( 1994 ) assumed that 3/4 of the galactic novae are from the bulge . \n doubts about the bulge dominance of the m31 nova population arose when ciardullo et al . \n ( 1990 ) combined the results of their search for novae in ngc 5128 with data on novae in the lmc , smc , m33 , m31 , and a few elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster . \n they found the nova rates per unit k  band luminosity to be remarkably similar  apart from a strikingly low rate for the m31 disk . \n they suggested that since the m31 bulge has been more thoroughly searched for novae than its disk , and since disk novae may be preferentially obscured by dust , it is possible that the nova rate in the m31 disk had been underestimated , and that the nova rate per unit mass of old stellar population may be approximately a constant . \n recently , shafter , ciardullo , & pritchet ( 1996 ) report that their search for novae in three more galaxies , m51 , m101 , and m87 , has produced preliminary results that are consistent with this proposition . \n another point of view that has developed recently is that young populations are _ \n better _ than old populations at producing novae . on the basis of observation , della valle et al . ( \n 1994 ) concluded that bulge  dominated galaxies ( ngc 5128 , m31 , m81 , and virgo ellipticals ) have a nova rate per unit h  band luminosity that is more than a factor of three lower than that of nearly bulgeless galaxies ( lmc and m33 ) . and , on the basis of a binary  star population \n synthesis study , yungelson , livio , & tutukov ( 1997 ) predict that the nova rate per unit mass of a young population should be much higher than that of an old population . \n yungelson et al . \n find support for that prediction in the nova rates per unit k  band luminosity in the galaxies mentioned above , and they suggest that the apparent dominance of bulge novae in our galaxy may be due to observational selection effects that favor the discovery of bulge novae over disk novae . \n recently we ( hatano et al . \n 1997 ) have used a monte carlo technique together with a simple model for the distribution of dust in the galaxy to investigate the observability and spatial distribution of galactic classical novae . \n we concluded that most galactic novae are indeed produced by the disk , rather than by the bulge . \n more specifically , we found the distribution of nova apparent magnitudes and positions on the sky to be consistent with the proposition that the galactic bulge  to  disk nova ratio is equal to that of the overall galactic bulge  to  disk mass ratio , which is only about 1/7 ( van den kruit 1990 ) . in this letter \n we report results of a study which set out to address the question of whether , similarly , the m31 bulge  to  disk nova ratio is consistent with the m31 bulge  to  disk mass ratio , which is about 1/2 ( kent 1989 ; hodge 1992 ) . \n since about 1917 , more than 300 novae have been discovered in m31 . \n we concentrate on 191 novae that were discovered ( or reported ) in major surveys carried out at mount wilson ( hubble 1929 ; arp 1956 ) and at asiago ( rosino 1964 , 1973 ; rosino et al . \n 1989 ) , and for which estimates of the peak apparent visual magnitude , @xmath1 , are available . \n 1 shows the positions on the sky of these novae , on the coordinate system of capaccioli et al . \n ( 1989 ) . at the adopted distance to m31 of 725 kpc ( @xmath2 ) , \n six arcminutes corresponds to about 1 kpc . \n we take the bulge to be spherical , with a radius of 18 arcminutes , or three kpc . obviously , most of these observed novae are projected within the bulge \n . the major  to - minor axis ratio of m31 is 4.3 , for an inclination of 77 degrees . \n the ellipse in fig . 1 corresponds to a circle in the disk , of radius 8.8 kpc ( where , as described below , the density of the dust peaks in our model ) . note that a great deal of disk is projected within the adopted perimeter of the bulge . \n we define  apparent bulge \" novae to be those whose sky positions are within the 18arcminute radius of the bulge , and  apparent disk novae \" to be those whose positions are not . as discussed below \n , some of the apparent bulge novae actually are disk novae . \n the top panel of fig . \n 2 shows the @xmath1distributions for the 176 apparent bulge novae , the 15 apparent disk novae , and the sum of the two . \n ( for comparison , the shape of our model @xmath1distribution , to be discussed below , also is shown in the top panel . ) \n the monte carlo technique that we have developed was inspired by one that was used by dawson & johnson ( 1994 ) in an interesting study of the observability of historical supernovae in our galaxy . we ( fisher et al . \n 1997 ) constructed an independent monte carlo code and used it to extend the work of dawson and johnson by considering the observability of hypothetical  ultra  dim \" supernovae in the galaxy , and to consider the observability of supernovae , in the model , from an external point of view . \n then we ( hatano et al . 1997 ) extended the technique to consider the observability of galactic classical novae . here \n we give a brief description of the model as it is used for this study of novae in m31 .    in our previous papers , \n the galactic dust was assumed to be distributed according to a simple double exponential law , with a radial scale length of 5 kpc and a vertical scale height of 0.1 kpc . \n in such a model , the density of the dust peaks right at the center of the galaxy . in m31 , however , the density of the dust is known to peak well out in the disk , not far from where most of the current star formation rate is taking place ( hodge 1992 ) . following fig . 3 of xu & helou ( 1996 ) , we adopt a simple distribution for the radial dependence of the extinction in m31 :    @xmath3    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the total line  of  sight extinction through the inclined disk of m31 . \n this distribution is generally consistent with the various evidence for the radial dependence of extinction discussed by hodge ( 1992 ) . \n the vertical scale height of the dust is taken to be 0.1 kpc , as we used for our galaxy . in this model , \n the extinction at @xmath6 kpc is 1.85 mag kpc@xmath7 , similar to its value at @xmath6 kpc in our galactic model , 1.9 mag kpc@xmath7 . \n the major difference between our adopted distributions of dust in the galaxy and in m31 is the low dust content in the central regions of m31 . \n disk and bulge novae in m31 are assigned the same spatial distributions as we used for our galaxy . \n disk novae obey a double exponential distribution , with radial and vertical scale lengths of 5 and 0.35 kpc , and the disk is truncated at @xmath8 kpc . \n bulge novae are taken to be distributed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a radial coordinate , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 kpc . \n the bulge is truncated at @xmath13 kpc , and the disk and bulge components interpenetrate . for galactic novae \n , we used a bulge  to  disk nova ratio of 1/7 , based on the estimated bulge  to  disk mass ratio of the galaxy ( van der kruit 1990 ) . \n for m31 , a more reasonable estimate of the bulge  to  disk mass ratio would be 1/2 ( hodge 1992 ; kent 1989 ) , so we adopt this as our default value of the m31 bulge  to  disk nova ratio . \n the m31 nova luminosity functions also are taken to be the same as we used for novae in our galaxy . \n they are gaussian , with dispersions @xmath14 , and the mean absolute magnitudes of disk and bulge novae are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . \n the middle panel of fig . \n 2 shows our model @xmath1distributions for true bulge novae , true disk novae ( we do know which _ model _ \n novae are from the disk and which are from the bulge ) , and the sum of the two . as can be seen in the top panel of fig . \n 2 , the total model @xmath1distribution agrees well with the observed @xmath1distribution on its bright side , to @xmath17 . \n however , the model distribution contains a larger proportion of faint novae than the observed distribution . \n this is due at least in part to observational selection against faint novae ( many faint observed novae had to be excluded from our sample because no estimate of peak apparent magnitude was available ) , but it may also be that our adopted luminosity functions contain too many intrinsically dim novae ; in any case this will not affect our main conclusion because it will be based only on the brighter novae . \n note that in the mean , the true disk novae are brighter than the true bulge novae . the bottom panel of fig . \n 2 is like the middle one , except that now the model novae are divided into _ apparent _ disk and _ apparent _ bulge novae , on the basis of whether or not their projected positions are within 18 arminutes of the center of m31 . because of the presence of true disk novae masquerading as apparent bulge novae , the difference between the @xmath1distributions of the apparent disk and apparent bulge novae is smaller than the difference between the @xmath1distributions for the true disk and true bulge novae . in the middle panel of fig . \n 2 , almost all of the bright novae are true disk novae , but in the lower panel , many of those true disk novae become apparent bulge novae . and , even though our input model bulge  to  disk nova ratio is only 1/2 , the apparent bulge novae outnumber the apparent disk novae . \n therefore , according to our model , _ a large fraction of the apparent bulge novae in m31 actually are disk novae_.    some insight into what is going on ( at least in the model ) can be gained from fig . \n 3 , which shows a side view of the spatial distribution of model novae having @xmath18 ; for clarity , the vertical scale is expanded by a factor of five . \n first , many true disk novae having @xmath19 kpc are seen as apparent bulge novae . \n second , while true bulge novae on the top side of the bulge are practically unextinguished , from our vantage point , true bulge novae on the bottom are significantly extinguished by dust that is well out in the disk , where the extinction is largest . \n this means that _ true bulge novae projected onto the top of the bulge are , in the mean , brighter than those projected onto the bottom . _ as can be inferred from looking at fig . \n 3 , the @xmath1distributions of true disk novae , on top and bottom , show a considerably milder difference .    fig . \n 3 suggests a way to estimate the actual m31 bulge  to  disk nova ratio , just by looking at the bottom  to  top ratio ( the btr ) of apparent bulge novae  and thus avoiding the issue of the extent to which the bulge has been searched more thoroughly than the disk . because fig . \n 2 shows that our model @xmath1distribution only fits the observed @xmath1distribution on its bright side , we now confine our attention to novae having @xmath20 . \n the btr of observed apparent bulge novae having @xmath21 ( see fig . \n 1 ) is @xmath22 , where the uncertainty is from @xmath23 statistics . the bottom panel of fig . \n 4 shows the model distribution of the sky positions of novae having @xmath24 . \n as expected , true disk novae show a mild asymmetry with respect to the major axis , while true bulge novae are strongly concentrated to the top . \n the top panel of fig . \n 4 is for an adopted bulge  to  disk ratio of nine , instead of 1/2 , _ \n i.e. _ , for the case in which m31 novae are overwhelmingly from the bulge . \n 5 is like fig . 4 , but showing enlarged views of the bulge . \n for the model bulge  to  disk ratio of 1/2 ( bottom panel ) , the btr of apparent bulge novae is 0.57 . for the bulge  dominated case ( top panel ) \n the btr ratio of apparent bulge novae is only 0.25 , and the disagreement with the sky positions of observed novae having @xmath21 ( fig . \n 1 ) is obvious . \n we have found that the assumption that m31 novae come overwhelmingly from the bulge produces results that are inconsistent with observation . \n instead , adopting an m31 disk  to  bulge nova ratio that is like the m31 disk  to  bulge mass ratio produces results that our acceptable . \n this would be consistent with the proposition that the nova rate per unit k  band luminosity is approximately constant ( ciardullo et al . \n 1990 ; shafter et al . \n 1996 ) . \n if we take our simple model literally we can go further and derive the m31 bulge  to  disk nova ratio that actually reproduces the observed btr of @xmath22 . \n 6 shows the dependence of the model btr on the percentage of true bulge novae , for three different degrees of dustiness  our standard case as described by eqns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ; twice as dusty ; and half as dusty . for our standard dust model , even zero percent bulge novae yields a btr that is not quite as high as the observed one ; within the statistical uncertainty of the observed btr the upper limit on the percentage of bulge novae is 25 percent , _ \n i.e. , _ a bulge  to  disk nova ratio of 1/3 . \n this would be consistent with the proposition that young populations are better at producing novae than old populations ( della valle et al . \n 1994 ; yungelson et al . \n however , fig . 6 shows that should m31 be only half as dusty as we have assumed ( cf . \n han 1996 ) , then our upper limit on the percentage of bulge novae would be 63 percent , _ \n i.e. _ a bulge  to  disk nova ratio of 1.7 . in view of the statistical uncertainties associated with the observed btr , and with our simple model , \n it probably would be premature to draw any conclusion other than that the m31 bulge  to  disk nova ratio is at least as low as the m31 bulge  to  disk mass ratio . \n now , in order to refine our knowledge of the spatial distribution of novae in m31 , what is needed is a carefully controlled search for novae that includes parts of the disk that are unambiguously outside the bulge . \n it is interesting that of eight m31 novae that were discovered in a recent search by sharov & alksnis ( 1996 ) , only three qualify as apparent bulge novae . \n as we completed this study we learned that another major search for novae in the disk of m31 is planned ( a. shafter , private communication ) . \n we are grateful to eddie baron , darrin casebeer , dean richardson , and lev yungelson for discussions , and to allen shafter for correspondence . \n this work has been supported by nsf grants ast 9417102 and 9417242 .", "StartTimeOffset": 651081031938, "RequestID": "1a880e3b1a354301cc7dae62f60cdd89cada8b8d", "TotalTokens": 3958}
{"ContextTokens": 3024, "GeneratedTokens": 235, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , there has been a great deal of activity on attempts of using grbs as cosmological probes  @xcite . in the original proposal  @xcite , it has been suggested that the magnitude versus redshift plot could be extended to redshifts up to @xmath2 , via correlations found between the isotropic equivalent luminosity , @xmath3 , and two grb observables , namely the time lag ( @xmath4 )  @xcite and variability ( @xmath5 )  @xcite . \n the isotropic equivalent luminosity is the inferred luminosity ( energy emitted per unit of time ) of a grb if all its energy is radiated isotropically , the time lag measures the time offset between high- and low - energy arriving grb photons , while the variability is a measure of the complexity of the grb light curve . using these correlations , one can infer two estimates of the absolute isotropic equivalent luminosity , which are combined through a weighted average . knowing the absolute isotropic equivalent luminosity together with the observed fluence yields an estimate of the luminosity distance to the grb .    unfortunately , these correlations are affected by a large statistical ( or intrinsic ) scatter . \n this statistical spread affects not only the cosmological precision via its direct statistical contribution to the distance modulus uncertainty , @xmath6 , but also through the calibration uncertainty given that the suitable grb sample with known redshift is rather small . in what follows \n we show that a relatively small sample of grbs with low redshifts is sufficient to greatly reduce the systematic uncertainty thanks to a more robust and precise calibration . \n more recently , a new correlation has been suggested  @xcite , which is subjected to a much smaller statistical scatter . \n the so - called ghirlanda relation is a correlation between the peak energy of the gamma - ray spectrum , @xmath7 ( in the @xmath8 plot ) , and the collimation - corrected energy emitted in gamma - rays , @xmath9 . \n this collimation - corrected energy is a measure of the energy released by a grb taking into account that it is beamed into a narrow jet . \n unlike the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations , the ghirlanda relation is not affected by large statistical uncertainties , however , it depends on poorly constrained quantities related to the properties of the medium around the burst . indeed , to infer @xmath9 one must estimate the angular opening of the jet , which can be performed assuming a density profile for the medium around the burst ( or circum - burst medium for short ) , where a fraction @xmath12 of the fireball kinetic energy is emitted in the prompt gamma - ray phase , and where one has measured the jet break time , @xmath13 @xcite . \n assuming that the circum - burst medium has a constant density , the simplest possible assumption , requires one additional parameter . \n this constant density has been measured for a few bursts  @xcite , and it exhibits a wide variation from burst to burst . \n another difficulty involving grbs is that they tend to occur at rather large distances , which makes it impossible to calibrate any relationship between the relevant variables in a way that is independent from the cosmological model . \n the method that is usually employed consist in fitting both , the cosmological _ and _ the calibration parameters , and then use statistical techniques to remove the undesired parameters . in here , we follow a different procedure @xcite . \n we consider that the luminosity distance for @xmath14 was previously measured using type ia supernovae , and divide the grbs sample in two sets ; the low redshift sample , with @xmath14 , and the high redshift one , with @xmath15 . \n since the luminosity distance of grbs in the range @xmath14 is already known , one can calibrate the luminosity estimators independently of the cosmological parameters and use the high redshift sample as a probe to dark energy and dark matter models . \n this method also allows us to verify whether the larger redshift range probed by grbs can compensate for the larger uncertainty associated with the distance estimates thus obtained . \n we have analyzed the use of these correlations in order to study of gcg , a model that unifies the dark energy and dark matter in a single fluid @xcite through the equation of state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are positive constants . \n the case @xmath19 describes the the chaplygin gas , that arises in different theoretical scenarios . \n if the curvature is fixed , there are only two free variables , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , although it is more convenient to use the quantity @xmath20 instead of @xmath17 . \n thus , we consider two free parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath21 . a great deal of effort has been recently devoted to constrain the gcg model parameters  @xcite , which include , for instance , supernovae  @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , gravitational lensing  @xcite and cosmic topology  @xcite . \n in addition to the gcg model , we also study the more conventional flat xcdm model . \n likewise the gcg model , the xcdm model is also described by two free parameters , the dark energy equation of state , @xmath22 , and the fraction of non - relativistic matter , @xmath23 . \n testing these models is particularly relevant since they are degenerate for redshifts @xmath24  @xcite . \n let us describe here the approach based on the correlation between the isotropic luminosity , and the variability and time lag . \n the @xmath10 and @xmath11 correlations are written as @xmath25 the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are found through fitting of these relationships to the data points , that is , via calibration of the luminosity estimators . \n given that the grb sample with measured redshifts is rather small , at present the calibration is rather poor . to test \n what improvements one expects to achieve in the future , we assess the gain in calibrating these relationships with larger samples . \n three mock , yet realistic , samples were generated , using the method detailed in ref . \n @xcite ; these mock data sets were used to calibrate the luminosity estimators .    we find that a calibration performed with @xmath28 grbs greatly improves the previous results , decreasing @xmath6 by close to half , yielding @xmath29 . \n however , by increasing the calibration sample to @xmath30 grbs the resulting improvement is just marginal , suggesting that very large calibration samples are not required . \n it is worth noting that a sample of about @xmath28 grbs may be available in the near future thanks to the _ swift _ satellite . \n we also find that despite the large statistical scatter , due to improvements in calibration , the uncertainty for this estimator becomes quite close to that obtained with the ghirlanda relation , @xmath31 ( c.f . \n however , it is also evident that , due to this large statistical uncertainty , one can not expect to significantly reduce the observational uncertainty of the variability and time lag method beyond about @xmath32 . in a sense , one arrives at a minimum possible uncertainty plateau , beyond which any further improvement seems impossible .    ) and 400 high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) grbs , while the dashed line show the 68% cl constraints for a sample made up of 500 high - redshift grbs only . \n on the left figure , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 relations have been used , while on the right one the ghirlanda relation was employed . \n the degeneracy of the @xmath18 parameter is quite evident.[gcg ] ]    next , we examine how grbs fare when used to constrain both models under consideration . \n the methodology is essentially the same of that used for type ia supernovae @xcite . \n one starts by defining a fiducial cosmological model , described by the parameters @xmath35 , and then use the @xmath36 function , defined as @xmath37 ^ 2~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the dimensionless luminosity distance , to build confidence regions in parameter space . \n the dimensionless luminosity distance of the grbs can be estimated using @xmath10 and @xmath11 . \n somewhat against our expectation , we found that grbs are not very suited to study the gcg model . \n the @xmath21 parameter can be constrained , however no limit can be imposed on @xmath18 , as shown in figure [ gcg ] . \n larger samples of grbs decrease the area of the allowed parameter space , however there is no significant improvement on the constraints imposed on either parameter . we also find that using some low - redshift grbs or the ghirlanda relation does not alter these conclusions significantly . \n the results for the xcdm model are , however , more promising . \n we find that grbs are sensitive essentially to @xmath23 , and very weakly sensitive to @xmath39 . \n the reason for this is the redshift range probed by grbs . \n we have verified that when using a sample that includes 100 grbs with @xmath14 , the constraints on the xcdm model are substantially better , as depicted in fig . \n it should be pointed out that this redshift dependence is not found for the gcg fiducial model . \n these results were found using the minimal @xmath40 . \n this uncertainty is essentially due to the statistical component , and hence it can not be reduced by better calibration or data , only through larger grb samples .    ) and 400 high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) grbs , while the dashed lines show the 68% cl constraints for a sample made up of 500 high - redshift grbs only . on the left figure , \n the @xmath33 and @xmath34 relations have been used , while on the right one the ghirlanda relation was employed . \n we discuss here the use of the ghirlanda relation , which is known to be intrinsically more precise . \n a drawback of this relation is its dependence on more parameters , and on how the circum - burst medium is modeled  @xcite . \n the calibration testing procedure was not repeated , as the main sources of uncertainty in the ghirlanda relation are the poorly constrained values of the peak energy , jet break time and circum - burst density  @xcite .    as before , \n we find that the characteristic feature of grbs of having rather high redshifts , makes them somewhat unsuitable to study dark energy models , even the gcg one . despite the increased precision , the allowed parameter range for the gcg model \n is not greatly improved when one uses the ghirlanda relation . as for the xcdm model \n , one finds that results are better if one uses the ghirlanda relations , but not significantly in what concerns the dark energy component . \n however , this independence on the the nature and amount of the dark energy component means that grbs can provide a estimate of @xmath23 alone , something which is not possible when using type ia supernovae . \n thus , while an improvement in calibration should not greatly alter the above conclusions , it should be noted that data quality and statistics will greatly improve in the future thanks to _ swift _ and _ hete 2 _ experiments . \n thus , as one expects significant improvements on the determinations of the peak energy , jet break time and circum - burst density , it is reasonable to assume that the distance modulus uncertainty for the ghirlanda relation will decrease . \n ]    the main conclusion of our study is that although grbs are poor dark energy probes , for @xmath15 , their luminosity distance is quite sensitive to the dominating energy density component . for the xcdm model , \n this is dark matter , and we find that the amount of dark matter can be remarkably constrained . for the gcg model , on the other hand , it turns out that what arises is a combination of the @xmath21 and @xmath18 parameters , and the data can not lift the degeneracy on @xmath18 . \n actually , if @xmath41 , the hubble function for the gcg becomes @xmath42 and one can easily observe that the allowed parameter region predicted from grbs does follow the line @xmath43 . \n this feature is also encountered in various phenomenological studies of the gcg , the only exception being on data from large scale structure formation  @xcite . \n also , the transition into an accelerated expansion phase in a gcg universe is faster , and at a lower redshift , than for the xcdm model . \n this explains why using some @xmath14 grbs improves the results for the latter model , while it does not have any impact on the former . \n the sensitivity on the non - relativistic matter density in xcdm models means that grbs may have a complementary role to play with respect to type ia supernovae . to test the impact of such a joint use \n , we built joint confidence regions for grbs and type ia supernovae constraints that may be imposed by the _ \n snap _ satellite . \n it was found that grbs may play an important role in the near future if a large grb data set is built before the promised scientific bounty of _ snap _ becomes available ( see figure [ sngrb ] ) . \n however , grbs should only marginally improve the constraints imposed by _ \n snap _ , unless the uncertainty is reduced by at least a factor of two by then . \n it must be realized that these results did not take into account several other systematic sources of error , namely selection and gravitational lensing effects . \n while for a tentative study , such as the one considered in this contribution , these potential sources of uncertainty may be neglected , a more careful assessment must be performed if one aims to impose robust constraints on cosmological models . \n furthermore , it is relevant to point out that the used correlations are purely phenomenological and lack , so far , a theoretical explanation . \n it is interesting that a new correlation has been recently proposed  @xcite which does not require any assumptions with regards to the circum - burst medium or the gamma - ray production efficiency . \n we are currently in the process of assessing the potential of such a relationship and testing whether marginalization methods , such as those used for type ia supernovae , can be advantageously employed  @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 657259499310, "RequestID": "a2860565d7fec90e12babcd89545c75769255262", "TotalTokens": 3259}

to - background ratio can be improved by adopting high @xmath2 cuts . \n we used madgraph / madevent @xcite ( version 1.3.1 of madgraph 5 ) to simulate the standard model background and calculate the scalar signal cross section at the lhc running at 7 and 14 @xmath43 center of mass energy , for different jet @xmath2 cuts and , in the weak singlet case , cuts on jet pair invariant masses . apart from this , \n the default madgraph run card was used , along with the @xmath44 pdfs . \n jets were ordered by @xmath2 , from highest to lowest . for the simulation of events involving scalars , we used feynrules @xcite to generate a model file for madgraph / madevent . \n events were run through pythia and pgs . \n madanalysis was used to plot the results . \n we point out that a similar analysis for weak singlet scalars was performed in ref.@xcite using pythia 5.7 . in this paper , however , we improve their analysis by running the events simulated using madgraph / madevent through pythia 6.420 and pgs4 . \n we also implement a larger set of @xmath2 cuts and impose a slightly different invariant mass cut . \n in addition , we present plots of the differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass of jet pairs and discuss the current constraints on the color octet scalar masses . \n we note that cuts can be tuned based on the scalar mass in order to maximize the effects of the scalars , at the same time leaving a large enough data sample . \n the restriction on the invariant mass of jet pairs we adopted is , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the invariant mass of the @xmath47-th and @xmath48-th jet as ranked by @xmath2 , and `` perms . '' \n denotes the other two possible pairings of the four jets . \n this cut simply requires that for at least one of the possible pairings the resulting invariant masses of jet pairs are within @xmath49 of each other . \n this should significantly suppress the standard model background , whereas the scalar signal is expected to essentially remain unchanged . \n figure [ fig : scalarm14 ] shows the four - jet differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass of jets 1 and 4 for various weak singlet color octet scalar masses after adopting the jet invariant mass cut ( [ masscut ] ) and different @xmath2 cuts . \n the signal is compared to the standard model background . \n the cross sections corresponding to several invariant mass windows are given in table i. in each case one can calculate the predicted number of events by multiplying the cross section by the integrated luminosity , and estimate the significance using the standard formula , @xmath50 . \n figure [ fig : muvspt ] shows the weak singlet scalar signal significance for different scalar masses and three sample data sizes at 14 tev lhc center of mass energy . \n we choose @xmath51 since the discovery significance for higher @xmath2 cuts does not improve by much . \n for scalar masses above 1 tev the significance is too small for the signal to be detected with @xmath52 of data . on the other hand , according to figure [ fig : muvspt ] , if there exists a low mass color octet scalar , it should be discovered relatively early at the lhc running at 14 tev . \n we also investigated current lhc constraints on the scalar masses with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath52 of data collected at @xmath55 center of mass energy . \n figure [ fig : muvspt2 ] shows the plot of the signal significance in this case as a function of the scalar mass . \n those data samples are still too small to extract any constraints on the color octet scalar masses from the four - jet analysis .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n we have investigated the effect of @xmath56 singlet and doublet color octet scalars on high @xmath2 four - jet events at the lhc . \n we analyzed part of the available parameter space , concentrating on the region least explored so far , i.e. , with no couplings or very weak couplings to quarks . \n we identified the proper signatures in both cases and imposed cuts which improved the signal significance .    in case of weak singlet \n color octet scalars , one of the best signatures to look for are four - jet events . the standard model background is significantly suppressed by choosing high transverse momenta jets and cuts on the invariant mass of jet pairs . \n the signal is then strongly peaked around the invariant jet pair mass equal to the scalar mass . \n this method can be used to look for low mass scalars already in the first few inverse femtobarns of data from the lhc running at 14 tev center of mass energy . \n the same four - jet signature can be used to search for weak doublet color octet scalars with no couplings or very small couplings to quarks . however , in this case there are also other channels involving four jets accompanied by weak vector bosons in the final state . because the standard model background is extremely small for those additional processes \n , such channels might be better to look at in search for weak doublet color octet scalars , especially since for massive scalars this signal should be much more significant than the four - jet signal . \n we performed such an analysis for particular values of the scalar potential parameters . in the case of stronger couplings between the @xmath0 doublet scalars and quarks , final states involving bottom and top quarks \n are more promising channels for discovery . \n the authors would like to express their special thanks to mark wise for inspirational discussions and many extremely helpful comments at all stages of the work on this paper . \n we are also very grateful to johan alwall for his continuous help , especially concerning the use of the madgraph 5 software . \n the work of the authors was supported in part by the u.s . \n department of energy under contract no . \n de - fg02 - 92er40701 . \n we further acknowledge the iisn `` madgraph '' convention 4.4511.10 for access to the ucl cluster . \n all feynman diagrams were drawn using jaxodraw @xcite . \n s.  i.  bityukov and n.  v.  krasnikov , _ the search for new physics by the measurement of the four jet cross - section at lhc and fnal _ , mod . \n a * 12 * , 2011 ( 1997 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/9705338 ] . \n y.  bai , b.  a.  dobrescu , _ heavy octets and tevatron signals with three or four b jets _ , \n jhep * 1107 * , 100 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1012.5814 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n b.  a.  dobrescu , k.  kong and r.  mahbubani , _ massive color - octet bosons and pairs of resonances at hadron colliders _ , \n b * 670 * , 119 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0709.2378 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n s.  y.  choi , m.  drees , j.  kalinowski , j.  m.  kim , e.  popenda and p.  m.  zerwas , _ color - octet scalars at the lhc _ \n , acta phys \n .  polon . \n b * 40 * , 1947 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0902.4706 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  v.  manohar , m.  b.  wise , _ flavor changing neutral currents , an extended scalar sector , and the higgs production rate at the cern large hadron collider _ , phys . \n rev .   * d74 * , 035009 ( 2006 ) [ hep - ph/0606172 ] . \n m.  i.  gresham and m.  b.  wise , _ color octet scalar production at the lhc _ \n d * 76 * , 075003 ( 2007 ) [ arxiv:0706.0909 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n m.  gerbush , t.  j.  khoo , d.  j.  phalen , a.  pierce , d.  tucker - smith , _ color - octet scalars at the cern lhc _ , phys . \n * d77 * , 095003 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0710.3133 [ hep - ph ] ] .            c.  kilic , t.  okui and r.  sundrum , \n _ colored resonances at the tevatron : phenomenology and discovery potential in multijets _ , jhep * 0807 * , 038 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0802.2568 [ hep - ph ] ] . c.  kilic , s.  schumann and m.  son , _ searching for multijet resonances at the lhc _ , \n jhep * 0904 * , 128 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0810.5542 [ hep - ph ] ] .    j.  alwall , m.  herquet , f.  maltoni , o.  mattelaer and t.  stelzer , _ madgraph 5 : going beyond _ , jhep * 1106 * , 128 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1106.0522 [ hep - ph ] ] . n.  d.  christensen and c.  duhr , _ feynrules - feynman rules made easy _ , comput \n .  phys . \n commun .   * \n 180 * , 1614 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0806.4194 [ hep - ph ] ] . c.  degrande , c.  duhr , b.  fuks , d.  grellscheid , o.  mattelaer and t.  reiter , _ ufo - the universal feynrules output _ , arxiv:1108.2040 [ hep - ph ] . \n d.  binosi and l.  theussl , _ jaxodraw : a graphical user interface for drawing feynman diagrams _ , \n commun . \n * 161 * , 76 ( 2004 ) [ hep - ph/0309015 ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 672877072086, "RequestID": "c54ad93ad0a3d9e9157e7b1967edded220920a2f", "TotalTokens": 4141}

( \n 2000 ) have studied the mid - infrared morphologies of the w49a complex , located on the far side of the galaxy and thus behind some @xmath3300 mag of extinction along the line of sight . \n their images have sufficient resolution to investigate the nature of the dust emission from individual sources and make comparisons with the radio observations . as another recent example , chini et al . \n ( 2001 ) produced a 20@xmath0m/10@xmath0 m `` temperature map '' of the dust in the orion bn / kl complex , and identified the main sources of heating . \n m , ( b ) 12.5@xmath0 m , and ( c ) 18.0@xmath0 m . \n contours are plotted for 10 and 15 @xmath8 levels in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , and for 5 , 10 and 15 @xmath8 in panel ( c ) . from marengo et al . \n ( 2000).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    one of the difficulties of probing the formation of protostars is a deficit of high spatial resolution observations . \n large extinction ( @xmath9 10 mag ) usually prevents optical imaging while millimeter observations typically have larger beam sizes . \n mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopy can help . \n for example , marengo et al . ( 2000 ) have recently presented sub - arcsecond - resolution images of the high - luminosity young stellar object afgl 2591 and its circumstellar enviornment . \n their images , at 11.7 , 12.5 and 18.0 @xmath0 m , reveal a knot of emission @xmath36  sw of the star , which may be evidence for a recent ejection event or an embedded companion star ( fig . \n this knot is roughly coincident with a previously seen near - infrared reflection nebula and a radio source , and lies within the known large - scale co outflow . \n marengo et al . also find a new faint nw source which may be another embedded lower - luminosity star . \n the _ iras _ mid - infrared spectrum of afgl 2591 shows a large silicate absorption feature at 10@xmath0 m , implying that the primary source is surrounded by an optically thick dusty envelope . \n first identified by herbig ( 1960 ) as higher - mass counterparts to young t tauri stars , these objects show many of the same signs of activity such as emission lines and large infrared excesses . over the years \n , several authors have attempted to model their spectral energy distributions as dusty envelopes and/or disks ( e.g. , miroshnichenko et al . 1999 and references therein ) . \n recent mid - infrared imaging by polomski ( 2001 ; fig . \n 2 ) and others reveal companions and complex circumstellar environments around many of these sources .          the recent discovery of a spatially - resolved disk around the nearby 10-myr - old star hr 4796a is a spectacular demonstration of the power of high - resolution mid - infared imaging  ( jayawardhana et al . 1998 ; koerner et al . \n the surface brightness distribution of the disk is consistent with the presence of an inner disk hole of @xmath550 au radius , as was first suggested by jura et al . \n ( 1993 ) based on the infrared spectrum , and provides an important constraint on inner disk evolution timescales . \n follow - up 10@xmath0 m and 18@xmath0 m observations on keck also revealed tentative evidence for a brightness asymmetry in the disk ( telesco et al . \n 2000 ; fig . \n 3 ) which may be the result of a forced eccentricity on dust particle orbits by a companion . \n mid - infrared spectroscopy , even at a relatively low resolution of @xmath6100 , is a useful probe of disk mineralogy . in particular \n , the 10@xmath0 m silicate feature of some disks appears to be rather similar to that of comets in the solar system ( e.g. , knacke et al . \n there is also some evidence , albeit limited to small samples , for evolution of the silicate feature over timescales of several million years ( e.g. , sitko et al . 2000 ) . \n one of the exciting prospects for the near future is nulling interferometry at 10@xmath0 m on the keck interferometer and vlti , with the possibility of detecting ( somewhat higher - surface - brightness ) counterparts of the zodiacal cloud around nearby stars . \n hinz et al .

of - freedom , which are supposed to emerge as effective particles after spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd  @xcite , are constituent quarks and goldstone bosons . \n the latter are realized by the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons . \n they provide a hyperfine interaction between the constituent quarks on top of a confining linear potential . in refs . \n @xcite goldstone - boson exchange between the quarks has been treated within an instantaneous approximation with the consequence that baryon excitations come out as stable bound states rather than resonances with a finite life time . \n a possible way towards overcoming this problem is to take the dynamics of the goldstone bosons explicitly into account  @xcite . \n this will not only change the baryon mass spectrum , but it will also affect the electroweak structure of the baryons . the physical picture of baryons that emerges from a constituent - quark model with instantaneous confinement and dynamical goldstone - boson exchange between the constituent quarks is that of a three - quark core which is surrounded by a pseudoscalar meson cloud . \n this kind of picture is also supported by a recent calculation of electromagnetic nucleon form factors performed within the bethe - salpeter - dyson - schwinger framework  @xcite . \n the author found clear signals of missing pion - cloud effects  in the low-@xmath0 region . in the following \n we will report on our attempt to estimate the pion - cloud contribution to the nucleon form factors within the framework of a ( generalized ) constituent - quark model . \n according to our introductory remarks , we consider a nucleon as a system of three constituent quarks which can emit and absorb pions and interact via an instantaneous confinement potential . \n we make use of the point - form of relativistic quantum mechanics in connection with the bakamjian - thomas construction to formulate electron - nucleon scattering in a poincar - invariant way  @xcite . following the strategy of refs . \n @xcite we then calculate the invariant @xmath1-exchange amplitude , extract the electromagnetic nucleon current , analyze the covariant structure of the current and identify the electromagnetic nucleon form factors .    in the point - form of relativistic dynamics , \n all four components of the momentum operator become interaction dependent , whereas the generators of lorentz transformations stay free of interactions . as a consequence , \n one has simple rotation and boost properties of wave functions and angular - momentum addition works like in non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite . \n thanks to the bakamjian - thomas construction , the overall motion of the system can be neatly separated from the internal motion : @xmath2 i.e. the 4-momentum operator factorizes into an interaction - dependent mass operator and a free 4-velocity operator . \n bakamjian - thomas type mass operators are most conveniently represented in a velocity - state basis . \n velocity states @xmath3 are characterized by the overall velocity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) of the system , the cm momenta @xmath6 of the individual particles and their spin projections @xmath7  @xcite . \n our goal is now to calculate the @xmath1-exchange amplitude for elastic electron scattering off a nucleon which is considered as a 3-quark system containing also a 3-quark - pion component . \n thereby not only the dynamics of electron and quarks , but also the dynamics of the photon and the pion should be fully taken into account . \n this is accomplished by means of a multichannel formulation that includes all states which can occur during the scattering process ( i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . \n what one then needs , in principle , are scattering solutions of @xmath12 which evolve from an asymptotic electron -

field theoretical interaction lagrangean densities  @xcite . \n the 4-vertices @xmath15 and @xmath16 show up only for pseudovector pion - quark coupling and vanish for pseudoscalar pion - quark coupling . \n it is now helpful to reduce eq . \n ( [ evequation ] ) to an eigenvalue problem for @xmath17 alone , which can be done by means of a feshbach reduction : @xmath18 { | \\psi_{3q e } \\rangle } = \\sqrt{s } \\ , { | \\psi_{3q e } \\rangle } \\ , , \\vspace{-0.3cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the 1@xmath20-exchange optical potential . \n the 1@xmath20-exchange amplitude is now obtained by sandwiching @xmath21 between physical electron -

form calculation  @xcite , we have taken an @xmath30 spin - flavor symmetric wave function for the ( bare ) nucleon with a simple ansatz for the momentum part : @xmath31 with @xmath32  gev , @xmath33  gev and @xmath34 , a reasonable reproduction of the proton magnetic and electric form factors is already achieved without pionic contribution ( see fig . \n the results for the strong @xmath26 form factor depend on whether a pseudoscalar or pseudovector pion - quark coupling is assumed ( see fig .  4 ) . \n better agreement with corresponding lattice predictions can be observed with the pseudovector pion - quark coupling which seems to be preferred also due to chiral - symmetry arguments . with these form factors and a model for the electromagnetic pion form factor ( e.g. the one from ref . \n @xcite ) , we have now the ingredients to calculate the graphs shown in fig .  2 and will get a first estimate for the pionic contribution to the electromagnetic nucleon form factors . \n refinements , like including a @xmath27 vertex ( with corresponding form factor ) , taking into account nucleonic excitations within the pion loop , or using a more sophisticated 3-quark wave function for @xmath23 will then be the subject of further studies .", "StartTimeOffset": 711031404264, "RequestID": "d1147ba1a5fbfa625582275cf6773be9abd59cab", "TotalTokens": 2174}

resonant background . moreover , \n light scalars are too numerous within a relatively short mass interval . the absence of a unique analysis procedure , especially regarding the interference of the background with the resonances results in conflicting measurements . in this sense \n the wider and lighter the state the worse , and this is the case of the two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 that will be discussed here . \n the theoretical interpretation of the lightest scalar meson have also been unclear . \n many objects  glueballs , @xmath3 molecules , multiquark compact states  are expected to populate the area . in a recent review article \n f. close and n. a. t@xmath4rnqvist@xcite discuss the scalars from both experimental end theoretical points of view . \n they suggest that the scalars be organized not in one but two nonets . \n the `` standard '' quark model @xmath5 nonet , distorted by a glueball predicted by lattice qcd , is enough to explain the region above @xmath6 1 gev . \n this nonet is composed by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the states below @xmath6 1gev  @xmath9 and possibly @xmath1 and @xmath2  by arguments based on qcd attractive forces in s -

wigners modulated by angular momentum conservation functions and form factors ) with complex coefficients obtained from the fit . \n the magnitude of the coefficients are proportional to each relative contribution and the phases accommodate in an effective way the final state interactions . \n it should be pointed out as the a great pro of these analysis the very good description that such simple model give to the data . \n alternative descriptions for the decay amplitude are being tried , for example focus experiment is using k -

resonant amplitude @xmath23 is represented by a constant . which is a reasonable assuption \n if we imagine that it is dominantly @xmath24-wave , in any case , the impact of this choice in the results is reduced due to a small nr contribution observed . \n the decay through resonant intermediate states , @xmath25 ( that then decay to the observed @xmath26 and @xmath27 hadrons ) , are viewed as s -

plot of each individual resonant state that contributes in the @xmath41 decay . \n notice that being coefficients and the individual amplitudes complex quantities , interference effects will take place when all the pieces act together . \n the above described produces a quite stringent model and obtaining acceptable fits is usually a difficult task . to access the quality of each fit a fast monte carlo ( mc ) \n program was developed which produces dalitz plot event densities accounting for signal and background pdf s , including detector efficiency and resolution . comparing the mc density distribution generated using parameters extracted from a given fit with that for the data \n , it is produced a @xmath42 distribution . \n when comparing two possible models , the best discriminating power test requires ensembles of monte carlo `` experiments '' . in the @xmath2 discussion below \n we illustrate the technique . \n we have chosen to start the results sessions with the @xmath44 because of the extremely clear signal seen in the @xmath45 decay , figure [ fig2 ] . \n there are dozens of measurements listed in pdg@xcite for this state and they converge to a reasonably well defined mass , @xmath46 mev but the estimation for width is from 40 to 100 mev .    for the best e791 fit 5 resonant channels contributes significantly : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , plus a nr that contributed with a fraction of only @xmath52% . \n the fit have @xmath53 = 71.8/68 with a confidence level of 35% . \n the dominant contributions comes from @xmath49 , @xmath54% , and @xmath51 , 32.4@xmath557.9% from which they measure : @xmath56 mev / c@xmath57 mev / c@xmath58 and @xmath59 mev / c@xmath58 . \n there is no evidence of a third higher mass scalar state , @xmath60 . \n previous production experiments claim a large contribution of the @xmath61 channel by estimation a large value of the parameter @xmath62 @xcite@xcite . \n these results do not agree with the value measured by e791 that , in fact , finds that a simple breit - wigner [ e3 ] is sufficient to represent the data . from the small but clear preliminary signal bes collaboration measure @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 gev@xcite . in figure [ fig3 ] \n we compare various results and conclude that in charm decay the resonance @xmath65 presents a narrower signal . \n the 1999 the workshop on hadron spectroscopy @xcite devoted one entire session to the meson @xmath1 , `` what do we know about the @xmath66 ? '' . by that time e791 \n had not published their observation of the meson @xmath66 in the decay of @xmath67@xcite . \n today charm decay is viewed as a tool for studying the light spectroscopy .    in figure [ fig4 ] \n we show the projection of the e791 dalitz plot where a clear peak at low mass can be seen . \n the figure compares the best fit achieved with all possible well established resonances available at the time , @xmath68 ( fit 1 ) , to their solution including a low mass scalar state , @xmath69 ( fit 2 ) . \n they measured @xmath70 mev / c@xmath58 and @xmath71 mev / c@xmath58 and the inclusion of the state took them from an unacceptable solution of @xmath53 = 254/162 with a confidence level less than 10@xmath72 to a very good fit with @xmath73 = 138/162 and confidence level of 90% . in fit 1 \n the nr contribution is dominant with 38% and in fit 2 following the trend of charm decays it dropped to 7.8% whereas the @xmath74 dominates with 46% . \n e791 perform a series of alternative fits and tests to be sure that no other model would as well describe the data . \n studying the channel @xmath75 bes experiment observe a signal of the mesons @xmath66 and measure their parameters @xcite ; @xmath76 mev / c@xmath58 and @xmath77 mev / c@xmath58 . in figure [ fig5 ] \n we show their final fit and scans for the @xmath66 mass and width measurements . \n as a last result we consider the @xmath2 resonance observed in e791 cabibbo favored decay @xmath78 . despite the large statistics available in this channel , no previous experiment @xcite@xcite \n have been able to provide a convincing explanation for this decay . \n e687@xcite best model for their sample of almost 9000 events have @xmath79 = 87/29 . \n the solution have the nr contribution dominating with a fraction of 99% . \n large interference pattern is produced with all fractions summing 147% . \n in contrast to the @xmath66 where a clear bump is seen in the @xmath80 projection , no evidence for a missing piece in the low @xmath81 region can be easily observed ( figure [ fig6]b ) . \n on the other hand the very large statistics and small number of possible intermediate states provide strong evidence of the need for an extra low mass wide resonance contributing for the decay . \n the first approach tried by e791 @xcite was to include all established states ; @xmath82 plus a nr ( they have studied also the possibility of a non - flat nr contribution without success ) . in general the result \n agree with previous studies including the bad quality of the fit . at this point \n they measured mass and width of the scalar @xmath16 to be 1416@xmath5527 and 250 @xmath55 21 mev / c@xmath58 respectively , which agree with pdg values . \n next they include an additional scalar named `` @xmath2 '' for which they measure respectively mass and width of 797@xmath55 47 and 410@xmath55 97 mev / c@xmath58 . in the same fit \n the parameters relative to @xmath16 were measured to be 1459@xmath559 and 175@xmath5517 mev / c@xmath58 . \n this new model describes very well the data with a @xmath79 = 46/63 , confidence level of 95% . \n the contribution of the new state is dominant with 48@xmath55 12% of the total fraction and the nr contribution is of 13@xmath557 % . \n the sum of all fractions dropped from 134% in the fit without @xmath2 to 88% indicating a smaller degree of interferences . \n in the amplitude analysis described here one do not measure directly a breit - wigner phase , instead it is assumed and consistency tests have to be performed to verify if alternative models are able to represent the data . \n this was done for this analysis ; a toy - model ( consisting of a breit - wigner amplitude without a phase variation ) , a vector and a tensor alternative models were tried , none producing a satisfying solutions . when comparing two possible models @xmath83 and @xmath84 the best figure of merit to be used is given by the neyman - person@xcite lema : @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are the likelihood for a given set of events calculated with the parameters obtained from fits to the data with models @xmath83 and @xmath84 . \n ensembles of 1000 monte carlo `` experiments '' were generated with the parameters extracted from fits to the data for the two models @xmath83 and @xmath84 . \n for each of such experiments the quantity @xmath87 was calculated and plotted in figure [ fig7 ] , where the model with the scalar @xmath2 is compared with model without it ; with the toy - model @xmath2 or with the vectorial @xmath2 . \n the discriminating power of the exercise is obvious by the separation of the distributions . \n the value of @xmath87 for the data is signed by the triangle showing the clear preference of the data to the model of the scalar @xmath2 . \n in conclusion , charm decay is , as said by f.close and t@xmath4rnqvist , a new window for studying light mesons . \n we discussed some of its remarkable contributions . with the already available data sets and the richness of charm decays \n , we hope to see in the near future confirmations and better measurements for some of the resonances , like the @xmath2 \n .    99 frank e. close and nils a. t@xmath4rnqvist , scalar mesons above and below 1 gev , hep - ph/0204205 e791 collaboration , e.m . \n aitala _ et al . \n lett . * 86 * 765 ( 2001 ) . \n e791 collaboration , e.m . \n aitala _ et al . \n lett . * 86 * 770 ( 2001 ) . \n e791 collaboration , e.m . \n aitala _ et al . \n _ , hep - ex/0204018 . \n submitted to prl .", "StartTimeOffset": 737823230010, "RequestID": "dee51e42e10e7486cf8a02fef5c5a690035ca426", "TotalTokens": 3508}

the spectra of flat - field and comparison lamps were also taken . during the subsequent reduction , \n the series of spectra for the object was aligned along the spatial axis and combined into a single spectrum for the subsequent extraction of one - dimensional spectra . \n all spectroscopic data were reduced with the standard ` iraf ` software package , which provides the tools to reduce the spectra obtained with long - slit spectroscopy , and using our own software . \n it turns out that to obtain sufficiently accurate spectroscopic redshift measurements it is not required to get a very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of elliptical galaxies . \n even if individual spectral features are not detected , redshift can be measured accurately from cross - correlation with elliptical galaxy template spectrum . \n accuracy of spectroscopic redshift measurements presented in this work can be estimated from delta @xmath16 and by comparison with other available redshifts measurements . \n this accuracy is not worse than 0.5% , except for one case where the resulting spectrum is too noisy and the accuracy of @xmath0 measurement is about 1% ( see  below ) .    as an example , the spectra of the brightest galaxies in clusters at various redshifts taken at rtt-150 , calar alto observatory 2.2-m telescope , and bta 6-m telescope are shown in figs . \n [ fig : rtt_example][fig : g14172_spec ] ( left panel ) . \n right panels in these figures show @xmath16 from cross - correlation of the galaxy spectrum with template spectrum of an elliptical galaxy . \n the minimum of @xmath16 corresponds to the most probable redshift of the elliptical galaxy . \n the results of our spectroscopic measurements for galaxy clusters from the first catalogue are presented in table  [ tab : clres ] . \n the object names , the coordinates of the cluster optical centers , and the redshifts measured here are provided in this table . \n the coordinates of the cluster optical centers were taken from @xcite and are given here for completeness . \n the last two columns specify which telescope was used to measure the redshift . for two clusters , psz1g060.12@xmath1211.42 and psz1g071.57@xmath1137.96 , \n the redshifts were also measured at the european northern observatory telescopes @xcite , and these measurements are in good agreement with ours . \n below , we give comments on several individual objects . \n [ [ psz1g141.7314.22 ] ] psz1g141.73@xmath1214.22 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the measured redshift of this cluster , @xmath17 , in the table is considerably more accurate ( the error is about 0.2% ) than its redshift in @xcite . \n the reason is that in our work we used the spectrum of the brightest cluster galaxy measured with a considerably higher signal - to - noise ratio , which was obtained at the 6-m bta telescope ( see fig . \n [ fig : g14172_spec ] ) . \n in addition , using the 2.2-m calar alto observatory telescope , we were able to obtain a considerably deeper image of this cluster ( see fig .

{"ContextTokens": 3560, "GeneratedTokens": 93, "SynthesizedBody": "recent analyses of spectroscopic data using modern three dimensional hydrodynamic atmospheric models have suggested that the solar abundance of oxygen and other abundant elements needs to be revised downward ( allende prieto , lambert & asplund 2001 , 2002 ; asplund et al . \n 2004a , b ; melendez 2004 ) . \n asplund et al . \n ( 2004a ) claim that the oxygen abundance should be reduced by a factor of about 1.48 from the earlier estimates of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) . \n the abundances of c , n , ne , ar and other elements are also reduced ( asplund et al . \n 2004b ) . as a result , \n the ratio ( by mass ) of heavy element to hydrogen abundance , @xmath0 , reduces from 0.023 to 0.0165 , which causes the heavy element abundance in the solar envelope to reduce from @xmath1 to 0.0122 . \n this will cause the opacity of solar material to decrease , in turn reducing the depth of the convection zone ( henceforth cz ) in solar models . \n bahcall & pinsonneault ( 2004 ) have constructed a standard solar model using these revised abundances to find that the depth of the cz is indeed reduced significantly making it inconsistent with seismically established value . \n basu & antia ( 2004 ) and bahcall et al . \n ( 2004a , 2005 ) also attempted to study solar models with reduced abundances and found that opacities near the base of the convection zone needs to be increased by 1020% to make them consistent with seismic data . \n turck - chize et al . \n ( 2004 ) also find that solar models constructed using revised heavy element abundances are not consistent with seismic inferences . \n subsequently , asplund et al .  ( \n 2004b ) have revised the abundances of some elements still further . as a result \n , the discrepancy can be expected to be somewhat larger .    since the discrepancy can be attributed to reduced opacities \n , there is a need to examine the opacity calculations . \n recently , seaton & badnell ( 2004 ) and badnell et al . \n ( 2004 ) have carried out independent opacity calculations under the op project . near the base of the solar cz , \n they only find a 2% increase in opacity as compared to opal . \n this is not likely to resolve the discrepancy , but nevertheless , the effect needs to be studied in detail . \n since two completely independent opacity calculations agree very well with each other , it is unlikely that any possible revision in opacity will be large enough to address the discrepancy caused by the downward revision of solar abundances . nevertheless , additional independent tests of opacity calculations are desirable to ensure reliability of opacities which are crucial input to stellar model calculations .    in this work \n we also study the effect of varying abundances of many heavy elements separately to check which of them are effective in addressing the discrepancy . such studies will help in identifying the elements which play a crucial role in the discrepancy in solar models . \n it turns out that the problem may be resolved if the neon abundance is increased by about 0.6 dex , i.e. , by a factor of 4 . \n it may be noted that the neon abundance in the photosphere can not be determined spectroscopically and hence the uncertainties could be large . \n following basu & antia ( 2004 ) we construct solar envelope models with different heavy element abundances . \n all these models have the seismically estimated hydrogen abundance , @xmath2 , of 0.739 ( basu & antia 1995 , 2004 ) and the depth of the convection zone of @xmath3 ( christensen - dalsgaard  et al .  1991 ; basu & antia 1997 , 2004 ) . as a result \n there are no free parameters in these models and the sound speed and density in these models can be compared with seismically inferred values to check for consistency . \n these models use the opal equation of state ( eos ) ( rogers & nayfonov 2002 ) and opacity tables from opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) or op ( badnell et al . \n 2004 ) . in all cases , \n the opacity has been calculated using the appropriate mixture of heavy elements , while the eos has been calculated using a standard mixture for which the opal tables are available . in principle \n , the eos tables also need to be modified in view of the change in mixture of heavy elements . \n that has not been done since the eos is not particularly sensitive to the detailed breakup of heavy element abundance . \n we construct solar envelope models using the heavy element abundances as given by grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) ( referred to as gs98 ) or asplund et al . \n ( 2004b ) ( referred to as asp04 ) . \n furthermore , to study the effect of abundances of individual heavy elements , we have constructed models where the abundances of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s and fe are separately reduced as compared to their abundances in gs98 . for each solar envelope model \n we compare the density profile in the lower part of the convection zone with that inferred through seismic inversions . \n in general , the two do not agree with each other and we need to modify the opacity near the base of the convection zone to get agreement . \n the opacity modification required to get the density to agree is a measure of consistency between seismic data , abundances and opacities . \n we compare the density profile in each solar envelope model with seismically inverted density and the results for some of the models are shown in fig . \n it is clear that the density profile in models constructed using the revised abundances is significantly different , from that of the sun , the densities being higher than solar density . \n the estimated errors in the density inversion results in the lower cz is about 1.5% , including systematic errors due to uncertainties in x , eos etc . \n ( basu & antia 2004 ) . the difference in density is more than 15% , much larger than the errors . \n on the other hand , models with gs98 abundances have density profiles within error limits , thus these models are consistent with seismic constraints . for the asp04 mixture the opacities need to be increased by @xmath4% for opal models and @xmath5% for op models to get the density profile in agreement with seismic inversions . \n the op and opal models for the same mixture are close to each other and the difference between them are consistent with known differences in opacity estimates . \n it is clear from fig .  1 that there is not much difference between models using opal and op opacities . \n in order to quantify the differences in opacities , fig .  2 shows the relative difference between the two opacities as a function of temperature in a solar model using asp04 mixture . \n the differences are taken at the same density and temperature and reflect the differences in the actual opacity calculations . \n the differences are generally less than 2% in the radiative interior . near the base of the cz \n the difference is of order of 1% . \n since the two independent opacity calculations agree remarkably well with each other , it is unlikely that the discrepancy caused by reduced abundances can be due to uncertainties in opacities . to separate out the contribution of each element we construct a series of solar envelope models with the gs98 mixture , with the abundance of one element at a time reduced by the amount shown in the third column of table  1 . \n two of these models ( for reduction in o and fe abundances ) are also shown in fig .  1 . \n the results using opal opacity tables are summarized in table 1 , which lists the required opacity modification to restore the density profile to that inferred by inversions . \n it also lists the logarithmic derivative of the required opacity modification with respect to abundance of each element . \n it is clear that the derivative is significant for abundant elements like o , ne , fe . \n thus the required opacity modification can be controlled by adjusting the abundance of some of these elements . \n and we see from fig .  1 , that the model with the increased ne abundance is actually consistent with seismic results . \n if we believe that the abundance determination of o , fe have improved significantly in recent times , then there may not be much uncertainty in their estimated abundance and we do not have much freedom to vary those abundances . \n the photospheric abundance of ne however , may involve higher uncertainties since it can not be determined spectroscopically due to lack of suitable photospheric lines and has to be determined from coronal lines . \n this could also involve uncertainties due to possible fractionation in these layers , as the coronal ne abundance may not reflect that in the photosphere . \n thus we speculate that the effect of reduction in abundance of other elements like c , n , and o may be compensated by an increase in the ne abundance . the required ne abundance \n can be estimated by constructing models with different values of ne abundance to estimate the required abundance to match the density profile . \n it turns out that we need an increase in ne abundance by @xmath6 dex when op opacities are used , and by @xmath7 dex when opal opacities are used . \n this corresponds to an increase in abundance by a factor of just over 4 . \n it can be seen from fig .  1 that the envelope models constructed using these abundances have the correct density profile . \n we can also estimate the required increase in ne abundance from the partial derivative given in table  1 , but that gives a somewhat larger estimate , presumably because the derivative itself would increase when ne abundance increases by a factor of 4 . \n primary seismic inversions for sound speed and density are independent of opacities , but we need to use opacities in order to infer the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles in the solar interior ( gough & kosovichev 1988 ; shibahashi & takata 1996 ; antia & chitre 1998 ) . \n we therefore check the differences in the inferred temperature and @xmath2 profile of the sun arising from the use of the two different opacity tables . \n figure  3 shows the difference in temperature and hydrogen abundance inferred using the technique described by antia & chitre ( 1998 ) . \n the differences are taken between the profiles calculated using op and opal opacities ( in the sense op @xmath8 opal ) when the same heavy elements abundances are used . \n the differences of less than 0.005 are comparable to estimated errors from other sources . \n in contrast , the difference between the @xmath9 and @xmath2 profiles obtained using gs98 and asp04 mixtures with the same opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger . \n thus the differences in opacities between opal and op do not lead to significant differences in seismic inversions for the solar temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles . \n recently , bahcall et al . \n ( 2004b ) have also compared models constructed using opal and op opacities and they also find similar differences in solar models due to opacities . \n although , the change in mixture from gs98 to asp04 leads to large changes in the inferred solar @xmath2 and @xmath9 profiles , these results do not have much significance because the value of @xmath2 near the base of the convection zone obtained with the asp04 mixture is inconsistent with helioseismic estimate of @xmath2 in the convection zone . \n the estimate of @xmath2 in the convection zone is barely affected by abundances of heavy elements ( basu & antia 2004 ) . \n the discrepancy in the @xmath2 profile is yet another measure of the inconsistency between opacity , abundances and seismic constraints . \n we find that solar envelope models that have reduced abundances of oxygen and related elements do not have the correct density profile in the cz despite having the seismically determined cz depth and surface @xmath2 . \n the density difference is about 15% , which is more than 10 times the estimated uncertainties in density . in order to get a seismically consistent solar model it is necessary to increase the opacities near the base of the convection zone . \n the required increase in opacity is 25% for op tables and 27% for opal tables . the slight increase in this estimate as compared to that by basu & antia ( 2004 ) and bahcall et al . \n ( 2004a ) is due to the further reduction of the abundance estimates for some elements . \n bahcall et al . \n ( 2005 ) who used evolutionary solar models , estimate that an increase in opal opacity by 11% may be enough to get solar models in reasonable agreement with seismic constraints . \n the difference is most likely due to the fact that the envelope helium abundance in these models is somewhat low ( 0.243 ) compared with seismic abundances , and because evolutionary standard solar models do not have abundance profiles that agree with the seismically determined abundance profiles ( antia & chitre 1998 ) in the region just below the base of the cz . \n these reasons are in addition to the further reduction of the abundances since the work of bahcall et al . \n if we construct solar envelope models with @xmath10 , then the required opacity modification reduces by 5% . \n the remaining difference is almost certainly due to difference in composition profile just below the base of cz and further reduction in abundances of some elements .    considering the excellent agreement between opal and op opacities it is unlikely that the error in computed opacity is of order of 10% or larger . \n thus the discrepancy between solar model with latest abundances and seismically inverted density profile is not likely to be due to opacities . \n an independent study of solar abundances is required to verify the recently estimated values . \n one possibility is that abundance of some element has been underestimated . to study the effect of each element \n separately we have constructed models with reduction in abundance of only one element at a time . from this study \n we find that the required opacity modification is mainly controlled by abundances of o , ne and fe . \n thus it would be worthwhile to determine the abundances of these elements independently to estimate any possible systematic errors in their determination . \n of these the photospheric abundance of ne has not been determined spectroscopically and hence the uncertainties could be high . \n thus we speculate that the ne abundance may be increased to compensate for reduction in abundances of other elements . \n we find that the required increase is @xmath6 dex for op opacities and @xmath7 dex for opal opacities . \n thus the estimated ne abundance [ ne / h]@xmath11 may be compared with a value of 7.84 ( asplund et al . \n 2004b ) and @xmath12 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . \n of course it is unlikely that the entire discrepancy is due to ne abundance , and almost certainly a part of the discrepancy is due to other uncertainties , including those in abundances of other elements . for example , if we construct models with abundances of c , n , o , fe increased by 0.05 dex ( which is the @xmath13 error estimate in their abundances ) over the values obtained by asplund et al . \n ( 2004b ) , the ne abundance needs to be increased by only a factor of 2.5 ( 0.40 dex ) to get the density within 1.5% of the inverted values in the lower part of the cz . \n it may be noted that we have increased the abundances of c , n , o by the same amount since these abundances are correlated . the required increase in \n ne abundance is comparable to the factor of 1.74 ( 0.24 dex ) decrease in ne abundance between grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) and asplund et al . \n ( 2004b ) . \n asplund , m. , grevesse , n. , & sauval , a. j. 2004b , in cosmic abundances as

pion threshold , unitarity is expressed by the final state theorem of watson , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the corresponding @xmath17 phase shift and @xmath18 an integer . \n we have essentially followed the method of schwela et al @xcite to solve eq . \n ( [ inteq ] ) with the constraint ( [ watson ] ) . \n in addition we have taken into account the coupling to some higher states neglected in that earlier reference . at the energies above two - pion threshold up to @xmath19 gev , eq . \n ( [ watson ] ) has been replaced by an ansatz based on unitarity @xcite . finally , the contribution of the dispersive integrals from @xmath20 gev to infinity has been replaced by @xmath0-channel exchange , parametrized by certain fractions of @xmath21- and @xmath22-exchange . \n furthermore , we have to allow for the addition of solutions of the homogeneous equations to the coupled system of eq . \n ( [ inteq ] ) . \n the whole procedure introduces 9 free parameters , which have to be determined by a fit to the data.@xcite    in our data base we have included the recent mami experiments for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production off the proton in the energy range from 160 mev to 420 mev@xcite , both older and more recent data from bonn for @xmath23 production off the proton@xcite , and older frascati@xcite and more recent triumf data@xcite on @xmath4 production off the neutron . \n our fit obtained with this data base describes this data very well and in addition it also gives good agreement with data from the world data base ( e.g. said@xcite ) not included in our fit . \n in table 1 we give our results for the @xmath24- and @xmath25-wave amplitudes at threshold and compare them to the available information from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite and experiment . \n the reduced @xmath25-wave amplitudes are defined as usual by @xmath26 , in the limit @xmath27 . \n in fact the dependence on the photon energy @xmath28 is not stringent , and in explicit calculations this definition leads to less energy dependence for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while @xmath31 would vary less without the factor @xmath32 . in general there is a very good agreement between our analysis , hbchpt and experiment . in our analysis the uncertainties are mainly in the neutron channel , especially for @xmath33 , where the lack of precise experimental data , in particular of polarization observables , reflects in the threshold values . \n in fact it is interesting to note that the threshold amplitudes given in table 1 are not fitted to the threshold data . \n they are only determined from experimental information above @xmath34 mev , therefore , they should be considered as predictions rather than fits . the interplay of the complete knowledge of pion photoproduction at all energies in the framework of dispersion relations can be seen in the individual contributions to the threshold values of the @xmath24-wave amplitudes . for @xmath35 \n we obtain @xmath36 where the individual contributions are from the pole terms , from @xmath37 and higher multipoles , respectively . \n there is special theoretical interest in the @xmath38 amplitude of @xmath39 because it allows for an independent determination of the charge exchange pion - nucleon scattering length via the panofsky ratio , @xmath40 . \n this ratio is well determined by experiment , @xmath41 @xcite , and related to the scattering length by time reversal , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath45 momenta of photon and neutral pion at @xmath46 threshold . \n using our value of the threshold amplitude , and the measured panofsky ratio , we find @xmath47 . \n this has to be compared with the value @xmath48 resulting from a partial wave analysis of pion - nucleon scattering @xcite ( solution kh80 ) . \n recently , @xmath49 has also been determined by studying the level spacing of pionic atoms , with a preliminary value of @xmath50 @xcite .    .threshold \n amplitudes for pion photoproduction . \n the @xmath24-waves @xmath38 are in units of @xmath51 and the reduced @xmath25-wave multipoles are in units of @xmath52 . \n our values are compared with results from chiral perturbation theory @xcite and data analysis for charged pion production@xcite and neutral pion production off the proton@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ratios ]    in table 2 we compare our result with two vpi solutions , the solution of the rpi group in a field theoretical lagrangian approach and the experimental analyses of mainz and brookhaven . with the numerical solutions of vpi and rpi we have applied the speed - plot technique in order to separate resonance and background contributions and to determine the pole position and residues . while the `` full '' ratios @xmath53 vary by more than a factor of 2 among these solutions , the ratios @xmath54 are much closer to each others . in particular , the imaginary parts are very stable within only about 30% .    finally , we have determined the photon couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the delta resonance \n . from our energy - dependent analysis we get @xmath57 and @xmath58 , both in units of @xmath59 . \n however , it should be again noted that both the @xmath53 ratio and the photon couplings , calculated at the k - matrix pole are well - defined quantities but they have no direct connection to quark model calculations of a `` bare '' resonance . \n with the new and very precise data obtained at mami in mainz we have obtained a new partial wave analysis for pion photoproduction . \n the uncertainties in most multipoles could be considerably improved compared to previous analyses . \n very accurate results can be obtained at threshold and in the resonance region . at resonance \n we must clearly distinguish between the resonance position @xmath60 mev on the real axis and the pole at @xmath61 mev in the complex plane . at the resonance position , where the phase passes @xmath62 \n , we obtain an rem ratio of @xmath63 in very good agreement with the experimental analysis@xcite . \n this was also recently confirmed in a vpi analysis with a restricted data base@xcite . at the pole in the complex plane \n we obtain the ratio of the resonant electric and magnetic multipoles as @xmath64 . \n this is a model - independent ratio that can be determined in any analysis or calculation of pion photoproduction . after a long time of confusion about the different ratios that can be defined and constructed out of the measured cross sections or the analysed multipoles @xmath65 and @xmath66 \n , it now appears that the ratio @xmath54 is the closest one can get to a background subtracted value . \n such a ratio must be complex , and it will be a challenge for all microscopic models to determine this ratio . \n 99 g.  hhler , pion - nucleon scattering , landoldt - brnstein , vol . \n i/9b2 , ed . \n h.  schopper , springer ( 1983 ) . \n d.  schwela and r.  weizel , z. physik 221 ( 1969 ) 71 . \n w.  pfeil and d.  schwela , nucl . phys . \n b 45 ( 1972 ) 379 . for further details see o.  hanstein , d.  drechsel and l.  tiator , phys . \n b 385 ( 1996 ) 45 ; phys . lett . \n b 399 ( 1997 ) 13 ; nucl - th/9709067 ( submitted to nucl . phys . \n a ) and our theory homepage : www.kph.uni - mainz.de / theory/. m.  fuchs et al . \n b 368 ( 1996 ) 20 . r.  beck et al . , phys . \n 78 ( 1997 ) 606 , + h .- p . \n krahn , ph.d . \n thesis , mainz ( 1996 ) . \n f.  hrter , phd . \n thesis , mainz ( 1996 ) . \n d.  menze , w.  pfeil and r.  wilcke , compilation of pion photoproduction data , bonn ( 1977 ) . \n k.  buechler et al . , nucl . \n phys . a 570 ( 1994 ) 580 . \n h.  dutz , phd . \n thesis , bonn ( 1993 ) , + d.  krmer , phd .  thesis , \n bonn ( 1993 ) , + b.  zucht , phd . \n thesis , bonn ( 1995 ) . \n f.  carbonara et al . , nuovo cim . 13 a ( 1973 ) 59 . \n a.  bagheri et al . \n , phys . rev . \n c 38 ( 1988 ) 875 . \n r.  a.  arndt , i.  i.  strakovsky and r.  l.  workman , phys . \n c 53 ( 1996 ) 430 ; the multipole analysis ( sp97k ) and the world data base was taken from said . \n v.  bernard , n.  kaiser and u .- g . \n meiner , phys . \n b 383 ( 1996 ) 116 . j.  spuller et al . , phys . \n 67 b ( 1977 ) 479 . \n m.  janousch et al . , proc . of the @xmath67 int . \n conf . on particles and nuclei , williamsburg 1996 , eds . \n carlson , j.j . \n domingo , world scientific , singapore 1997 , p. 372 . \n m.  i.  adamovich , proc . \n p. n. lebedev phys . \n ( 1976 ) 119 . j.  c.  bergstrom et al , phys . \n c 50 ( 1994 ) 2979 and phys . \n c 55 ( 1997 ) 2016 . \n g.  hhler and a.  schulte , @xmath17 newsletter 7 ( 1992 ) 94 . \n r.  m.  davidson , private communication . \n r.  workman , vpi solution b500 , presented at this conference . \n g.  blanpied et al . \n , preprint bnl-64382 , brookhaven 1997 .", "StartTimeOffset": 757917435534, "RequestID": "441a5316c5810706b40d97b322371661210cb7f6", "TotalTokens": 3099}

[ fig_tc10 ] . \n the straight line fit from figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] and  [ fig_lilj1 ] comes in as second lowest . \n the lowest curve corresponds to eq . \n ( [ rijas ] ) and the upper curve to dividing the @xmath29 fit of column six of table  [ tab_as ] by the @xmath40 fit of the same column . \n as suspected this curve looks rather fanciful . \n however , using a log scale for the abscissa would stretch the range on the left , and one should have in mind that the absolute differences between all three fits are quite small . \n systematic errors at @xmath50 can be read off on the right - hand side of the figure and are seen to be less than  4% . \n we have studied the approach of su(2 ) lgt to its quantum continuum limit by investigating the scaling behavior of a number of length scales with definitions based on the deconfinement phase transition , the gradient flow and the cooling flow . while the deconfining scale @xmath51 is uniquely defined ( [ ntau ] ) , one has considerable freedom in the definition of gradient and cooling flow scales . \n they depend on the choice of observables and target values of the flow . \n we considered :    1 . \n energy densities @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 defined by eqs . \n ( [ e0 ] , [ e1 ] , [ e4 ] ) . \n @xmath52 is up to normalization the wilson action and @xmath53 in essence an equivalent definition . \n @xmath54 , introduced in @xcite , averages over four plaquettes . \n target values @xmath55 and @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 ) are defined by eqs . \n ( [ yi01 ] , [ yi02 ] , [ cyi01 ] , [ cyi02 ] ) . \n they are constructed so that the initial scaling behavior of either the gradient or the cooling flow of either @xmath52 , @xmath53 or @xmath54 matches that of the deconfinement length @xmath17 ( altogether @xmath58 distinct definitions ) .    for ratios of these length scales , corrections to scaling are supposed to be of order @xmath59 in the lattice spacing as illustrated in figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] , [ fig_lilj1 ] , [ fig_lilj2 ] , [ fig_scaling2 ] and  [ fig_tc10 ] . in these figures \n the cooling length scale @xmath40 , which relies on the @xmath52 energy density and a @xmath60 target value ( [ cyi02 ] ) , is used as reference scale by the following reasons :    1 .   scaling violations of ratios of scales \n are then rather symmetrically distributed above and below  1 . \n @xmath52 is easier to calculate than @xmath54 and estimates from the same statistics result in smaller error bars for the @xmath52 length scale . \n no scaling advantages were found for @xmath54 scales . \n @xmath53 is essentially equivalent to @xmath52 with the benefit for @xmath52 that the wilson action is implemented in the program anyhow . \n the cooling flow is faster and easier to calculate than the gradient flow and there is no noticeable loss of accuracy as anticipated in ref . \n as the cooling method @xcite was an answer to difficulties encountered when trying to calculate the topological charge in a paper by lscher and one of the authors @xcite , it appears that the cooling scale could have been introduced 30 years before the gradient scale @xcite . \n the magnitude of scaling violations we find for ratios of length scales is close to that reported in ref . \n @xcite for su(3 ) when comparing the @xmath52 with the @xmath54 flow . \n the su(2 ) scaling region begins at @xmath61 where we find corrections to scaling in the 10% range . \n deeper in the scaling region , at @xmath62 , they become reduced to slightly less than  5% .    scaling corrections for the ratio @xmath63 fall into the range provided by the other scales as is seen in figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] and  [ fig_lilj1 ] . \n the significant advantage of the gradient scale , and to an even greater extent the cooling scale , over the deconfinement scale is that we can far more easily follow the scaling behavior towards the continuum limit . on the other hand , \n there are no ambiguities in the definition of the deconfinement scale , which makes it kind of ideal to define initial scaling values as discussed in sections  [ sec_grad ] and  [ sec_cool ] . \n we have used two rather different approaches for analyzing our data . for figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] to  [ fig_lilj2 ] we simply calculate @xmath64 from jackknife bins of the data and perform the linear 2-parameter fit ( [ rij ] ) using the @xmath31 dependence @xmath43 from the same data . \n while this is straightforward , one does not connect with the asymptotic @xmath65 scale .    to connect with asymptotic scaling , we relied on truncated forms of eq . \n ( [ fas ] ) based on ref \n .  @xcite . \n the normalization constants of our asymptotic scaling fits are collected in table  [ tab_as ] . \n a common fixed parameter ensures that scaling corrections for ratios are  @xmath31 . \n systematic errors due to distinct truncations of the fits are found around 10% . \n for the gradient and cooling scales the finally accepted fits of column six rely on three free parameters , one of them being the normalization constant that yields the continuum estimate . for @xmath29 four fit parameters \n are needed despite the fact that there are only five data points . comparing in fig . \n [ fig_tc10 ] the ratio of the @xmath29 and @xmath40 fit with direct fits of the @xmath66 ratios indicates overfitting , though @xmath29 data on larger lattices is needed to be conclusive . \n while the lattice spacing is exponentially small in @xmath25 , asymptotic scaling corrections come in powers of @xmath67 . \n as is seen in fig . \n [ fig_ascaling ] , they range at @xmath61 from 30% to 36% . \n the scales cluster together , so that the relative deviations at @xmath68 reproduce the previously encountered 10% range .    for ratio estimates \n it turns out that one should not divide the asymptotic scaling estimates by one another , but perform the fit ( [ rijas ] ) for the jackknifed @xmath69 ratios of the data , where the common fixed parameter is set to zero to enforce @xmath70 corrections . a decisive difference to the previous approach ( [ rij ] ) remains : the @xmath31 behavior is no longer enforced for our data at hand , but only in the continuum limit . \n indeed , some of the fits make use of this possibility . \n compare fig . \n [ fig_scaling2 ] with figs . \n [ fig_lilj1 ] and  [ fig_lilj2 ] . despite the differences in the approach to the continuum limit , \n the obtained curves look similar . \n the continuum limit estimates of our ratios are collected in tables  [ tab_rij ] and  [ tab_ratb ] using , respectively , ( [ rij ] ) and ( [ rijas ] ) . \n differences due to the distinct fit forms stay below 1.3% . \n this is in most cases larger than the statistical errors . \n the different fit forms allow one to get an idea of the systematic errors possible .    in conclusion \n , we hope that the methods outlined are also of some value for studying the approach of physically realistic theories like qcd to their continuum limits . \n though such data rely on large scale calculations on supercomputers , it is presumably safe to assume that their quality is not better than that of our su(2 ) data . \n david clarke was in part supported by the us department of energy ( doe ) under contract de - sc0010102 . \n our calculations used resources of the national energy

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see figure 1 ) . \n @xcite have recently presented high resolution spectra for ucsds , providing the first rotational velocity and accurate radial velocity measurements for these sources . \n the high @xmath5 = 65@xmath615  km / s of the l subdwarf 2mass  j0532 + 8246 @xcite suggests that the lowest mass halo stars may not lose their angular momentum as efficiently as more massive stars . \n they also find that one of the first l subdwarfs to be identified , lsr  1610 - 0040 @xcite , has mixed m dwarf and subdwarf spectral features , a conclusion also reached by @xcite on the basis of near - infrared spectroscopy . \n this source appears to be peculiar , even among the small number of ucsds now known . \n @xcite provides a compendium of 16 currently known ucsds , an increase of 60% since cool stars 13 . \n this increase has been driven by new proper motion search programs using red optical photographic plate surveys ( e.g. , superblink , @xcite ; and the supercosmos sky survey [ sss ] , @xcite ) and serendipitous discoveries in near - infrared catalogs such as 2mass . \n new discoveries include two ultracool extreme subdwarfs @xcite , tripling the number of known ultracool esdms ; and a new l subdwarf , sdss 1256 - 0224 , reported by @xcite . \n while red optical proper motion surveys have been successful , the spectral energy distributions of cooler ucsds peak around 1  @xmath4 ( a balance of reduced t@xmath0 and increased absorption by h@xmath3 ; see figure  1 ) , so near - infrared measurements become increasingly useful . \n indeed , the ukidss survey with its 1  @xmath4 @xmath7-band should be highly sensitive to ucsds @xcite . \n the recent inception of near - infrared proper motion surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ; j.  d.  kirkpatrick , 2007 , in prep . ) will likely expand the known ucsd population substantially in the near term . \n spectral types for ucsds are currently based on extrapolations of schemes developed for earlier - type m subdwarfs @xcite , based on tio and cah bands in the 62007300   region . \n these features become inadequate in the ucsd regime as tio and cah bands decline due to condensation ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; wide , pressure - broadened na  i and k  i lines suppress adjacent features @xcite ; and the sources themselves become exceedingly faint at optical wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite have suggested the use of the same red optical features used to classify l dwarfs as diagnostics for ucsd classification , and the direct comparison of l subdwarf spectra to l dwarf spectral standards ( see figure  2 ) . at near - infrared wavelengths , useful diagnostics are largely limited to the @xmath8-band region ( figure  1 ) , and work is progressing in this direction ( burgasser et al . , in prep . ) .    an issue to consider in the classification of ucsds \n is the division of metallicity classes . \n strong , blanketing molecular bands results in greater spectral sensitivity to metallicity and chemistry effects . \n the current population of ucsds may already span a fairly broad range of metallicities , as suggested by comparisons to atmospheric models ( * ? ? ? \n * see figure  2 above ) ; and the metallicities of early - type sdms may not ( and perhaps need not ) correspond to those of late - type sdms and sdls . in addition , even slightly metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath9 -0.5 ) `` mild '' ucsds are spectrally distinct ( figure  1 ) , and a `` d / sd '' designation for these objects has been suggested . \n this group would encompass slightly metal - poor t dwarfs , distinguished by depressed @xmath10-band peaks ( due to h@xmath3 absorption ) and enhanced @xmath7-band peaks ( possibly related to the red wing of the k  i doublet at 0.77  @xmath4 ; @xcite ) ; and several recent discoveries of so - called `` blue '' l dwarfs @xcite that may also be metal - poor . \n i briefly summarize other issues that have arisen in recent studies of ucsds . \n the interested reader is encouraged to examine the literature for further discussion .    _ \n dust formation : _ one of the defining properties of l field dwarfs is the formation of condensate dust in their photospheres , driving the depletion of gaseous tio , vo , cah , al  i , ca  i and ti  i in the photosphere @xcite . \n however , several late - type subdwarfs exhibit features from these species when it is absent in their dwarf counterparts ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see figure  2 above ) . \n their persistence suggests that condensate formation may be inhibited in metal - poor atmospheres ; chemical modeling of this effect is needed . \n _ spectral modeling : _ attempts to derive physical properties for ucsds based on spectral model fits have met with mixed results ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n the difficulties stem from the same issues that arise when modeling ultracool dwarf spectra ; e.g. , complex molecular opacities , and chemistry and condensate grain formation . \n there are new concerted efforts to develop better metal - poor atmosphere models in the ucsd regime ( @xcite ; schweitzer , hauschildt & wawrzyn , these proceedings ) . _ \n binaries : _ binary systems are useful laboratories for studying detailed properties , testing formation theories and finding low temeprature sources as companions ( see splinter session overview by h.  bouy ) . there have been a couple of studies targeting m subdwarfs for companions ( * ? ? ? \n * gelino & kirkpatrick , these proceedings ) with as yet no reported ucsd discoveries . \n _ distance measurements : _ these are perhaps the most crucial observations needed , as only two ucsds have reported parallaxes . \n such measurements make possible the construction of absolute magnitude , luminosity and t@xmath0 scales , and facilitate comparisons to spectral and structural models . \n i would like to thank a.  burrows , j.  d.  kirkpatrick , r .- d . \n scholz , and a.  schweitzer for discussions in the final preparation of this contribution , and r .- d . \n scholz for providing an electronic version of figure  2 . \n burgasser , a.  j. , kirkpatrick , j.  d. , & lpine , s. 2005 in the 13th cambridge workshop on cool stars , stellar systems , and the sun ( esa - sp-560 ) , ed . \n f.  favata , g.  a.  j.  hussain & b.  battrick ( noordwijk : esa ) , p.  237", "StartTimeOffset": 765893408394, "RequestID": "b06f78a936a2cd1381dc0c4bcfb50b690eeed731", "TotalTokens": 2232}

{"ContextTokens": 3549, "GeneratedTokens": 139, "SynthesizedBody": "the observation of formation of nanocrystals ( ncs ) by annealing of silicon dioxide films having excess si or ge has attracted attention due to optical and electronic properties of such nanostructures  @xcite . in particular , ge ncs embedded in amorphous silicon oxide ( a - sio ) films have been subject of study , because of low temperature of formation , compatibility with standard integrated circuit fabrication processes and for their potential applications in optoelectronic and memory devices . \n the ncs are candidates as storage media for electron storage cells in flash memory devices  @xcite . since many parameters of ncs such as density , size and composition can be adjusted by proper choice of fabrication parameters , they offer flexibility in design of nc flash memory cells \n . however , a better understanding of charge storage mechanism is important in optimization of device performance . \n recent studies have proposed a model describing the storage of carriers in nc - mos devices assuming storage in deep - traps @xcite associated with ncs and trap energy level engineering was investigated to improve device performance .    in this paper , we investigate an alternative mechanism for carrier storage by assuming carrier storage in nc energy levels instead of deep traps . based on this assumption , we present a theoretical model that includes the effect of nc dimensions and density to calculate the discharge dynamics . \n germanium nc - mos capacitors have been fabricated and characterized using capacitance measurements . \n results are compared with theory , showing agreement on size and density related discharge properties . \n a typical nc memory element cross section is shown in fig . \n [ moscapandtem ] . based on the assumption that only ncs are responsible for charge storage , the flat - band voltage shift @xmath0 is approximately given by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total stored charge in the ncs \n , @xmath3 is the control oxide thickness , @xmath4 is the average diameter of the ncs , @xmath5 s are the dielectric constants of respective materials . \n an important parameter of the nc - mos device is the maximum flat - band voltage shift @xmath6 . \n this is the flat - band voltage shift when all available ncs of density @xmath7 carry an electron i.e. @xmath8 . \n it is seen that @xmath9 depends on device geometry through eq . \n [ hysteresisvoltage ] and also on nc density . due to large coulomb charging energy , average number of electrons per nc can be assumed to be smaller than one .    in order to evaluate retention properties of nc - mos memory elements \n , discharging currents must be calculated . \n since there are many device parameters that collectively determine the charge - discharge currents , a simple closed form formula can not be obtained that covers all cases . therefore retention and erase currents are addressed separately .    during retention , \n the device is in depletion and @xmath10 . \n if nc bound states are responsible for storage of carriers , discharge occurs by tunnelling from the nc ground state to the substrate , either by direct or trap assisted tunnelling . for the calculation of the discharge current \n , the barrier height of tunnelling carriers must be calculated . \n the barrier height is a function of the nc ground state energy given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bulk barrier height and @xmath13 is the energy of electron stored in the nc . \n the energy levels of uncapped germanium ncs have recently been measured directly as a function of size , using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy . \n the conduction band minimum of ge ncs as a function of size is given by @xcite @xmath14 where the energies are in ev , @xmath15 is the nc diameter in nm . \n if we assume a gaussian size distribution for the ncs , the density of states , @xmath16 , can then be calculated through eq . \n [ genccbm ] for electrons as plotted in fig . \n [ dosnc ] .    assuming thermal equilibrium within the nc layer \n , the quasi - fermi level can be calculated implicitly ( inset of fig . \n [ dosnc ] ) for a given total stored charge . \n escape of carriers near or above the quasi - fermi level dominates the discharge current . as a result of reduced barrier height at the quasi - fermi level for a large number of carriers per nc , discharge current increases with the number of stored carriers ( or the flat - band voltage shift ) . \n this reduction in barrier height , along with the increase in the tunnel oxide field , results in the super - exponential charge decay commonly observed in nc - mos memory elements . \n the current density describing the discharge of the ncs can be calculated assuming direct tunnelling . for carriers stored in ncs with density @xmath17 all at an energy @xmath18 \n , the discharge current density @xmath19 can be given as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the semi - classical escape attempt rate for ncs of diameter @xmath15 @xcite . \n here @xmath22 is the barrier transparency , for electrons with energy e and tunnel oxide field @xmath23 \n . the actual discharge current must be obtained by integration of eq . \n [ dischargecurrentdensity ] multiplied by the density of states ( dos ) . \n the resulting current will be dominated by tunnelling of carriers near the quasi - fermi level . \n the transmission probability @xmath22 can be calculated through the wkb approximation as @xcite @xmath24.\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the electron tunnelling mass . \n the tunnel oxide field @xmath23 is determined by the amount of stored carriers as well as by the band - bending . \n if band - bending and gate - substrate work function difference is ignored , the tunnel oxide field is approximately proportional to the flat - band shift ( or the total stored charge ) . \n tunnel oxide field is then given roughly by @xmath27 . \n exact value of @xmath23 depends on device geometry and properties as well as band - bending .    during the erase cycle \n , @xmath28 is negative and the device is in inversion . \n the discharge current is determined by eqs . \n [ dischargecurrentdensity ] and [ transmissioncoefficient ] . \n however , the oxide field is determined by the applied gate voltage and flat - band voltage shift and is given approximately by @xmath29 . \n a more accurate description of @xmath23 as a function of gate bias can be obtained in a numerical calculation by taking into account the band - bending of the substrate . using the discharge currents given in eq . \n [ dischargecurrentdensity ] and a standard band - bending model @xcite , the charge and discharge currents can been calculated numerically . \n the oxide - germanosilicate - oxide trilayer films were grown in a pecvd reactor ( model plasmalab 8510c ) on si substrates using 180 sccm sih@xmath30 ( 2% in n@xmath31 ) , 225 sccm no@xmath31 and varying flow rates of geh@xmath30 ( 2% in he ) as precursor gases , at a sample temperature of 350 @xmath32c , a process pressure of 1000 mtorr under and an applied rf power of 10 w. the samples were then annealed in n@xmath31 atmosphere in an alumina oven at temperatures ranging from 650 @xmath33c to 950 @xmath33c for 5 minutes . \n the samples were loaded and unloaded with ramp times of 1 minute . for fabrication of the devices , first a thermal tunnel oxide of thickness 4 nm was grown using dry oxidation on n - type silicon substrates with resistivity of 1 - 10 @xmath34 cm , followed by pecvd growth of germanosilicate layer of 10 nm thickness and composition of @xmath35 . on top , a @xmath36 nm control oxide was deposited . \n after annealing , backside ohmic metallization and gate metallization was done by metal evaporation . \n transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) was used to characterize the formation of ncs as a function of annealing temperature . \n high density nc formation is observed for layers with a composition of @xmath35 as determined by xps analysis . \n the nc diameter increases nonlinearly from 2.5 nm to 7.4 nm as the annealing temperature is increased from 650 @xmath32c to 850 @xmath32c as tabulated in table [ nctable ] for four devices . \n the average energy , energy distribution width and maximum flat - band voltage shift calculated using eq.[genccbm ] and eq.[hysteresisvoltage ] are given in table [ ncenergytable ] for the same devices in table [ nctable ] . \n .average nanocrystal size and width of size distribution for different annealing temperatures as observed by tem . \n + [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     capacitance measurements were performed using a capacitance meter ( hp 4278a ) with 1 mhz ac excitation of 25 mv amplitude . \n the flat - band voltage shift can be tracked quasi - real - time for small changes in the flat - band shift by using a digital feedback loop that eliminates the need of tracing the whole c - v curve to estimate the value of the flat - band voltage shift . during write \n / erase pulses , the loop can be momentarily turned off . \n this method allows rapid monitoring of the changes in the flat - band voltage shift ( within few tens of msec ) after a write or erase pulse or during retention . \n dynamic c - v measurements have been performed on nc - mos capacitors , by measuring the c - v as a function of time near the flat - band voltage between applied pulses of varying voltage and durations . \n the discharge currents have been measured through time decay of flat - band voltage shift for three devices as shown in fig . \n [ dischargedensities ] . \n the measured @xmath0 is used to calculate the stored charge using eq . \n [ hysteresisvoltage ] and divided by the time duration between measurements to calculate the current . \n the discharge current is seen to increase with increasing flat - band voltage shift ( or stored charge ) . \n curves for different nanocrystal sizes show a cross - over behavior . \n this feature is a strong evidence for size related discharge of the nc - mos elements . \n smaller ncs decay faster due to higher quantization energy and reduced tunnel barrier at low charging ratios of @xmath37 . \n however , if the flat - band voltage shift is close to @xmath9 or @xmath38 , the quasi - fermi level increases rapidly as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ dosnc ] . \n as @xmath9 is proportional to nc density @xmath39 , smaller ncs have higher density and @xmath9 . at a given @xmath0 , stored charge per nc \n is larger for lower density ( large diameter ) ncs . \n therefore , they may have a larger quasi - fermi energy for large ncs than smaller ncs at a given @xmath0 . since carriers near the quasi - fermi level dominate the discharge , the discharge current increases rapidly when @xmath40 as is clearly seen in the data for the device with 7.4 nm diameter ncs , for which @xmath41 v. this is in accordance with the numerical solution shown in solid curves of fig.[dischargedensities ] . \n the cross - over behavior shows that nc size and density as well as total stored charge play an important role in determination of the charge decay rate . \n nanocrystal discharge currents have been measured as a function of erase pulse voltage . \n after nc - mos devices with nc diameters of 2.5 nm and 2.8 nm have been charged by 5 v write pulses to a flat - band voltage shift of 1.6 v , erase pulses of duration @xmath42 sec have been applied and flat - band voltage shift has been recorded . \n the discharge currents are shown in fig . \n [ discharge ] . \n the increased currents for smaller ncs quantitatively confirm the prediction of numerical calculation . \n the data of fig . \n [ discharge ] suggest that the discharge is indeed dominated by direct tunnelling . \n the decay of the charge stored in the ncs has also been recorded for the nc - mos capacitors with different nc diameters as a function of time . \n the decay of the flat - band voltage shift is fitted using numerically calculated discharge currents as seen in fig . \n [ retexample ] . as can be seen \n , the model predicts the decay of charge for both short and longer time scales . \n it is seen in the time domain also that smaller ncs decay faster than larger ncs . \n in conclusion , we have proposed a charge storage and retention model for nanocrystal mos memory devices and compared it with experimental results . \n the model envisions storage of carriers in quantized energy levels of ncs . \n the escape of carriers is modelled by direct tunnelling out of the ncs to the substrate . \n the model can be used to predict the effect of various design parameters such as nc size and density on retention time . \n the model also correctly predicts the super - exponential charge decay commonly observed in nc memory devices . for nc - mos capacitors containing ge ncs fabricated by the pecvd technique , nc size related quantum confinement \n is found to play a role in the retention of charges . \n this is an alternative model to surface trap related carrier storage . \n the model agrees well with the experimental results , and gives useful insight to nc - mos memory device design . \n this work is partially supported by the eu fp6 project seminano under the contract nmp4 ct2004 505285 and by tubitak under contract no 103t115 . \n thanks are due to m. willander of gteburg university for supplying the oxidized silicon wafers . \n s. tiwari , f. rana , h. hanafi , a. hartstein , e. f. crabbe , and k. chan , appl . \n . lett . * 68 * , 1377 ( 1996 ) . \n x. x. wang , j. g. zhang , l. ding , b. w. cheng , w. k. ge , j. z. yu and q. m. wang , phys . \n b * 72 * , 195313 ( 2005 )    s. okamoto and y. kanemitsu , phys . rev . * b * 54 , 16421 -

only volumes . \n for example , if a volume is read - only , then the client only has to contact the afs server once to cache the volume . \n we tested afs performance using two clones and two replicated volumes on two separate machines . \n the afs server machine ( basilisk.phys.uvic.ca ) held the master and a cloned volume , with the objectivity server machine ( objy.phys.uvic.ca ) holding a replicated and a cloned volume . \n this configuration appeared to be sufficient for the size of the testbed so that no bottlenecks occurred as a result of the afs servers . \n initial tests of the atlas software using a local machine and a machine 1200 km distant showed that using a cloned volume increased the access to the software at the remote machine . \n real execution time at the remote machine dropped by about 40% whereas ( as expected ) no change was observed at the local machine . running simultaneous multiple jobs over the grid \n did not degrade the afs performance . we concluded that having cloned volumes significantly increased the afs performance . \n we plan to continue to monitor the afs performance as we continue to scale up the size of the gc testbed . \n jobs were submitted from victoria using simple scripts . \n no resource broker or portal was used however , we are examining the available tools ( such as gridport @xcite ) and plan to incorporate them into the testbed . \n monitoring of the gc testbed was done using the cacti package @xcite providing network traffic and cpu utilization . \n detailed descriptions of the victoria testbed can be found at http://grid.phys.uvic.ca . \n hep simulation applications begin by the generation of events which are collections of 4-vectors representing the trajectories of particles from an initial collision of two incident particles . \n the 4-vectors are then passed through a program that simulates the response of the experimental detector . \n the output is in a format that is usually identical to the format used to store the real collision data , but includes additional simulation information . \n after the detector simulation , the data is passed through an application that reconstructs the data into physical quantities such as tracks in the tracking chambers and energy in the calorimeters . \n it is now common practice to inject background events ( either real or simulated ) on top of the simulated physics events . \n we chose to examine the performance of the gc testbed using the simulations of the babar and atlas experiments . \n the main difference between the atlas and babar simulation applications is the manner in which they store their data . \n atlas uses conventional files in a zebra format developed at cern while babar uses the commercial objectivity database . in the following subsections \n we describe the results of running the babar and atlas simulations on the gc testbed . \n it is worth pointing out that neither the babar or the atlas simulation are optimized for operation over a wide - area grid .      the babar collaboration studies electron - positron collisions at the slac facility . \n in addition to collecting data from the experiment , the collaboration generates a significant amount of monte carlo simulated data in order to model the response of the detector and to help assess efficiencies and systematic errors in the physics studies . \n the simulation application is run in 3 phases for event generation , detector simulation and reconstruction . \n data is written to objectivity by the event generation application . \n the detector simulation reads the output of the event generation and writes output that is then used by the reconstruction . \n the reconstruction application writes out data that can be used for physics studies . \n the babar application accesses the database multiple times per event . \n the handshaking required between the database and application combined with the large latency resulted in relatively poor utilization of the remote processors . for example , we observed that cpu utilization was approximately 10% at sites 3000 km away from the objectivity server . \n a series of 1 day tests were run involving many of the gc testbed sites . \n a total of approximately 50,000 events were generated per test . \n the babar software was accessed from the afs server . \n the network traffic to the objectivity and afs servers is shown in figure  [ f1 ] . \n approximately 0.5 mb / s of data was constantly read and written to the database . \n afs traffic was generally only a few kb / s with a peak during the start of the application . \n our initial tests showed that one of the areas that had to be addressed was the issuing and releasing of database locks . \n for example , a remote application locks the entire federation during a creation of a container . \n if a remote machine lost network connectivity while a global database lock was present then this resulted in the entire testbed being halted as none of the sites would be able to write to the database . as a result we developed a series of monitoring and cleanup utilities that would eliminate any problems associated with the database locks . \n we consider the test a success in that we could run the babar application on non - hep resources . \n it is clear that the efficiency at the remote sites was low and we believe a number of modifications to the babar application could improve the throughput . however , given the plan by babar and the lhc experiments to move away from the objectivity database , it was decided not to pursue this application further . \n the atlas collaboration will study high energy proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider at the cern laboratory . \n atlas is expected to produce large volumes of data starting in 2007 . \n the atlas data challenge ( dc ) is a project to test and develop the ability to exploit remote computing resources for monte carlo simulation . for our tests \n , we used the application that generates background ( called pile - up ) events . input and \n output data are standard files in a zebra format . \n future atlas dc will use the root data format@xcite ; such a change will make no difference to the way in which the current test was performed . \n we tested three modes of operation on the testbed :    1 . \n both input data and output data transferred using afs 2 . \n input data transferred using gridftp and output data transferred using afs 3 . \n both input and output data transferred using gridftp    all software and log files use afs . \n it has been recognized that afs was not an ideal protocol for transfering large data files , however , we felt it was important to quantify the differences . \n we found afs to extremely slow for reading input data and resulted in cpu utilizations being less than 5% . \n afs caches its output ; as a result we tested a mode where the input was sent via gridftp to the remote site and let afs control the output . \n the results of this mode of operation were more encouraging , however the performance of afs is comparable to single stream ftp and using gridftp is a much more effective solution . \n the mode of operation we chose was one where the input files were tarred and compressed , and sent via gridftp to the remote site . at the remote site , the files would be untarred and uncompressed , and the job executed . at the end of the job , the output files would be tarred and compressed , and then transferred via gridftp back to the victoria disk server . \n this was found to be a successful mode of operation . \n access to software via afs proved to be reliable and efficient . \n we chose an application that would run extremely quickly on the processing nodes ( 30 minutes on a 2 ghz cpu ) . \n compression , transfer and uncompression was approximately 20 minutes for a 2 gb file . \n although the overall utilization of a remote cpu could be considered to be low if one includes the compression and transfer times , a more realistic application , such as simulation or reconstruction , would take hours rather than minutes to process data files of the same size . \n in this situation , we believe the cpu utilization would significantly improve . \n we have demonstrated that hep applications can be run on generic computing resources with relatively high efficiency . with ( modest ) design changes in the applications we expect that further gains in efficiency would be possible . \n further tests are planned using a sites with significantly larger resources with the aim of establishing a production level grid resource in canada .", "StartTimeOffset": 787663218630, "RequestID": "59ff8653ccedb2fb2cf823474ef4ca3fa02c08c0", "TotalTokens": 2580}
{"ContextTokens": 4008, "GeneratedTokens": 250, "SynthesizedBody": "there is increasing evidence that quasars and gravitationally lensed quasars sometimes have very red optical - infrared colors . reddening by intervening dust offers an explanation for this phenomenon ( webster et al . \n 1995 , lawrence et al . \n 1995 , larkin et al . \n such large reddenings raise questions about possible incompleteness of optical quasar and lens surveys . \n this in turn can have important implications for cosmological models , since many constraints on cosmological parameters are derived from the luminosity functions of quasars and from the numbers and seperations of lensed quasars ( turner , ostriker & gott 84 , fukugita and peebles 1993 , fukugita & turner 1991 , malhotra & turner 1995 , kochanek 1993 , maoz & rix 1993 ) . \n the reddening of gravitationally lensed quasars is also a potential probe of the ism of the lensing galaxies at high redshift . \n one would expect the radio selected gravitational lenses to be free of bias against reddened lenses . also small seperation lenses , where the optical paths are likely to pass near the center of a single lensing galaxy , are more likely to show substantial amount of reddening . \n the radio source 1938 + 66.6 is one of the small seperation gravitational lenses discovered in the vla / merlin survey of flat spectrum radio sources ( patnaik et al 1992 ) . \n it has four compact sources and an arc ; the maximum seperation between the any of the components is @xmath15 . \n patnaik et al report a r=23 object at the location of the lens . \n we observed this source in the near infrared @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) bands , and in the optical thuan - gunn @xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath19 ) bands . \n an object was detected at the position of the lens in all bands except @xmath11 . \n this optical - infrared object will hereafter be referred to as `` 1938 + 666(oir ) '' ; we will argue that it is a counterpart of the radio system . \n the observations and data analysis are described in section 2 . in section 3 \n we estimate the probability of the infrared source being a cool star or a high redshift galaxy on the basis of color . \n discussion and posssible interpretation of the results are presented in section 4 . \n we observed 1938 + 666 in @xmath2 band on 2 july 1995 ( ut ) , in @xmath4 and @xmath0 bands on 6 august 1995 ( ut ) , and in thuan - gunn @xmath11 and @xmath6 bands on 4 and 24 july and 5 august 1995 ( ut ) . \n there was intermittent scattered cloud cover early on the night of 2 july , but the sky cleared shortly before the 1938 + 666 @xmath2 band observations . \n all data were taken with the apache point observatory 3.5 meter telescope . \n the near - ir observations used the grim ii camera , while the @xmath11 and @xmath6 band observations used the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) in imaging mode . \n seeing was about @xmath20@xmath21 fwhm in all bands . \n some parameters of the observations are summarized in table  1 . \n all data reduction was done using the iraf package and followed standard procedures . \n for the near - ir data , individual short exposures were sky subtracted , typically using the 24 sky frames nearest in time . \n a sky flat was made by taking the median of all disregistered exposures in a band , subtracting a mean bias frame , and normalizing the result by its median pixel value . \n the sky subtracted image frames were then divided by this flat . \n finally , the images were registered ( using the centroid of a bright star to determine fractional pixel shifts ) and a combined image was produced by taking the median of all processed single frames at each pixel . for \n the @xmath11 and @xmath6 bands processing was similar but no sky subtraction step was needed . \n final images are shown in figure  1 . \n on the nights 2 july , 4 july , and 6 august we also observed photometric standards to calibrate our fluxes . for the @xmath2 band \n , we used the ukirt faint standard fs 28 ; for @xmath4 and @xmath0 bands we used fs 7 ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) . for the @xmath11 and @xmath6 bands \n , we used the fields mark a ( jorgensen 1994 , landolt 1992 ) and f1038 - 6 ( jorgensen 1994 , stobie et al 1985 ) . \n we determined the position of the radio source using three hst guide stars that fell within the r band image ( epoch 2000.0 coordinates 19 38 14.23 + 66 50 23.99 , 19 38 45.36 66 48 40.38 , and 19 38 01.38 + 66 51 14.11 ) . \n we first used the guide stars to determine the position and orientation of the coordinate grid , and then determined the position of the quasar relative to each guide star . \n the scatter in the resulting position estimates was @xmath22 in ra and @xmath23 in declination . \n in the @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , & @xmath0 bands , the counterpart to 1938 + 666 is apparent , and we have done conventional aperture photometry to measure its fluxes . in the @xmath11 and @xmath6 bands \n we have applied additional tests to see if an object is detected and to place upper limits on the counterpart flux . \n our results are reported in table  1 . \n we measured aperture magnitudes with radii @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of the psf ( point spread function ) and the coefficient @xmath26 maximizes the signal to noise for aperture photometry of a faint source with a gaussian psf . to see \n if the resulting @xmath11 and @xmath6 fluxes are significantly above background , we measure fluxes in randomly placed apertures and determine how frequently the flux exceeds that seen for 1938 + 666 . \n the result is not very sensitive to aperture size for @xmath27 . in @xmath11 band , \n @xmath28 of randomly placed @xmath29 apertures had fluxes exceeding that for 1938 + 666 , and we conclude there is no evidence of a @xmath11 band counterpart to the radio source . in @xmath6 band , \n @xmath30 of randomly placed @xmath29 apertures had fluxes exceeding that for 1938 + 666 . \n visual inspection of the final @xmath6 band image shows a source at the location of the nir source , and we believe that the weak result of the random aperture test is due to bleeding columns from saturated bright stars and to the substantial density of 23rd magnitude objects on the sky .    by modelling the counts in an aperture of area @xmath31 pixels as the object flux plus sky noise , we may place an upper limit on the total flux for a point source ( modelled as a gaussian psf ) at the h band source location . at confidence levels of @xmath32 and @xmath33 \n we find @xmath34 and @xmath35 . \n applying the same formalism to the weakly detected @xmath6 band source gives @xmath36 and @xmath37 . \n a source substantially larger than the psf could be brighter than the total magnitude limits quoted above . \n additionally , the spectral slope of the putative candidate will influence the @xmath6 band limit , since our standard star observations suggested a substantial color term ( @xmath38 ) in the transformation from instrumental to standard @xmath6 magnitude . \n no important color term was apparent in @xmath11 band . \n we were not able to observe enough nir standards to allow secure color term corrections in @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 bands . \n to test the interpretation of 1938 + 666(oir ) as the counterpart of the radio source 1938 + 666 , we compared its measured colors to those of galactic stars , normal galaxies , quasars , and lensed systems . \n we first account for galactic foreground dust . \n reddening towards 1938 + 666 can be estimated at @xmath39 , based on the reddening map of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) . the normal galactic extinction law ( with @xmath40 ) yields @xmath41 ( cf . \n mathis 1990 ) . \n thus , galactic dust does not contribute strongly to the extremely red color of 1938 + 666(oir ) . \n our data indicate @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .    for comparison , \n data in bessell ( 1991 ) plus the color transformations of jorgensen ( 1994 ) give @xmath46 for the m6.5 dwarf lhs 3003 , and @xmath47 for an m7.5 dwarf . \n thus , only the very coolest stars have colors as red as 1938 + 666 . \n two further tests may be applied to the hypothesis that the object is a very cool star . \n first , we can see if 1938 + 666(oir ) is appreciably broader than a point source . in the present @xmath2 band data , \n the fwhm of 1938 + 666(oir ) is @xmath48 , while a representative stellar fwhm is @xmath49 . \n this would be consistent with a source of size @xmath50 , but better seeing and a larger signal to noise ratio are required before this test can be considered conclusive . \n second , we can use wainscoat et al s ( 1992 ) model of the near - ir sky to calculate the number density of `` m late v '' dwarfs with @xmath51 towards 1938 + 666 ; the resulting density is 0.25/arcmin@xmath52 , giving a probability @xmath53 of finding a suitably red m dwarf within 3 arcseconds of the radio source . \n we can also compare the observed color limit to the colors of normal galaxies . \n the reddest local elliptical galaxies have @xmath54 colors around @xmath55 ( persson , frogel , & aaronson 1979 ) , while moderate redshift ellipticals ( @xmath56 up to @xmath57 ) show @xmath58 ( persson 1988 ) . by redshift @xmath59 , \n elliptical galaxies can have @xmath60 up to @xmath61 ( dickinson 1995 ) , and the central component of the @xmath62 radio galaxy 0156@xmath63252 has @xmath64 ( mccarthy , persson , & west 1992 ) , so the color of 1938 + 666(oir ) is consistent with a lensing galaxy or a lensed radio galaxy at @xmath65 . \n spiral galaxy @xmath66 colors are not widely published , but an examination of de jong s work suggests that @xmath67 is typical while occasional exceptions ( e.g. ugc 4256 ) might be a magnitude redder . \n ( de jong , 1995 ) .    taken together , \n the close positional coincidence and unusually red color are strong circumstantial evidence that 1938 + 666(oir ) is indeed the gravitational lens system observed in the radio by patnaik et al . \n this interpretation might be confirmed by obtaining an image in sub - arcsecond seeing and comparing the near - ir and radio morphologies ; or ( preferably ) by obtaining a spectrum , and measuring a redshift if the object is indeed a quasar . \n either of these tests might determine if the observed infrared source is the lensed object or a high redshift lensing galaxy . \n the optical - ir colors of many lensed quasars are found to be as red or redder than observed for 1938 + 666(oir ) ( lawrence et al . \n 1994 , larkin et al . \n 1994 , annis & luppino 1993 , annis 1992 ) . \n the most extreme red colors are seen for mg 0414 + 0534 : @xmath68 , and for mg1131 + 0456 : @xmath69 . to compare the reddening directly one needs the redshift of the lens and the dust responsible for the reddening . \n optical - ir colors of radio selected quasars can also be quite red . \n webster et al . \n 1995 report @xmath70 for the confirmed quasars among the flat - spectrum radio sources observed with the parkes telescope , and up to @xmath71 for the sources for whom the redshift is not known . the red color of 1938 + 666(oir ) \n support its identification as a counterpart to the gravitationally lensed radio ring . \n we have detected an infrared object at the location of the radio - detected gravitational lens 1938 + 666 , with very red colors ( @xmath72 ) . \n the most natural explanation for these observations is that the we are seeing the lensed object or a lensing galaxy at large redshift ( @xmath73 ) . \n the close positional coincidence observed is quite unlikely to happen for random field stars or galaxies , with the exception of the lensing galaxy . \n moreover , empirical measurements show that @xmath74 colors of most stars and low to moderate redshift field galaxies are bluer than our observed limit . on the other hand , \n a moderate fraction of flat - spectrum radio sources and gravitationally lensed quasars are similarly red . \n our interpretation could be tested by imaging 1938 + 666 with higher spatial resolution , or taking a spectrum of this object . \n annis , j. 1992 ,  391 , 17 annis , j. & luppino , g. a. 1993 ,  407 , 69 bessell , m. s. 1991 ,  101 , 662 burstein , d. , & heiles , c. 1982 ,  87 , 1165 casali , m. & hawarden , t. 1992 , jcmt - ukirt newsletter 4 , 33 de jong , r. s. 1995 , thesis dickinson , m. 1995 , in `` fresh views on elliptical galaxies '' fukugita , m. , & peebles , p. j. e. 1993 , institute for advanced study preprint number iassns - ast 93/24 fukugita , m. , & turner , e. l. 1991 ,  253 , 99 . \n jorgensen , i. 1994 ,  106 , 967 kochanek , c. s. 1993 ,  419 , 12 landolt 1992 ,  104 , 340 larkin , j. e. ;

{"ContextTokens": 1688, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "the precise measurement of final state hadrons in lepton nucleon deep inelastic scattering constitutes an excellent benchmark for different features of perturbative quantum chromodynamics . among them , the calculation of higher order corrections , which have been explored and validated for most processes up to next to leading order ( nlo ) accuracy . for the one particle inclusive processes \n only very recently there has been progress beyond the leading order ( lo ) @xcite . \n and up to now there were no analytic computation of the @xmath2 corrections for the electroproduction of hadrons with non vanishing transverse momentum . \n the analytic computation of the @xmath2 corrections allows us to check factorization in a direct way , which means that collinear singularities showing up in the partonic cross section factorize into parton densities ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) . as a consequence of this explicit cancellation , \n the resulting cross section is finite and can be straightforwardly convoluted with pdfs and ffs in a fast and stable numerical codes . \n the analytical result is still sufficiently exclusive and keeps the dependence on the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the produced hadron , allowing a detailed comparison with the experimental data . in the following \n we summarize the results obtained in ref . \n we consider the process @xmath3 where a lepton of momentum @xmath4 scatters off a nucleon of momentum @xmath5 with a lepton of momentum @xmath6 and a hadron @xmath7 of momentum @xmath8 tagged in the final state . omitting target fragmentation at zero transverse momentum , which has been discussed at length in @xcite , \n the cross section for this process can be written as @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the partonic level cross section corresponding to the process and is calculated order by order in perturbation theory through the related parton - photon squared matrix elements @xmath11 for the @xmath12 processes @xmath13 in terms of the standard kinematical variables @xcite .    at order-@xmath0 , \n the partonic cross sections receive contributions from the following reactions : @xmath14 where any of the outgoing partons can fragment into the final state hadron @xmath7 .    at variance with the @xmath15 case , where the integration over final states leads to overlapping singularities along various curves in the residual phase space , here \n the only remaining singularities are found at @xmath16 and thus they can be dealt with the standard method . after combining real and virtual contributions to a given partonic process , the cross section can be written as @xmath17 where the coefficient of the single poles , @xmath18 , as well as the finite contributions @xmath19 , include ` delta ' and ` plus ' distributions in @xmath20 . \n the ir double poles present in the individual real and virtual contributions cancel out in the sum , providing the first straightforward check on the angular integration of real amplitudes and the loop integrals in the virtual case . in the real terms \n , the above mentioned double poles come from the product of a pole arising in the integration over the spectators phase space and a single pole coming from the expansion of @xmath21 factors . \n double poles in the virtual contributions always arise from loop integrals . \n the remaining singularities , contributing to the single pole , are of uv and collinear origin . \n the former are removed by means of coupling constant renormalization , whereas the latter have to be factorized in the redefinition of parton densities and fragmentation functions . \n in figure [ fig : x_bj ] we show the lo and nlo predictions for the electroproduction of neutral pions as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , in the kinematical range of the h1 experiment @xcite , together with the most recent data for the range @xmath24 . \n the cross sections are computed as described in the previous sections , applying h1 cuts and using mrst02 parton densities @xcite . \n similar results are found using other sets of modern pdfs . for the input fragmentation functions , we use two different sets , the ones from reference @xcite denoted as kkp and those from @xcite referenced as k. we set the renormalization and factorization scales as the average between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and we compute @xmath27 at nlo(lo ) fixing @xmath28 as in the mrst analysis . \n the plots clearly show that the nlo cross sections are much larger than the lo ones , even by the required order of magnitude in certain kinematical regions . \n another interesting feature is that the uncertainty due to the choice of a fragmentation functions set is also quite noticeable , this fact driven by the different gluon content of the two sets considered here . \n low @xmath25 bins seem to prefer kkp set , which have a larger gluon - fragmentation content , whereas for larger @xmath25 both sets agree with the data within errors . \n lo estimates show a much smaller sensitivity on the choice of fragmentation functions , since gluon fragmentation does not contribute significantly to the cross section at this order . \n the rather large size of the k - factor can , then , be understood as a consequence of the opening of a new dominant ( ` leading - order ' ) channel , and not to the ` genuine ' increase in the partonic cross section that might otherwise threaten perturbative stability . \n the dominance of the new channel is due to the size of the gluon distribution at small @xmath22 and to the fact that the h1 selection cuts highlight the kinematical region dominated by the @xmath29 partonic process .      in figure \n [ fig : discri ] we show the different contributions to the cross section discriminated by the underlying partonic process . \n notice that at very small @xmath22 the @xmath30 term can be by itself several times larger than the lo contribution , remaining larger or comparable even for higher @xmath22 values . \n the forward selection is also responsible of the scale sensitivity of the cross section , as it supresses large components with small scale dependence whereas it stresses components as @xmath30 whose scale dependence would be partly canceled only at nnlo        a. daleo , c. garca canal , r. sassot , _ nucl . \n phys.b _ * 662 * 334 ( 2003 ) . \n a. daleo , r. sassot , _ nucl . \n phys.b _ * 673 * 357 ( 2003 ) . \n p.  aurenche , r.  basu , m.  fontannaz and r.  m.  godbole , _ eur . \n j. c _ * 34 * 277 ( 2004 ) . \n m.  fontannaz , arxiv : hep -

garca regular black hole spacetime @xcite , @xcite , @xcite into the rotational one by using the newman - janis algorithm @xcite , @xcite and study some of its basic properties . \n in this section we describe the newman - janis algorithm which is used for converting the spherically symmetric static black hole spacetime metric into rotational one . \n the ayn - beato - garca spacetime metric of the regular spherically symmetric black hole is given as @xcite @xmath13 where the lapse function @xmath14 reads @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath0 are the total mass and electric charge of the black hole , respectively . \n the spacetime metric ( [ 0 ] ) is the solution of the field equations within general relativity , where the nonlinear electrodynamic field satisfying the weak energy condition is considered as a source . \n as can be seen from the lapse function ( [ 01 ] ) the spacetime metric ( [ 0 ] ) has only the coordinate singularity . \n this is why in order to remove this singularity one has to write the spacetime metric ( [ 0 ] ) in the advanced eddington - finkelstein coordinates . to do this \n we make following transformation for incoming photon ( or ray ) : @xmath17 and for outgoing photon ( or ray ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 hereafter , we consider only the outgoing photon ( [ 03 ] ) case . \n then the spacetime metric ( [ 0 ] ) in the advanced eddington -

lindquist coordinates as as @xmath45d\\phi^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is given by equation ( [ 8 ] ) . \n if we consider the black hole as non - charged one ( @xmath47 ) , the lapse function ( [ 01 ] ) takes the same form of one of the schwarzschild spacetime metric as well as new spacetime metric ( [ 13 ] ) converts into the kerr one , namely @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    in order to investigate properties of the spacetime metric ( [ 13 ] ) we here study the behavior of the @xmath2 and @xmath51 components of the spacetime metric ( [ 13 ] ) . \n now we will analyze the static limit and event horizon defined by the conditions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . \n obtained new spacetime metric ( [ 13 ] ) is also regular everywhere . from the fig . \n [ plot2 ] and fig . \n [ plot3 ] one can easily see that for some set of values of the rotation parameter @xmath1 and electric charge @xmath0 the solution ( [ 13 ] ) has coordinate singularity ( event horizon ) .    the radial dependence of the function @xmath46 presented in fig . \n [ plot2 ] and fig . \n [ plot3 ] show that with increase of the value of the rotation parameter @xmath1 and charge @xmath0 possibility of existence of the horizon decreases . in the equatorial plane ( @xmath54 ) the dependence of the function @xmath46 on the rotation parameter @xmath1 vanishes and \n the existence of the horizon depends only on the value of the charge @xmath0 . \n there is critical value of the charge @xmath0 for which two surface described by the solutions of the condition @xmath52 merge into one . in order to find the critical value of @xmath0 the lapse function @xmath55 must satisfy the couple of conditions : @xmath56 since the lapse function @xmath51 is the function of four quantities @xmath57 and \n @xmath0 , solving the equations ( [ 001 ] ) with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath0 one can get the solution as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 . in fig . \n [ fig_ahmadjon ] dependence of the critical value of the electric charge @xmath0 and radius of the static limit surface @xmath5 which is corresponding to critical state on the rotation parameter @xmath1 have been shown for several values of @xmath6 . \n the shaded region in the @xmath58 plot corresponds to the regular black hole with the static limit . \n the unshaded region in the @xmath58 plot corresponds to the regular black hole without static limit . \n the @xmath59 plot represents the dependence of the radius of the static limit on the rotation parameter which corresponds to the border of shaded - unshaded regions . in order to find the same critical value of the charge one may use the conditions @xmath60 in fig .  [ fig_ahmadjon2 ] dependence of the critical value of the electric charge @xmath0 and radius of the static limit surface @xmath5 which is corresponding to the critical state on the rotation parameter @xmath1 \n have been shown for several values of @xmath6 . \n the shaded region in the @xmath58 plot corresponds to the regular black hole with two ( outer and inner ) event horizons . \n the unshaded region in the @xmath58 plot corresponds to the regular black hole without event horizon . \n the @xmath59 plot represents the dependence of the radius of the static limit on the rotation parameter which corresponds to the border of shaded - unshaded regions . \n the regular black hole with the rotation parameter @xmath61 can have the horizon in the poles of the black hole ( @xmath62 ) even in the case when the value of the charge @xmath0 is very small . \n one may conclude that in the presence of the rotation parameter the small value of electric charge may cause the elimination of the singularity . \n the critical values of the electric charge @xmath63 are different for the static limit and the event horizon . \n the critical value of the electric charge for event horizon is more rapidly decreasing with the increase of the rotation parameter @xmath1 with compare to that for the static limit . \n this means that the event horizon disappears earlier with the increase of the electric charge for the fixed value of the rotation parameter @xmath1 . \n one can see from fig . \n [ fig_ahmadjon ] and [ fig_ahmadjon2 ] that when the value of the electric charge @xmath64 the static black hole ( @xmath65 ) has horizon . \n if @xmath66 even extreme black hole can have the horizon in the equatorial plane ( @xmath54 ) . \n [ fig_ahmadjon3 ] provides the shape and size of the ergoregion in the @xmath67 plane where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . with the increase of the electric charge one can observe the increase of the relative shape and size of the ergosphere . \n note that for the values of electric charge with @xmath70 the event horizon and static limit both disappear .                   as the further step we study the question of satisfying the weak energy condition and choose the locally non rotating frame ( lnrf ) in order to get the stress - energy tensor in diagonal form , namely , @xmath71 . \n then the weak energy condition reads as @xcite @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . \n finally , we express the spacetime geometry in frame of the lnrf and study the behavior of the angular velocity of these frames . \n the orthonormal tetrad of the lnrf has the following form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the angular velocity of the lnrf frame .    in fig . \n [ fig_ahmadjon4 ] the 3d plot of the radial and angular dependence of density and pressures is shown for the given value of the rotation parameter @xmath76 and electric charge @xmath77 . \n one can easily see that the weak energy condition is violated near the nonsingular origin of rotating regular black hole . \n in this paper , we used a regular black hole solution with the source with the nature of nonlinear electrodynamics obtained by ayn - beato and garca  @xcite to generate rotating regular black hole solution which includes the ayn - beato - garca and kerr metrics as special cases . considered newman - janis algorithm uses static solution to generate rotating solutions without touching the field equation and very useful in order to get rotating black hole solutions . \n the relation between einstein vacuum solution and any non vacuum solution of general relativity opens new direction in studying the properties of the new solution with nonlinear electrodynamic source . \n obviously , when electric charge is vanishing , the solution reduces to the vacuum one . \n here we have obtained an exact rotating regular bh solution in the framework of general relativity . \n obtained solution gives opportunity to study the geometrical and causal structures , as well as test particles motion around rotating regular bh , which will be subject of the future projects . on the other hand \n , it could be also very interesting to compare the rotating ayon - beato - garcia regular spacetimes without horizons to the kerr naked singularity spacetimes , testing if the interesting and unusual physical phenomena occuring in the kerr naked singularity spacetimes  @xcite could arise in the regular rotating spacetimes too . \n the  authors acknowledge the  project supporting integration with the  international theoretical and observational research network in relativistic astrophysics of compact objects , cz.1.07/2.3.00/20.0071 , supported by operational programme _ education for competitiveness _ funded by structural funds of the  european union . \n one of the authors ( zs ) acknowledges the albert einstein center for gravitation and astrophysics supported by the  czech science foundation no . \n 14 -

called telescope , \n was developed by the aarhus university . \n the telescope utilizes the mimosa26 chips , a maps with fast binary readout @xcite . \n the mimosa26 utilizes a binary readout indicating the pixel signals exceeding the preset discrimination level . \n the pixel matrix is read continuously ( without triggering ) providing a complete frame every 115.2  @xmath0s . \n the data are gathered , triggered and stored by a custom daq system , based on the pxi crate , developed by the aarhus university in collaboration with strasbourg university . \n four telescope planes , each comprising one mimosa26 chip , were set upstream of the * dut * as shown in figure  [ fig : cern_set - up ] . \n the trigger system consists of three scintillators with compact photomultipliers . \n two solid 5@xmath15mm@xmath2 scintillators were placed upstream and downstream the telescope and one , with a 9  mm diameter circular hole , was placed just before the last telescope plane . \n the * dut * ( lumical detector prototype ) , was prepared using four detector planes always separated by two absorber layers as shown in figure  [ fig : dut_cern ] . \n the complex mechanical structure developed by cern allows to install the tungsten absorber or active sensor layer with a precision of a few tens of micrometers . \n a fully assembled detector plane is shown in figure  [ fig : pcb_old ] @xcite . \n the prototype system consists of a silicon sensor covered by kapton fanout and front - end electronics \n .    21  cm@xmath2.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    due to high energy depositions in the * lumical * calorimeter , standard 320  @xmath0 m thick silicon sensors were chosen as a compromise between the capacitance and the amount of generated charge . * \n lumical * sensors have been designed at the institute of nuclear physics pan in cracow @xcite and manufactured by hamamatsu photonics . \n the sensor is made from a n - type silicon , with p@xmath4pads with a thin aluminum metalization . \n the sensor tile , as the smallest sensor unit produced , includes 256 separate sensor pads . \n for this experiment 32 channels readout module was used .      during october 2015 \n , four detectors were installed on the tungsten layers and installed inside the same frame as we used during the 2014 test beam as shown in figure  [ fig : desy_dut ] . \n the whole system was installed in 5 gev electron beam at desy . \n the beam line was composed of scintillators for the trigger and six planes of silicon used as a telescope @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : desy_exp_set_up ] . \n a crucial point in the measurements was the synchronization between the data acquired with the detectors under investigation and that of the tracker . \n the latter was used to measure the local detection efficiency and evaluate the level of cross - talk between neighboring pads as function of the particle impact location . \n this was effectively achieved employing the rd51 scalable readout system ( srs ) . \n the data acquisition of both systems ( silicon tracker and lumical detector ) was triggered by the same scintillator signals and performed with a single srs front - end card ( fec ) @xcite . \n for each triggered event , the charge accumulated by all channels was stored . for each channel \n , the charge was sampled in 25 bins of 25 ns each . \n the mmdaq1 online data acquisition software was used to store the synchronized data on a pc for further analysis . using the online , it is possible to visualize events . on the figure  [ fig : adc_256 ] \n , we can see a typical event : the adc counts ( pedestal subtracted ) as a function of the channel number ( between 1 and 256 ) and the time ( between 0 and 500 ns ) . \n the aim of the test beam was to fully equipped four silicon sensors and installed these sensors in between two tungsten planes , namely within one mm . \n we modified the read out kapton foil including two 130 pin connectors ( figure  [ fig : ch_fanout ] ) so we will be able to read all the pads of a sensors . \n the high voltage was originally injected from on the 3.5 mm pcb but to cope with the one mm , we designed a thin high voltage kapton foil as shown in the figure  [ fig : hv_fanout ] .            in order to mechanically support the sensor and the two kapton foils , we designed an envelope , which should also fit within 1 mm . \n we used two different techniques to produce the envelope : 3d printing and carbon fiber . \n it appears that the 3d printed envelop is not rigid enough so we finally choose the carbon fiber option , which allows thickness of  200  @xmath0 m and a good rigidity . \n the whole detector ( see figure  [ fig : desy_sensor ] including the carbon fiber , the two kapton foils and the sensor ) thickness was measured in different positions around 900  @xmath0 m . \n an important effort has been realized on the gluing layers thickness and on the wire bonding loop size : some tools have been developed in order to be able to apply glue layers of 20 to 30  @xmath0 m . \n we developed an expertise to maintain the wire bonding loop size around 50  @xmath0 m .    in order to read all the pads of each sensor ( 128 channels ) we used the apv25 chip . \n one hybrid contains 128 channels , which each are ac coupled to one read - out strip of the detector . \n each channel contains a pre - amplifier , cr - rc shaper with adjustable shaping time and has a spark protection system implemented . \n the hybrid records the value of the shaped signal every 25 ns and stores it in an analog memory consisting of a 192 celled pipe - line . \n the signal is read out upon a trigger signal . \n the number of samples in one acquisition window is user defined , and the trigger time delay must hence be adjusted by the user to synchronize the trigger with the acquisition window . \n the apv hybrids are connected to the adapter boards using commercial hdmi cables . \n one cable can serve two apv hybrids ( a master and a slave card ) that can be connected through a 16-lead flat cable . \n the hybrid cards are connected to the detector ground through two low - ohmic low - profile rf coaxial connectors , which also serve to fix the hybrid card mechanically . \n the testbeam campaigns were done to investigate the performance of the calorimeter prototype . \n data were taken for different pads and also for regions covering pad boundaries . \n the impact point on the sensor is reconstructed from the telescope information . using a color code for the signals on the pads \n the structure of the sensor becomes nicely visible , as seen in figure  [ fig : impact_points ] .        during the test beam , \n the response of the readout chain to electromagnetic shower was studied . in order to analyze the electromagnetic shower development \n the energy deposited in each sensor plane from all configuration were obtained . \n the shower can be therefore sampled up to the 10@xmath5 layer with the target spatial sampling resolution of one radiation length , by combining the data obtained in all three configurations . \n the measurement results from october 2014 test beam were compared with prediction of geant4 monte carlo simulations where the experimental setup was implemented . \n a good agreement was found between them as shown in figure  [ fig : long_shower ] . \n data taken in tests beam were processed using various algorithms to investigate the response of large - area pad sensors assembled with a full readout chain . \n a first * lumical * multi - layer silicon - sensor prototype was tested at the ps cern facilities with a mixed - particle beam and at the desy ii synchrotron with a 5 gev electron beam . \n the mc simulation of the testbeam was performed with a fair level of detail and the experimental data are in good agreement with mc simulations . \n the obtained results indicate an excellent working performance of all components ( silicon sensors , front - end and readout electronics ) and fulfilled the requirements for * lumical * calorimeter . using new technology and expertise and each construction step , we succeeded to develop , produce and test detector less than 1 mm thick modules ( 900  @xmath0 m ) . \n the first results of a four layers fully equipped have started and results are promising . \n this work was partially supported by the romania uefiscdi agency under pn -

{"ContextTokens": 3869, "GeneratedTokens": 313, "SynthesizedBody": "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data have been crucial to define and confirm the currently favored cosmological model : a flat cosmological constant  dominated , cold dark matter model , @xmath1cdm . \n it is important to keep in mind that cmb observations predominantly probe the physics of the early universe ( @xmath4 ) . \n when these observations are interpreted in terms of the standard cosmological parameters , defined at @xmath5 , an extrapolation is needed , which is done within a given cosmological model . in our previous work @xcite \n , we argued that local , model - independent measurements of cosmologically - relevant quantities can be used to test the self - consistency of the currently favored cosmological model and to constrain deviations from it . \n direct measurements of the hubble constant and age of the universe are especially suited to this aim . \n in fact , these measurements have a long history and have now reached a level of precision and accuracy that make them competitive with other cosmological observations . \n if local and high - redshift measurements are to be combined to constrain cosmological parameters within a given model , the well established framework of bayesian parameter inference can be used . however , \n if the two sets of measurements are to be used to distinguish between models then bayesian model selection and bayesian evidence ( model - averaged likelihood ) should be used @xcite . \n bayesian methods in cosmology have been used for almost two decades now ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    ref . \n @xcite used pre-_planck _ state of the art data , so it is a natural extension to that work to consider the post-_planck _ \n @xcite state - of - the - art cosmological data . \n the _ planck _ \n team official analysis pointed out that local direct measurements of the hubble constant seem to be at odds with cmb data when interpreted within the context of the @xmath1cdm model . \n cmb data are however not at odds with other cosmological measurements ( e.g. , baryon acoustic oscillations ) . \n this conclusion arises from a parameter - estimation analysis , where the best fit value of the hubble constant extrapolated from cmb data is @xmath6 away from the direct measurement . \n we will examine these findings in the framework of bayesian model selection and discuss their implications for cosmology . \n we will also consider measurements of the age of the universe and investigate whether , from a model selection point of view , the tension between local and high redshift measurements disfavors the @xmath1cdm model in favor of a more complex model . \n this paper is organised as follows : in sec . \n [ sec : data ] , we present the data sets and combinations of data sets we will use . in sec .  [ \n sec : methods ] , we review different statistics that measure the  distance \" or the  difference \" between two distributions . \n we present our statistic of choice that stems from the bayesian evidence ratio and is suited to assess whether two posterior distributions from two different experiments are in tension or not . \n we present our results in sec . \n [ sec : results ] , where we examine the tension between local and high redshift cosmological measurements . \n we then explore several possibilities for this tension and examine the consequences both in terms of unknown errors and deviations from the @xmath1cdm model . finally , we conclude in sec .  [ \n sec : conclusions ] . in [ sec : kld ] , we report the kullback - leibler divergence between planck and wmap for selected models and parameters . \n we consider the _ planck _ \n mission cmb data with local measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath7 and of the age of the universe @xmath8 . \n the planck collaboration , along with the nominal mission temperature data , has also released the outputs of the markov chains monte carlo ( mcmc ) used to sample from the space of possible cosmological parameters . \n these mcmcs have been used by the team to generate estimates of the posterior mean of cosmological parameters , along with their confidence intervals @xcite . here \n , we use the publicly available outputs of the _ planck _ team mcmcs . \n the _ planck _ \n data have been analyzed by the team in several ways : using only planck temperature data on scales corresponding to multipoles @xmath9 ( _ planck _ ) , using planck data in conjunction with wmap polarization data at low @xmath10 ( _ wp _ ) , and using planck data , wmap data and also include the measurement of the lensing potential , which was reconstructed from the planck temperature maps themselves through the measurement of the four - point function ( _ lensing _ ) . in some cases , \n data from high - resolution but partial sky ground - based cmb experiments ( act and spt ) have also been included ( _ highl _ ) . in combination with planck these data \n better constrain the foreground - model parameters . here \n however , we concentrate on the _ planck + wp _ data combination . except in the appendix \n , we will not consider the _ lensing _ information in line with the considerations presented in @xcite ; the combination _ \n planck + wp+highl _ predicts a value for the lensing amplitude which is about @xmath11 higher than the value measured from the convergence power spectrum @xcite and the origin of this tension is not yet fully understood .      for the local data we follow exactly ref . \n we combine the values reported in ref . \n @xcite and @xcite in a  world average \" where the central value is given by the variance - weighted mean and the error conservatively given by the average of the errors : @xmath12 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 . \n estimates of the age of the universe can be obtained from the ages of the oldest objects and in particular from the ages of the oldest stars since these objects form very shortly after the big bang . \n accurate dating of globular clusters has been the subject of active investigation for decades but the error bars were , for a long time , large . \n it is only relatively recently that error - bars have become smaller due to better estimates of their distances @xcite or the use of distance independent methods @xcite . \n recently , it has become possible to use single stars to estimate @xmath8 ; accurate distances using direct parallax measurements were obtained for nearby sub - giant stars . in particular the star hd 140283 is a sub - giant moving off the main sequence , so its luminosity is a very good age - indicator . \n consequently , in order to constrain the current age of the universe , we use recent determinations of the ages of the oldest stars in the milky way . \n we use two kind of measurements : the age of the nearby sub - giant hd-140283 and the ages of the oldest globular clusters . \n the age of hd-140283 has been accurately measured by @xcite using hst parallaxes and spectroscopic determinations of its chemical abundance . \n in addition , they have used state of the art stellar evolutionary models and carried out a careful and extensive error budget . \n the age of hd-140283 is determined to be @xmath14 gyr ( including systematic errors , which dominate the error bar ) . \n additionally , the ages for some of the most metal poor milky way globular clusters ( ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 , and 47 tuc ) have been determined by ref .  @xcite . taking into account the revised nuclear reaction rate for @xmath15 of the cno burning cycle @xcite \n , we obtain an age @xmath16 gyr . in what follows we will linearly add these ( random and statistics ) two sources of errors . \n it is remarkable that age determinations for such different systems are in such a good agreement . \n there are three main ingredients that dominate the error budget of stellar ages : distance , chemical composition and theory of stellar evolution . \n the last one has been studied with extreme care in the last decade and major improvements have been made . \n it is very unlikely that stellar evolution theory needs any further significant revisions ; the contribution to the age error budget from stellar evolution theory is now negligible contributing to about 1% to the total age uncertainty . \n the two dominant error sources remain distance and chemical composition . \n the distance uncertainty can be efficiently removed by obtaining trigonometric parallaxes to the oldest stars or globular clusters . \n this has been the case for hd-140283 . however , for the globular clusters it is not yet possible to obtain trigonometric parallaxes and distances have to be obtained by indirect methods . \n currently the uncertainty budget in the age determination of galactic globular clusters is dominated by its distance estimation , which is done via indirect methods ( sub - dwarf fitting ) .    on the other hand , the dominant source of error of nearby sub - giants is the chemical composition of the stars . \n current 10-meter class telescope observations provide abundance with an accuracy of @xmath17 dex , which translates into a @xmath18% uncertainty when estimating the age of the oldest stars . \n the ages determinations of nearby sub - giants and globular clusters are dominated by different and independent systematics ( chemical abundance and distance respectively ) and we therefore combine the two above measurements by inverse variance weighting . recall that the ages of the oldest objects at @xmath19 only provide a lower estimate of @xmath8 . \n however , we know that the first generation of stars formed at @xmath20 @xcite . at this redshift the age of the universe is only @xmath21 gyr , which is much smaller than the current age estimation errors . \n this formation time - lag will only play a role when age estimations uncertainties are reduced by at least a factor of five , to the @xmath22% level . in our analysis \n we convert the age of the star to the age of the universe by adding to the stellar age @xmath23 gyr , assuming a gaussian distribution ( cutting negative tails when appropriate ) . \n we obtain the following estimate for the age of the universe : @xmath24 . here \n we assume gaussian distributions for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 measurements . \n it is important to note that the error - budget in the age determination will change dramatically with the launch of the gaia satellite in october 2013 . \n gaia will obtain trigonometric parallaxes to globular clusters and identify a large number of metal - poor sub - giants . \n therefore , the only dominant source of error remaining will be the chemical composition of the stars . \n a way to improve on this will be to obtain longer integrations or use different line diagnostic for the metallicity in the infrared . \n thus the dominant uncertainty in the error budget for the age of the local universe , will be the chemical composition reaching an error - floor of @xmath25% ; see @xcite for discussion . \n the questions we wish to address are the following . _ \n a ) _ we have two measurements of cosmologically interesting quantities in the form of a two or higher dimensional posterior distribution . in our application \n these two measurements are the high - redshift , model - dependent joint distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the local , cosmological - model - independent one . in the bayesian framework , \n how would one quantify whether these two measurements are or not in agreement ( tension ) ? in other words , if the null hypothesis is that the two measurements are  sampled \" from the base model adopted , when should the null hypothesis be abandoned ? \n if the answer to _ a ) _ is that the two measurements are in tension , then bayesian model selection can be used to study extensions to the base model adopted and select which is the favored model . \n alternatively the detected tension might indicate the presence of unaccounted for , residual systematic errors . \n possible options at this point are : discredit the measurement most likely affected by systematics or artificially increase its errors . \n if instead no tension is detected the measurements can be combined to perform , for example , joint parameter estimation .    clearly to address this type of question a measure of distance or difference between two distributions should be used . \n there are many statistics that quantify the difference between two distributions . \n the most widely used are the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite , the jeffrey s divergence @xcite , and jensen - shannon divergence @xcite . \n these are well rooted in information theory and they measure the difference between two probability distributions , say @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and therefore are suited to quantify how well @xmath26 approximates @xmath27 or the information content that @xmath27 adds to @xmath26 . \n in fact the kullback - leibler divergence is not symmetric ( clearly , the information content that @xmath27 adds to @xmath26 is not the information content that @xmath26 adds to @xmath27 ) and the jeffrey s divergence and jensen - shannon divergence are two approaches to symmetrize it . \n we will explore the application to cosmology of the entropy - based kullback - leibler divergence measure in the appendix . for our question _ a ) _ at hand we know _ a priori _ that we will be comparing two different distributions ( in fact we are comparing different experiments ) . \n we want to know wether the best fit values are consistent given the shape of the respective distributions , in other words we need the bayesian ( multi - dimensional ) parallel of the standard equivalency test . and @xmath28 ) \n of the same quantity , the standard equivalency test says that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are consistent within the errors if @xmath31 . \n ] we argue that this is given by the evidence ratio as follows . \n imagine we have performed two experiments : @xmath32 and for each experiment we produce a posterior @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the parameters of the model and @xmath35 represents the data from experiments @xmath32 respectively . \n let us also assume that for producing both posteriors we have used the same , uniform priors over the same  support \" , x , i.e. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 . \n let @xmath40 be the ( null ) hypothesis that both experiments measure the same quantity , the models are correct and there are no unaccountable errors . in this case \n , the two experiments will produce two posteriors , which , although can have different ( co)variances , and different distributions , have means that are in agreement . \n the alternative hypothesis , @xmath41 is when the two experiments , for some unknown reason , do not agree , either because of systematic errors or because they are effectively measuring different things or the model ( parameterization ) is incorrect . in this case \n , the two experiments will produce two posteriors with two different means and different variances .      in any practical application , the absolute normalization of the posteriors is often unknown , but we can still work as follows . \n we define : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the likelihood and @xmath44 . \n @xmath45 is the bayesian evidence for the joint distribution , thus @xmath46 is akin to an unnormalized evidence . \n operationally , to deal with the ( difficult to compute ) normalization factor let us now imagine that we can perform a _ translation _ ( shift ) of ( one or both of ) the distributions in @xmath47 and let us define @xmath48 the shifted distribution \n . this translation changes the location of the maximum but does not change the shape or the width of the distribution . \n if the maxima of the two distributions coincide then @xmath49 this can be considered our  straw man \" null hypothesis . as the distance between the maxima increases ( \n but the shape of the distributions remains the same ) , @xmath50 and eventually @xmath51 as the two distributions diverge . \n clearly the evidence ratio for the ( null ) hypothesis @xmath52 is @xmath53 , as the normalization factors @xmath54 cancel out , and the evidence ratio for the alternative @xmath41 is its reciprocal . \n we therefore introduce : @xmath55 which denotes the degree of tension that can be interpreted in the widely used ( slightly modified , @xcite ) jeffrey s @xcite scale ( tab . [ tab : scale ] ) . \n @xmath0 indicates the odds : @xmath56 are the chances for the null hypothesis . in other words , a large tension mens that the null hypothesis ( @xmath57 = @xmath58 ) is unlikely . \n d.  parkinson , p.  mukherjee and a.  r  liddle , phys . \n d * 73 * , 123523 ( 2006 ) [ astro - ph/0605003 ] . \n r.  trotta and a.  melchiorri , phys . \n lett .   * 95 * , 011305 ( 2005 ) [ astro - ph/0412066 ] . \n r.  trotta , mon .  not . \n * 378 * ( 2007 ) 72 [ astro - ph/0504022 ] . \n p.  a.  r.  ade _ et al . \n _ [ planck collaboration ] , arxiv:1303.5062 [ astro-ph.co ] . \n p.  a.  r.  ade _ et al._[planck collaboration ] , arxiv:1303.5076 [ astro-ph.co ] . \n feeney s. , peiris h.v . \n , verde , l. , in preparation ( 2013 )              r.  jimenez , p.  thejll , u.  jorgensen , j.  macdonald and b.  pagel , mon .  not . \n * 282 * ( 1996 ) 926 [ astro - ph/9602132 ] . \n gratton , r.  g. , bragaglia , a. , carretta , e. , clementini , g. , desidera , s. , grundahl , f. , lucatello , s.  2003 . \n distances and ages of ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 and 47 tuc . \n astronomy and astrophysics 408 , 529 - 543 .", "StartTimeOffset": 838083075948, "RequestID": "7047a6028e7d7c16a4bbd70ba3034a29dcaefcd9", "TotalTokens": 4182}

radial modes of pulsating stars are observationally distinguishable via the analysis of line profile variation ( lpv ) . from this pioneering work \n , there has been an increasing interest in lpv modeling driven by the improvement in resolution and efficiency of modern spectrographs : @xcite included the influence of stellar rotation , @xcite considered photospheric spots , @xcite performed a mode identification via the moments of the line profile or @xcite via the doppler imaging technique . \n @xcite noted that a pure kinematic approach is not enough for lpv modeling and that a realistic representation of the strength and broadening of spectral lines were necessary . \n they considered the atmosphere of a pulsating star as a perturbed status of the hydrostatic equilibrium and represented the temperature perturbation of atmospheric layers with a series expansion in terms of effective temperature and gravity . \n this operative method does not clearly represent the physics of @xmath0cep stars , pulsation modes do not change the energy production and the very small ( 1% ) stellar radius variation @xcite can not modify neither the effective temperature nor the surface gravity in an observable way . \n however along a pulsation cycle , the compression and expansion of photospheric layers change the dependence of temperature and pressure on optical depth and let the effective temperature appear variable , with the pulsation period , if determined in a limited spectral interval . \n a phenomenon indeed observed in some @xmath0 cephei stars by @xcite on the basis of a photometric approach . \n these authors derived a t@xmath1 variability up to 1000 k with the pulsation period , from geneva colours .    with the density and temperature , the variation of atomic level populations \n should also result in apparent surface gravity variations . \n in fact , there is an equivalence between stellar surface gravity and electron pressure in the framework of spectral line formation @xcite . \n a further contribution to the strength and profile of spectral lines comes from the microturbulence ( @xmath4 ) , that in principle could be modified along compression and expansion phases .    in this paper \n we analyse a set of time resolved spectra of @xmath0 cep (=  hd205021  =  hr8238 ) , which is generally accepted to be the proto - type of a class of hot pulsating stars , with the aim of ascertaining the apparent variability of the effective temperature , gravity and microturbulence with the pulsation period . \n these variations would strongly constrain any lpv method , as the one proposed by dupret and collaborators . \n .for each spectrum we report the heliocentric julian date , the radial velocity measured from the si iii triplet at 4550 , the t@xmath1 and @xmath3 determined through the h@xmath0 line . \n [ cols=\"^,>,^,^ \" , ]     the number and equivalent widths of the silicon lines in our spectra are not enough to measure the microturbulence . however , the siiii triplet at 4552 , 4567 and 4574 is very sensitive to this velocity field and rules out a microturbulence range larger than 1.0 km s@xmath5 . \n table[equiv ] shows that for the microturbulence variation deduced from nitrogen lines , the silicon triplet would present a 25% variability of equivalent widths much larger than the 7% observed ( fig.[var_ew ] ) . \n we conclude that the microturbulence variability determined from nitrogen lines is a local minimum of the previous @xmath9 function and we assume a constant value for this velocity equal to the one we obtained from the average spectrum : @xmath4 = 8.1 km s@xmath5 . \n we find that the effective temperature and gravity of @xmath0cep are variable with the pulsation period ( tab . \n fig.[teff_var ] shows that t@xmath1 changes , almost sinusoidally from @xmath723700  k to 24400  k , in phase with the @xmath3 variability from 3.76 to 3.93 .    for a constant @xmath4 , \n the variability of equivalent widths with the pulsation period is also indicative of the temperature behaviour along a cycle . \n fig.[var_ew ] shows that n ii and si iii lines are in phase and that they change out of phase compared to o ii and si iv . \n we have computed the expected equivalent widths of the representative lines of fig.[var_ew ] for atmosphere models with 20000  @xmath10  30000 k , @xmath3 = 3.91 , @xmath4 = 8.1 km s@xmath5 and abundance listed in table 2 . \n it appears ( fig.[teff_var ] ) that the observed behaviour of these lines is due to a variation of the effective temperature between 25000 and 26000 k. that is a result in agreement with @xcite who derived an effective temperature of 26000 k from the ratio of si iv and si iii line strength . \n the top panel of fig . \n [ teff_var ] shows the n ii abundance computed along the pulsational phase , considering the corresponding values of t@xmath1 and @xmath3 and keeping constant the value of @xmath4 ( 8.1 km s@xmath5 ) . \n this reflects the variations of the ionisation state of nitrogen . \n with the aim of determining the variations of the effective temperature , surface gravity and microturbulence velocity that occur in hot pulsating stars during the pulsational cycle , we performed time resolved r=20000 spectroscopic observations of the prototype @xmath0  cep along a complete period coverage . \n as a first step , we confirm the t@xmath1 and @xmath3 found in a previous paper by @xcite and we measure @xmath4=8.1@xmath20.9  km  s@xmath5 , from a sample of single lines of oii . with these values , the abundances resulted to be solar for nitrogen , oxygen , neon , aluminium , silicon and sulfur , while slight under - abundances have been inferred for carbon , magnesium and iron . \n we find that along a pulsation cycle , after a correction for the pulsational doppler shift , the h@xmath0 line profile changes are matched assuming a variability of the effective temperature in the range of 23700 to 24400 k and a variability of gravity in the range of 3.76 to 3.93 . \n the amplitude of @xmath11  0.08  dex measured in the gravity variation could lead the reader to the erroneous belief that it corresponds to a radius variation larger than the one computed by @xcite , via cinematic considerations . \n however , the variability of @xmath3 here determined for @xmath0  cep is not a consequence of changes in the surface gravity because of expansions and compressions of the star as a whole . \n we ascribed the @xmath3 variability to a change of the electron pressure @xcite induced by temperature , that modulates the ionisation state of metals . \n thus , it should not be linked directly to the radius of the star . \n metal lines are characterised by equivalent widths variable with the pulsation cycle . \n these are explained by a variable effective temperature between 25000 and 26000 k as a consequence of the changed ionisation state . \n it could be that the most extended formation region of the h@xmath0 line is at the origin of the lower temperature , in agreement with the 15% larger amplitude presented by the radial velocity measured through the h@xmath0 core .        as to the possibility that the microturbulence depends on the compression and expansion of the atmospheric layers \n , we find that it is constant within a 1.0 km  s@xmath5 . \n we conclude that pulsations modify the dependence of the temperature and pressure on the optical depth in the atmosphere of @xmath0  cep . \n this mimics a variability of the effective temperature and gravity when a small range of wavelengths is selected . \n we hope that this information can help in modeling the variability of spectral lines that is not only due to the pulsation velocity field @xcite .    along the expansion phase \n , the negative radial velocity is expected to increase up to a null value just in coincidence with the maximum of the stellar radius . at this phase of minimum compression \n , the photosphere is expected at the temperature minimum . \n differently , we observe a delay in the temperature minimum about one tenth of the pulsation period . according to @xcite , \n this extra - phase shift is due to the non - adiabatic condition that occurs in the pulsating layers . \n the authors wish to thank luigia santagati for the english revision of the text . \n kurucz r.l . , 1993 , a new opacity -

{"ContextTokens": 3917, "GeneratedTokens": 119, "SynthesizedBody": "hd209458b is the first extra - solar giant planet ( egp ) observed to transit its parent star @xcite and , consequently , its mass ( 0.69 m@xmath0 ) and radius ( 1.35 r@xmath0 ) are known to a high degree of accuracy . \n these results leave little doubt that hd209458b is a gas giant . and \n its special orbital inclination has drawn a great deal of attention from observers and theorists over the past year . \n recently , an increase in the sodium absorption ( relative to the continuum ) at 5893was observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) during several transits of hd2094598 @xcite . \n the additional sodium absorption is believed to be due to na d absorption in the egp s atmosphere as stellar light passes through the planetary limb . \n this observation marks a major turning point in the study of egps , for now we have direct evidence of an atmosphere around hd209458b and a measurement of one chemical species ( na ) . according to @xcite \n , the hst observations suggest that either the egp atmosphere has a low concentration of neutral atomic na ( due to photoionization , molecular formation , or an overall low metallicity ) or that high altitude clouds exist and reduce the amount of stellar flux transmitted though the egp limb .    in this letter , we offer an alternate explanation for the observed na absorption and explore the possibility that the na d feature is altered by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects brought on by the impinging stellar radiation field and insufficient collisional thermalization . \n if true , nlte effects would offer a natural explanation for the apparently low sodium absorption observed in the hd209458b without the need for excessive ionization , a reduced metallicity , or extremely high altitude clouds . \n below we will present theoretical predictions for nlte na d doublet line profiles for the transmitted spectrum of an irradiated egp atmosphere and provide stringent limits on the non - lte effects . \n the construction of the model atmospheres presented below follows the procedure outlined in @xcite ( here after bha ) . in order to make a direct comparison with hd209458b \n , we have adopted the best - fit values for the radius , mass , and orbital separation of hd209458b and its parent star published by @xcite and @xcite ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . \n we have also assumed that the total flux received by the planet has been uniformly distributed over the planet s dayside . \n therefore , the incident flux has been weighted by 0.5 , whereas in the bha models , no redistribution was assumed . \n the intrinsic effective temperature of the model ( i.e. the effective temperature of the planet in the absence of irradiation ) is 500k . however , this intrinsic temperature has little effect on the structure of the outer atmosphere which is completely determined by the incident flux . with this redistribution , \n our models represent an upper limit to the equilibrium effective temperature which is about 1800k . \n we further assume that the planet has a solar composition with an opacity setup identical to the `` ames - cond '' models of bha and @xcite . \n in this situation , dust grains form in the atmosphere at locations determined by the chemical equilibrium equations but their opacity contribution is ignored , mimicking a complete removal of the grains by efficient gravitational settling . \n therefore , the models in this study represent cloud free atmospheres . \n we model the flux transmitted through the limb of the planet s atmosphere , by solving the spherically symmetric radiative transfer equation ( ssrte ) suitably adjusted to account for the incident radiation . \n the incident flux is taken from a separate calculation which reproduces the observed spectrum of hd209458 . \n the ssrte has a significant advantage over the plane - parallel solution because a geometry more appropriate ( and more accurate ) for the upper atmosphere is already incorporated . when solving the ssrte , \n the atmosphere is modeled as a discrete number of concentric shells surrounding the interior ( or `` core '' ) . \n the solution along characteristic rays that pass through the outer most shells is all that is needed to calculate the transmitted intensities and automatically accounts for the curvature of the limb . \n the total transmitted flux is obtained by integrating over the planet limb : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the perpendicular distance from the planet center to a tangential characteristic ray . \n @xmath3 is the planet radius at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the optical depth at @xmath6 . \n @xmath7 is chosen such that for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the incident stellar intensity . \n this lower limit ensures that the transmitted intensities are well sampled and light from the core region is excluded . \n note that both @xmath3 and @xmath12 are determined by the simulation and depend on the resulting structure of the model atmosphere . \n the only prescribed radius is @xmath13 , which is equal to the planet radius given in table [ tab1 ] . with these definitions , \n the thickness of the limb ( @xmath14 ) is roughly @xmath15 . \n when a gas is assumed to be in lte , the level populations for each species depend entirely upon the gas temperature and electron pressure and are given by the saha - boltzmann distribution . in general , the lte assumption is a matter of computational convenience and is not expected to be valid in most cases , especially in the optically thin regions of an atmosphere . \n however , it is often assumed that lte is achieved in very late type stars ( even brown dwarfs ) despite the fact that this assumption has not been thoroughly tested . \n departures from lte have previously been investigated for ti i @xcite and co @xcite for cool m dwarfs and for ch@xmath16 in the jovian planets @xcite . \n these earlier works found that , for these particular species , nlte effects were small .    due to the close proximity of hd209458b to its parent star \n , the planet s atmosphere is subjected to intense stellar radiation . \n this inherently _ nonlocal _ source of radiation dramatically alters the conditions of the outer atmosphere compared to an isolated egp . \n in addition , the cool atmospheres of egps are dominated by strong opacity sources like h@xmath17o and ch@xmath16 and , therefore , have intensities that differ greatly from those of a blackbody . when combined with the relatively low pressures of the outer atmosphere , these conditions \n very likely will lead to departures from lte which may play an important role in determining the atmospheric structure and resulting spectrum . \n if lte is to be achieved in egp atmospheres , then the collisional rates must be large enough to compensate for the deviations of the radiative rates from their lte values . \n unfortunately , a limitation of all nlte models is a lack of well determined collisional cross - sections for interactions with important species like h@xmath18 , he , and h. however , it is unlikely , given the low thermal velocities , that these particles could restore lte completely . \n in fact , the effects of collisions with hydrogen on the na d profile in m dwarfs with chromospheres are fairly small and electron collisions dominate despite the fact that @xmath19 @xcite . \n the na i model atom used in this work includes 53 levels , and 142 primary transitions ( all bound - bound transitions with @xmath20 ) were included in the solution of the statistical equilibrium equations . for details of the method used to solve the rate equations , see @xcite . as in @xcite for ti \n i , electron - impact bound - free collisional rates are approximated by the formula of @xcite and bound - bound collisional rates are based on the semi - empirical formula of @xcite with permitted transitions determined from van regemorter s ( 1962 ) formula . for the ground - state photoionization cross sections , \n we have used the opacity project data of @xcite . \n we have also assumed complete redistribution .    we have constructed four model atmospheres and resulting transmitted spectra for hd209458b . \n the first irradiated model ( a ) only includes collisions with electrons , where the source of free electrons is primarily the ionization of potassium . even in an irradiated egp atmosphere , \n the number density of electrons is very small ( @xmath21 ) and the temperatures are too low for electronic collisions to be important . model a , therefore , can be considered a lower limit for the collisional rates . \n the second irradiated model ( b ) has the same parameters as model a , except that collisions with h@xmath18are also included . in order to place a secure upper limit on the effects of collisions with h@xmath18 , \n we have treated h@xmath18  as if it had the same rate coefficients as an electron . assuming identical cross - sections \n implies that the rate coefficients scale with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the reduced mass of the collision partners . \n therefore , we are overestimating the h@xmath18collisional rates by more than an order of magnitude . \n the remaining two models ( c and d ) represent _ non_-irradiated atmospheres with the same effective temperature as the irradiated models ( @xmath24 1800k ) and include the same lower ( model c ) and upper ( model d ) limits for the collision rates . each of these model atmospheres was produced from a self - consistent solution of the ssrte , chemical equilibrium equations , and the nlte rate equations . \n we did not prescribe the temperature structure or mixing ratios for any of the species . \n the temperature - pressure profiles for models a and c are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . \n note that , the profile for model b is identical to that of model a and model d has the same profile as model c. the gas pressures in the limb are very low , ranging from 0.004 mb to 0.2 mb . as is to be expected , the non - irradiated models look nothing like the irradiated models which have temperatures nearly 1000k higher in the outer atmosphere @xcite . there were no significant changes to the temperature - pressure profiles in the four nlte models compared to the lte structures . \n departures of the level populations from lte , for a particular species , are usually described by the departure coefficients , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nlte population density for level @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the lte value @xcite . in figure \n [ fig2 ] , we show the @xmath29 s for the ground state ( 3s ) and the first excited states ( 3p@xmath30 , 3p@xmath31 ) of the neutral sodium atom for several different physical conditions within an egp atmosphere . \n the largest departures are seen in model a where the 3s ( ground state ) and 3p levels are both underpopulated by many orders of magnitude , especially in the limb region . \n the main reason for such large departures is that we have only included collisions with electrons and , in such a cool atmosphere , the number density of electrons is @xmath32 orders of magnitude below that of the dominant species , h@xmath18 . \n consequently , there are essentially no collisions in model a to thermalize the level populations in the na atom thus allowing the radiative rates to dominate and drive the system out of lte . also , since the upper atmosphere is dominated by a large external radiation source ( which happens to peak near the na d doublet , @xmath33 ) , the mean intensity of the line is much larger than the thermal source function which implies a strong decoupling of the radiation field from the local conditions . \n furthermore , the ratio of the line source function to a blackbody is roughly given by the ratio of the departure coefficients of the upper ( 3p ) and lower ( 3s ) levels for the transition @xcite . from figure 2 \n , we see that the line source function is far from a blackbody for the majority of the upper atmosphere ( since @xmath34 ) .    an obvious question to ask \n is whether the system will return to lte if collisions with the dominant species ( h@xmath18 ) are included . \n model b , which has the same parameters and temperature profile as model a , includes collisions with both electrons _ and _ \n h@xmath18  ( but assuming that h@xmath18  has the same rate coefficients as an electron ) . \n in effect , we have increased the importance of electronic collisions by more than 8 orders of magnitude . as is expected , \n the departure coefficients are closer to one , but the level populations in the limb are still far from the lte values . \n however , since @xmath35 for most of the atmosphere , nlte effects will only be important in model b for @xmath36 . \n the real situation is likely to be somewhere between models a and b.    we also show departure coefficients for non - irradiated models ( c and d ) with @xmath37 equal to the equilibrium effective temperature of the irradiated atmospheres ( 1800k ) for both collisional rate limits . despite the absence of any extrinsic radiation and much lower temperatures in the upper layers , the non - irradiated atmospheres still have departures from lte , though generally less significant than those found in the irradiated atmospheres . \n model c ( the near collision free limit ) , has departures from lte similar to those of the collision dominated irradiated model ( b ) for the ground state but with an over populated 3p level . with \n increased collisional rates , na i has nearly returned to lte for most of the atmosphere in model d with departures still present in the top most layers whereas in the irradiated case both levels were greatly underpopulated even in the collision dominated model ( b ) . \n the effects on the na d line profiles are quite dramatic for model a ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . in this case \n , the lack of thermalization reduces the line transfer to nearly a pure scattering case . as a result \n , the doublet appears completely in emission . \n however , in model b , as the collisional rates are increased , the line wings return to their lte shape while the line cores are reversed . \n the data analysis of @xcite does not directly reveal the na line profile produced by the planet atmosphere . \n instead , their work shows that a deeper transit is observed in the na band implying additional na absorption by the planet limb . \n given the current sensitivity of the observations , a core reversal feature like the one shown in our model b would be buried in the noise and manifest itself as simply a smaller equivalent width . \n the na absorption in model b would result in a transit deeper than in the continuum bands but not as deep as implied by the lte model . \n the fact that na d absorption ( and not emission ) has been observed in the transmitted spectrum of hd209458b rules out our model a indicating that some thermalization does occur in the limb region . \n however , it is unlikely that the collisional rates are as large as those in our model b suggesting that the equivalent width of the na d doublet will be substantially reduced by nlte effects . \n the reduced equivalent width predicted by our model is _ not _ due to photoionization of na . in the majority of the limb , \n only 3% is ionized and the neutral na concentration is nearly constant with @xmath38 . \n na is only significantly ionized ( @xmath39 ) at the very top of the atmosphere where @xmath40 . \n the shallow ionization depth of na is due to the strong uv opacity provided by metals ( e.g. atomic mg , al , ca , fe , and ni ) which effectively shield na from the incident ionizing photons . the ionization predicted by our models ( even 3% ) is far greater than what is obtained from an lte calculation but does not significantly affect the line profile . however , \n if the planet s atmosphere is substantially cooler than in our model , then additional condensation and settling could further deplete the atmosphere of metals and allow greater ionization of na to occur . \n we also find that only a very small amount of na is in molecular form and that neutral na is nearly 3 orders of magnitude more abundant than nacl ( the most abundant na bearing molecule ) . \n furthermore , condensation of na via nacl grains is unlikely . \n the reduced equivalent width and central core emission is purely a radiative transfer effect . \n the recent hst observations provided the first direct measurement of the conditions inside the atmosphere of hd209458b . \n however , even under the best circumstances , determining the concentration of any species based solely upon one absorption feature is problematic , especially if this feature forms in the upper regions of an atmosphere where pressures are low and nlte effects are greatest . our models clearly show that na is far from being in lte in the upper atmosphere of hd209458b and the observed na absorption can be explained with a solar metallicity atmosphere which is cloud free or has only very low lying clouds . \n it is likely that other important species ( e.g. co and ch@xmath16 ) are in nlte , and we plan to test the lte assumption for a wide variety of atomic and molecular species in a future work . \n hopefully the na d doublets and other alkali metal lines will be useful diagnostics in the study of egp atmospheres . \n however , only with detailed nlte calculations including well determined collisional rates will we have a chance at constraining the physical conditions in the atmosphere of hd209458b . \n we would like to thank charbonneau et al . for making a copy of their work available before publication . \n this research was supported by nasa atp and ltsa grants to the university of georgia and to witchita state and in part by the ple scientifique de modlisation numrique at ens -

mode dependent critical limits .    an example sequence of an interlock test performed with the collimation application in the ccc is shown in fig . \n [ fig : interlocktest ] .    39.7 mm ) . \n the step counter , however , stays at 37 mm because in the emergency extraction with the springs the motor coupling is lost . \n a reset at the mechanical reference point ( out stopper ) is needed . \n , width=313 ] \n the beam - based alignment of the rps is performed with a technique established for the collimators  @xcite : a reference beam edge is produced by closing the horizontal and vertical primary collimators ( tcps ) until they scrape the beam halo at an aperture @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the beam size at the collimator , calculated for nominal optics functions and for a given normalised emittance . \n this beam edge is then used as a reference for the rps : the pot approaches the circulating beam in steps as small as 10@xmath1 m . \n when it reaches the edge , a beam loss is measured in a beam loss monitor ( blm ) downstream ( fig . \n [ fig : collim ] ) . in this condition , \n the rp and the primary collimator are at the same normalised distance @xmath4 from the beam orbit with an accuracy given by the step size . at the contact position , \n the rp scrapes slightly into the beam . to refine the scraped beam edge , \n the primary collimator in the appropriate plane is moved further towards the beam until it becomes again the aperture bottleneck . \n the average of the two normalised reference distances @xmath4 of the primary collimators is used to compute the normalised distance @xmath5 of the rp .      note that this procedure only establishes the distance between the _ thin window _ of the rp and the beam centre . \n the alignment of the different _ silicon detector planes _ , both relative to each other and to the beam , is determined by software , using real particle data .        a detailed discussion of the software alignment methods is given in  @xcite . \n most degrees of freedom of the relative alignment between the rp sensors can be obtained from the reconstructed tracks . \n the underlying idea is that sensor misalignments give raise to residuals , i.e. the distances of the measured hit positions from the fitted tracks . \n this technique is sensitive to shifts ( along the sensor read - out direction , i.e. perpendicular to the microstrips ) and rotations of individual detector planes relative to each other , but not to global shifts or rotations . \n the transverse overlap between vertical and horizontal detectors ( fig . \n [ fig : stationscheme ] ) establishes the alignment between the mechanically independent 3 pots of a rp unit . \n [ fig : trackbasedresult ] shows a comparison of the track - based alignment results for an example rp with the optical metrology data . \n the global misalignment modes ( e.g. common shifts or rotations of entire stations w.r.t . \n the beam ) are inaccessible to the track - based techniques but can be constrained by exploiting known symmetries of certain physics processes . \n a prominent example is elastic scattering with its clean hit distribution in the vertical detectors ( fig . \n [ fig : elasticprofile ] ) . \n the horizontal and vertical symmetries of the distribution lead to an alignment precision of better than 10@xmath1 m horizontally and about 20@xmath1 m vertically .    . \n the symmetry line of the vertical distribution ( indicating the position of the beam centre ) is found by inverting the sign of the @xmath6 part ( excluding the region near the acceptance cut ) and shifting it until it coincides with the @xmath7 part.,width=317 ]    9 totem collaboration : technical design report , cern -

{"ContextTokens": 3367, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "the formation and evolution of a very low  mass binary system consisting of a neutron star ( millisecond pulsar ) and a 0.1 @xmath2 companion is not yet well understood . \n one of the main observational features of these systems is that they are eclipsing . \n one interesting eclipsing binary system , psr b174424a , is in the globular cluster terzan 5 . \n the neutron star is an 11.56 ms pulsar in a 1.8 h orbit with a low  mass companion ( lyne et al . \n the duration of the eclipse in this system is very variable and is never less than one  third of the orbital period . \n lyne et al.(1990 ) estimated that the energy flux from the pulsar at the companion surface ( isotropic radiation is assumed ) is @xmath3 2@xmath4 erg s@xmath5@xmath6 which is near the critical value when the irradiation may influence the structure of a low  mass star ( podsiadlowski 1991 ) . however , this value is at least a factor of 15 less than for another eclipsing millisecond binary pulsar system psr b1957 + 20 ( fruchter et al . \n this small irradiative flux value and great variations in duration of the eclipse lead lyne et al . \n ( 1990 ) to the conclusion that in this system roche lobe overflow may occur . \n recent long  term timing observations of the eclipsing binary pulsar psr b174424a at the vla and green bank , show that the orbital period of psr b174424a has decreased , with a time \n scale of only @xmath7@xmath0200 myr . \n this is five times faster than if the orbital period decay is driven only by the gravitational wave radiation ( nice et al . \n 2000 ) . \n the key question of interest is : how did this system evolve ?    in this short note we show that the new observational data for the orbital period decay of psr b174424a may give us a unique opportunity to test the magnetic braking mechanism if the observed orbital period decay is secular . \n more than twenty years ago it was realized that to produce short orbital period low \n mass binary systems ( cataclysmic variables and low  mass x  ray binaries  lmxb ) it is necessary to include two mechanisms for orbital angular momentum losses : gravitational wave radiation and/or magnetic braking . low \n mass unevolved stars ( main  sequence stars ) will fill their roche  lobe only for orbital periods less than 12 hours and the mass transfer due to gravitational wave radiation mechanism never exceeds @xmath8/yr . \n this produces an x  ray luminosity of @xmath9 erg / s . \n observations , however , show that many lmxbs in this orbital period range have x  ray luminosities that are one or two orders of magnitude higher .    to explain this discrepancy verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) introduced additional orbital angular momentum loss by magnetic braking which was able to drive a much higher mass  transfer rate . in view of these much higher mass transfer rates \n the companion will be driven out of thermal equilibrium . \n however magnetic braking will not work forever . \n as soon as the companion mass has decreased to m @xmath10 0.3 @xmath2 ( fully convective star ) an orbital period near the 3 hours , the rate of angular momentum loss by magnetic braking is expected to either vanish or to drop considerably ( spruit & ritter 1983 ) , causing the mass  loss rate to drop , and the secondary star subsequently relaxes to its thermal equlibrium state . \n the stellar radius decreases and the star detaches from its roche lobe . during the detached phase , orbital angular momentum loss by gravitational wave radiation will continue , and when the orbital period has been reduced to 2 hours , the companion ( of mass @xmath00.3 @xmath2 ) again fills its roche lobe . \n this is the so \n called standard cataclysmic variable ( cv ) evolutionary scenario .    in 1985 \n tutukov et al . discussed what will happen with a low  mass binary if the star filling its roche lobe is a slightly evolved star ( so  called `` turn  off main  sequence star '' ) . in this scenario \n the binary evolves towards very short orbital periods . due to the chemical composition gradient , \n the secondary star does not become fully convective when its mass has reduced to 0.3@xmath11 and magnetic braking does not vanish . between orbital periods of two to three hours , the mass transfer rate is very low , and apparently during this time the system may be in the `` propeller '' stage ( ergma & sarna 1996 ) . according to the standard cv evolutionary picture , \n the magnetic braking mechanism vanishes near an orbital period of 3 hours . \n however in the latter scenario , it will also work for smaller values of the orbital periods . \n the evolutionary sequences for the secondary star in a low  mass binary were computed using a standard one  dimensional stellar evolution code based on a henyey  type code developed by paczyski ( 1970 ) and adapted to low \n mass main  sequence stars . for more detail about the computer program see muslimov & sarna ( 1993 ) and sarna & de greve ( 1994 , 1996 ) . \n we compute the loss of orbital angular momentum due to gravitational radiation using the formula presented by landau & lifshitz ( 1971 ) . \n @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the primary mass , secondary mass , total mass and orbital period of the system . \n we assume that the companion is being spun down by the magnetic braking and its spin and orbital rotation are synchronized at the cost of orbital angular momentum loss . \n we adopt the standard formula ( see mestel 1968 , mestel & spruit 1987 ) for the rate of orbital angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking of the companion .    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the radius of gyration of the secondary star , @xmath18 = 0.1 . \n this formula contains a poorly known parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath0 0.71.8 ) characterizing the effectiveness of the dynamo action in the stellar convection zone ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) . to take account of the angular momentum loss that accompanies mass loss during the `` propeller phase '' \n , we use a formula based on that used to calculate angular momentum loss via a stellar wind ( paczyski , 1967 , sarna & de greve , 1994 )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21(@xmath220 ) is the mass  loss rate from the secondary star ; @xmath23(@xmath240 ) is the accretion rate on to the neutron star , @xmath25(@xmath220 ) is the rate of the total mass loss from the system ; @xmath26 is the ratio of the mass ejected by the neutron star to that accreted by the neutron star and @xmath27 is defined as the effectiveness of angular momentum loss during mass transfer ( sarna & de greve , 1994,1996 ) . \n we consider the following model ( similar scenarios have been discussed by shaham & tavani 1991 , kluniak et al . 1992 and ergma & sarna 1996 ) for the psr b174424a system . the progenitor of this system is a low  mass ( @xmath311.5@xmath2 ) star + old neutron star . \n the secondary star fills its roche lobe , as a `` turn  off main  sequence star '' . at the beginning , \n the mass transfer rate proceeds on a thermal time  scale and the neutron star will spin up to a millisecond period . after that , the mass transfer rate drops and the system enters the `` propeller stage '' and the pulsar spins down . \n

, @xmath32(rlof)= 1 day ; ( ii ) @xmath14 = 1.5@xmath2 , @xmath31=1.4 @xmath2 @xmath32(rlof)= 1.02 days ( @xmath32(rlof ) is initial orbital period when the secondary star fills its roche lobe ) . in fig . \n 1 ( a , b , c ) the mass  loss rate versus orbital period is presented for the following cases : ( a ) sequence ( i ) , @xmath26=@xmath27=0 , ( b ) sequence ( i ) , @xmath26=@xmath27=1 , ( c ) sequence ( ii ) , @xmath26=@xmath27=1 . at first , the mass exchange rate is rather high ( proceeds on the thermal time  scale of the secondary star ) and during this phase , the old neutron star will spin  up . \n latter @xmath25 decreases and near an orbital period of @xmath0 24 hours , the mass accretion rate has its minimum value . depending on the value of the surface magnetic field strength , the system may or may not be in the `` propeller phase '' . \n how does the value of @xmath1 influence the orbital evolution of the binary system ? \n for example for sequence ( a ) and for @xmath1= 1.8 , the final orbital period is larger than the initial and for @xmath1 = 1.0 a short period binary system with low \n mass helium white dwarf and millisecond pulsar is formed ( @xmath33 13 hours ) . only for @xmath1 @xmath3 1 \n does the system evolve towards very short orbital periods ( fig.1 ) .    in fig . \n 2 , a , b , c the variation of @xmath34 versus orbital period is shown for the same cases as presented in fig . \n 1 a , b , c. as is clearly seen in this figure , orbital period changes depend on the value of @xmath1 . in table 1 we present @xmath35 and orbital period decay time \n scale @xmath36=@xmath37 values for various @xmath1 when the orbital period is equal to 1.8 hours . the evolutionary time \n scale obtained by nice at al . \n ( 2000 ) is 200 myr . from table 1 \n we can see that a @xmath1 close to 1 agrees well with the observed value for psr 174424a.the calculated mass of the secondary @xmath0 0.15 @xmath2 near a period 1.8 h also agrees well with the observed value ( lyne et al . \n if the observed orbital period decay is secular and our suggestion is correct that the orbital evolution of psr 174424a is driven by magnetic braking then this may be the first case when the orbital period decay by a magnetic braking mechanism has been measured . according to our model calculations the best fit to the observed orbital period decay \n is obtained when @xmath1 is near to one . which means that the value proposed by smith ( 1979 ) @xmath1=1.78 underestimates , that and proposed by skumanich ( 1972 ) @xmath1=0.73 sligtly , overestimates the magnetic braking efficiency . \n ee thanks dr.b . stappers for useful comments and in improving the text of the paper . \n also we thank dr.d.nice for providing us results of observations before

{"ContextTokens": 2593, "GeneratedTokens": 67, "SynthesizedBody": "the distortion of pulses propagating through waveguides arises due to dispersive spreading \n . however , if the waveguides is made using materials the refractive index of which depends nonlinearly on the intensity of the propagating pulses , it will be possible to compensate the effect of dispersion by a pulse - narrowing effect @xcite . a typical example in respect of this \n is provided by optical fibers . here \n the weak nonlinearity of the index of refraction arising due to kerr effect produces a self modulation which in turn causes steepening of the wave . \n the dynamical interplay between the dispersive and narrowing effects produces the so called optical solitons . for an isotropic medium with cubic nonlinearity \n the complex optical wave field @xmath0 is governed by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls )    @xmath1    here @xmath2 stands for time and @xmath3 , the coordinate along the fiber . \n the suffixes @xmath3 and @xmath2 of @xmath4 denote partial derivatives with respect to these variables . in particular , @xmath5 . \n the main reason for the robustness of the solitons described by @xmath6 is that the wave numbers of the solitons lie in a range that is forbidden for the linear dispersive waves @xcite . as a result \n , linear wave can not be in resonance with the soliton to receive energy from the latter . \n we then have a stable soliton . \n the propagation of picosecond pulses is well described by the nls equation in @xmath6 which accounts for only the second - order dispersion and self modulation . but for femtosecond pulses another important physical effect namely , the third - order dispersion comes into play . in this case \n the appropriate evolution equation for the pulse propagation is given by @xcite @xmath7 understandably , the parameter @xmath8 is a measure of the perturbation caused by the third - order dispersion . due to the effect of perturbation \n a soliton could have wave numbers residing inside the linear spectrum of the system . \n such a soliton is called an embedded soliton @xcite . \n clearly , the embedded solitons can be in resonance with the perturbation to generate continuous wave radiation for subsequent decay . despite this , in certain parameter regimes these solitons can be stable @xcite . in view of this \n the stability analysis of embedded solitons arising in the solutions of higher - order nls equation has been subject of considerable current interest . \n the present work is an effort in this direction . \n studies in embedded solitons @xcite within the framework of a third - order nls equation indicate that these soliton exits as a continuous family . \n the members of the family being characterized by their propagation velocities are connected through a gauge transformation @xcite . \n we demonstrate the existance of such a family by using a straightforward analytical model and argue that embedded solitons can be fully stable despite their tendency to shed radiation . \n we believe that such an approach has distinct advantages to deal with physical problems because many unknown effects are then readily expressed and evaluated . to achieve our goal \n we shall derive a variational approach involving trial functions in order to describe the main characteristics of the embedded solitons as determined by the third - order nls equation in @xmath9 . \n although the chosen trial functions have a specific form , the shape parameters are allowed to evolve as the solitons propagate . with this assumtion \n the evolution equation under consideration simplifies to a reduced lagrangian problem @xcite . \n we shall try to study the stability of embedded solitons by taking variations of this lagrangian with respect to the shape parameters . \n for the nls equation in @xmath6 there exists a well - defined spectral problem @xcite such that one can write a closed form analytical solution of it in terms of sech functions . \n as opposed to this , the third - order nls equation can not be solved analytically . keeping this in view we look for a variational treatment of @xmath9 to find an accurate approximation solution . for our treatment \n we will essentially rely on a ritz optimization procedure @xcite applied to the lagrangian function for the nls equation in @xmath9 . \n we have found that the action functional @xmath10 with the lagrangian density @xmath11 reproduces the third - order nls equation via the hamilton s variational principle .    in the ritz optimization procedure , the first variation of the action functional is made to vanish for a suitable chosen trial function . in analogy with the well - known solution of @xmath6 \n we introduce a sech type trial function @xmath12\\times \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\nonumber \\\\\\exp i\\left [ v(x)(t - y(x))+\\frac{b(x)}{2a(x)}\\left ( t - y(x)\\right)^2+\\sigma(x ) \\right ]   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are real functions of @xmath3 . \n the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 are related to the three lowest -

order differtial equation for the pulse width @xmath61 the first integral of @xmath62 gives @xmath63 where the potential field @xmath64 the constant of integration @xmath65 is determined by the initial conditions of @xmath62 . \n first from the initial conditions of @xmath62 written as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 using @xmath69 in @xmath70 we write @xmath71 we now introduce a normalized pulse width @xmath72 to rewrite @xmath73 as    @xmath74    with    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    the potential function @xmath77 vanishes for two values of @xmath78 , namely , @xmath79 and @xmath80 implying that there is a minimum in between these points . \n the point at which @xmath77 is minimum can be obtained from @xmath81 as @xmath82 in the limit when @xmath83 we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in this case \n the potential well degenerates into a single point such that a particle released at that point will stay there . in the context of this work , this signifies that a wave pulse for which @xmath83 propagates with unchanged shape as a cosequence of exact balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects . \n interestingly , we now have a continuous family of soliton solutions because @xmath86 depends on the continuous variable @xmath87 . \n this implies that in the neighbourhood of each embedded soliton there is another one having a slightly higher or lower energy . \n a particular embedded soliton when perturbed may always relax to the adjacent one . \n this makes an embedded soliton fully stable .    in fig . \n 1 we plot the potential function @xmath77 as a function of @xmath78 for @xmath88 . \n each of these potentials has @xmath89 and is , therefore , associated with an embedded soliton . \n the solid curve @xmath90 is the potential function corresponding to the usual second - order nls equation while the dotted curves represent the potential functions of the embedded solitons as found in the solution of third - order nls equation . for @xmath91 , \n the potential curves for the embedded solitons lie above the solid curve for @xmath92 . for @xmath93 \n the dotted curves fall below the solid curve . \n we have drawn only a few curves for discrete values of @xmath94 . however , a dense set of curves can be drwan by varying @xmath94 continuously . \n this work forms the part of a research project f.10 -

{"ContextTokens": 2309, "GeneratedTokens": 291, "SynthesizedBody": "the interaction of soft substrates with fluid interfaces is common to many biological , medical , and industrial processes . for this reason , the field of elastocapillarity @xcite , \n in which one studies how surface tension forces couple to the deformations of elastic substrates , has been the subject of much recent attention . \n even the most basic characterization of the wetting forces at the three - phase contact - line remains in dispute , especially for soft viscoelastic materials @xcite that have both liquid and solid properties . \n for such materials , the young - dupr law for a liquid wetting a hard solid , neumann s law for a liquid wetting another liquid , or some hybrid thereof may apply @xcite . \n theoretical efforts have been made to bridge the gap between the hard solid and liquid regime , such as introducing the concept of solid surface tension @xcite . \n alternative methods employ computational approaches such as density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations @xcite to gain a more thorough understanding of the wetting forces acting at the contact - line .    in general , the elastic resistance must be comparable in magnitude to the surface tension forces applied to the elastic medium for many elastocapillary phenomenon . \n the elastocapillary number @xmath1 is a typical measure of the relative importance of capillarity to elasticity . here \n @xmath2 is the surface tension , @xmath3 the elastic modulus and @xmath4 a characteristic length scale . in experiments , \n it is typically easiest to adjust @xmath4 , as seen in the wrinkling of elastic sheets @xcite , capillary origami @xcite and buckling of elastic fibers @xcite . \n however , it is also possible to use a gel as the solid phase @xcite , which permits @xmath3 to be tuned over several orders of magnitude .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we end this section with a comment on the failure criteria . \n the results presented in this section have assumed that the substrate is always weak enough to generate deformations that exceed the failure threshold for agar gel . as such \n , we have focused our study on identifying a critical wavenumber and not the failure threshold . \n additional experiments would be needed to extract such information . \n the model developed above captures the central feature required to generate a starburst with a particular number of arms : a critical wavenumber @xmath5 for which the tangential displacement is maximal . in experiments \n , we observe that for a given set of experimental conditions , a narrow range of wavenumbers are selected ; this is not surprising given that values of @xmath6 can have a maximum displacement similar to @xmath5 . \n however , the failure criteria does not provide a failure mechanism . in physical gels such as agar or gelatin , \n the stiffness of the material is provided by a network of entangled polymers @xcite . under strain \n , these polymers are stretched further away from equilibrium , although not necessarily to the point of failure . \n because polymers are subject to thermal fluctuations , even a sub - critical strain can be triggered by a sufficiently large thermal fluctuation . \n this is the mechanism behind delayed fracture , whereby there is an exponential distribution of waiting times ( indicating a poisson process ) before which a strained material fractures . this has been directly observed in both stiffer gelatin rods ( @xmath7  kpa ) @xcite and in vibration - controlled experiments in this system . \n ( color online ) definition sketch of a fluid - filled crack of length @xmath4 driven by a pressure head @xmath8 . \n , scaledwidth=37.0% ]    once a fracture is initiated , fluid begins to flow into the crack tip and the crack propagates outward ( away from the central droplet ) until the reservoir of fluid is exhausted . \n we develop a two - dimensional model for the asymptotic propagation of a mode i fracture driven by a pressure head @xmath8 . a schematic \n is shown in figure  [ fig : fracture ] . \n to begin , we consider an incipient crack of length @xmath9 , filled with an inviscid fluid of density @xmath10 , propagating into an elastic solid.in this section , we model the solid as either i ) a linear elastic material or ii ) an incompressible neo - hookean material , as is typically used for polymeric gels , and contrast the computed propagation rates . \n we assume the capillary pressure head @xmath11 at the fluid reservoir @xmath12 is greater than the elastic stress in the solid in front of that reservoir , so as to drive fluid into the crack tip . \n the flow @xmath13 of this inviscid fluid is governed by bernoulli s law , @xmath14 and , hence , driven by the gradient in fluid pressure @xmath15 , which is related to the elastic stress induced by deformations of the crack surface . \n here we assume there is no ambient stress field in the elastic solid , or the substrate is not pre - stressed \n . the localized stress ( pressure ) field near the crack tip @xmath16 of a linear elastic solid has the well - known asymptotic form @xcite , @xmath17    for an incompressible neo - hookean solid , the asymptotic stress field is given by @xcite , @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are stress intensity factors for a linear elastic and incompressible neo - hookean solid , respectively . \n in general , @xmath19 is a function of the crack geometry and far - field loading conditions , but we may simplify our model by utilizing several experimental observations . \n recent experiments have demonstrated self - healing behavior of fluid - filled cracks in soft substrates @xcite . \n this observation is characteristic of stable , or transport - limited , crack growth . \n that is , the speed of crack growth is limited by the extent to which the fluid can be supplied ( transported ) to the crack tip . for reference , unstable crack growth \n would be controlled by the speed of an elastic wave in the solid , a characteristic which is not observed experimentally . \n hereafter , we assume the crack propagates in the marginal state @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fracture toughness , consistent with stable crack growth . \n we apply bernoulli s law ( [ bernoulli ] ) using the crack tip ( state 1 ) and a point upstream ( state 2 ) to derive an equation relating the crack - tip velocity @xmath23 to the pressure gradient in the linear elastic solid ( [ fstress ] ) :    @xmath24    whose solution gives @xmath25 this predicts a characteristic exponent of @xmath26 for the growth of the arm . \n a similar relationship is derived for an incompressible neo - hookean solid by applying the respective stress field ( [ nhstress ] ) instead : @xmath27 for this system , the characteristic exponent is instead @xmath28 : @xmath29    note that both constitutive models predict power law behavior , but the neo - hookean model is able to reproduce the universal exponent @xmath30 observed experimentally @xcite . \n we attribute this result to the observation that the gel substrate is incompressible and that the large scale deformation of the soft solid are more aptly described by the nonlinear neo - hookean constitutive law . \n ( color online ) histogram for the crack length exponent @xmath31 with mean @xmath32 . \n , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    because the gels are spatially - heterogeneous , cracks nucleate with different widths and propagate at varying rates . \n we fit the length of each fracture arm to the form @xmath33 and examine the distribution of @xmath31 values observed . \n no systematic variation with material parameters was found for the values of @xmath31 , but the width of the crack determines the pre - factor @xmath34 @xcite . \n for this same data set of @xmath35 individual arms , we find that @xmath36 ( standard error ) . \n the full probability distribution is show in figure  [ fig : alpha ] , which allows for comparison to the @xmath37 ( neo - hookean ) and @xmath38 ( linear elastic ) constitutive models . \n we have analyzed the deformations of a soft elastic substrate induced by the liquid / solid interactions with a liquid droplet , as well as the propagation of a fluid - filled crack in a soft elastic medium . \n the deformations associated with a corrugated contact - line yield a critical disturbance with wavenumber @xmath5 that generates the largest elastic response within the substrate . \n we quantify the response with the tangential displacement , a failure criteria which we correlate with the initiation of a starburst fracture ( see figure  [ fig : intro ] ) . \n computations reveal that the location of the unbalanced contact - line force is the most important parameter in wavenumber selection . \n our theoretical predictions compare favorably to i ) previously - reported experiments with fixed volume droplets @xcite and ii ) experiments where the contact - angle @xmath39 is fixed and the droplet volume @xmath40 is varied , thereby confirming our interpretation of the initiation process . \n our model also predicts that the substrate thickness @xmath41 is also an important parameter in wavenumber selection , an observation which we see in experiments . for the crack propagation problem \n , we develop a model by considering the transport of an inviscid fluid into the crack tip of either a linear elastic or incompressible neo - hookean solid . \n while both elastic models yield power law growth , the neo - hookean model predicts the crack length grows with universal exponent @xmath0 and does not scale with any material parameters , consistent with experimental observations @xcite . \n studies on fracture necessarily take place on materials which are strong enough to resist fracture until the point when the measurement is made . however , many biological materials are soft enough that conventional fracture measurements are not possible because the material is too weak to support its own weight . \n the present study suggests that by depositing a droplet of known size and wettability , it could be possible to use starburst fractures to measure the fracture toughness of very soft materials so long as they remain fully supported by the dish . furthermore , because the growth rate of fractures is sensitive to whether or not the material is linear - elastic , this could also provide a new method for materials characterization . \n the authors are grateful for support from the national science foundation under grant number dms-0968258 , as well as nc state s undergraduate research office , to michael shearer for valuable discussions , and to mark schillaci for preliminary experiments useful in formulating the model . \n tadashi kajiya , adrian daerr , tetsuharu narita , laurent royon , francois lequeux , and laurent limat . \n advancing liquid contact line on visco -

{"ContextTokens": 1798, "GeneratedTokens": 110, "SynthesizedBody": "hash table is a common data structure used in large set of data storage and retrieval . \n it has an o(1 ) lookup time on average , but the worst case lookup time can be as bad as o(@xmath1)(@xmath1 is the size of the hash table ) \n . such a time variation is essentially caused by possibly many collisions during keys hashing . in this paper \n , we present a set of hash table schemes called cascade hash tables which consist of several levels(@xmath2 ) of hash tables with different size . \n after constant probes , if an item ca nt find a free  cell\"(slot ) in the first level table , it will try to find a cell in the second level , or subsequent lower levels . with this simple strategy \n , these hash tables will have descendent load factors , therefore descendent collision probabilities . \n so finally the probability that the item can not find an empty cell in any hash table is slight . \n this enables the whole hash table to reach a high load factor with constant probes in random generated test set , before a _ \n crisis_(the situation that when an item comes , we can not find a free slot in limited probes in any hash table ) happens . \n a hash table is a data structure that associates keys with values . \n the primary operation it supports efficiently is a _ \n lookup _ : given a key ( e.g. a person s name ) , find the corresponding value ( e.g. that person s telephone number ) . \n it works by transforming the key using a _ hash function _ into a hash  a number that the hash table uses to locate the desired value . \n a hash function is a many - to - one mapping , which maps keys in a large domain to hashes in a relative small range . so collisions among keys which are mapped to the same hash are inevitable . \n differences among hash table schemes lie in hash function and collision resolution strategy . \n generally a string type key is hashed into an integer by a hash function , then mapped into an index not bigger than the table size(a common method is to compute the hash value modulo the table size . \n there are various hash functions on strings , such as crc , _ \n lookup2 _ and md5 . as to integer type keys , \n they are directly mapped into indices .      if two keys hash to the same index , the corresponding records can not be stored in the same location . \n so , if it s already occupied , we must find another location to store the new record , and do it so that we can find it when we look it up later on . \n the most popular collision resolution techniques are _ chaining _ and _ open addressing_.    in the chained hash table technique , each slot in the array references a linked list of inserted records that collide to the same slot . \n insertion requires finding the correct slot , and appending to either end of the list in that slot ; deletion requires searching the list and removal . \n this technique is intuitive and the performance degrades gracefully when the load factor increases . \n but if the record size is small , the overhead of the linked list is significant . \n additionally , traversing a linked list has poor cache performance . \n some popular hash table implementations , such as stl , use this technique . \n open addressing hash tables store the colliding records directly within the array . \n a hash collision is resolved by probing through alternate locations in the array(the probe sequence ) until either the target record is found , or an unused array slot is found , which indicates that there is no such key in the table . \n well known probe sequences include : linear probing , in which the interval between probes is fixed  often at 1 ; quadratic probing , in which the interval between probes increases linearly ( hence , the indices are described by a quadratic function ) ; double hashing , in which the interval between probes is fixed for each record but is computed by another hash function . \n any of these methods may probe indefinite number of locations , even as many as @xmath1 in the worst case ! \n we call these methods _ unlimited_. a method is _ limited _ , if the number of probes can not exceed some limit . \n in the implementation of @xmath3-level cascade hash table , we have @xmath3 hash tables , and use limited double hashing in every level of table . in turn , the hash table size is half of its preceding hash table(the proportion @xmath4 is chosen empirically ) . \n we limit the total number of probes to @xmath5 . \n thus in every level , the probe number is @xmath6 . here \n @xmath3 is a factor of @xmath5 , so @xmath7 . if an item ca nt find a free cell in level @xmath8 in @xmath9 probes , it will probe in level 2 , and if still with bad luck , it turns to search lower levels . \n if a crisis happens , the hash table will be enlarged and rehashed . \n the lookup procedure is similar to the insertion procedure . \n it also takes not more than @xmath5 steps .    clearly , insertion and \n lookup both take at most @xmath5 probes , so the time complexity of cascade hash table is o(1 ) .    specially , when @xmath10 , it s the ordinary ( limited ) double - hashing scheme . when @xmath11(one probe every level ) \n , it s the  multilevel adaptive hashing \" scheme presented by paper@xcite . \n experiments show that it is not the best configuration . \n are all occupied ) ] \n by experiments on random data sets , we get the result as in table [ result1 ] , [ result2 ] and [ result3 ] .    .experiment result 1 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from these tables , we can see that in a certain level of a multiple level hash table , the load factor decreases drastically . \n take three - level hash table for example , when hash tables are  full\"(not really full , but we can not insert the coming new item into it in limited probes ) , @xmath12 is around @xmath13 , @xmath14 is @xmath15 , but @xmath16 is only around @xmath17 . \n so if a new item comes , the _ crisis rate_(the probability that the item ca nt find an empty room in any hash table ) is not bigger than @xmath18 . \n given a one level hash table , assume it has a load factor of @xmath19 , then it will take at least @xmath20 probes on average to obtain the same small crisis rate(which ensures a high load factor ) as 3-level cascade hash table . \n but cascade hash table just makes @xmath5 probes meanwhile .    to our surprise \n , the space efficiency of @xmath3-level hash table does nt increase monotonically with @xmath3 . at @xmath21 , \n the space efficiency hits the climax , then falls down at @xmath11 . \n in this paper , we introduce a series of hash table schemes  cascade hash tables . \n it uses @xmath3 levels of hash tables ; in every level , we use limited double hashing to make probes . \n smaller hash tables work as fail - safes of bigger hash tables . roughly speaking , \n different tables are similar with sieves with holes in different shapes . \n we hope no object escape through these sieves . with more sieves , \n the chance that an object is screened in some level is bigger . \n the idea is simple , but its performance exceeds the ordinary one level hash table dramatically when there are more than @xmath22 levels . by choosing @xmath21 , it s much better than the hash scheme proposed in paper@xcite . \n obviously , if we permit a larger total probe count , we can achieve higher load factor . \n but the average speed will be slower . \n so a user can choose an appropriate configuration which balances best between speed and space efficiency to him . \n 12 andrei z. broder , anna r. karlin . \n multilevel adaptive hashing . in proceedings of the 1st acm - siam symposium on discrete algorithms ( soda ) , pp . \n 43 - 53 , 1990 . \n bill mcquain . \n hashing , slides for class cs 2604 . \n http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs2604/summerii_2005/notes/c10.hashing.pdf thomas h. cormen , charles e. leiserson , ronald l. rivest and clifford stein . \n introduction to algorithms , second edition . the mit press \n hash table \" entry in wikipedia .", "StartTimeOffset": 907639369392, "RequestID": "387b993ad83f9430e497af5a94e7bc2f5be7efd2", "TotalTokens": 1908}

hence , the intrinsic parity @xmath11 is a good quantum number that can be used to enumerate hfb eigenstates . \n another quantum number preserved by hfb - ax is the angular momentum projection @xmath12 on the symmetric axis . \n the boundary conditions are implemented through first- and second - order derivative operators . \n the precision of computations depends on the mesh size , order of b - splines , and the box size . \n those parameters determine the numerical effort involved .    in hfb - ax , \n the diagonalization of the complex hamiltonian matrix takes the bulk of the computing time . \n diagonalization blocks of given @xmath12 and @xmath11 quantum numbers are assigned to computing cores through mpi communications . \n we modified the lapack diagonalization routine zgeev to calculate only the selected eigenvectors . for calculations of a heavy nucleus with the mesh size of 0.6 fm , 10-th order b - splines , and a box size of 24 fm , \n the rank of hamilton matrix is @xmath13=4608 . to take the advantage of multi - core architectures , we use the threaded lapack library , which can speed up the diagonalization by a factor of 3 with 6 threads , as shown in fig . \n [ threads](a ) . for the matrix multiplication problem in fig . \n [ threads](b ) , the routine zgemm scales perfectly . for other matrix operations , we use openmp for parallel calculations . \n the modified broyden method is used to accelerate the iteration convergence  @xcite . \n the hybrid mpi and openmp programming have made hfb - ax an accurate and fast hfb solver for large box calculations . \n besides the threaded library on cray machines , one can also utilize the threaded amd s acml library or the threaded intel mkl library . in the near future \n , the multi - core+gpu cray xt6 machine is expected , and the corresponding magma library  @xcite can further improve the capability of hfb - ax . \n the precision of hfb - ax has been demonstrated in calculations of weakly - bound nuclei in which the coupling to scattering continuum is essential  @xcite . \n in large - box calculations , very dense quasi - particle spectrum is obtained , and the non - resonant continuum contribution can be precisely taken into account by means of the direct integration @xcite . \n furthermore , hfb - ax is expected to provide precise solutions for the continuum qrpa description of excited states by means of the recently developed finite - amplitude method @xcite . \n the recent success of hfb - ax is the prediction of rapidly oscillating pairing potential in highly elongated traps @xcite by using the slda  @xcite and aslda  @xcite energy density functionals for polarized fermi gases . \n the software madness - hfb @xcite is a fast @xmath14 method based on the multiresolution analysis and low separation rank methods of representing and approximating functions and operators for solving schrdinger and lippman - schwinger equations up to user - determined precision @xmath15 . \n madness is an acronym for multiresolution adaptive numerical environment for scientific simulations @xcite . \n the application of multiresolution analysis separates the behavior of functions and operators at different length scales in a functional way . \n interesting mathematical and computational feature in our madness library implementation is that each of the operators and wave functions has its own adaptive structure of refinement to achieve and guarantee the desired accuracy . \n the representation of functions and operators in madness is based on an adaptive pseudo - spectral representations of functions and operators using the discontinuous alpert s multiwavelets @xcite and the low - separation rank representations and applications of green s functions . \n alpert s multiwavelets have compact support . for representing functions in 3d \n , we use tensor products of 1d multiwavelets . \n the two - scale relations provides for an adaptive approximation of the expansion in terms of multiwavelet basis as a function of accuracy in terms of the regularity of the solutions . \n the support of the bases functions in each level resembles that of structure adaptive refinement . \n a schematic figure of such a refinement process is shown in fig .  [ multi ] .     a schematic picture illustrating the two - scale generated refinement process of a multi - resolution representation of a function in 2d with 3-levels . \n ]    using two - scale relations , the multiwavelet basis provides a way of constructing an adaptive pseudo - spectral method . \n the multiwavelet basis is a local basis of degree @xmath16 defined on the interval @xmath17 generated from scaling functions which are defined by shifted , rescaled and orthonormalized legendre polynomials from degree 0 to @xmath18 from @xmath19 with a value of 0 defined outside of @xmath17 . \n the subspace , of @xmath20 , spanned by scaling functions of degree @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-th legendre polynomial on @xmath19 . for each level @xmath24 \n , we further define an ascending sequence of the subspaces @xmath25 . \n specifically , @xmath26 ; the multiwavelets basis , denoted by @xmath27 , is the orthogonal complement of @xmath28 in @xmath29 . for each level @xmath24 \n , we can further construct @xmath30 in the same way of shifting and rescaling the basis functions of @xmath27 as in @xmath31 to construct @xmath32 . \n thus ,    @xmath33    the notable features of the multiwavelet bases are that at each level the support of the basis functions are of width @xmath34 , and that there is an exact algebraic relationship between the basis functions at level @xmath24 and level @xmath35 . \n in particular , the coefficients of a representation of a smooth function in the multiwavelet basis decays proportionally to the width of the interval at level @xmath24 . \n thus , we can estimate the accuracy of the representation and truncate coefficients below a specified threshold for a sparse representation .    in 3d , we use a tensor product basis generated from the 1d multiwavelet basis ; the representation of operators uses a non - standard approximation or a low separation rank approximation based on gaussians . \n the structure of the support of a function resembles that of an oct - tree . \n each node of the oct - tree consists of a tensor of coefficients . \n the truncation of the sparse coefficients produce a pruned tree . \n the oct - tree is distributed across the nodes of a massively parallel computer referenced by a global hash - table for each node of the tree . \n the singular integral operators are represented using a low - separation rank approximation of the green s functions @xcite with details described in @xcite . \n the madness library uses a combined mpi and pthread parallel computing method in a task based computing model with a task graph scheduling and queue on each node . on each node of a parallel multicore computer \n , one core is devoted to processing internode communication via mpi , and one core is devoted to handling thread scheduling and task allocation and queue scheduling within the node . \n the code is polymorphic with the use of c++ templates . \n each operation on functions and the application of operators are defined in terms of tasks to be performed on the nodes or tensors of the `` oct - trees '' in the representation the functions or operators . \n in addition , a data path and flow path dependency analysis is performed to determine when different steps of the code can be overlapped and scheduled in each node s task queue so that distributed multi - threading computation can be performed . \n furthermore , since different functions and operations have different data and work - loads , a user directed dynamic load - balancing of data memory can be performed to permit more efficient data and work load distribution .    the solution methodology for the madness - hfb consists of two main steps : ( i ) diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix using wave functions expanded in the multiwavelet bases in 3d , and ( ii ) computation of each of the wave functions using the associated lippman - schwinger equation . \n recall that the green s function for the operator @xmath36 is @xmath37 , the yukawa potential . \n the solving procedure is similar to that for solving hartree - fock problems  @xcite . in short , \n the solution algorithm is :    * obtain a set of guess wave - function @xmath38 in the multiwavelet basis . * \n iterate until convergence : * * compute and diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix @xmath39 to obtain the latest orthogonal wave functions ; * * compute densities , properties and gradients ; * * compute the approximation of the yukawa potential for each eigenvalue @xmath40 ; * * solve the lippman - schwinger equation by convolving with the green s function based on yukawa potential , @xmath41 . * compute observables . \n we carried out benchmark calculations with hfb - ax and madness - hfb for 100 ultra - cold fermionic atoms in elongated traps . \n the cold fermions at the unitary limit can be described by the superfluid density functional slda  @xcite . \n the single - particle hamiltonian of slda can be written as : @xmath42 where the deformed external trap potential is : @xmath43.\\ ] ] the densities of spin - up ( @xmath44 ) and spin - down ( @xmath45 ) atoms , the pairing densities @xmath46 , and pairing gaps @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of the hfb two - component eigenvectors ( [ hfbm ] ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the regularized pairing strength . in eq . \n ( [ dens ] ) , @xmath50^{-1}$ ] and the temperature is @xmath51=0.01 . the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in eq.([slda ] ) are taken as 1.14 , @xmath550.553 and @xmath551/0.0906 , respectively @xcite . \n we work in trap units for which @xmath56 . \n the trap aspect ratio @xmath57 in ( [ vtrap ] ) denotes the trap elongation . in experiments , \n the adopted optical trap is highly elongated with @xmath57 up to 50  @xcite . \n the highly elongated trap is interesting because it provides a connection to quasi one - dimensional systems . in madness - hfb \n , we employed very large boxes : @xmath58[-100 , 100 ] for @xmath59 and [ -160 , 160 ] for @xmath60 . in hfb - ax , \n the 2d box sizes are 10.5@xmath6135 ( @xmath59 ) and 9.1@xmath6170 ( @xmath60 ) . \n the potential depth @xmath62 is 12 and 10 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . \n pairing densities @xmath63 calculated by madness - hfb and hfb - ax for 100 polarized atoms in an elongated trap with @xmath59 ( left ) and @xmath60 ( right).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure  [ compare ] displays the calculated pairing densities @xmath63 for ultra - cold fermi gas with polarization of 0.2 . \n the energy cutoff is taken as 6.75 and 5.05 for @xmath59 and 16 , respectively . \n it is seen that the two solvers agree very well at @xmath57=5 . at @xmath60 \n , there appears a very small difference between hfb solutions ; this may be an indication that an even larger box is needed in hfb - ax . \n it is to be noted that at @xmath60 there appear coexisting solutions which are close in energy @xcite . \n figure  [ 3dview ] shows the 3d pairing density distribution computed by madness - hfb for very elongated system with @xmath60 . \n the characteristic transversal oscillations of the pairing field are indicative of the larkin - ovchinnikov phase @xcite .     pairing density @xmath64 , calculated by madness - hfb for the elongated trap with @xmath60 . \n the box scale in view is @xmath65[-12 , 12 ] , @xmath66[-12 , 12 ] and @xmath67[-32 , 32 ] . \n , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in general , the computational effort of 3d hfb calculations is significantly greater than in the 2d case . \n thus , the adaptive representation using multiwavelet techniques and parallel computing are crucial for the success of madness - hfb . \n to put things in perspective , madness - hfb takes about 5 minutes per iteration on 5000 cores for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , while hfb - ax takes about 10 minutes per iteration for @xmath59 on 400 cores and 25 minutes for @xmath60 on 800 cores . from this trend , \n we conclude that the parallel performance of madness - hfb is superior to hfb - ax in large - box calculations . \n the coordinate - space hfb solvers hfb - ax and madness - hfb have been developed for large - box calculations of superfluid fermi systems . \n the 2d solver hfb - ax has been adapted to the multi - core supercomputers by using a hybrid mpi and openmp programming model . \n the 3d solver madness - hfb is based on multi - resolution multiwavelet techniques and more sophisticated hybrid mpi and pthreads based task parallelism programming methodologies . \n a scaling benchmark test for 100 ultracold fermions in elongated traps has been carried out . \n developments are underway to efficiently use the next generation of multi - core+gpu architectures for more demanding nuclear problems . \n this work was supported in part by the u.s . \n department of energy under contract nos . \n de - fg02 - 96er40963 ( university of tennessee ) and de - fc02 - 09er41583 ( unedf scidac collaboration ) . \n it is also partially sponsored by the office of advanced scientific computing research ;

{"ContextTokens": 2487, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "massive ( @xmath2 ) stars are the progenitors of most of supernovae ( sne ) . the explosion of a massive star results in the origin of an extended ( tens of parsecs ) diffuse supernova remnant ( snr ) and a compact stellar remnant . in most cases \n the stellar remnant is a neutron star ( ns ) . \n therefore most of snrs should be associated with nss . \n a ns could be located within the confine of the associated snr or beyond it , depending on the kick velocity received by the star , the age of the system and some other factors ( see below ) . \n however , only a small fraction of known snrs was found to be associated with nss . \n moreover , it is believed that some of proposed ns / snr associations are the result of geometrical projection . \n thus , the obvious lack of associations should be explained or filled up . \n the latter seems to be more attractive and fruitful in view of the recent splash of discoveries of nss in snrs . \n the reliability of ns / snr associations is usually assessed with help of several criteria ( see e.g. kaspi 1996 ) . \n some of them are trivial , i.e. should be fulfilled for any association . \n other criteria are based on the use of the standard sedov - taylor model of snrs and therefore are over - simplified . \n the application of these criteria can lead to rejection of genuine associations ( gvaramadze 2000 , 2002a , b ; bock & gvaramadze 2002 ) . \n the point is that the massive stars strongly modify their environs by virtue of their winds and ionizing emission , and it is the subsequent interaction of sn blast waves with their processed ambient medium that results in the observed snrs ( e.g. shull et al . \n 1985 ; ciotti & dercole 1989 ; chevalier & liang 1989 ) . \n it is clear that the presence of circumstellar and interstellar structures could strongly affect the standard sequence and duration of evolutionary stages of the sn blast wave ( e.g. woltjer 1972 ) . \n for example , the sedov - taylor stage could be absent at all if the sn exploded within the wind - blown cavity surrounded by a massive shell ( e.g. franco et al . \n another important point is the proper motion of massive stars , which causes them to explode far from the geometrical centres of their cavities and makes the cavities and other circumstellar and interstellar structures non - spherically - symmetrical . \n the natural consequence of an off - centred cavity sn explosion is that the sn blast centre does not coincide with the geometrical centre of the future snr . \n taking into account these considerations allows us to enlarge the circle of possible ns / snr associations and to explain the morphological peculiarities of snrs ( gvaramadze 2000 , 2002a , b ; bock & gvaramadze 2002 ; gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ) . on the other hand \n , the better understanding of origin of peculiar snrs helps to infer the  true \" sn explosion sites in these remnants , and therefore to search for new nss associated with them ( gvaramadze 2002b ; gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2002 , 2003 ; see also sect.4 ) .    to illustrate the significance of the concept of off - centred cavity sn explosion \n we show how this concept could be used to preclude the anti - humane decapitating the duck ( g5.4@xmath01.2 @xmath1 g5.27@xmath00.9 ) and dismembering the swan ( cygnus loop , g74.0@xmath08.5 ) recently attempted , respectively , by thorsett , brisken , & goss ( 2002 ) and uyaniker et al . \n ( 2002 ) , and to search for a ns associated with the snr rcw86 ( msh14 - 6_3 _ , g315.4@xmath02.30 ) . \n the association between the pulsar b1757@xmath024 and the snr g5.4@xmath01.2 was for a long time one of a few most reliable ns / snr associations . \n however , recently this association was questioned by thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) , who suggested that psr b1757@xmath024 and the compact nebula g5.27@xmath00.9 behind it ( the  head \" of the  duck \" ) are unrelated to the snr g5.4@xmath01.2 ( the  body \" of the  duck \" ) . to justify the decapitating the duck , thorsett et al . used a set of standard criteria for evaluating the reliability of ns / snr associations ( e.g. kaspi 1996 ) , which include the agreement of distance and age estimates for pulsar and snr , the consistence of the implied pulsar transverse velocity ( i.e. the velocity inferred by the displacement of the pulsar from the geometrical centre of the snr ) with the measured ( e.g. proper motion ) velocity , and the correct orientation of the vector of pulsar transverse motion . \n we agree with thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) that the estimates of the distance to the pulsar and the snr are not inconsistent and therefore will concentrate on the rest three criteria .    two main arguments against the association put forward by thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) are based on their interferometric proper motion measurements of psr b1757@xmath024 [ an upper limit on the westward motion of the pulsar , @xmath3 \n @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the distance to the snr in units of 4.5 kpc ) was found to be an order of magnitude less than the implied transverse velocity ] and the  incorrect \" orientation of the pulsar proper motion ( a cometary - shaped nebula behind the pulsar does not point back to the geometrical centre of g5.4@xmath01.2 ) . both  inconsistencies \" , however , could be removed if the snr g5.4@xmath01.2 is the result of off - centred cavity sn explosion . \n we suggest that : a ) psr b1757@xmath024 was born near the northwest edge of a wind - blown cavity ; b ) the cavity was surrounded by a massive ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the sn ejecta ) wind - driven shell ( see also gvaramadze 2000 , 2002b ) . \n the first suggestion implies that : _ i _ ) the  true \" transverse velocity of the pulsar is much smaller than the implied one ; _ ii _ ) the tail behind the pulsar has a correct orientation . \n the second suggestion implies that : _ i _ ) \n the sn blast wave was drastically decelerated by the interaction with the wind - driven shell , so that the pulsar ( moving in the westward direction at the velocity @xmath10 ) was able to overrun the resulting snr ; _ ii _ ) the current radius of the snr is about the same as the radius of the wind - driven shell . \n the proper motion measurements by thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) provide an estimate of the kinematic age of the system : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance travelled by the pulsar from its birthplace . for @xmath13 pc \n ( gvaramadze , in preparation ) , one has @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the characteristic age of the pulsar . \n the  true \" pulsar age , however , could be equal to @xmath16 if the spin - down rate of the pulsar is mainly due to the interaction between the pulsar s magnetosphere and the dense ambient medium ( see gvaramadze 2001 and references therein ) , or if the pulsar braking index is @xmath17 ( cf . gaensler & frail 2000 ) . \n recent polarized intensity image of the cygnus loop obtained by uyaniker et al . \n ( 2002 ) revealed a prominent shell - like structure encompassing the  break - out \" region in the south of this snr . \n uyaniker et al . \n advocated the widely accepted point of view on the origin of snrs consisting of two overlapping shells and suggested that the cygnus loop is actually two individual snrs interacting with each other . \n an alternative possibility is that the snrs of this type are due to off - centred cavity sn explosions ( dubner et al . \n 1994 , gvaramadze 2002b ) . \n we suggest that the snr cygnus loop is the result of sn explosion near the south edge of a cavity blown up by the sn progenitor during the main - sequence phase ( cf . \n gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ; see also sect.4 ) . \n this implies that the conventional shell of the cygnus loop corresponds to the former cavity re - energized by the sn blast wave , while the south shell is created by the interaction of the sn blast wave with the unperturbed interstellar medium . \n accordingly , we expect that only one stellar remnant is associated with both shells . \n uyaniker et al . \n ( 2002 ) discussed eight reasons for considering the cygnus loop as two colliding snrs . \n we note however that these reasons could also be considered as indications of the off - centred cavity sn explosion . \n for example , we believe that the presence of a ns candidate ( miyata et al . 2001 ) near the centre of the south shell is a strong argument in support of our suggestion . \n note also that the absence of centrally peaked x - ray emission in the south shell implies that the sn progenitor exploded after the red supergiant phase of its evolution ( cf . \n gvaramadze 2002b ) , i.e. the initial mass of the progenitor was @xmath18 . \n rcw86 is a bright shell - like snr with a peculiar protrusion in the southwest encompassing a prominent hemispherical optical nebula . \n we believe that rcw86 is the result of a cavity sn explosion of a moving massive star , which after the main - sequence phase has evolved through the red supergiant phase , and then experienced a short  blue loop \" ( gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ; cf . \n gvaramadze 2002b ) . during the main - sequence phase \n the stellar wind blows up a large - scale cavity , while the motion of the star causes it to cross the cavity and start to interact directly with the interstellar medium . \n we suggest that the sn exploded inside a  hollow \" bow shock - like circumstellar structure ( created by the post - main - sequence winds ) adjacent to the main - sequence cavity . \n this suggestion implies that the optical arc in the southwest of rcw86 is the remainder of the pre - existing circumstellar structure and that the stellar remnant associated with the snr should be in the centre of the arc .    motivated by these considerations we searched for a stellar remnant in the southwest protrusion of rcw86 using the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ archival data . \n the unprecedented high angular resolution of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ allows us to detect a ns candidate just in the  proper \" place ( see gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2002 , 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 927034294668, "RequestID": "b3e34eb3cfd7a47fb276cd8d79aa4b004f635ab4", "TotalTokens": 2625}

type accelerator at higher energy . \n the original design of the facility , coupled to developments in superconducting rf technology , makes it feasible to triple the initial design value of cebaf s beam energy to 12  gev in a cost - effective manner \n .    the research program with the 12 gev upgrade will provide breakthroughs in two key areas : ( 1 ) mapping gluonic excitations of mesons and understanding the origin of quark confinement and ( 2 ) searches for physics beyond the standard model . \n the upgrade will also provide important advances in two additional areas : ( 3 ) a direct exploration of the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon and ( 4 ) the physics of nuclei to understand the qcd basis for the nucleon - nucleon force and how nucleons and mesons arise as an approximation to the underlying quark - gluon structure . \n an overview of the upgrade research program is given in its conceptual design report@xcite . \n lattice qcd calculations@xcite have convincingly illustrated the linear quark - quark potential necessary for confinement . \n the quark and anti - quark in a meson are sources of color electric flux , which is trapped in a flux tube connecting the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . however , very little is still known about the direct excitation of that flux tube . \n the observation of such direct manifestations of gluonic degrees of freedom will provide understanding of confinement@xcite . \n the quantum numbers of the flux tube , added to those of a @xmath2 meson , can produce exotic hybrids with unique @xmath3 quantum numbers . \n these excitations can be probed far more effectively with photons than with @xmath4- or k - mesons , because the quark spins are aligned in the virtual vector - meson component of the photon . for a full partial - wave analysis of such excitations \n linearly polarized photons are a requisite . \n the gluex research program will be focused on a definitive measurement of the spectrum of exotic hybrid mesons , expected in a mass range from 1 to 2.5 gev / c@xmath5 . \n one of the more compelling new opportunities with the 12 gev upgrade will be a highly accurate measurement of the weak charge of the electron , via the parity -

weak theory . \n examples of additional pvdis measurements are the value of @xmath8 as @xmath9 , the search for evidence of charge symmetry violation at the partonic level , and the characterization of novel higher - twist effects . \n the pvdis program will require the use of a new large - acceptance spectrometer / detector package , that can in parallel be used for a broad program of exclusive and semi - inclusive reaction processes . \n a main focus of the research program will be the generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) through the study of exclusive processes at large momentum transfer . \n the gpds can be considered as overlap integrals between different components of the hadronic wave function@xcite , governed by the selection of the final state . \n measurements of these gpds will thus make it possible to map out quark and gluon wave functions . \n the orbital angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin can be directly accessed through gpds . \n factorization is an essential ingredient in the extraction of gpds . for deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) \n scaling has been shown to be valid already at 6 gev , but for other processes this has still to be established experimentally . \n , on the right the projected determination of various combinations of polarized valence and sea quark distributions from semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering . ] \n one of the most fundamental properties of the nucleon is the structure of its quark distributions at higher @xmath6-values , where the physics of the valence quarks is cleanly exposed . \n the 12 gev upgrade will for the first time ( by providing the necessary combination of high beam intensity and reach in @xmath10 ) allow to map out the valence quark distributions at large @xmath6 with high precision . \n most dynamical models predict that in the limit where a single valence up or down quark carries all of the momentum of the nucleon ( @xmath9 ) , it will also carry all of the spin polarization . \n recent data from hall a for the first time show a hint of a possible upturn in the neutron polarization asymmetry @xmath11 at an @xmath6-value of @xmath120.6 . \n figure [ highx ] ( left ) shows how @xmath11 can be measured up to @xmath6-values close to 0.8 outside the nucleon resonance region with the 12 gev upgrade . \n there is a similar lack of data on other deep inelastic scattering observables in this region . \n one example is the ratio of down to up quarks in the proton , @xmath8 , whose large-@xmath6 behavior is intimately related to the fact that the proton and neutron are the stable building blocks of nuclei . \n this ratio requires measurement of the structure function of the neutron as well as of the proton . \n information about the neutron has so far been extracted from inclusive deuterium data , where it is difficult to disentangle from nuclear effects at large @xmath6 . \n figure [ doveru ] shows the precision with which this fundamental ratio can be measured with the 12 gev upgrade . the proposed experiment will utilize a novel technique ; detection of the slowly recoiling proton spectator \n will @xmath13 scattering events on a nearly on - shell neutron in a deuteron target . \n an independent measurement of @xmath8 can be made by exploiting the mirror symmetry of @xmath14 = 3 nuclei in simultaneous measurements with @xmath15he and @xmath15h targets . \n both methods are designed to largely eliminate the nuclear corrections , thereby permitting the @xmath16 ratio to be extracted with unprecedented precision .    - and @xmath17-quark momentum distributions , @xmath8 , at large @xmath6 . \n the shaded band represents the uncertainty in existing measurements due to nuclear fermi motion effects . ] \n the precise way in which the spin of the nucleon is distributed among its quark and gluon constituents is one of the most fundamental questions that can be addressed in nonperturbative qcd . \n most of the experiments so far have focused on measuring the total quark and gluon contribution to the nucleon spin in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering . in recent years \n the focus has moved to the investigation of specific aspects of the nucleon spin , such as the flavor asymmetries of sea quark distributions and quark transverse spin ( transversity ) distributions . \n the mapping of the flavor dependence of polarized valence and sea quark distributions and the determination of the quark transversity distributions require semi - inclusive measurements , in which the detected final - state hadron reveals information about the spin , flavor , and charge of the @xmath18 quark participating in the deep - inelastic process . \n the 12 gev upgrade will provide a unique opportunity to perform semi - inclusive measurements with high precision over a wide kinematic range , producing a detailed picture of the spin structure of the nucleon . \n figure [ highx ] ( right ) shows how polarized valence and sea quark distributions can be extracted from semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering by detecting the leading @xmath19 and @xmath20 hadrons .    at 12 gev \n , the details of the nucleon - nucleon force can be probed at distance scales much less than the pion compton wave length , where the effects of two - pion exchange , vector - meson exchange , and quark exchange all compete . although well - constrained phenomenologically by the large body of pp and np elastic scattering data , it is not yet understood under \n what circumstances the effective nuclear force can be described in terms of the exchange of mesons , and when it is more efficient to describe the force in terms of the underlying quark - gluon exchange forces . \n alternatively , the atomic nucleus can be used as a laboratory to study how the underlying qcd non - abelian degrees of freedom manifest themselves . \n the idea is here to strike a quark inside the nucleus with such velocity that one can uniquely witness how hadrons emerge on their path through the nucleus . \n our present sketchy understanding of this process will be vastly improved with the 12-gev program at jlab . \n at present cebaf accelerates electrons to 6 gev by recirculating the beam four times through two superconducting linacs , each producing an energy gain of 600 mev per pass . \n both linac tunnels provide sufficient space to install five additional newly designed cryomodules . \n the new cryomodules will each provide over 100 mv ( compared to the 28 mv from the existing ones ) , by increasing the gradient to 20 mv / m and the number of cavity cells from five to seven . \n this will result in a maximum energy gain per pass of 2.2 gev , providing a maximum beam energy to the existing halls a , b and c of 11 gev . \n the new hall d will be provided with the desired maximum energy of 12 gev by adding a tenth arc and recirculating the beam a fifth time through one linac . \n a total of 90 @xmath21a of cw beam can be provided at the maximum beam energy . \n further modifications required are changing the dipoles in the arcs from c - type to h - type magnets , replacing a large number of power supplies and doubling the capacity of the central helium liquifier . \n the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) in hall b is used for experiments that require the detection of several , loosely correlated particles in the hadronic final state at a limited luminosity . \n the clas12 detector has evolved from clas to meet the basic requirements for the study of the structure of nucleons and nuclei with the cebaf 12 gev upgrade . \n the main features are : 1 ) an operating luminosity of @xmath22 10@xmath23 @xmath24s@xmath25 for hydrogen targets , a ten - fold increase over current clas operating conditions ; 2 ) detection capabilities and particle identification for forward - going high momentum charged and neutral particles ; 3 ) improved hermeticity for the detection of charged particles and photons . \n clas12 makes use of several existing detector components . \n major new components include new superconducting torus coils that cover only the forward - angle range , a new gas erenkov counter for pion identification , additions to the electromagnetic calorimeters , and the central detector . \n the hall c facility has generally been used for experiments which require high luminosity at moderate resolution . \n the core spectrometers are the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) and the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) . \n the hms has a maximum momentum of 7.6 gev / c . at a 12-gev jefferson lab \n , the sos spectrometer will be replaced by a new magnetic spectrometer , the super high momentum spectrometer ( shms ) , powerful enough to analyze charged particles with momenta approaching that of the highest energy beam . charged particles with such high momenta \n are boosted by relativistic kinematics into the forward detection hemisphere . \n therefore , the shms is designed through the use of a small horizontal bend magnet to achieve angles down to 5.5@xmath26 ( and up to 25@xmath26 ) . \n the shms will cover a solid angle up to 5 msr , and boasts a large momentum and target acceptance . \n the magnetic spectrometer pair will be rigidly connected to a central pivot . \n the present base instrumentation in hall a has been used for experiments which require high luminosity and high resolution in momentum and/or angle of at least one of the reaction products . \n the central elements are the two high resolution spectrometers ( hrs ) , to which recently a third spectrometer has been added with a large acceptance ( bigbite ) . \n the beamline into hall a will be upgraded so that the hall will be able to accept the full range of beam energies available for two major purposes . \n the first will be to continue the use of the three existing spectrometers . the second purpose for hall a will be to stage major installation experiments . with a diameter of over 50 m , hall a is the largest experimental hall at jefferson lab and \n can easily accommodate major installations such as the proposed parity - violation setups . \n the gluex experiment will be housed in a new aboveground experimental hall ( hall d ) located at the east end of the cebaf north linac . a collimated beam of linearly polarized photons ( with 40% polarization ) of energy 8.5 to 9 gev , optimum for the production of exotic hybrids in its expected mass range , \n will be produced via coherent bremsstrahlung with 12 gev electrons . \n this requires carefully aligned thin diamond crystal radiators . \n the scattered electron from the bremsstrahlung will be tagged with sufficient precision to determine the photon energy to within 0.1% . \n the gluex detector uses an existing 2.25 t superconducting solenoid that is currently being refurbished . \n an existing 3000-element lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter will be reconfigured to match the downstream aperture of the solenoid . \n inside the full length of the solenoid , a lead and scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter will provide position and energy measurement for photons and tof information for charged particles . \n a simple start counter will surround the 30 cm long liquid hydrogen target . \n this in turn will be surrounded by cylindrical straw - tube drift - chambers which will fill the region between the target and the cylindrical calorimeter . \n planar drift chambers will be placed inside the solenoid downstream of the target to provide accurate track reconstruction for charged particles going in the forward direction . \n this detector configuration has 4@xmath4 hermeticity and momentum / energy and position information for charged particles and photons produced from incoming 9 gev photons . \n it has been carefully optimized to carry out partial wave analysis of many - particle final states . \n the final planned photon flux is @xmath27 photons / s . at this flux \n the experiment will accumulate in one year of running a factor of 100 more meson data than are presently available even from pion production . \n in april of 2004 the us department of energy ( doe ) signed cd-0 approval for the 12 gev upgrade project , acknowledging the mission need for this project . \n then , in february of 2006 doe approved the preliminary baseline range through the second critical decision . \n two further review processes in increasing level of detail , spaced 12 to 18 months apart , have to be successfully passed before construction funding for the project will be allocated . \n the 12 gev upgrade project is the only large construction project underway at the nuclear physics program office in the doe office of science . at present 11 gev beam to at least one hall and the start of the first experiments \n is expected in 2012 , with full operations in all four halls to commence by late 2014 .    at jefferson lab \n a plan for the next upgrade , involving an electron - ion collider is already being developed . \n initial design studies have yielded a promising concept for up to 150 gev protons colliding with up to 7 gev electrons ( or positrons ) at a luminosity of close to @xmath28 @xmath24s@xmath25 , thus at a center - of - mass energy of up to 65 gev . both electrons or positrons and protons \n would be circulating in two storage rings with four interaction regions at maximum polarization for either beam . \n light ions up to mass @xmath12 40 would also be available .      9 , 2005 , http://www.jlab.org/div_dept + /physics_division / gev / doe_review / cdr_for_science_review.pdf . \n g.s . bali _ \n et al . _ , \n proceedings of int . conf . \n on quark confinement and the hadron spectrum , world scientific , 1995 , p. 225 . \n n. isgur , r. kokoski and j. paton , ; + s. godfrey and j. napolitano , . \n x. ji , ; a. radyushkin , .", "StartTimeOffset": 938703741624, "RequestID": "9b3796ec94a382ad91420cf7a9470c50d53bedf2", "TotalTokens": 3775}
{"ContextTokens": 3117, "GeneratedTokens": 183, "SynthesizedBody": "due to its large center of mass energy the lhc provides an ideal opportunity to test bfkl - driven observables @xcite . among them both central production processes , such as heavy quark production @xcite , forward production of high @xmath0 jets @xcite and drell -

tang ' jets ) . \n this process is special since it allows to probe the non - forward bfkl kernel , unlike the previously mentioned processes restricted to the forward case . from a phenomenological point of view \n the description in terms of the non - forward bfkl green s function is of relevance , since the latter describes a color singlet @xmath2-channel exchange . unlike configurations which merely suppress emissions above a certain veto scale , \n the non - forward bfkl green s function therefore describes a @xmath2-channel exchange with emissions into the gap region intrinsically absent . \n while the non - forward bfkl kernel is currently available at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite , only the virtual nlo corrections to the impact factors @xcite are currently known ; phenomenological studies , see _ \n @xcite , are therefore limited to leading order ( lo ) impact factors . as \n nlo corrections to bfkl observables are often found to be size - able , this limitation to lo impact factors is currently one of the main drawbacks of bfkl phenomenology . a powerful tool to overcome this limitation is given by lipatov s effective action  @xcite . \n it is given in terms of the conventional qcd action to which a new induced term is added . \n the latter contains a new effective degree of freedom , the reggeized gluon , which has been introduced in order to achieve a gauge invariant factorization of qcd amplitudes in the high energy limit . \n the determination of higher order corrections within this effective action is at first plagued by both technical and conceptual difficulties . \n loop corrections show a new type of divergence , which is not present in usual qcd feynman diagrams . supplementing the qcd action with the additional induced term leads to an apparent over - counting problem . \n these problems have been addressed and resolved recently , first in the context of lo transition kernels  @xcite and later on in the calculation of nlo corrections to the forward quark -

cone singularity @xmath15 . \n as discussed in  @xcite this pole should be treated as a cauchy principal value . \n the starting point for the determination of the quark induced mueller - tang jet impact factors is given by the quark - quark scattering amplitude with color singlet exchange . in the high energy limit such a scattering amplitude factorizes ( in terms of a transverse convolution integral ) into the two reggeized gluon exchange in the color singlet ( which can be understood as the lowest order contribution to the perturbative pomeron ) and two impact factors ( which describe the coupling of the two reggeized gluon state to the external quarks ) , see fig . \n [ fig : mt ] .        due to high energy factorization , the longitudinal part of the loop integral _ \n i.e. _ the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) integration , can be entirely associated with the upper ( lower ) impact factor . at cross -

{"ContextTokens": 2754, "GeneratedTokens": 155, "SynthesizedBody": "gravitational microlensing can be used to detect extra - solar planets orbiting distant stars @xcite with relatively large photometric signals as long as the angular planetary einstein ring radius is not much smaller than the angular size of the source star @xcite . for giant source stars in the galactic bulge , however , the signals of earth - mass planets are largely washed out by their large angular size , but galactic bulge main sequence stars are small enough to allow the detection of planets with masses as low as @xmath2 .    this fact has led to suggestions that ground - based microlensing surveys might be able to measure the abundance of earth - like planets @xcite . however , the initial estimates of the sensitivity of such a survey neglected the blending of main sequence source stars in the bulge that is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig - image ] . \n the brightness of the source stars was over - estimated , and it was not realized that the actual source stars were blended with several other stars of similar brightness in ground - based images . \n more realistic estimates of the sensitivity of the proposed ground - based extra - solar planet searches indicated very poor sensitivity to terrestrial planets @xcite , and suggested that only a space - based survey @xcite could discover a significant number of earth - like planets .    in this paper \n , we simulate the most capable ground - based microlensing survey that could reasonably be attempted : a network of three 2-m class wide field - of - view telescopes spanning the globe in the southern hemisphere that are dedicated to the microlensing planet search survey for four years . \n many of the details of our simulations have been described in @xcite , but there are additional details that must be added to describe the observing conditions at ground - based observatories . \n i assume that the microlensing survey telescopes are located at the best existing observatory sites in chile ( paranal ) , south africa ( sutherland ) , and australia ( siding springs ) . for paranal , actual seeing and cloud cover records are available from the eso web site . \n the sutherland site in south africa has conditions similar to la silla in chile ( peter martinez , private communication ) , so the eso records for la silla ( offset by 1 year ) were used as a proxy for sutherland . \n standard airmass and wavelength correction formulae @xcite were used to convert the eso seeing data to seeing estimates for bulge observations in the i - band , and the sky brightness was calculated following @xcite .    for the observations from australia , \n the 1997 - 1999 seeing records from the macho project have been used since the mt . \n stromlo observatory and siding springs have very similar seeing . to compensate for the optical effects of the macho telescope , 0.8 \n was subtracted in quadrature from all the macho telescope seeing values . \n the number of clear nights was adjusted slightly to meet the long term averages for each site as listed in @xcite . \n an important input to this simulation is the systematic crowded field photometry errors that are assigned . \n the ogle - iii ews data @xcite provides a set of photometry for stars with brightness varying in a predictable way ( due to microlensing ) using the most accurate crowded field photometry method devised to date @xcite . by fitting to point - source , \n single - lens light curves to the 2002 ogle - iii ews data for stars brighter than @xmath3 , we find an assumed systematic error of 0.7% of the total flux at the psf peak of each star seems to give fit @xmath4 . \n the systematic errors appear to be larger for fainter stars or for other data sets , but i adopt this as a systematic error estimation formula . \n this systematic error implies a limit to the useful size of a microlensing planet search survey telescope . \n once the systematic error dominates , it is no longer useful to go to a larger telescope . \n our simulation results yield an optimal telescope aperture of about 2-m with a 6 sq . \n deg .  field - of - view ( fov ) . \n larger telescopes could detect some more planets by cycling between two or more fields , but the gain is not large because of the rapid decrease in the microlensing rate away from the central galactic bulge . \n [ fig - bad - lc1 ] shows an example of two light curves that would be considered planet detections by the criteria of @xcite for a space - based survey ( a @xmath5 improvement for the planetary lensing model over the best single lens model ) . \n but the uneven data quality due to seeing variations and cloud cover imply that the planetary parameters can not be constrained . \n thus , while the planetary signal is detectable for these events , terrestrial planets can not be discovered with data like this . \n the situation is only slightly better for the events shown in fig . \n [ fig - bad - lc2 ] , where the poor seeing in australia , and low s / n of the planetary deviation conspire to prevent determinations of the planetary masses . \n of course , sometimes a planetary signal will be seen during good observing conditions , yielding light curves that can accurately determine the planetary parameters . \n this is the case for the two events shown in fig . \n [ fig - good - lc ] . \n generally , such events have planetary deviations that occur at high magnification , such as the event on the left or have large amplitude deviations like the event on the right . \n intermediate between the poorly covered planetary detections shown in figs . \n [ fig - bad - lc1][fig - bad - lc2 ] and the well covered planetary discoveries shown in figs . \n [ fig - good - lc ] are the light curves shown in fig .  [ fig - fair - lc ] . in both cases , \n the planetary parameters can be formally determined . \n however for the event on the left , the source star brightness is only @xmath6 . \n if the photometry errors are not random , as is likely for systematic errors , then the brightness of the source star can not be determined from the light curve fit . \n hence , the planetary parameters will be poorly constrained . for the light curve on the right \n , the parameters can be determined despite the relatively poor coverage of the deviation because the deviation shape contains redundant information . \n however , the poor light curve coverage means that the redundancy can not be used to confirm the interpretation of the event . \n this is a serious drawback because the planet discovery can not be confirmed in any other way . \n it is clear from figs . \n [ fig - bad - lc1]-[fig - good - lc ] it is sensible to consider two different categories of detected planetary events : `` detected '' planets and `` discovered '' planets . \n the `` detected '' category includes all planets with planetary signals that provide at least a @xmath7 improvement over the best single lens fit . \n clearly , the events shown in fig .  [ fig - good - lc ] should be in the `` discovered '' while those shown in figs . \n [ fig - bad - lc1 ] and [ fig - bad - lc2 ] should not be in this category . \n we define the planet `` discovered '' category with the following criteria . \n each planetary light curve deviation is split up into 1 - 3 separate deviation regions of positive or negative magnification with respect to the single lens curve with the same parameters . \n the first and last regions are considered be begin and end when the deviation reaches the with 10% of the maximum planetary deviation or 0.3% of single lens magnification . for a planet `` discovery '' , each the observations must cover at least 40% of each planetary deviation region , and at least 60% of each total deviation . \n all measurements are considered to contribute the light curve coverage unless their error estimates are larger than one third of the maximum planetary deviation . \n also , because a significant component of the error estimates is a systematic error , we also require that each  discovery \" light curve have at least one measurement that detected the stellar microlensing event by @xmath8 and one measurement that detects the planetary deviation by @xmath9 . with these definitions , about one third of the detected planets \n pass the planet discovery threshold including both the events in fig . \n [ fig - good - lc ] and the light curve on the left side of fig . \n [ fig - fair - lc ] . \n [ fig - det_sep ] compares the sensitivity of a 3-site network of 2m - class ground - based microlensing planet search telescopes vs.  a space - based microlensing planet search telescope that would be appropriate for nasa s discovery program @xcite . at present \n , the cost cap for a discovery mission is $ 360 m , and the ground - based network that i have simulated would be roughly one fifth that cost , including all software development and operational expenses . \n the ground - based survey does the best at separations of 23 au where the planet is near the einstein ring and is detectable in high magnification events . \n the ground - based survey would have about 30 times fewer planet discoveries and 10 times fewer raw detections of terrestrial planets at these separations . at 1 au \n , the advantage of space for planet discoveries is a factor of 100 . \n the number of planet detections as a function of planetary mass fraction are shown in fig . \n [ fig - det_eps ] for planets in earth - like orbits and planets in all orbits . \n the left hand panel indicates that even if earth - like planets in earth - like orbits are quite abundant , the 3-site ground - based survey would only expect to find one with good light curve coverage . \n the ground - based results in fig .  [ fig - det_eps ] are somewhat misleading for @xmath10 because these events can generally be detected with giant source stars , which have not been included in this simulation . \n these would add significantly to the ground - based detections , but would add little to the space - based detections . \n so , for planets with mass fractions about ten times that of the earth , the ground - based survey may have an advantage . \n i have carried out detailed simulations of the most capable ground - based microlensing terrestrial planet search program that could plausibly be attempted . \n the simulated survey employs three 2 m class telescopes spanning the globe in the southern hemisphere which observe the galactic bulge whenever possible for a period of 4 years . \n such a network is about 100 times less sensitive than a space - based survey which might only cost 5 times as much . \n so , without some dramatic improvement in ground - based crowded field photometry , it will not be possible to conduct a microlensing survey to determine the abundance of terrestrial planets in the inner galaxy .    for a gravitational census of terrestrial planets \n , a space - based survey will be required @xcite . as fig . \n [ fig - n_vs_sep ] indicates , such a mission would complete the survey for terrestrial planets that will be started by the kepler mission @xcite which is sensitive to earth - like planets at separations @xmath11au using the transit method . \n a space - based microlensing survey would overlap kepler with sensitivity at @xmath12au , and extend sensitivity to terrestrial planets to all separations including free - floating planets , which may have been ejected from their parent stars during the planetary formation process . \n alard , c. , & lupton , r. h. , 1998 , , 503 , 325 albrow , m. d. , et  al . \n 2001 , , 556 , l113 alcock , c. , et al .  2000 , , 541 , 734 ; ( e ) 557 , 1035 bennett , d. p. , & rhie , s. h. , 1996 , , 472 , 660 bennett , d.  p.  & rhie , s.  h. , 2002 , , 574 , 985 bennett , d.  p. , et  al . \n 2003 , spie , 4854 , 141 borucki , w. j. , et  al . \n 2003 , spie , 4854 , 129 gould , a. , & loeb , a. 1992 , , 396 , 104 krisciunas , c. , & schaefer , b. 1991 , , 103 , 1033 mao , s.  & paczyski , b.  1991 , , 374 , l37 peale , s. j. 2003 , , 126 , 1595 sackett , p. d. , 1997 , astro - ph/9709269 tytler , d. 1996 , in  a road map for the exploration of neighboring planetary systems ( exnps ) , \" jpl report , chap . 7 . \n udalski , a. , 2003 , acta astronomica , 53 , 291 walker , g.  1987 ,  astronomical observations \" , cambridge university press .", "StartTimeOffset": 960213159420, "RequestID": "f8f2bae019f67a5bcb84bb38a1a2da2df2c0d4e3", "TotalTokens": 2909}

{"ContextTokens": 1993, "GeneratedTokens": 135, "SynthesizedBody": "the formation of colour - electric flux tubes provides an intuitive physical picture for permanent confinement of quarks within hadrons . \n moreover , this picture seems to be realized within qcd , as has widely been observed in lattice simulations . \n the mechanism leading to flux tube formation , however , is still subject to analytical and numerical investigations . \n the shortcoming of the corresponding lattice calculations , however , is the fact that regarding sufficiently long flux tubes , i.  e.  large lattice sizes , becomes a numerically very difficult task . a simpler gauge theory which also exhibits confinement is @xmath0 \n ; it can be used as a prototype for investigating the formation of flux tubes . \n furthermore , it was realized many years ago @xcite that one can perform a duality transformation of the path integral in compact abelian gauge theories . in this way a new partition function is obtained which can be regarded as a limit of the dual non - compact abelian higgs model @xcite . \n besides this fact , the dually transformed theory can be used as a very efficient tool for the calculation of expectation values in the presence of external charges @xcite . \n the numerical advantages of such dual flux tube simulations also hold for the more general case of dual higgs models .    in this \n talk we review the results obtained in dually transformed @xmath0 lattice gauge theory and present some first calculations in the dual abelian higgs model . \n we will focus on one of the key questions within the dual superconductor picture , namely whether the confinement vacuum corresponds to a type - i or a type - ii superconductor , and we will investigate the role of quantum fluctuations of the dual degrees of freedom . \n the expectation value of a physical observable like the electric field or the magnetic current in the presence of external sources ( represented by polyakov loops ) can be rewritten as averaging over the dual degrees of freedom , as has been shown in previous work @xcite . \n the dual representation of the polyakov loops can be interpreted as a dual dirac sheet connecting the electric charges . \n this dual formulation opens the possibility for very accurate numerical calculations for several reasons : contrary to standard lattice simulations , the confinement phase is the weakly coupled one in the dual theory , therefore there are less quantum fluctuations . even more important is the fact that it is not necessary to project the charge \n anticharge state out of the vacuum : on a lattice of same size charge pairs with arbitrary distance can be simulated with equal accuracy , and increasing the time extent of the loops ( i.  e.  of the lattice ) does not influence the quality of the result , either . \n further advantages are the implementation of doubly charged flux tubes @xcite by double dirac strings which also yields results of equal accuracy , and the extension to periodically closed flux tubes . \n these `` torelons '' are free of end effects and allow for a more reliable calculation of pure flux tube properties like the string tension . \n an interesting physical task is the testing of the validity of a dual london equation for @xmath0 flux tubes @xcite . in the dual formulation \n we were able to investigate rather long flux tube lengths up to 20 lattice spacings . \n our results @xcite showed that the agreement between the @xmath0 data and the predictions of a classical model of maxwell and london equations are very good for small charge distances , but there is absolutely no agreement at large distances ( @xmath1 lattice spacings ) . \n a possible interpretation within the dual superconductor picture is that the confining @xmath0 behaves as an effective type - i superconductor , rather than an extreme type - ii as an exact validity of the dual london equation would suggest . \n in fact we got support for this conjecture also from a completely independent investigation : simulating doubly charged flux tubes . \n we found @xcite that in four - dimensional @xmath0 there is an attractive interaction between flux tubes for the coupling @xmath2 approaching the phase transition . \n thus one might look at @xmath0 lattice gauge theory from two points of view : from a `` microscopical '' it can be regarded as a double limit of a dual higgs model with both vanishing london penetration length and vanishing coherence length . from a `` macroscopical '' point of view it looks like a classical dual type - i superconductor . \n this peculiarity is related to the fluctuations in the dual theory : the observed attraction between flux tubes was shown to be a purely `` quantum - mechanical '' effect of the dually transformed @xmath0 theory @xcite . \n the action of the full abelian higgs model including a dual dirac string ( denoted with @xmath3 ) can be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dual gauge field and @xmath6 the dual higgs field , located on the sites of the dual lattice . \n @xmath7 is the symmetry - breaking higgs potential with its minimum at @xmath8 . for the squared covariant derivative of the higgs \n current the compact formulation has been chosen , because this allows for fluctuations of the fluxoid string @xcite . in the classical model @xmath9 \n is the squared london penetration depth , and @xmath10 the squared coherence length . \n the double limit @xmath11 , @xmath12 exactly corresponds to the dually transformed @xmath0 theory discussed in the last section . \n if we compare this model to the parameters of dual qcd @xcite after an abelian ansatz , we find the correspondence @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( chromo-)magnetic coupling , @xmath15 the location of the minimum and @xmath16 the strength of the corresponding continuum higgs potential , and @xmath17 is the lattice spacing . \n these parameters can be chosen to reproduce very well the infrared behaviour of qcd . \n the classical flux tube solutions of the higgs model on sufficiently fine lattices give very good agreement with corresponding continuum calculations @xcite . \n it is now an interesting question how quantum and string fluctuations ( of the fluxoid string ) do effect the physical quantities , e.  g.  the string tension . \n for the set of parameters which yields the desired classical solution , the system is not in the higgs phase any more on a reasonably fine lattice , if fluctuations are turned on . \n for this reason we introduce a `` quantum scale '' @xmath18 , by substituting @xmath19 in the path integral by @xmath20 , which allows for a smooth interpolation between the classical limit ( @xmath21 ) and an ordinary simulation ( @xmath22 ) . \n the changing of the string tension as a function of @xmath18 is depicted in fig . \n [ sigma_n ] for two cases : considering only quantum fluctuations but keeping the physical fluxoid string fixed , and also considering string fluctuations , which leads to an increase of the energy per length ( until the system undergoes a phase transition to the coulomb phase ) . \n ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 40,160)(0,0)@xmath23    physical arguments suggest that the dual superconductor should be approximately at the borderline between type - i and type - ii . \n this is fulfilled for the chosen classical solution . \n investigating the influence of fluctuations on an effective landau - ginzburg parameter ( defined by the ratio of the individual contributions to the string tension ) showed us that the system is pushed towards type - i behaviour by fluctuations . \n by dual simulations of flux tubes one can address a lot of interesting questions concerning the confinement mechanism . \n here we focussed on the discussion whether the confinement vacuum is a dual type - i or type - ii superconductor , and on the meaning of fluctuations in dual theories . \n similarly to the behaviour of @xmath0 in the vicinity of the phase transition , these fluctuations can produce an effective type - i superconductor also in the full abelian higgs model .    of course \n , it is another interesting question , which set of ( bare ) parameters has to be used to describe the same physics as with the classical solution of the abelian higgs model . \n for this task , however , it will be necessary to improve the control over string fluctuations in our simulations . \n this work was supported by the fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung , project no . \n p12495-tph .    1 cm t.  banks , r.  myerson , j.  kogut ,  129 ( 1977 ) 493 . \n j.  frhlich , p.  a.  marchetti , _ europhys . \n _ 2 ( 1986 ) 933 . \n m.  zach , m.  faber , p.  skala ,  57 ( 1998 ) 123 . \n m.  zach , m.  faber , p.  skala ,  ( 1998 ) , in press , + 9709017 . \n v.  singh , r.  w.  haymaker , d.  a.  browne ,  47 ( 1993 ) 1715 . for \n a review see e.g. m.  baker , j.  s.  ball , f.  zachariasen ,  41 + ( 1990 ) 2612 . \n m.  baker , n.  brambilla , h.  g.  dosch , a.  vairo ,  58 ( 1998 ) + 034010 .", "StartTimeOffset": 973099520946, "RequestID": "1239b4006d4e30b6658a809f22cc42f80342decd", "TotalTokens": 2128}
{"ContextTokens": 1788, "GeneratedTokens": 204, "SynthesizedBody": "the main title of this paper is , apart from the term multiplex , literally identical to a forney , gallager and co - workers paper issued more than one decade ago [ for et al . \n 84 ] , which analyzed the benefits of coded - modulation techniques . \n the large success achieved by ungerboeck s coded - modulation came from the way of introducing redundancy in the encoder [ ung 82 ] . in classical channel coding , \n redundant signals are appended to information symbols in a way somewhat analogous to time division multiplex tdm ( envelope interleaving ) . \n it was believed that introducing error - control ability would increase bandwidth . \n an efficient way of introducing such an ability without sacrificing rate nor requiring more bandwidth consists in adding redundancy by an alphabet expansion . \n this technique is particularly suitable for channel in the narrow - band region . \n a similar reasoning occurs in the multiplex framework where many people nowadays believe that mux must increase bandwidth requirements . \n +   + one of the most powerful tools in communications is the fourier transform , specially its discrete version dft . on the other side , \n applications of finite field have a renewed explosion of interest in the last decades . \n a discrete fourier transform for finite fields ( ffft ) was introduced by pollard [ pol 71 ] . \n it has successfully applied to perform discrete convolution and as a tool of image processing [ ree et al . \n 77 , ree -

fourier transforms [ bla 79 ] , finite field hartley transform ght [ cam et al . \n 98 ] defined on a gaussian integer set gi(@xmath0 ) contains some redundancy and only the cyclotomic coset leaders of transform coefficients are needed to be transmitted . \n this yields a new * efficient - bandwidth code division multiplex for band - limited channels*. these mux may present lower bandwidth requirements than tdm by using an argument somewhat analogous to coded - modulation . \n tradeoffs between extension of the alphabet and bandwidth are exploited in the sequel . \n +   + in the present work , the coded - modulation idea is adapted to multiplex : information streaming from users are not combined by interleaving ( like tdm ) but rather by signal alphabet expansion . \n the mux of users sources over a galois field gf(@xmath1 ) deals with an expanded signal set having symbols from an extension field gf(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2 . as a consequence , \n the multiplex of @xmath3 band limited channels of identical maximal frequency @xmath4 leads to _ bandwidth requirements less than @xmath5 _ , in contrast with tdmed or fdmed signals . \n +   + the design of such an _ efficient bandwidth mux _ is based upon the finite field structure , specifically , it consists of applying finite - field fourier transforms ( ffft ) . \n this paper shows that the bandwidth compactness factor relatively to tdm depends on the length @xmath6 , the alphabet extension . \n +   + another point to mention is that the superiority of digital mux regarding analogic mux is essentially due to the low complexity of tdm . \n the majority of today multiplex systems follows plesiocrhonous ( pdh ) or synchronous ( sdh ) hierarchy . besides presenting higher spectral efficiency ( bits / s / hz ) than classical mux \n , the new cdm schemes here introduced are based on fast transforms so they also seem to be attractive from the implementation viewpoint . \n although most mux systems today be intended to optical fiber which are not yet bandlimited channels , multiplex has also been adopted on satellite channels . \n probably applications of such multiplex will be on transponders and specially on cellular communications . \n cable television ( catv ) can also have benefit by using such a technique . \n digital multiplex normally alludes time division multiplex ( tdm ) . \n however , it also can be achieved by coding division multiplex ( cdm ) . \n the cdm has recently been focus of interest , specially after the is-154 standardization of the cdma system for cellular telephone . in this section \n we introduce a new class of mux schemes based upon finite - field transforms which can be implemented by fast transform algorithms . \n _ classical multiplex increases simultaneously the transmission rate and the bandwidth by the same factor _ , keeping thus the spectral efficiency unchanged . in order to achieve ( slight ) better spectral efficiencies , \n classical cdma uses waveforms presenting a non zero but residual correlation . \n +   + given a signal @xmath7 over a finite field gf(@xmath1 ) we deal with the galois domain considering the spectrum @xmath8 over an extension field gf(@xmath0 ) which corresponds to the finite field transform ( galois transform ) [ bla 79 , cam et al . \n +   + as an alternative and attractive implementation , the multiplex is carried out by a finite field transform ( ffft / ffht ) and the demux corresponds exactly to a inverse finite -

{"ContextTokens": 4027, "GeneratedTokens": 280, "SynthesizedBody": "an important prediction of quantum theory is the existence of irreducible fluctuations of electromagnetic fields even in vacuum , that is in the thermodynamical equilibrium state with a zero temperature . \n these fluctuations have a number of observable consequences in microscopic physics for example in atomic physics the van der waals force between atoms in vacuum . \n vacuum fluctuations also have observable mechanical effects in macroscopic physics and the archetype of these effects is the casimir force between two mirrors at rest in vacuum . \n this force was predicted by h. casimir in 1948 @xcite who considered two plane parallel perfect reflectors as shwon in figure [ casimir ]    and found an interaction energy @xmath0 depending only on geometrical parameters , the mirrors distance @xmath1 and surface @xmath2 , and two fundamental constants , the speed of light @xmath3 and planck constant @xmath4 @xmath5the signs have been chosen to fit the thermodynamical convention with the minus sign of the energy @xmath0 corresponding to a binding energy . \n the casimir energy for perfect mirrors is usually obtained by summing the zero - point energies @xmath6 of the cavity eigenmodes , substracting the result for finite and infinite separation , and extracting the regular expression ( [ ecas ] ) by inserting a formal high - energy cutoff and using the euler - mclaurin formula @xcite . \n the casimir force was soon observed in different experiments which confirmed its existence @xcite . \n recent experiments have reached a good precision , in the % range , which makes possible an accurate comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental observations @xcite . \n casimir considered an ideal configuration with two perfectly reflecting mirrors in vacuum . \n but the experiments are performed with real reflectors , for example metallic mirrors which have a perfect reflection only at frequencies below a plasma frequency @xmath7 or alternatively for mirror separations much larger than the plasma wavelength @xmath8 characetristic for the metal . \n accounting for this imperfect reflection and its frequency dependence is thus essential for obtaining a reliable theoretical expectation of the casimir force in a real situation . \n the consideration of real mirrors is important not only for the analysis of experiments but also from a conceptual point of view . \n real mirrors are certainly transparent at the limit of high frequencies and this allows one to dispose of the divergences associated with the infiniteness of vacuum energy . \n this point was already alluded to in casimir s papers and an important step in this direction was the lifshitz theory of the casimir force between two dielectric bulks @xcite . \n however this idea was fully implemented in theoretical derivations after a quite long period .    in the limit of small separations \n @xmath9 , the casimir effect has another interpretation establishing a bridge between quantum field theory of vacuum fluctuations and condensed matter theory of forces between two metallic bulks . \n it can indeed be understood as resulting from the coulomb interaction between surface plasmons , that is the collective electron excitations propagating on the interface between each bulk and the intracavity vacuum @xcite . \n the corresponding field modes are evanescent waves and have an imaginary longitudinal wavevector . at short distances , surface plasmon modes \n are known to dominate the interaction and the casimir energy reduces to @xcite @xmath10    surface plasmons play an important role in many fields of physics . \n let us only mention as recent examples the surface plasmon assisted enhancement of the transmission of light through metallic structures @xcite or in the context of biomolecular physics , the importance of plasmon fluctuations of a 2-dimensional wigner - like crystal where they can generate an attractive component to the dispersion forces between parallel surfaces @xcite .    here , we derive and expand in more detail the results previously given in ref .

infinitely large plane mirrors at zero temperature so that the only modification of the casimir formula ( [ ecas ] ) is due to the metals finite conductivity . \n this modification is calculated by

wavevector associated with the mode . \n @xmath18 are the reflection amplitudes here supposed to be the same for the two mirrors .    imperfectly reflecting mirrors \n will be described by scattering amplitudes which depend on the frequency , wavevector and polarization while obeying general properties of stability , high - frequency transparency and causality . \n the two mirrors form a fabry - perot cavity with the consequences well - known in classical or quantum optics  : the energy density of the intracavity field is increased for the resonant frequency components whereas it is decreased for the non resonant ones . \n the casimir force is but the result of the balance between the radiation pressure of the resonant and non resonant modes which push the mirrors respectively towards the outer and inner sides of the cavity @xcite . \n this balance includes not only the contributions of ordinary waves propagating freely outside the cavity but also that of evanescent waves . \n these two sectors of ordinary and evanescent waves are directly connected by analyticity properties of the scattering amplitudes . \n expression ( [ ereal ] ) holds for dissipative mirrors as well as for non dissipative ones @xcite . \n it tends towards the ideal casimir formula ( [ ecas ] ) as soon as the mirrors are nearly perfect for the modes contributing to the integral . \n the reduction of the casimir energy ( [ ereal ] ) with respect to the ideal formula ( [ ecas ] ) due to the imperfect reflection of mirrors is described by a factor @xmath19 this factor plays an important role in the discussion of the most precise recent experiments . \n we now recalculate the casimir energy as a sum over the cavity modes using the plasma model for the mirrors dielectric function . \n @xmath20

expression in terms of surface plasmon resonances ( [ shortapprox ] ) .    the ensemble of modes appearing in eqn . \n ( [ diff ] ) can be separated into two different ensembles . \n the tm

adopt an adiabatic mode definition , where we follow it continuously from the evanescent into the propagative sector and attribute the whole mode to the surface plasmon modes , which we call `` plasmonic modes '' @xcite . \n this denomination is chosen in order to avoid confusion with the ( common ) definition of surface plasmon modes which defines them as evanescent modes only and cuts the @xmath28 mode into two pieces . \n plasmonic modes are thus the cavity modes living in the evanescent sector at least for some particular value of their parameters . in the same line of reasoning \n we call all propagative modes minus the propagative part of the @xmath28 mode `` photonic '' modes . \n photonic modes are the cavity modes propagating for all cavity length . in the limit @xmath30 ,

and in the constant . \n this particular structure can be traced back to the properties of the plasmonic modes . \n the positive @xmath15-value domain coincides with the evanescent sector while the negative one describes the propagative sector . \n while the plasmonic mode @xmath29 and the surface plasmon frequency for a single mirror @xmath54 are totally contained in the evanescent sector , the plasmonic mode @xmath28 lives in both sectors . therefore @xmath55 and @xmath56 describing the properties of @xmath29 and @xmath54 \n are contained only in the first integral while @xmath53 has to be

intermediate and large distances . \n this result is based on an adiabatic definition of the surface plasmon modes , where we follow the @xmath28 mode even when it crosses the barrier @xmath64 and becomes propagative . \n let us now compare this result to the common definition of surface plasmon modes which includes only evanescent waves and cuts the @xmath28 mode at @xmath64 as for example done by bordag recently @xcite . \n this leads to @xmath65-\\omega_{0}[k]\\right)dk-\\frac{180}{\\pi^{3}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}k\\left(\\omega_{-}[k]-\\omega_{0}[k]\\right)dk\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is

. \n shows the short distance asymptotic behavior of the total casimir energy given in as it was reported in @xcite . \n it does not change its sign and , in agreement with @xcite , at long distances goes as @xmath71 with this definition we therefore naturally find the result that the contribution of the evanescent modes to the casimir energy is always attractive and reproduces well the short distance behavior of the casimir energy . \n as a concluding remark we would like to stress that , no matter how we attribute the propagative part of the @xmath28 mode , whether to the surface plasmon modes in an adiabatic definition ( plasmonic modes ) or to the propagating modes , the influence of surface plasmons is very important at all distances . \n the casimir energy is the detailed balance of two very large contributions of opposite sign which nearly cancel each other , but not quite , the difference being a small casimir energy , much smaller than each of both contributions \n .    it might be interesting to investigate if a change in the photon - plasmon coupling could somehow influence this detailed balance and therefore the value or even the sign of the casimir force . \n a different coupling could be obtained by using for example nanostructured surfaces . \n for such an analysis the adiabatic mode definition should be well suited , because for a different coupling the mode will change _ as a whole _ and in following continuously the mode one could trace back the changes introduced through the structured surface .", "StartTimeOffset": 986663986608, "RequestID":

ray emission using hubble space telescope and rosat hri images . \n the velocities they find in the brightest x - ray regions would produce plasma at temperatures an order of magnitude higher than observed , assuming that the ejecta was colliding with a stationary ism . of course \n ,  should be surrounded by a wind blown bubble out to much larger radii than 0.3  pc ( the radius of the x - ray nebula ) , and the material inside the bubble should be streaming outward . \n it seems likely that the observed shock temperature reflects the velocity at which the x - ray emitting ejecta are overtaking the previously emitted stellar wind . \n the temperature range @xmath13 implies a shock velocity range of @xmath15 . if the x - ray emitting ejecta date from the great eruption of 1843 , then the rough expansion velocity for a free expansion is @xmath16 , so the velocity of the stellar wind before the great eruption was @xmath17 . \n the n / o ratio observed in the ejecta has implications for the evolution of . \n it is clearly a signature of cno processing , and the degree of conversion of oxygen to nitrogen observed in the ejecta is high . \n all massive main - sequence stars burn hydrogen on the cno cycle . \n its nucleosynthetic signatures are the conversion of most of the catalytic carbon and oxygen to nitrogen , and the burning of h into he . for cno \n processed material to be observed on the surface of these stars , or in their ejecta , it must be transported there from the core . \n previous measurements of n / o in  give similar but generally less constraining results than our rgs measurements . \n optical and uv spectroscopy of the s condensation ( corresponding spatially roughly to the brightest x - ray knot @xcite ) shows that most cno is nitrogen and that the helium mass fraction is @xmath18 @xcite . \n a quantitative measurement of the cno abundance ratios is not made because of their dependence on ionization and thermal structure , and also because some oxygen and carbon may be in solid grains . \n it should be noted that the measured value of the helium mass fraction may be systematically too low if the ionization balance of helium was not properly modelled . \n more recent measurements of the abundances in the s condensation have been made by @xcite with hst - fos . \n they report cno and he abundances for the s2 and s3 `` sub - condensations '' , respectively , of @xmath19}>1.72,1.75 $ ] , @xmath20}>1.95,1.85 $ ] , and @xmath21 . \n they did detect weak oxygen and carbon lines , but treated them as upper limits due to potential contamination from the foreground region . \n however , they also find that preliminary analysis of the s1 and s4 sub - condensation spectra show much lower n and he enrichment , with correspondingly lower n / o and n / c ratios . \n previous x - ray observations @xcite have shown the presence of a strong ly  @xmath5 feature in the spectrum , but the ccd spectra lacked the resolution to strongly constrain the and features . \n our measurement of n / o is not limited by the spectral resolution of rgs , but rather by source / background contamination , and the observed line strength is not influenced by the formation of dust grains or large uncertainties in the temperature distribution of the plasma . \n recent hst - stis long - slit spectroscopy of the central star have obtained a lower limit of @xmath22 @xcite . \n this is a conservative interpretation of the data ; the lower limit could easily be taken to be an order of magnitude higher . on the other hand , uv spectra taken with hst - ghrs show evidence for moderate carbon depletion which may be inconsistent with the level of depletion found in the ejecta @xcite . in light of recent work indicating that  may be a binary system @xcite , the apparent contradiction in the stellar and nebular abundances is taken to be an indication that the star producing the carbon features is actually the secondary ( assuming the star that produced the nebula is the primary ) . \n @xcite points out that there are several difficulties with this conclusion , the most obvious being the concealment of the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) primary . \n spectroscopic measurements of the abundances of the central star can not invalidate the rgs abundance measurements , but the binary scenario requires us to treat the nebular abundances with some care . \n it is unlikely that both members of a binary system could contribute substantially to the ejecta around , but it is possible , in principle , that the ejecta from the primary could mix with the wind of the secondary . \n if both stars had a high n / o ratio , but substantially different helium abundances , then it would be possible to misinterpret the significance of the nebular abundances . however , this is not a likely scenario , so we make the simplest assumption , which is that the observed nebular abundances reflect the current surface abundances of the primary .    the signatures of cno processing have been observed in various types of hot stars , including obn stars , blue supergiants , and lbvs @xcite . \n however , cno processed material is not observed on the surface of all hot stars , and the amount of processed material observed spans a wide range . the fact that n / o is so high in the ejecta of  is strongly constraining , regardless of the mechanism responsible for mixing . \n the two most plausible mechanisms which could have resulted in the measured abundances in the ejecta of  are : 1 . ) \n is on the main sequence and is rotating . \n this rotation has caused very thorough mixing . \n 2 . )  is in a post - red - supergiant blue supergiant phase , and the cno abundance ratios are a result of the onset of convection in the envelope during the red supergiant phase . \n we refer in particular to the discussion in @xcite , which deals with the same question in the case of other lbv nebulae . \n we can use the measured n / o ratio in conjunction with the he abundance of @xcite to assess the plausibility of these two mechanisms .    using figure 3 of @xcite for the case of an @xmath23 star with @xmath24 \n , we find that for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 . \n this simply reflects the fact that although a high surface ratio of n / o can be obtained in the red supergiant phase , this can only happen if the star lost enough of its envelope on the main sequence to allow core processed material to dominate the resulting composition . \n this value of y is not consistent with the @xcite measurement of @xmath28 , although a conservative assessment of the possible errors , particularly in measuring the helium mass fraction , does not allow us to rule out that  could be a post - red - supergiant object . \n @xcite make predictions for the abundances of rotating massive stars . \n their @xmath24 model with an initial rotation velocity of @xmath29 and a mass of @xmath30 predicts @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the end of h - burning . while this value of y is also not consistent with the observed value , in this case y \n will clearly be lower earlier in the life of the star , whereas if the mixing is efficient enough , n / o will already be high enough to be consistent with the measured lower limit . \n this is an important point ; the conversion of oxygen to nitrogen in cno burning is considerably slower than the conversion of carbon to nitrogen . \n if rotational mixing is responsible for the observed abundances , the mixing timescale must be short compared to the evolutionary timescale . as pointed out in @xcite , the ratio of the mixing timescale to the main sequence lifetime in rapidly rotating stars is indeed expected to decrease with increasing mass . \n we have analyzed xmm - newton x - ray spectra of . \n the epic spectral data from the star are consistent with past observations by _ asca _ and _ chandra_. the data are not consistent with an isothermal plasma , but require at least two temperatures . \n the rgs spectra show that the nebula is nonisothermal and has strongly non - solar cno abundances . \n the temperature range in the nebula is @xmath33 . \n if this is interpreted as a shock velocity , it corresponds to @xmath34 . \n we find a lower limit of @xmath35 , which is indicative of very thorough mixing in the envelope of . \n taken with previous measurements of the surface helium abundance @xmath28 , this implies that  is a main - sequence object with some strong mixing mechanism at work , although it does not decisively rule out the possibility that it is a post - red - supergiant object . \n we acknowledge useful comments from the anonymous referee , which substantially improved the quality of this paper . \n mal thanks j. r. peterson for useful conversations and for the development of features relevant to this analysis for the rgs monte carlo . \n the columbia university group is funded by nasa . \n dufour , r. j. , glover , t. w. , hester , j. j. , currie , d. g. , van orsow , d. , & walter , d. k. 1997 , asp conf . \n 120 , luminous blue variables : massive stars in transition , ed . \n a. nota & h. j. g. l. m. lamers , p. 255", "StartTimeOffset": 995884716432, "RequestID": "ff307855739c04430adf3f44f360f032b8d2bf86", "TotalTokens": 3940}
{"ContextTokens": 1805, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "when observing a nearby elliptical or bulge of a spiral galaxy , there are two distinct characteristics in the galaxy s surface brightness . \n the first is the most obvious : the galaxy is brightest in the center and grows fainter with increasing radius . \n the second characteristic is only apparent in good seeing conditions : the surface brightness is clumpy on the scale of the seeing disk . these clumps , which can be a few percent of the mean surface brightness for the nearest galaxies like m  31 and m  32 , arise from poisson statistical fluctuations in the number of stars per seeing disk . \n historically , this effect was known as `` incipient resolution . '' in the modern context , they are called surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) . \n tonry & schneider ( 1988 ) devised a technique to quantify sbfs and to use them as a distance indicator for undisturbed early - type galaxies . specifically , they proposed using the ratio of the 2@xmath2 moment of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) to the 1@xmath3 moment as a standard candle : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of stars of type @xmath6 with a luminosity of @xmath7 . \n @xmath8 has units of luminosity and is expressed in astronomer s units as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the absolute and apparent sbf magnitude , respectively . \n since @xmath9 is an intrinsic property of the lf , sbfs can be useful for studying the stellar populations of early - type galaxies . \n the potential parameter space to explore is very large , since the `` age '' and `` metallicity '' of the stars can be a complex combination of formation epoch and subsequent history ( e.g. , kaufmann , in this volume ) . \n sbfs provide data _ unique _ from the integrated light / spectra of these galaxies . because of their @xmath11 dependence , sbfs are very sensitive probes of the most luminous stars , the cool red giant stars ( figure  1 ) . \n modeling these stars interior structure and emergent spectra is very challenging . \n also , since bright rgb and agb stars evolve quickly , only a handful of each are present in any star cluster in the milky way or magellanic clouds . \n therefore , sbf measurements , which arise from the stellar population of entire galaxies , provide one of the best observational tests of our current understanding of these stars . \n recent observational and theoretical advances make now a ripe time to revisit and expand sbf stellar population studies . \n past modeling ( tonry et al .  1990 ; buzzoni 1993 ; worthey 1993 ) used the previous generation of evolutionary tracks ( vandenberg or revised yale isochrones ) based on older stellar opacities . the optical sbf dataset has been expanded and improved considerably ( tonry et al . \n 1997 ) , and a growing body of ir data has widened the spectral coverage . \n figure  2 presents @xmath12-band sbf data for fornax cluster ellipticals from liu et al . \n ( 1999b ) and jensen et al . \n ( 1998 ) . \n fornax is appealing since it is close enough to have a cepheid distance measured with hst ( silbermann et al . \n 1999 ) and is compact on the sky , implying the galaxies basically lie at the same distance . \n predictions from bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) single - burst models are overplotted ; these use padova evolutionary tracks , stellar spectra of lejeune et al.(1997 ) , and a semi - empirical agb prescription ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ) . \n ( see bruzual , in this volume . ) \n the good agreement between data and models means the lifetimes , luminosities , and colors of the bright rgb and agb stars are roughly correct , or else multiple errors are cancelling each other out ( e.g. , charlot et al . \n 1996 ) . \n the bc98 models agree worse with the @xmath13-band empirical sbf calibration ( tonry et al . \n 1997 ) than with the @xmath12-band data , which has lead us to revise the most evolved stars in the models ( liu et al . \n this illustrates the usefulness of sbf tests . \n although the models agree reasonably well with integrated colors of elliptical galaxies and local group globular clusters , it is the sbf comparison which reveals possible weaknesses in the modeling of the most luminous stars . \n in old populations , @xmath9 is expected to be very metal - dependent , since it strongly tracks the rgb and agb , whose colors are governed by metallicity ( frogel et al . \n 1983 ) . therefore , sbf data are potentially very useful in characterizing the stellar content of ellipticals . \n broad - band colors are degenerate in age and metallicity , with changes of @xmath14 preserving the color ( worthey 1994 [ w94 ] ; worthey , this volume ) . \n absorption line indices can be more age- or metal - sensitive , e.g. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are age - sensitive ( @xmath17 ) and mg@xmath18 and c@xmath184668 are metal - sensitive ( @xmath19 ) . in comparison , \n ir sbf magnitudes are predicted by the bc98 and w94 models to have in old populations . \n this suggests ir sbf data combined with balmer absorption indices could effectively disentangle age and metallicity effects in ellipticals . \n developing accurate models is critical for measuring distances to galaxies from sbfs . \n optical / ir sbf distances can be measured to @xmath20  km / s and therefore to obtain @xmath21 , but accurate distances rely on accurate @xmath12-corrections to account for the redshifting of the galaxy spectrum . \n moreover , models can guide us to better observations . \n for instance , @xmath13-band sbf distances use the @xmath22 integrated galaxy color to account for stellar population variations from galaxy to galaxy ( tonry et al . \n both the bc98 and w94 models suggest that @xmath23 or @xmath24 colors , which are more metallicity - driven , would lead to a better correction , reducing the scatter by @xmath2550% . \n the wider spectral ranges of these colors also lead to greater tolerance of errors in photometry or reddening than @xmath22 . \n finally , accurate models could provide a purely theoretical calibration for sbf distances , independent of any cepheid calibration . \n buzzoni , a. 1993 , , 275 , 433 bruzual , g. & charlot , s. 1998 , in preparation ( bc98 ) charlot , s. & bruzual , c. 1991 , , 367 , 126 charlot , s. , worthey , g. , & bressan , a. 1996 , , 457 , 625 frogel , j. a. , cohen , j. g. , & persson , s. e. 1983 , , 275 , 773 jensen , j. b. , tonry , j. l. , & luppino , g. a.  1998 , , 505 , 111 lejeune , th . , \n cuisinier , f. , & buser , r.  1997 , , 125 , 229 liu , m. c. , charlot , s. , & graham , j. r. 1999a , in preparation liu , m. c. , graham , j. r. , & charlot , s. 1999b , in preparation silbermann , n. a. et al .  1999 , , 515 , 1 tonry , j. l. & schneider , p. 1988 \n , , 96 , 807 tonry , j. l. , ajhar , e. a. , & luppino , g.  1990 , , 100 , 1416 tonry , j. l. , blakeslee , j. p. , ajhar , e. a. , & dressler , a.  1997 , 475 , 399 worthey , g. 1993 , , 409 , 530 ;

{"ContextTokens": 2451, "GeneratedTokens": 218, "SynthesizedBody": "almost all properties of a material are given by its electronic structure . \n for metallic materials , the most important characteristic of the electronic structure is the fermi surface , namely the boundary between occupied and unoccupied states in momentum space . \n the traditional experimental method for studying the fermi surface is the de haas - van alphen effect , which is limited to low temperatures , and therefore can not be utilized for the study of certain paramagnetic materials , for example cr , since the nel temperature of cr is @xmath5k @xcite . \n for this reason , numerous acar investigations , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite have been performed on paramagnetic cr . \n studying the fermiology of the paramagnetic phase of cr would allow to gain insight to the driving mechanism of the anti - ferromagnetic ordering of cr below @xmath5k , since a nesting feature of the fermi surface gives a possible explanation . \n however , several 2d - acar investigations performed in the paramagnetic @xcite phase of cr revealed significant discrepancies between the measured and the calculated two - photon - momentum distribution , which can not be explained in terms of an unexpected topology of the fermi surface . these discrepancies are most probably due to @xmath6-@xmath7-correlations and/or many - body effects not accounted for by theory . \n recently , an experimental approach to this problem , the utilisation of a state - dependent enhancement has been presented in@xcite . with this method the enhancement is directly obtained by fitting the contribution of the individual bands to the data . \n this way , the fermi surface nesting vector was deduced via the computation of the static susceptibility from the fitted lmto calculations . in our study \n we focussed on the differences in the fermi surface topology between paramagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic cr . \n therefore , 2d - acar measurements at different temperatures have been performed . \n the 2d - acar spectrometer consists of two main components , the source - sample chamber including the sample environment , and the detector assembly consisting of two anger - type gamma cameras , which were obtained from the positron group of bristol university . \n the anger cameras are positioned symmetrically at a distance of @xmath8 m to the source - sample chamber . \n the munich 2d - acar spectrometer features two interchangeable sample holders , with an available temperature range between @xmath3k and @xmath2k , both of which were used for this study . \n the details of the munich 2d - acar spectrometer and the performance characteristics can be found in @xcite . \n + for this study , four 2d - acar measurements have been conducted , each with the integration direction chosen along [ 100 ] . \n two measurements were performed with the coolable sample holder in the anti - ferromagnetic phase of cr , one at @xmath3k with a total of @xmath9 counts and the other one at room temperature with a total of @xmath10 counts . \n two additional measurements were performed with the heatable sample holder , one at room temperature , in order to ensure reproducibility , with a total of @xmath11 counts and the other one at @xmath4k with a total of @xmath12 counts . before each of the two measurement campaigns the orientation of the cr crystal was checked by means of laue diffractometry and aligned to @xmath13 . before the sample was mounted the surface was etched with concentrated hydrochloric acid in order to remove the oxide layer from the surface . \n the crystal was cut by means of spark erosion , therefore it is assumed that the crystal is defect free . \n positron lifetime measurements are underway to investigate the defect concentration . + the recorded acar spectra were corrected for the momentum sampling function and then folded back to * k*-space following the lcw - procedure@xcite . \n this way features in the projection of the momentum distribution attributed to the fermi surface are enhanced and easier to identify . \n the lcw - folded data were corrected for background contributions and scaled from @xmath14@xmath15 so that the dynamic range is identical for all three measurements as well as for theoretical calculations : @xmath14 represents unoccupied states while @xmath16 represents the occupied states . \n + in addition , first principle band structure calculations have been performed for paramagnetic cr using the munich spr - kkr - package @xcite and the expected two - photon momentum distribution was deduced . for the calculations \n the independent particle model was applied , therefore @xmath6@xmath7correlation effects are not included in the theoretical data . \n lcw distribution for cr [ 100 ] at @xmath4k . slightly above the nel temperature for cr of @xmath5k . ] \n lcw distribution for cr [ 100 ] at @xmath4k . slightly above the nel temperature for cr of @xmath5k . ]    cut through the lcw -

folded projections along @xmath17-n-@xmath17 ( p@xmath18p@xmath19 ) for the paramagnetic and the anti - ferromagnetic phase . \n the initial lcw - projections were normalized to the same amount of counts . ] \n two of the four measurements were performed at room temperature in order to check if the acar spectra are consistent before and after the change of the sample holder . since both spectra are compatible within the statistical limits only the spectrum with the higher statistics \n is presented here ( see figure [ fig : room ] ) . \n the comparison of the low temperature measurement and the room temperature measurement shows the effect of decreasing resolution with increasing temperature . \n however , besides the lower resolution in the room temperature measurement both spectra are comparable , therefore only one is shown . \n + the features at the n - points appear to be occupied in the anti - ferromagnetic phase ( high symmetry points of the brillouin zones of both phases , _ simple cubic _ for the anti - ferromagnetic phase and _ bcc _ for the paramagnetic phase are indicated in figures 15 ) . \n this picture changes when the sample temperature is increased above the nel temperature ( see figure [ fig:318 ] ) . \n a small difference in temperature drives the sample into the paramagnetic state and yields a drastic change in the lcw - folded data . \n the n - hole pockets become more pronounced , which can be seen comparing cuts along @xmath17-n-@xmath17 for both phases ( see figure [ fig : cut1 ] ) . furthermore \n , the electron pocket structure at the x - points connecting the n - points is smaller than in the anti - ferromagnetic phase . \n generally , the agreement of our measurement with previous 2d - acar measurements ( see ref.@xcite ) on paramagnetic cr is considerable . \n however , the discrepancies between our data and the sprkkr calculations are quite substantial . \n this has also been reported from different laboratories @xcite . \n the relative intensities in the calculation for the occupied and the unoccupied states can not be reproduced in the lcw - folded data ( see figure [ fig : rech ] ) . \n the experimental resolution of our spectrometer lies between @xmath20mrad and @xmath21mrad @xcite , which is only slightly less than the extent of the n - point features in our data . \n however , the changes in the lcw - folded data when the sample is driven over the magnetic phase transition can not be attributed to resolution effects , since a temperature increase of @xmath22k results in a degradation of the overall resolution of less than @xmath23mrad . \n + during data analysis the lcw - folding was applied to the isotropic data , which was obtained by azimuthal averaging of the original data . \n the isotropic data does not contain the full information on the fermi surface topology . with the isotropic data alone features at the x - point , similar to those described above , can be produced by the lcw - folding , as can be seen in figure [ fig : cut ] . \n + a possible explanation would be that the positron annihilation with a high lying flat band close to the fermi energy is strongly enhanced . \n also it has to be considered the application of the lcw - theorem is only valid if the positron wave function can be characterized as a plane wave , which is not true if strong correlation effects are present , like it is the case for cr @xcite . \n + to summarize , we were able to reproduce the results from previous measurements@xcite we also could show , that the 2d - acar spectrum is drastically different in the anti - ferromagnetic and in the paramagnetic phase . however , the interpretation of our data with respect to the calculation remains an unsolved challenge . \n cut through the lcw - folded data along @xmath24 ( p@xmath25 ) in comparison with the same cut for a lcw - folding of the isotropic data . \n the position of high symmetry points is indicated . ] \n for the interpretation of the 2d - acar data of cr a solid understanding of the enhancement is needed . \n we plan on recording multiple 2d - acar projections of cr in the paramagnetic phase in order to perform a full 3d reconstruction of the momentum density , respective measurements are under way . this way \n , we hope to get a better grasp of the enhancement in cr and with that gain insight to the electronic structure . \n this project is funded by the deutsche forschungsgesellschaft ( dfg ) within the transregional collaborative research center trr 80 `` from electronic correlations to functionality '' . \n 9 steinitz m o 1986 _ j. magn . \n magn . mater . _ \n * 60 * 137 -

play ( cha cha , jive ) also suggests the importance of periodic action on short timescales . indeed charciving is a pretty lively process , as we shall see . \n charciving as a physically meaningful term applies specifically to biochar creation rather than black carbon in general . \n biochar , defined as charcoal ( syn . \n char , black carbon or bc ) produced by thermal decomposition of biomass , is one of nature s long - term carbon warehouses . \n it has been made by nature for some 400 million years , for as long as significant terrestrial vegetation has existed  @xcite . \n the outcome of a charciving process is net removal of carbon from the atmospheric pool and storage in the biochar warehouse . \n thus , on timescales compatible with human responses to climate change , biomass may be charcived but plastics made from petroleum may not , and used tyres are partially charcive - able . \n more importantly in the context of the effects of open vegetation fires on global carbon pools , charciving processes include prescribed and traditional burning of forests , grasslands , savannas , and in situ crop residues if managed to enhance charring . \n approximate residence times of carbon in burning cycle carbon reservoirs are given in the following table : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + crucial to fire ecology , and to the global carbon cycle as a whole , is the competitive nature of these two processes : as figure [ figure1 ] indicates , volatiles are produced at the expense of char and vice versa . \n this reciprocal linkage was originally suggested in @xcite and has been verified by numerous experiments since . \n chemical feedback autocatalyses the charring path , but the heat produced promotes the competing volatilization process . ]    during thermoconversion the instantaneous balance between charring and volatilization is governed by the temperature in the reacting zone . \n the chemical dehydrations that produce desaturated , highly conjugated precursors to char are low activation energy reactions and therefore set in at relatively low temperatures . \n the water vapor produced biases the competition towards , or autocatalyses , the charring path . \n but charring is highly exothermic overall ( @xmath1 = -2000 j / g char ) , because desaturation and crosslinking ensure that more chemical bonds are formed than broken and significant aromatization occurs . \n the consequently hotter reaction zone allows the high activation energy volatilization reactions to kick in and take over  for a short time . \n volatilization is endothermic , with @xmath1 = 540j / g volatiles , and it locally self - damps , thus switching the reaction field again to the charring path . \n it was suggested in @xcite that this competitive process may provide the mechanism for a thermal oscillator , and in @xcite it was shown that the solutions of a physicochemical dynamical model for cellulose thermal decomposition obtained using known rate and thermochemical data have the properties of a relaxation oscillator . \n the model is described in appendix i and an example time series is given in figure [ figure2 ] . \n the temperature ( a ) rises slowly as the charring reactions proceed , as measured by production of water vapor from chemical dehydration of cellulose fragments ( b ) . \n heat accumulates in the reaction zone and the temperature spikes because the rate of reactive heat release exponentially overtakes the rate of linear ( conductive ) heat removal . just before the temperature jump \n , the water concentration is at a maximum and volatiles concentration is at a minimum ( c ) . \n after the jump volatilization begins to cool the system down , the volatiles concentration rises to a maximum causing a temperature collapse , then falls off and the lower temperature charring path takes over again . \n a time series from the dynamical model for cellulose thermal decomposition in @xcite shows classic relaxation oscillations . \n ( a ) temperature t in k ; ( b ) w is the water vapour concentration in the reaction zone , a measure of the extent of charring ; ( c ) v is the concentration of volatiles in the reaction zone . \n w and v are scaled in arbitrary units . ] \n this is the biopy thermokinetic oscillator . \n understanding its properties and mechanism are crucial to understanding bushfires @xcite and to engineering biomass pyrolysis . \n it is related to other well - studied thermokinetic instabilities such as the salnikov and surface reaction thermal oscillators @xcite , but is distinct in that it features reciprocally coupled endothermic and exothermic reactions . \n it is a special case of an endex thermoreactive system @xcite , which is described in appendix ii . \n in fact it is not at all difficult to visualize the biopy oscillator in action , although few people these days have the apparatus for doing so  a domestic slow combustion stove . \n the flames of a wood fire under air control typically flicker , falter , and fluctuate as the charring and volatilization pathways alternately dominate , effectively visualizing the pulses of volatiles released by the spikes in temperature . \n ( if you do not have your own wood stove and spare long winter s evening , try watching in slow motion some of the videos found on youtube by a search such as ` wood fired stove ' . ) in an open fire the biopy oscillator tends to be masked by turbulence , and possibly by local fluctuations in oxygen concentration . \n the flaming combustion path is cartooned in figure [ figure3 ] , where it is indicated that the heat of charring primarily maintains the supply of volatiles from the solid phase substrate and the heat of flaming combustion primarily activates the gas phase combustion of the volatiles . a small fraction of the char is also oxidised during a vegetation fire , as indicated by the dotted arrow . \n this glowing combustion of the char is a surface reaction that usually extinguishes because of surface diffusion limitations and a high activation energy barrier . \n the heat of charring primarily maintains volatilization of the solid phase and the heat of flaming combustion primarily maintains the gas phase combustion of the volatiles . ]    to appreciate the importance of the biopy oscillator mechanism in maintaining biomass combustion , consider a ( not uncommon ) situation where lighting ignites a mass of very damp biomass , cartooned in figure [ figure4 ] . \n the heat of charring and heat of combustion preferentially drive the evaporation of water , an endothermic process requiring 41 kj / mol , because with an activation energy of zero it is kinetically favoured over the high activation energy volatilization and the lower activation energy charring . \n flaming combustion is extinguished for lack of volatile fuel to sustain it , the biopy oscillator ceases to function , and the entire thermoconversion rapidly fizzles out . viewed in this light , extinction of a vegetation fire by pouring water on it is achieved by short - circuiting the biopy oscillator . \n combustion of wet vegetation quickly fizzles out because the enthalpy of vaporization of water short - circuits the biopy oscillator . ] \n thus the biopy oscillator mechanism as illustrated in figure [ figure1 ] acts to maintain vegetation combustion while fuel is available and the effect is to distribute biomass carbon between the black carbon and atmospheric reservoirs . in a chronically wet biomass scenario , where combustion can not be sustained or propagate , refractive char is not formed and nearly 100% of biomass carbon is returned to the atmosphere as co@xmath0 or methane via the short - term decay path , which uses enzyme - catalysed oxidation reactions of low or zero activation energy . \n char accumulates in soils and sediments if its rate of formation exceeds its rate of oxidation . \n how much char is produced globally from wildfire activity per year ? \n what is the rate of char oxidation ? \n it is easy to give a rough estimate for the second question : a typical c@xmath2 activity of charcoal in sediments is around 0.6 that of new wood . \n the half life of c@xmath2 is 5730 years , giving the decay time constant as 0.000245/year . for such sedimentary charcoal , @xmath3 , thus @xmath4 years , and literature estimates \n are of order 1,3004000 years @xcite . \n for the first question , an estimate from a recent analytical review study @xcite for the average annual production of black carbon from wildfires during the 1990s is 2.72 tg per year . \n the carbon content of a typical charcoal is 85% by mass , giving the mass of carbon sequestered in the black carbon reservoir as 2.31 tg / year during the 1990s . \n these rates of bc formation and bc oxidation are plotted in figure [ figure5](a ) . \n when the mass of carbon in the global bc reservoir exceeds @xmath50.95e04gt the rate of bc oxidation exceeds the rate of formation and total bc reserves must decrease . in this case \n bc becomes a source of atmospheric co@xmath0 rather than a sink . \n the rate of bc formation , in tg c atoms / year , determines the critical global mass of c in the black carbon reservoir , c@xmath6 , above which bc becomes a source of atmospheric co@xmath0 . ]    in figure [ figure5](b ) the rate of bc formation is decreased by 20% from ( a ) . in reality \n this could be achieved by suppressing open biomass fires , and/or promoting drier hotter fires , and/or by combustion of the char . \n we see that the critical mass of carbon in the global bc reservoir is significantly lower , @xmath50.75e04gt .    in figure [ figure5](c ) the rate of bc formation \n is increased by 20% from ( a ) . \n this could be achieved by cooler more frequent open vegetation fire regimes and/or industrial biochar production in globally significant quantities . \n the critical mass of carbon in the global bc reservoir above which total bc reserves must decrease is considerably greater , @xmath51.15e04gt . \n this brings us to a third charcive challenge : how much carbon is currently stored in the global black carbon reservoir ? \n the answer to this crucial question will determine whether human intervention to dramatically escalate biochar production is of any use at all as a co@xmath0 sequestration strategy . \n human activity has promoted fire over recent decades , but suppresses fire in the long term . \n there are still large gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge of wildland fire emissions , such as yearly mass fluxes , spatiotemporal variability , and longer - term trends . \n even the open burning of agricultural residues is poorly quantified . \n results of the analytical review study in @xcite suggest a significant increase in emissions from wildfires during the period 19602000 due to forest and peat soil burning . in the amazon basin human activity \n has promoted fire since 1970s @xcite . \n the occurrence of forest fires in southeast asia is believed to have increased greatly since the 1960s and currently prevailing socioeconomic and natural conditions are likely to continue to favour tropical biomass burning in the short term @xcite . yet \n charcoal records show that global biomass burning declined from 1 to @xmath51750 , and abruptly after 1870 , the latter reduction being due to agricultural and pastoral expansion and fire suppression in intensively farmed areas @xcite . \n human - mediated suppression of biomass burning is likely to continue globally . \n the widespread fires that have been used over the past few decades to clear tropical rainforests for the planting of crops and create settled communities with higher standards of living are a transient phenomenon , after which it will be in those communities interests to suppress biomass burning . \n in this work i have argued that wildfires , land management fires , and open burnings of crop residues open the ` hatch ' that pours carbon into the long - term global reservoir of refractory black carbon . \n this is a sink for atmospheric co@xmath0 if the rate of bc production ( or dimension of the hatch ) is greater than the rate of bc decay . \n the hatch mechanism is the biopy thermokinetic oscillator , which is effectively short - circuited when wildfires are suppressed . \n the first charcive challenge asks the question : can we produce and distribute enough biochar to stabilise the earth s climate in the short - term ? \n it is the first challenge because the question was posed first , in response to the virgin earth challenge ( www.virgin.com/subsites /virginearth ) , not because it is the most fundamental problem in the use of biochar to regulate the earth s carbon cycles . \n the second charcive challenge asks whether we have painted ourselves into a corner . \n it asks whether humans need to suppress fire is fundamentally incompatible with nature s use of fire to distribute carbon between long - term black carbon and short - term atmospheric co@xmath0 pools . \n the third charcive challenge is , i think , the most important . \n if we can quantify the amount of black carbon in soils and sediments globally we can assess whether bc is a source or sink of co@xmath0 , then begin to make progress on all the other refinements to our knowledge of carbon flux rates and carbon reservoirs that will be necessary to devise and implement scientifically sound , socioeconomically benign global carbon management . \n the primary thermal decomposition of a cellulose substrate @xmath7 occurs via the competing reactions @xmath8 where @xmath9 repesents the primary volatilization product , mostly levoglucosan , @xmath10 is the char , @xmath11 is the water of charring , @xmath12 is the enthalpy of volatilization , @xmath13 is the enthalpy of charring , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the arrhenius - form rate constants . \n this reaction scheme is incorporated in the following dynamical system : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the volume of the reaction zone , @xmath18 is the concentration of water vapor , @xmath19 is the concentation of volatiles , @xmath20 is the molar flow rate of water vapor into the reaction volume , @xmath21 is the residence time of vapor - phase species in the reaction volume , @xmath22 is the averaged volumetric specific heat of the reacting system , @xmath23 is the rate coefficient of conductive heat transfer from the reaction zone to the environment at temperature @xmath24 . \n it is assumed that volatilization is a ( pseudo ) zero - order process . a mass balance for @xmath7 is not included because in this model @xmath7 is drawn from an infinite pool . \n this is effectively a two - dimensional dynamical system because @xmath9 is determined by @xmath25 , and a linear stability analysis finds that the relaxation oscillations in figure  [ figure2 ] occur where the eigenvalues of the jacobian are a complex conjugate pair with positive real parts . \n an endex thermoreactive system consists of an exothermic ( heat releasing ) reaction that is directly thermally coupled and kinetically matched with an endothermic ( heat absorbing ) reaction @xcite . \n the endex reactor is the ` active ' equivalent of a ` passive ' heat exchanger . in other words \n the endothermic and exothermic reactions ` see ' and respond to each other s thermokinetics in real time . the original context for investigation of endex systems was to achieve intrinsic thermal stability , autothermal operation \n , full recovery of chemical energy , scaleability , and co - production of valuable products in chemical reactor systems , and an endex - configured system has recently been used in a new technology for separating carbon dioxide from flue gas streams @xcite .    however , as is often the case with good ideas , it seems that nature can claim prior art with respect to endex systems . \n the thermal decomposition of cellulose appears to be nature s own endex system , of a special kind in which the competing reactions are intrinsically coupled , that functions to distribute carbon between solid black carbon and atmospheric co@xmath0 reservoirs . \n schultz , a.  heil , j.j . \n hoelzemann , a.  spessa , k.  thonicke , j.g . \n goldammer , a.c . \n held , j.m.c . \n pereira , and m.  van  het bolscher . \n global wildland fire emissions from 1960 to 2000 . , 22:gb2002 , 2008 . \n doi:10.1029/2007gb003031 . \n marlon , p.j . \n bartlein , c.  carcaillet , d.g . \n gavin , s.p . \n harrison , p.e . \n higuera , f.  joos , m.j . \n power , and i.c . \n climate and human influences on global biomass burning over the past two millennia . \n , 1:697702 , 2008 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1022364332070, "RequestID": "b206c2b491482279285a6dd4462d11f1a95628e7", "TotalTokens": 3785}

{"ContextTokens": 3554, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "it is well established , that the statistics of long flexible polymer macromolecules in a good solvent is governed by scaling laws in the asymptotic limit of infinitely long chains . \n the model of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) is regarded as most successful in capturing the universal behaviour of polymer chains @xcite . in particular , for the averaged end - to - end distance and number of configurations of saw with @xmath3 steps one finds : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are universal exponents , that depend on the space dimension @xmath6 only ( for numerical estimates see ref . \n @xcite ) , @xmath7 is a non - universal fugacity . the scaling laws ( 1 ) correspond to the swelling regime of of polymer coils . \n note , that the situation changes , when the temperature of the solution decreases . \n for any generic polymer solvent system one finds a so - called @xmath8-temperature @xcite , at which the solvent mediated attractive and repulsive interactions between the monomers cancel . \n in this situation the scaling properties of the polymer chain can be described by that of a simple random walk ( rw ) . \n then , the scaling laws ( [ sawscaling ] ) hold with exponents @xmath9 . at temperatures below the @xmath8-point , \n the polymer undergoes a collapse transition and passes to a globule regime with a scaling exponent @xmath10 . \n as established by de gennes @xcite , the scaling properties of saws can be studied in the language of field theory , by mapping the @xmath11-symmetrical spin model at its critical point to polymer field theory by a formal @xmath12 limit . in this way , \n the powerful renormalization group ( rg ) methods , which are traditionally used to quantitatively describe the critical behaviour of magnetic systems and to determine the critical exponents , can be applied to polymer solutions . in the frames of the rg , \n the scaling behaviour of the model is determined by the stability and physical accessibility of a corresponding fixed point ( fp ) . for a polymer chain , the crossover from the rw regime to that of \n the saw corresponds to the interchange of stability between the gaussian ( g ) fixed point ( corresponding to absence of interaction between monomers ) and the polymer ( p ) fixed point . \n the scaling of a saw is governed in by exponents ( 1 ) that belong to the @xmath13 universality class . \n these are the most prominent scaling exponents in polymer physics , however , there are more . on the one hand , there is a series of exponents governing the scaling of polymers of complex topology  star polymers and networks @xcite . on the other hand , the scaling laws ( 1 ) may change if e.g. disorder in the system gives rise to a separate stable fp . \n both cases are considered below . \n the present communication aims to attract attention to appearance of new scaling laws related to a constraint on the polymer system in the form of a disordered environment or to a more complex architecture of the polymers . \n in particular , we will be interested in investigating the interplay of different aspects of complexity appearing simultaneously such as the degree of branching of the polymer , its possibly inhomogeneous composition and the type of disorder in the environment . \n we derive and calculate the scaling exponents for the corresponding universality classes and discuss the relevant observable phenomena . \n the outline of this paper is as follows : we first describe different possible scenarios of scaling behaviour and present the field - theoretical description for models of polymers in these scenarios . \n we then discuss the results and the underlying physical phenomena . \n our discussion encompasses previous results @xcite as well as recent extensions @xcite . \n from the point of view of rg transformation , the scaling exponents ( 1 ) originate from anomalous dimensions of local operators evaluated at the stable fp . \n the scaling laws can be altered by connecting single polymer chains into more complex structures , which in the language of field theory amounts to the appearance of new composite operators . \n the most simple non - trivial representative of the class of branched polymers is the so - called star polymer , which consists of linear chains , linked together at one of their end - points . for a star with @xmath14 arms each with @xmath3 steps ( monomers ) , the number of possible configurations scales as @xcite : @xmath15 the second part shows the power law in terms of the size @xmath16 of a single chain of @xmath3 monomers on microscopic step length @xmath17 . \n the exponents @xmath18 , @xmath19 are universal star exponents , depending on the space dimension @xmath6 and number of arms @xmath14 . \n this includes the single polymer chain with @xmath20 or @xmath21 . \n some results on star polymers can be found in refs . \n @xcite . \n linking together polymers of different species , results in non - homogeneous polymer stars , which may have a richer scaling behaviour @xcite . \n a particular case is the copolymer star , consisting of polymer chains with two different @xmath8-temperatures . \n let @xmath22 chains be in the good solvent condition while further @xmath23 chains of the star polymer are at their @xmath8-temperature . \n then the partition function of this star copolymer scales as@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents a family of copolymer star exponents and @xmath26 indicates one of eight possible fps in this ternary polymer scenario @xcite . \n what is the influence of structural disorder on the scaling laws eqs.(2),(3 ) ? \n such structural disorder may be present in a solution in terms of a porous medium . \n it has been shown however , that uncorrelated point - like defects of weak concentration will not induce any change of polymer scaling behaviour @xcite : the polymer fp , as for saw on a pure lattice , remains stable and physically accessible . \n more interesting is the case of so - called long - range - correlated disorder , where the distribution of structural defects is characterised by a correlation function that decays with a power law @xmath1 @xcite for large @xmath2 . \n the non - trivial influence of long - range ( lr ) disorder on the scaling properties of single polymer chains and star polymers has recently been worked out in the frames of the field - theoretical approach @xcite . \n as mentioned earlier , the statistics of flexible polymer chains can be extracted in the formal limit @xmath27 of an @xmath28-vector model at its critical point . \n similarly , the scaling of a polymer experiencing lr correlated disorder can be studied using the effective hamiltonian : @xmath29\\label{lag } { + } \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}\\delta(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4)\\times } \\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n \\frac{u_0}{4 ! } \\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_1}\\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_2 } \\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_3}\\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_4}\\right . \n % \\nonumber\\\\ & & { -}\\left.\\frac{w_0}{4!}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=1}^n |k_1-k_2|^{a -

physical region .    here \n , it is our intention to investigate a higher order approximation to confirm the stability of the lr disorder fp in the physical region also within the @xmath39-expansion . \n we use the second - order rg @xmath40-functions of the @xmath28-component model in lr correlated disorder , as derived in ref . \n @xcite . converting these to continuous differential equations , and passing to the @xmath41 limit \n we find : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a rescaling parameter , @xmath44 . \n looking for the fps of this rg flow , we find the lr disorder induced fp @xmath45 , @xmath46+@xmath47 . \n this fp is stable and physically accessible for @xmath48 or equivalently @xmath49 . taking into account , that according to eq . \n ( [ lag ] ) lr disorder should be relevant for @xmath50 , these second order results establish the presence of the lr fixed point in the physical region of ( @xmath51 ) . \n as explained in ref.@xcite , the study of @xmath14-arm star configurations in this theory is given in terms of the anomalous dimensions of complex composite operators , containing products of @xmath14 zero - component fields . \n the presence of a new stable fixed point leads to different values of the scaling exponents for polymers . in particular , for star polymers , the first order expressions for the exponents @xmath52 for a star in a pure solvent and for a star influenced by long - range correlated disorder ( lr ) read : @xmath53 note the decrease of @xmath18 at fixed @xmath54 with increasing @xmath55 ( i.e. when the correlation of the disorder becomes stronger ) . \n however , the behaviour for chain polymers @xmath56 differs : in this case the exponents @xmath57 increase for increasing @xmath55 . \n omitting factors of @xmath58 , let @xmath59 be the free energy of a star polymer in the pure solvent and @xmath60 its free energy in a porous medium . \n then we can estimate the free energy difference of a star polymer with respect to the two environments : @xmath61 the difference in the free energy consists of two terms . \n the first is independent of the polymer architecture and simply takes into account the change in chemical potential per monomer . \n two polymers of the same molecular weight ( same total number of monomers @xmath62 ) will experience the same difference . \n the second term which grows with @xmath63 is architecture dependent . \n following eqs . \n ( [ change ] ) , we see that this term has different signs for chain polymers ( @xmath64 ) , and star polymers ( @xmath65 ) . thus , even though both may be expected to be expelled from the correlated environment , this effect is weakened for linear polymers and enhanced for star polymers of the same molecular weight . \n the first term could in principle be cancelled out if the pure part of the solution is exchanged by a second porous medium which however displays short range ( sr ) disorder with the same chemical potential @xmath66 . \n static architecture induced separation results , see fig.[star ] . \n exploring further aspects of complexity , we consider star polymers built from chains of species with different @xmath8-temperatures ( copolymer stars ) . depending on the temperature , one or more of inter- and \n intra - chain interactions may vanish , and additional fps appear for the inter - chain interaction . \n a species with vanishing intra - chain interaction is represented by rws avoiding the other species . \n this situation may also be used to describe the diffusion of particles near an absorbing polymer @xcite . \n the moments of the resulting flow near the polymer turn out to be multi - fractal @xcite . the scaling exponents of copolymer stars also determine the scaling of corresponding copolymer networks @xcite and play role in a number of other phenomena , given below .    treating the model of star copolymers in a porous medium by the rg approach \n , we have found different scenarios of scaling behaviour and corresponding values for scaling exponents @xcite . to summarise some results for the exponents , \n let us first introduce some notations . \n each regime is denoted by two letters , corresponding to species 1 and 2 respectively and reflecting , whether it behaves like random walk ( @xmath16 ) or self - avoiding walk @xmath67 . \n the index @xmath68 denotes the presence of long - range - correlated disorder . \n the index @xmath69 corresponds to the situation , when species @xmath70 and @xmath21 interact with each other . when disorder is absent , we reproduce known results @xcite for the cases of two interacting random walks \n @xmath71 , two interacting saws @xmath72 and saws interacting with random walks @xmath73 : @xmath74 @xmath75 is equivalent to the exponent of a homogeneous star polymer of @xmath76 arms . turning on the long - range - correlated disorder , \n we obtain estimates for the exponent @xmath77 for different regimes in a new universality class : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the exponent for the homogeneous star with @xmath80 arms in long - range - correlated disorder , @xmath81 and @xmath82 describe @xmath23 random walks , interacting with @xmath22 rws and saws respectively , in lr disorder .    besides the usual polymer exponents describing statistical properties like end - to - end distance or number of configurations , polymers of complex structure ( e.g. star copolymers ) \n are characterised by the full set of star exponents . \n these star exponents form a basis to determine the scaling of complex copolymer networks @xcite . \n they are important for a wide range of phenomena , some examples are given by the absorption of diffusive particles in the vicinity of an absorbing polymer @xcite , the effective interaction in colloids of star polymers @xcite , the transition of double stranded to single stranded dna @xcite . as we have demonstrated in this paper polymer scaling behaviour is influenced in a non trivial way by correlated structural disorder . \n further investigations are under way to complete the quantitative description of the scenarios of complex polymer behaviour in correlated environments . \n we acknowledge support by a  marie curie international incoming fellowship \" ( v.b . ) and austrian fwf under project no . \n p19583-n20 ( yu.h ) . \n see , e.g. : g .- p . de gennes , _ scaling concepts in polymer physics _ , cornell university press , ithaca and london , 1979 ; l. schfer , _ universal properties of polymer solutions as explained by the renormalization group _ , springer , berlin , 1999 . \n v. blavatska , c. von ferber and yu . \n holovatch , _ polymers in media with long -

{"ContextTokens": 2021, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "owing to new observations and a continuous improvement of simulations , in the last years the solar community has published several works concerning the formation and evolution of filaments . \n active region ( ar ) filament studies are still scarce in literature , and it is not clear how similar their formation process is to that of the quiescent ( qs ) ones . generally speaking , there are two proposed scenarios that try to explain the formation of filaments : ( 1 ) the sheared arcade ( sa ) model and ( 2 ) the flux rope emergence ( fre ) model . \n the difference between both models mainly exists in the atmospheric height of filament formation . on the one hand , in the sa model \n the filament is formed in the corona by shearing motions in addition to converging flows at the polarity inversion line ( pil ) and reconnection processes . as a result , \n the magnetic structure can be a flux rope ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a dipped arcade ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) . on the other hand \n , the fre model assumes that a flux rope emerges from below the photosphere ascending into the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n @xcite provide an extensive discussion and references related to these two models . in this work \n , we present a multi - height study of the magnetic structure of an ar filament observed in july 2005 and investigate whether this filament fits into the sa or fre model . \n the present analysis is mainly based on spectropolarimetric observations acquired with the tenerife infrared polarimeter attached to the vacuum tower telescope ( vtt ) in tenerife ( tip - ii ; * ? ? ? \n the data sets of an ar filament belonging to noaa 10781 were taken close to disk center ( @xmath00.91 and 0.95 ) on 2005 july 3 and 5 . \n however , h@xmath1 images from big bear solar observatory ( bbso ; * ? ? ? \n * ) show that the filament was already present a few days before , on july 1 . \n line - of - sight ( los ) magnetograms from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi , * ? ? ? \n * ) show that below the filament an extensive facular region is seen with two polarities clearly separated by the pil . between july 17 \n the opposite polarities became more compact , almost touching each other at the pil , and then broadened again . during this event , with characteristics of the `` sliding door '' effect ( an effect firstly described by * ? ? ? * ) , new pores and orphan penumbrae emerged at the pil ( see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for a detailed description and images ) . \n @xcite related this effect to the emergence of a flux rope below an ar filament . \n the spectral region observed with tip - ii comprised the photospheric si i 10827    line , the chromospheric he i 10830    triplet , and two telluric lines with a spectral sampling of @xmath211.04  m  px@xmath3 . \n therefore , with this instrument it is possible to simultaneously analyze the vector magnetic field at two different heights in the solar atmosphere . in this work \n , we will concentrate on the second set of spectropolarimetric data taken on july 5 between 7:36 and 14:51 ut . the observing strategy was to scan the filament with the slit parallel to the pil with a scanning step size of 0.3@xmath4 . \n the pixel size along the slit was 0.17@xmath4 . \n the vector magnetic field was inferred by carrying out inversions of the four stokes parameters with two different inversion codes : ( 1 ) for the si  i line we used the sir code ( stokes inversion based on response functions ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and ( 2 ) for the he  i triplet we used a milne - eddington - based inversion code ( melanie ; * ? ? ? \n the 180@xmath5-ambiguity was solved using the azam code @xcite . \n the los velocities were determined from the inversions and converted to an absolute scale , i.e. , corrections for orbital motions and the gravity shift were made ( see * ? ? ? * for a full description of the velocity calibration ) . \n the inferred magnetic field strength in this ar filament is 600800  g @xcite , which was the strongest value detected so far inside ar filaments . recently , \n other authors have also reported similar strong magnetic fields inside filaments , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n therefore , it seems to be rather common to find these strong fields inside ar filaments . \n the set of inferred chromospheric and photospheric vector magnetograms indicate that the magnetic structure which supports the filament is a flux rope . to substantiate this result , \n non - linear force - free ( nlff ) field extrapolations , starting from the photosphere and chromosphere , were carried out . \n the extrapolations confirmed the presence of a flux rope structure , which lay surprisingly low in the atmosphere and had its axis located at @xmath21.4  mm above the solar surface ( see * ? ? ? * for a complete description of the extrapolations and results ) . \n the light green field lines on both sides of the filament represent the fields in the positive ( upward arrow ) and negative ( downward arrow ) faculae . \n this figure is from @xcite . ] \n based on the vector magnetograms , we constructed the sketch presented in fig . \n the cartoon shows a gray - scale continuum image from the dutch open telescope ( dot ) on 2005 july 5 . in the middle of the image , \n the aforementioned pores and orphan penumbrae that started to appear on july 4 are seen . \n the reconstruction of the filament is represented as a black structure which was extracted from the corresponding dot h@xmath1 image . \n the filament follows the pil . \n the positive ( negative ) polarity is at the right ( left ) side of the pil when viewing the figure from the lower right corner . \n there are three different magnetic field lines represented in the cartoon . \n ( 1 ) the dark red field lines are based on the photospheric vector magnetograms . \n these field lines are aligned along the pil where pores and orphan penumbrae are seen . \n however , outside the orphan - penumbrae region , the field lines have an inverse polarity configuration ( pointing from negative to positive polarity ) . \n ( 2 ) the light blue field lines were derived from the chromospheric vector magnetograms . in this case , the field lines are parallel to the filament axis outside the orphan - penumbrae region , whereas inside , the field lines show a normal configuration ( the field lines point from positive to negative polarity ) . \n ( 3 ) the green field lines , close to the corners of the image , represent the positive ( upward pointing arrow ) and negative ( downward pointing arrow ) polarity of the faculae .    to shed light on the formation of the flux rope it was crucial to infer the los velocities . \n calibrations using two telluric lines and corrections related to orbital motions and the gravity shift were carefully carried out ( see * ? ? ? \n the motions of the transverse magnetic fields in the photosphere , in the orphan - penumbrae area , show , on a seven - hour average , a slow upward trend . \n above , in the chromosphere , the filament moves on average downward . nevertheless , there are clearly localized upflow areas ( see fig . 3 in * ? ? ? * ) . \n this indicated , when looking at the orphan - penumbrae area in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , that the axis of the flux rope is slowly rising . \n half of the flux rope is below the surface , which seems to be responsible for the formation of the orphan penumbrae . \n the upper part of the flux rope reaches the chromosphere where groups of field lines produce the upflow patches detected in the chromosphere . the portion of the filament that does not have orphan penumbrae below behaves differently . \n out of seven maps , the first four show on average upward motions of the transverse fields . \n the other three show on average velocities close to zero . \n the chromospheric counterpart shows downward motions . \n the initial formation phase of this ar filament can not be described with the presented data sets because the filament was already present prior to our observations . \n however , we have shown that ar filaments can have extremely low - lying flux rope structures ( even as low as the photosphere ) that support the filament . \n this structure can eventually emerge from below the photosphere , as seen in our data sets , generating pores and orphan penumbrae along the pil . \n therefore , ar filaments can have a photospheric counterpart . in the chromosphere , \n the filament s plasma is being pushed upward by the magnetic field that expands from the emerging flux rope structure . at the same time \n , the emerging flux rope supports the filament material against gravity . \n altogether , the present results favor a flux rope emergence scenario . \n ck greatly acknowledges the travel support received from the iau . \n the vtt is operated by the kiepenheuer - institute for solar physics in freiburg , germany , at the spanish observatorio del teide , tenerife , canary islands . \n the national center for atmospheric research ( ncar ) is sponsored by the national science foundation ( nsf ) . \n the authors would like to thank c. denker for carefully reading the manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 1053540197862, "RequestID": "9c5fbe897420fd028dcde23d4c037b3b0e7ce67a", "TotalTokens": 2150}
{"ContextTokens": 3657, "GeneratedTokens": 213, "SynthesizedBody": "a central problem in the search for earth - like planets is to suppress the light from a star so as to reveal a planet which might be 10 to 12 orders of magnitude fainter than the star and might be in quite close to the star . in earlier papers ( nisenson and papliolios , 2001 ; nisenson et al , 2003 ) we showed that apodizing a telescope pupil reduced the diffraction of a telescope that would allow exo - planet detection . \n in addition to diffraction suppression , extremely low scattering optical surfaces at frequencies of 3 to 30 cycles / mirror are necessary . obtaining such low scattering will require a combination of super - polishing and adaptive optic correction . in this paper \n , we describe a technique for designing an apodizer that minimizes diffraction in a chosen region of the focal plane while maximizing the throughput of the apodizer . \n the image of a star ( unaberrated by the atmosphere ) is the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope . \n we want to design a real , non - negative , continuous tone mask , i.e. , an apodizer , to place in the aperture ( or a relay plane of the aperture ) such that the psf has a compact , central peak with minimal spread beyond the core of the psf . \n this problem was first studied by slepian & pollack ( 1961 ) in the context of radar , communications , and superresolution . \n the authors show that the band - limited signal , @xmath0 , which has the most energy in time t satisfies the integral equation :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a zero - one function which time - limits @xmath0 to t seconds and the fourier transform , @xmath3 , of @xmath4 is another zero - one function which band - limits @xmath0 . \n the solutions ( eigenfunctions ) of this integral equation are prolate spheroidal ( ps ) functions and @xmath0 is the eigenfunction with the largest eigenvalue . the authors show that @xmath0 , inside t , is identical to its fourier transform , @xmath5 , suitably scaled in f. kaiser ( 1966 ) presented an approximation to @xmath0 and subsequent authors ( oppenheim and schafer , 1989 ; aime et al , 2002 ) have used the kaiser window because @xmath0 is difficult to compute . \n papoulis ( 1968 ) studied the same problem in the optical context and showed that @xmath6 , the fourier transform of @xmath0 , is the optimal one - dimensional apodizer . \n he showed that the optimal apodizer for a square aperture is the product @xmath7 , which is the form proposed by nisenson and papaliolios ( 2001 ) . \n he also shows that the optimal apodizer for a circularly symmetric aperture is a sum of the first and second order bessel functions . \n other authors ( kasdin et al , 2002 and aime et al , 2001 ) , have shown the optimality of a ps apodizer . \n kasdin et al ( 2002 ) suggest a ps - shaped , binary aperture with the key advantage that the binary aperture may be easier to manufacture . \n in this paper we present an iterative calculation of an optimal apodizer . \n the method does not require the kaiser approximation and it can accommodate any special features of the measurement process , such as the likely position of a planet in reference to its star . \n we use a very simple iterative procedure to calculate the apodizer , an iterative algorithm that has its roots in linear system theory and is closely related to the well - known gerchberg - saxton algorithm ( gerchberg and saxton , 1972 ) . \n we use the method of alternating projections which was introduced by von neumann ( 1950 ) . \n we write equation ( 1 ) in the compact form    @xmath8    where r is an operator , sometimes called the kernel . \n r space - limits the two - dimensional function @xmath9 with a specified spatial mask , @xmath10 , then band - limits it with a specified spatial frequency mask , @xmath11 . the latter is determined by the shape of the aperture . \n to solve eq . \n ( 2 ) we repeatedly impose r on an initial @xmath9 until eq . \n ( 2 ) is satisfied . \n more specifically , we calculate    @xmath12    then we calculate the fourier transform of f(x , y ) , namely f(u , v ) , and calculate    @xmath13    the inverse fourier transform of @xmath14 is @xmath9 , which completes one iteration of the algorithm . \n we rely on the fact that n iterations will produce an expansion of @xmath9 in eigenfunctions of eq . \n 2 with coefficients which are multiplied by eigenvalues raised to the power n. eventually , only the eigenfunction with the largest eigenvalue will emerge , a property which is well - known . \n the algorithm is described by the figures and text in papoulis 1968 book . \n because the operation r uses a forward fourier transform , a masking operation , an inverse fourier transform , and another masking operation , the algorithm is similar to the iterative transform algorithm generally known as the gerchberg - saxton algorithm ( gerchberg and saxton , 1972 ) . \n we emphasize that the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be any desired shape , which gives us the opportunity to shape both the aperture and the search region . \n a one - dimensional , unapodized aperture of width d has inverse fourier transform , @xmath15 , a sinc function with its first zero at @xmath16 . \n we call @xmath17 the diffraction - limited spot size or , more simply , a dl element . the magnitude squared of @xmath15 is @xmath18 , the one - dimensional point spread function ( psf ) . \n a square , two - dimensional aperture has @xmath19 . on the left in figure 1 \n is the logarithm of the psf for such an unapodized aperture . \n the diagonal line in the image shows where we will sample the psf for comparison purposes . in all of our examples \n we assume that the available light is broadband with a bandwidth which is 20% of the central wavelength . \n thus , the deep nulls in a conventional sinc function are blurred out when we combine the psf s at various wavelengths .    to form this first apodized aperture \n we space - limit a one - dimensional @xmath20 to the interval , say , @xmath21 , then we band - limit the result to d. ( for these examples , we used fft software with a calculation size of n = 256 and we set the aperture size to d = 41 . ) these space and bandwidth limiting operations are defined by equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . \n we repeat them until the iterations converge . \n what emerges is the prolate spheroidal function , @xmath22 . \n its fourier transform , @xmath6 , is the apodizer . following previous authors ( i.e. aime et al , 2002 ) , we form the product aperture @xmath23 , which we call a product prolate spheroidal ( pps ) aperture , and its inverse fourier transform , p(x , y ) , is the telescope s psf . in the center of figure 1 \n is the logarithm of the psf for this apodizer . \n note that the psf is concentrated along the x and y axes . \n the aperture has a transmission of @xmath24 . \n papoulis ( 1968 ) showed that this aperture best concentrates the psf into a central square of size @xmath25 by @xmath25 . \n figure 1 shows a third psf . \n this was formed by defining a one - d spatial mask , @xmath26 , which is 1 in the range from 0 to @xmath27 , zero from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and 1 for all larger x ; and is symmetric about @xmath29 . \n the mask forces the psf to be narrow , as above , but also allows it to rise outside a restricted search region from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . \n we apply the same iterative algorithm , starting with the pps apodizer and stopping the iterations when the transmission is ( @xmath30 ) . \n the result is the psf shown on the right of figure 1 . \n figure 2 shows a @xmath31 cut through three psf s . \n the horizontal axis plots diagonal distance in units of @xmath17 and the vertical axis plots the logarithm of @xmath32 , scaled such that @xmath33 . \n figure 2 also shows the psf for the unapodized aperture . \n note that the pps plot is about seven orders of magnitude below the no - apodizer plot , beyond about @xmath34 . \n the modified pps plot matches the pps plot from 0 to @xmath34 , drops about 2 db below it to about @xmath35 , then rises almost to the no - apodizer plot . \n figure 3 shows horizontal cuts through the pps apodizer and the modified pps apodizer .    for our next set of examples we used a circular aperture of diameter @xmath36 . \n first we calculated the psf for an unapodized aperture . \n it is the well - known airy disc . \n the logarithm of this psf is shown on the left of figure 4 . \n ( as in figure 1 the psf s are for wideband light so the rings are somewhat indistinct . \n the horizontal and vertical bands at the edge of the figures are aliasing , caused by our finite sampling . ) \n next we formed a circular mask of radius 3.5z and exercised a two - dimensional version of the iterative algorithm . \n this results in the 2-d psf in the center of figure 4 . \n this is the psf which papoulis ( 1968 ) reports but does not sketch . \n we call the apodizer a circular bessel ( cb ) apodizer \n . then we allowed the mask to rise at a radius of @xmath37 , so that the mask looks like a bulls eye , and exercised the two - d algorithm . \n the psf is on the right of figure 4 . \n cuts through the psf s are shown in figure 5 . inside the search region \n the bulls eye psf is about two orders of magnitude below the psf for the cb aperture . \n the apodizers are shown in figure 6 . both have transmission of about @xmath38 .    finally , we formed an apodizer for a square aperture with a two - dimensional mask which is a cross of width @xmath39 , imbedded in a circular mask of radius @xmath35 , a hybrid apodizer . \n it has a restricted search area as shown on the left in figure 7 . \n we exercised the iterative algorithm , starting with the cb apodizer . \n figure 7 shows the mask ( the search area ) and the log of the psf . \n figure 8 shows a slice through the psf and , for comparison , a slice through the psf for the cb apodizer . despite what appear to be only subtle differences in the shapes of the two apodizers , the hybrid apodizer has a transmission of @xmath40 , almost double that of the cb apodizer ; it also has a narrower central peak and better sidelobe supression . \n the reduced search area of this hybrid apodizer provides significant advantages over our earlier examples . \n figure 9 shows cuts through the apodizer at 0 and at @xmath31 , which shows that the hybrid apodizer is not circularly symmetric . \n we have described an approach to designing an apodization mask that is optimized for minimizing diffraction in a selected local area of the focal plane . \n this would allow use of selectable apodization masks in a tpf telescope that could , for example , reduce diffraction over a wide area in the focal plane for a survey , and then produce deeper nulls in local areas for spectroscopy of an already detected planet . or one could select an apodizer for the minimum width of the central peak , trading off the size of the searchable region for minimum detectable separation of star and planet \n . we also investigated use of apodizers that vary only in one direction ( constant in the other ) . \n these apodizers result in maximizing throughput ( close to 50% ) while allowing detection of luminosity ratios of @xmath41 . \n this is insufficient for tpf - like missions ( luminosity ratios will be of order @xmath42 for an earth - like planet orbiting a star at 10 pc ) but hybrid apodizers , as described in the paper , allow a continuous trade - off between maximizing throughput and minimizing diffraction . \n the speckle due to optical surface errors and the diffraction will produce a psf that is highly centro - symmetric when ( as required for a tpf telescope ) the phase errors are extremely small . for very small phases , \n the exponential phase can be accurately approximated by only the linear term of the power series expansion of the exponential . \n so , for example , a telescope with 1/1000 wave rms surface errors will have a centro - symmetric psf to a precision of about 0.1% and 1/10000 wave results in centro - symmetry of 0.01% . \n one can then use this asymmetry to calibrate the residual speckle and diffraction in the half - plane of the psf that contains a planet using the opposite half - plane . \n subtraction of the calibration region then increases the dynamic range to an accuracy limited only by photon statistics . \n accurate intensity transmission of the apodizers is critical for their success - this is evident from the apparently small differences in apodizer shape , as illustrated in figure 3 , producing substantial effects on the psf . \n we have estimated the precision required in the transmission of the apodizer to be 0.3% or better for it not to affect the dynamic range . \n this is the same requirement as one for the uniformity of the reflective coatings of the telescope mirrors . \n numerical simulations that substantiate this result are included in nisenson et al . \n ( 2003 )    the usual problems with iterative algorithms are choosing an initial function and choosing a stopping point in the iterations . \n for the examples which yielded the ps and cb solutions , we started with a gaussian shape and we stopped the iterations when there was no significant change in the solution , typically a few hundred iterations . for the other examples we started with a ps or cb aperture \n . continued iterations result in deeper and deeper suppression of diffraction in the chosen region but also resulted in decreasing throughput for the apodizer . \n we stop the iterations when the diffraction is reduced to a selected level while leaving the throughput at a maximum . \n we have shown an approach to calculating an optimum apodizer that maximizes the detectable luminosity ratio for exo - planet detection in the focal plane of the tpf telescope . \n the next step in this analysis would be to include realistic specifications on wavefront errors from the telescope optics and also to factor in practical limits on the accuracy in the manufacture of apodizing masks . \n how well continuous tone apodizers can be manufactured is an open question . \n many of the techniques developed for photolithography allow very precise shaped transmission to be generated in special glass . \n such a mask was used in a laboratory demonstration of imaging two close point sources with a luminosity ratio of nearly @xmath43 ( melnick et al , 2001 ) . \n melnick , g. j. , fischer , d. , geary , j. c. , gezari , d. y. , hardesty , c. , harwit , m. , holman , m. , korzennik , s. g. , lyon , r. g. , marley , m. s. , mcelroy , m. b. , neufeld , d. a. , nisenson , p. , noyes , r. w. , papaliolios , c. , ridgway , s. t. , sasselov , d. d. 2001 , american astronomical society meeting 199 , # 09.10 . \n nisenson , p. , melnick , g.j . , \n geary , j. , holman , m. korzennik , s.g . \n , noyes , r.w . , \n papaliolios , c. , sasselov , d.d . , \n gonsalves , r. , hardesty , c , gezari , d. , lyon , r.g . , fischer , d. , harwit , m. , marley , m.s . , \n neufeld , d.a . , \n ridgway , s.t . \n 2003 , to appear in asp conf . \n , scientific frontiers on research of extrasolar planets , eds . \n d. deming & s. seager , ( san francisco : asp ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1058544763914, "RequestID": "9d9f7f1c42eadd1a6d74bee11ffb4bb001520b45", "TotalTokens": 3870}
{"ContextTokens": 1796, "GeneratedTokens": 102, "SynthesizedBody": "the air shower experiment kascade @xcite aims at the investigation of the knee region of the charged cosmic rays . \n it is built up as a multidetector setup for measuring simultaneously a large number of observables in the different particle ( electromagnetic , muonic and hadronic ) components of the extended air shower ( eas ) . \n this enables to perform a multivariate multiparameter analysis for the registered eas on an event - by - event basis to account for the non parametric , stochastic processes of the eas development in the atmosphere . in parallel \n the kascade collaboration tries to improve the tools for the monte carlo simulations with the relevant physics . \n the code corsika @xcite allows not only the detailed three dimensional simulation of the shower development in all particle components ( including neutrinos ) down to the observation level , but it has been implemented several high - energy interaction models . as the basic physics of these models in the relevant energy region and in the extreme forward direction can not be tested at present days accelerators , the test of these models emerged as one of the goals of the kascade experiment . \n the following overview is based on results presented at the 26@xmath1 international cosmic ray conference in salt lake city , utah 1999 @xcite . \n the kascade array consists of 252 detector stations in a @xmath2m@xmath3 rectangular grid containing unshielded liquid scintillation detectors ( @xmath4-detectors ) and below 10 cm lead and 4 cm steel plastic scintillators as muon - detectors . \n the total sensitive areas are @xmath5m@xmath3 for the @xmath4- and @xmath6m@xmath3 for the muon - detectors . in the center of the array a hadron calorimeter ( @xmath7m@xmath3 ) \n is built up , consisting of more than 40,000 liquid ionisation chambers in 8 layers with a trigger layer consisting of 456 scintillation detectors in between . \n below the calorimeter a setup of position sensitive multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) in two layers measures high - energy muons ( @xmath8gev ) of the eas . \n + for each single shower a large number of observables are reconstructed with small uncertainties . \n for example , the errors for the so - called shower sizes , i.e. total numbers of electrons @xmath9 and number of muons in the range of the core distance @xmath10 m @xmath11 , are smaller than 10@xmath12 . \n + the resulting frequency spectra of the sizes ( inclusive the spectra of the hadron number and muon density spectra at different core distances ) show kinks at same integral fluxes . \n this is a strong hint for an astrophysical source of the knee phenomenon based on pure experimental data , since same intensity of the flux corresponds to equal primary energy . \n + but for the reconstruction of the primary energy spectrum and the chemical composition detailed monte carlo simulations are indispensable due to the unknown initial parameters and the large intrinsic fluctuations of the stochastic process of the shower development in the atmosphere . \n the usage of a larger number of less correlated observables in a multivariate analysis parallel to independent tests of the simulation models tries to find the solution of this dilemma . \n in the air shower simulation program corsika several high - energy interaction models are embedded including venus , qgsjet and sibyll ( refs . \n see in @xcite ) . \n the models are based on the gribov - regge - theory and qcd in accordance with accelerator data . \n extrapolations for the eas physics in the knee region are necessary due to the high interaction energy and for        the extreme forward direction . \n to compare kascade data with monte carlo expectations a detector simulation by geant is performed for each corsika simulated shower . \n + one test is the comparison of simulated integral muon trigger and hadron rates with the measurements . \n this test is sensitive to the energy spectrum of the hadrons which are produced in the forward direction at primary energies around 10 tev , where the chemical composition is roughly known ( fig.[fig : rate ] ) . for higher primary energies \n the hadronic part of the interaction models are tested by comparisons of different hadronic observables in ranges of shower sizes @xcite . in general \n it is seen that the high - energy interaction models predict a too large number of hadrons at sea level compared with the measurements . \n + nonparametric multivariate methods like `` neural networks '' or analyses based on the `` bayesian decision rules '' are applied to the kascade data for the estimation of the energy and mass of the cosmic rays on an event - by - event basis . \n the necessary `` a - priori '' information in form of probability density distributions are won by detailed monte carlo simulations with large statistics . \n + for the energy reconstruction the shower sizes @xmath9 and @xmath11 as parameters are used in a neural network analyses ( fig.[fig : spec ] ) . a parametric approach to the same data leads to compatible results ( fig.[fig : spec ] ) :     to @xmath13 at the knee position of @xmath14gev . ]    here a simultaneous fit to the @xmath9 and @xmath11 size spectra is performed . \n the kernel function of this fit contains the size - energy correlations for two primary masses ( proton and iron ) obtained by monte carlo simulations . \n + an analysis of the size - ratio @xmath15 calculated for each single event leads to results of the elemental composition for different energy ranges ( fig.[fig : comp ] ) . \n the measured distribution of these ratios is assumed to be a superposition of simulated distributions for different primary masses . \n the large iron sampling calorimeter of kascade allows to investigate the hadronic part of eas in terms of the chemical composition . for six different hadronic observables ( won by spatial and energy distributions of the hadrons ) the deviations of the mean values to expectations of pure proton and iron primaries in certain energy ranges \n are calculated . \n + besides the use of global parameters like the shower sizes , sets of different parameters are used for neural network and bayesian decision analyses . \n examples of such observables are the number of reconstructed hadrons in the calorimeter , their reconstructed energy sum , number of muons in the shower center , or parameters obtained by a fractal analysis of the hit pattern of muons and secondaries at the mwpc . \n the latter ones are sensitive to the structure of the shower core which is mass sensitive due to different shower developments of light and heavy particles in the atmosphere . in figure \n [ fig : comp ] results of a bayesian analyses and of a separate neural net analysis using the fractal parameters are shown . \n + as the tendency of the results of each described method is consistent with a heavier primary mass after the knee region , but the absolute scale strongly depends on the particle component of which the observables are constructed from , the syllogism is that the balance of the energy and number of particles between the muonic , electromagnetic and hadronic part in the eas differs for simulations and the real shower development . \n first results of the kascade experiment can be summarized by following statements : all secondary particle components of the showers display a kink in the size spectra . \n this strongly supports an astrophysical origin of the `` knee '' , rather than effects of the interaction of the primaries in the atmosphere . the knee is sharper for the light primary component than for the heavy one . \n this result follows from the measurement as an increasing average mass of the primary cosmic rays above the observed kink , together with the energy dependent mass classification of single air showers . but \n none of the high - energy interaction models en vogue is able to fit the data of all observables consistently \n .    9 h.o . \n klages et al . \n kascade collaboration , nucl . \n b ( proc . suppl . ) 52b ( 1997 ) 92 . \n d. heck et al . , fzka 6019 , forschungszentrum karlsruhe ( 1998 ) . \n t. antoni et al . \n kascade collaboration , proc . \n 26@xmath16 icrc , salt lake city , utah 1999 ; published as : k.h . \n kampert ( editor ) , fzka 6345 , forschungszentrum karlsruhe ( 1999 ) . t. antoni et al . \n kascade collaboration , j. phys . \n g : nucl . part . \n phys . 25 ( 1999 ) 2161 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1067171748036, "RequestID": "51d6668c1911443077d93120d69636694ec92cec", "TotalTokens": 1898}
{"ContextTokens": 3255, "GeneratedTokens": 232, "SynthesizedBody": "echocardiography plays an important part in diagnostic aid in cardiac diseases . \n it relies on the use of ultrasound images to reflect the information about the heart of a patient . in the process of diagnosis \n , images are captured from specific views of heart , which are commonly named _ \n heart views _ or _ \n standard planes_. standard planes tend to provide promising views to present different heart structures that are benefit to diagnosis . \n the task for standard plane location ( spl ) exactly refers to selecting 2d planes from a candidate list considering both static and dynamic characteristics from different views of heart . \n automatic recognition of standard planes have been extensively studied in recent works . \n most of them focus on ultrasound images with 2d static images , 3d static volumes and 2d - temporal sequences . for 2d static images , ebadollahi et.al  @xcite deal with view classification of echocardiograms based on spatial layout of 2d static frames . \n @xcite propose an approach by applying local detectors sequentially on the pre - selected locations with selective search . \n for 3d volumes , lu et.al  @xcite proposed an automated supervised learning method to detect standard multiplanar reformatted planes ( mprs ) from a 3d echocardiographic volume with coarse - to - fine strategy . \n chykeyuk et.al  @xcite build a class - specific random forest regression model for standard plane classification based on 3d static volumes . for 2d - temporal sequences , qian et.al  @xcite employed bag of visual words based on spatial - temporal features . \n sparse coding and max pooling are used in a codebook to generate the representation . \n previous works usually regard the standard plane location as a classification problem based on individual frames or a set of sequences . in this paper , the data used in our work are 4d stic volumes where all slices have been captured including both 3d position and temporal information . \n the task for standard plane location is to select a specific or small set of 2d planes from 4d volumes according to different preferences of views . \n different from the previous works , the spl task on 4d image introduces the following problems :    1 .   restricted by the facility performance , the image quality of 4d stic volume is often poor \n . the spatial plane is generated by interpolation and the noise is inevitably introduced . \n the standard plane of abnormal cases can be quite similar to the plane which is not the standard plane in normal cases . \n 3 .   given the 4d stic data , the searching space for * 2d plane * is considerably large . \n the real - time location is in urgent demand . \n considering the issues above , we propose a novel framework for spl task in 4d stic volume .    * different from the disease diagnosis \n , it is observed that the spl tasks focus more on the boundary characteristic but not the fine - grained information . \n therefore , we use an @xmath0 smoothing algorithm  @xcite which removes the noise and preserves the boundary simultaneously ( for problem 1 ) . * \n static sift  @xcite and spatial - temporal sift ( stip )  @xcite are deployed to model the feature of standard plane ( for problem 2 ) . * \n based on sift and stip , we propose a supervised method to learn the discriminative subspace and to generate the compact feature which can obviously reduce the searching consumption ( for problem 2&3 ) . \n the main framework of the proposed method is shown in fig  [ fig::framework ] . given \n the 4d stic volume data , a large set of candidate 2d planes are generated to identify the standard plane . \n each 2d plane is featured with a sequence of grey - scale images indicating the cardiac motion . \n an @xmath0 smoothing filter is firstly deployed to remove the noise in each image . \n sift and stip features are extracted to capture both static and dynamic information . in order to learn compact representation , a low - dimensional subspace is obtained by embedding sift and stip features via supervised semantic correlation . finally a support vector machine  ( svm ) classifies the candidates into different views . \n we deploy the fast @xmath0 smoothing algorithm  @xcite to generate the filtered image and detect the sift points as shown in figure  [ fig::imagevis ] . \n as shown in figure  [ fig::imagevis ] , the boundary of original frame is perfectly preserved while the noise is largely reduced in the filter image . \n we can also find the sift points detected in the filtered image mostly distributed along the boundary and the number of points is much smaller than the number in the original image . \n as mentioned above , it is observed that the contour is more discriminative to locate the standard planes other than fine grained local features . \n the 4d stic volume data naturally involves the spatial - temporal information . in order to present both dynamic and static features , \n sift @xcite and stip@xcite are used in our work . for each frame , we extract sift points as static features that are used to indicate local features and invariant to scale and rotation transforms . \n @xcite demonstrates that the dynamic feature ( stip ) is powerful in standard plane location which takes both spatial invariant and temporal structure into consideration . however , the classification accuracy of standard plane is not promising enough according to our experiments on real datasets . \n stip prefers to select the interesting points based on spatial - temporal structure . \n although stip performs well in action recognition based on video captured in natural scenes , the quality and sampling rate of ultrasound image sequence is poor without preprocessing . \n moreover , the stip feature can not fully capture the static information which is also important for standard plane location . \n therefore , we aim at learning the common space between dynamic and static features .      many strategies are designed for learning the representation from multiple features including multiple kernel learning  @xcite , subspace learning  @xcite , etc . as mentioned in section  [ sec::introduction ] , \n the searching space is considerably large in standard plane location . \n therefore , we tend to learn the feature that integrates both dynamic and static information as well as in compact form . in this section , \n we follow a supervised embedding scheme to generate the subspace feature based on sift and stip .    given a 2d plane @xmath1 with @xmath2 grey - scale frames @xmath3 , the plane is represented by bag - of - words feature with sift ( denoted by @xmath4 ) and stip ( denoted by @xmath5 ) . \n each plane is labeled with semantic information including plane description @xmath6 and diagnosis result @xmath7 . \n @xmath6 is a vector with @xmath8 elements @xmath9 where @xmath10 if current plane belongs to @xmath11th type of standard plane , otherwise , @xmath12 . if current plane is not a standard plane , the last element @xmath13 . \n the diagnosis result label @xmath14 indicates whether current plane supports the diagnosis of specific disease . following the similar scheme of plane description , \n the first @xmath15 elements shows the existence of specific disease ( i.e. @xmath16 supports @xmath11th disease . \n otherwise , @xmath17 ) . for normal cases , \n the last element is set to be @xmath18 . \n based on the labels , the semantic similarity between two planes can be measured as follows : @xmath19 according to the definition of @xmath20 , when two samples belong to different types of standard planes , the similarity is zero . \n however , the diagnosis information is taken into consideration when samples belong to the same standard plane . \n based on the pair - wise similarity , the task for multi - view feature embedding is to learn @xmath21 and @xmath22 mapping @xmath23 and @xmath24 into common latent space that maximizes the semantic similarity as defined in eq.([eq::semantic_sim ] ) . \n therefore , we have the objective function as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the length of the compact codes to learn . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are set of features of all training samples . \n after learning @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the original feature @xmath23 and @xmath24 are transformed into @xmath27 and @xmath28 which is compact ( @xmath29 ) and more discriminative than original feature . in order to obtain the solution of eq.([eq::c_loss ] ) , we impose orthogonality constraints , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and then expand the original problem into the following form : @xmath32 problem in eq.([eqn::conver1 ] ) with orthogonality constraints is equivalent to a generalized eigenvalue problem that has closed - form solution . \n the embedded feature @xmath33 or @xmath34 is finally fed into a support vector machine ( svm ) to determine whether current plane belongs to specific standard plane . in order to address the problem of nonlinear cases , a histogram intersection kernel ( hik ) \n is adopted in this paper . for each class of standard plane \n , we use one - vs - rest strategy to train binary svm classifier . \n to evaluate the performance of the proposed embedded feature , a 4d stic volume dataset is collected by xinhua hospital from ge e8 and the data is exported and stored in the dicom format by 4dview software from ge . \n the dicom image has the size of four dimensions with three - dimensional structure and frame numbers ( @xmath35 with 40 frames ) . to simplify the cases of disease , \n the volume data are divided into two parts with 92 normal cases and 93 abnormal cases . as shown in figure  [ fig::standardplane ] , \n three standard planes including four chamber section ( a4c ) , three vessel view ( tvv ) and transverse abdominal section ( tas ) are selected for evaluations . for each volume \n , we uniformly generate 400 planes as candidate list and , for each standard plane , three candidates are labeled by expert as ground truth . in training step , \n we randomly select 46 normal cases and 46 abnormal cases from the full dataset . in testing step , we construct two evaluation settings :    * * synthetic data : * for standard planes , we randomly select 75 planes from abnormal cases and 184 from normal cases . for non - standard planes , \n the numbers of samples from abnormal and normal cases are 1392 and 1304 respectively . \n therefore , the evaluation on synthetic data is equivalent to a conventional classification problem . \n the performance can be directly measured by classification accuracy . * \n * real volume : * we regard spl task as a retrieval problem . for each volume , the query of specific standard plane is conducted by classifying all candidate planes in the same volume . \n the final performance can be measured by f1-score of standard planes averaged over all volumes .    for visual representation , we extract sift and stip interesting points from the sequential image series of planes where the final feature is 5000d bag - of - words sift and 1000d bag - of - words stip . \n the dimension of the proposed multi - view feature is 32d . \n three baseline methods are implemented for comparison :    * * single view feature*. only sift ( denoted by `` sift only '' ) or stip ( denoted by `` stip only '' ) feature is deployed for visual representation for each plane . * \n * direct concatenation*. the sift and stip feature are concatenated into a new vector as visual representation ( denoted by `` direct concate '' ) . \n the dimension of feature is 6000d . * * unsupervised cca*. sift and stip are mapped into a latent space with unsupervised canonical correlation analysis ( denoted by `` cca '' )  @xcite . \n the dimension of feature is 32d . \n all experiments are conducted on a pc with intel 2.4ghz cpu and 16 gb ram . \n methods are implemented with matlab . \n we use libsvm package  @xcite for svm classifier . \n .classification accuracy on synthetic data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab::runningtime ] shows that the running time of training and testing steps . for cca and the proposed method , \n the training part is comprised with the learning of multi - view embedding matrix and svm parameters . \n we can observe that the time consumption is much smaller than learning svm parameters . \n since the dimension of the embedded feature is 32d which is much smaller than original feature , the testing time is only 0.14s which is much faster than the rest of approaches while the training time is also acceptable . \n the real - time detection of standard plane can be implemented . \n this paper presents a spatial - temporal embedding framework to extract the standard view planes from 4d stic volumes . \n we evaluate the proposed method with 92 normal cases and 93 abnormal cases in three standard planes . \n it demonstrates that our method outperforms the baselines in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency . \n the future work includes the use of more powerful features ( e.g. deep convolutional network ) to obtain higher accuracy . \n chykeyuk , k. , yaqub , m. , noble , j.a . : class -

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the average instanton number for the configurations is @xmath5 . \n the average number of monopole loops for the smoothed configurations as well as for the instanton ensembles , is approximately the same . \n is there some explanation behind or this is simply an accident ? \n we studied the number of monopole loops versus the instanton number for all configurations . \n correlation analysis of mathematical statistics clearly showed a strong linear correlation between these quantities in case of the artificial instanton configurations . \n however , no correlation exists between the same quantities for the smoothed monte carlo configurations . \n this indicates the following . on the artificial instanton configurations ( both with parallel and random instanton orientation ) , in average , each instanton is accompanied by a monopole loop close to its centre . \n the average instanton radius is @xmath6 and the instanton distribution is dilute ( see the average instanton number ) . \n the average length of monopole loops is @xmath7 for the parallel and @xmath8 for the randomly oriented instanton ensembles , i.e.  the loops are small , local loops ( see also the length of the largest loops in the table ) . \n in contrast , for the smoothed configurations the average length of the monopole loops is @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the once smoothed and for the 9 times smoothed configurations , respectively . on these configurations , large loops are formed which can cross several instantons and the number of loops and number of instantons is uncorrelated . \n we illustrate the situation for a configuration sample in fig .  1 ( which is available in colour from the hep / lat archives ) . on the real configurations large loops are present which can not be paired with individual instantons . \n using renormalization group inspired smoothing in su(2 ) lattice gauge theory we showed , that the first smoothing step drastically reduces the number of abelian monopoles . \n additional smoothing steps result only in moderate effect . \n the correlation between monopoles and instantons increases with smoothing . \n we find a much stronger correlation for mag than for pg .    in case of the artificially prepared instanton configurations the size of the monopole loops \n is determined mainly by the size of the instantons . \n the monopole - instanton correlation is the strongest for these ensembles . in average , \n each instanton is accompanied by a small monopole loop . \n the monte carlo generated smoothed configurations differ considerably from the artificial ones . \n large loops of monopoles are present . \n work is in progress to determine the monopole contribution to the string tension at different stages of the smoothing sequence . \n we thank the colorado experimental high energy group and the ucla elementary particle theory group for granting us computer time . \n this work was partially supported by u.s . \n department of energy grant de - fg02 - 92er-40672 , otka hungarian science foundation t 23844 and the physics research group of the hungarian academy of sciences , debrecen . \n s.  thurner , h.  markum and w.  sakuler , hep - th/9506123 ; v.  bornyakov and g.  schierholz , phys . \n b384 ( 1996 ) 190 ; a.  hart and m.  teper , phys . \n b371 ( 1996 ) 261 ; h.  suganuma , a.  tanaka , s.  sasaki and o.  miyamura , nucl . phys . \n b ( proc . \n suppl ) 47 ( 1996 ) 302 m.  feurstein , e.m . \n ilgenfritz , h.  markum , m.  mller - preussker and s.  thurner , hep - lat/9709140 t.  degrand , a.  hasenfratz and t.g . \n kovcs , nucl . \n b505 ( 1997 ) 417 t.  degrand , a.  hasenfratz and t.g . \n kovcs , hep - lat/9710078 t.g . \n kovcs and z.  schram , phys . \n d56 ( 1997 ) 6824 a.  hart and m.  teper , nucl . \n b ( proc . \n suppl ) 63 ( 1998 ) 522", "StartTimeOffset": 1077918227172, "RequestID": "a3b1bfd0373bf961044ba52bfbed21be9ce00465", "TotalTokens": 1660}

center agn , which is typically radio - loud in dense cooling core systems . \n x - ray images of several cooling core clusters reveal the presence of significant interaction between the central radio source and the intracluster medium ( icm ) , thus supporting the idea that the agn may be a source of energy input to the surrounding gas . \n the icm shows evidence of cavities surrounded by ( at least partial ) rims in several systems . \n associated radio observations at 1.4 ghz reveal that many of the cavities are filled with radio plasma from the lobes of the central agn . in some systems , however , the x -

ray rim . \n in addition , the cluster is also host to an x - ray tunnel running westward from the agn ( figure  [ fig : a262 ] left ) . \n multi - frequency radio observations at frequencies below 1.4 ghz reveal that the central radio source is more than three times larger than previous observations showed @xcite . \n the 610 mhz emission ( figure  [ fig : a262 ] right ) fills the western tunnel , eastern x - ray cavity , and reveals three distinct radio features further eastward of the previously detected x - ray cavity . \n in fact the radio feature closest to the eastern x - ray cavity falls on top of a low significance x - ray deficit seen in the original @xmath1 images @xcite . \n the other more eastern radio features are not detected as x - ray deficits but this may simply be a result of having insufficiently deep x - ray images to detect the depression . \n if the observed radio features all correspond to separate agn outbursts ( repetition timescale @xmath5 yr ) that have created x - ray cavities , then we find that the total energy input from those outbursts is within a factor of two of the x -

ray emission @xcite . \n the core shows two central x - ray clumps surrounded by an extended diffuse emission which displays a sharp surface brightness edge running from the northeast to the southeast ( figure  [ fig : n507 ] left ) . \n the sharp edge may be related to a metallicity gradient in the gas where the brighter emission is associated with cooler , higher abundance material @xcite . a suggested origin for this material is gas which has been displaced from the central regions by the expanding radio lobe @xcite . in the right panel of figure \n [ fig : n507 ] we show new high resolution vla 1.4 ghz contours overlaid on the x - ray surface brightness image . \n the eastern radio lobe is seen to take a sharp bend to the south to trace the inner edge of the x - ray discontinuity , while the western radio lobe seems to be strongly interacting with the central icm , creating a possible depression between the two central x - ray peaks . \n there is no question that the observations obtained from @xmath1 and xmm have significantly advanced our understanding of the interactions between the central agn and the thermal gas in galaxy groups and clusters . \n it is clear that over a wide range of system masses the central agn has the ability to disrupt the thermal gas in the dense cores of these systems . \n a detailed understanding of these central interactions requires the addition of targeted multi - frequency radio data that is selected to probe both the relevant spatial scales for the system in question as well as a wide frequency range ( including low frequencies ) to track the radio outburst history of the central agn .    in this paper \n we presented a few cases of sources where new radio observations have changed the view of the system under study . in the case of abell 4059 \n it appears that the x - ray cavities are likely still undergoing active injection from the central agn and thus are not buoyantly rising detached lobes . \n the radio observations of the central source in abell 2597 reveal extended structures along several different position angles which are suggestive of multiple outbursts along possibly different initial directions . \n in the case of abell 262 the new radio observations reveal multiple structures along roughly the same position angle . these distinct structures may be signatures of different outburst episodes . \n adding up the total energy input into the icm from all radio outbursts seen in abell 262 suggests that the agn is more powerful than previously thought and is within a factor of two of being powerful enough to offset cooling over several outburst episodes . \n the presence of the extended radio emission toward the eastern region of abell 262 suggests that the low frequency radio flux is originating from detached buoyant lobes from past agn outbursts . using the observed projected offset of the radio structures from the cluster cores in abell 2597 and abell 262 together with the buoyant velocity in the systems we estimate a repetition timescale for the central agn of a few @xmath7 yr . \n this is significantly shorter than the typical assumption of @xmath8 yr . \n although there is some evidence of an x - ray deficit associated with one of the eastern emission regions in abell 262 we note that it is relatively difficult to detect x - ray cavities once they are located beyond the densest parts of the cluster cores @xcite . in these cases , \n low frequency radio observations provide an important tool for tracing the total energy input into the system to determine if it is sufficient to offset the radiative cooling . \n finally , in the case of ngc 507 we note that sensitive , high resolution radio images allow us to trace the interactions of the western radio lobe with the central x - ray structure . \n these observations also show the clear correspondence between the eastern radio lobe and the southern portion of the sharp surface - brightness discontinuity in the system . \n l. anderson , e.  l. blanton , t.  e. clarke et al . : in preparation e.  l. blanton , c.  l. sarazin , b.  r. mcnamara et al . : \n apj * 612 * , 817 ( 2004 ) y .- y . \n choi , c.  s. reynolds , s. heinz et al . \n : apj * 606 * , 185 ( 2004 ) t.  e. clarke , e.  l. blanton , c.  l. sarazin et al . : in preparation t.  e. clarke , c.  l. sarazin , e.  l. blanton et al . : apj * 625 * , 748 ( 2005 ) t.  a. ensslin , s. heinz : a&a * 384 * , 27 ( 2002 ) a.c . \n fabian et al : apj * 436 * , 63 ( 1994 ) a.  c. fabian , a. celotti , k.  m. blundell et al . \n : mnras * 331 * , 369 ( 2002 ) s. heinz , y .- y . \n choi , c.  s. reynolds et al . \n : apj * 569 * , 79 ( 2002 ) z. huang , c.  l. sarazin : apj * 496 * , 728 ( 1998 ) r.  p. kraft , w.  r. forman , e. churazov et al . \n : apj * 601 * , 221 ( 2004 ) b.  r. mcnamara , m.  w. wise , p.  e.  j. nulsen et al . : apj * 562 * , 149 , ( 2001 ) c.  p. odea , s.  a. baum , j. mack , et al . \n : apj * 612 * , 131 ( 2004 ) w.  r. oegerle , l. cowie , a. davidsen , et al . : apj * 560 * , 187 ( 2001 ) p. parma , h.  r. de ruiter , c. fanti et al . : \n a&as * 64 * , 135 ( 1986 ) j.  r. peterson , a.  c. fabian : physics reports * 427 * , 1 ( 2006 ) c.  l. sarazin , j.  o. burns , k. roettiger et al . \n : apj * 447 * , 559 ( 1995 )", "StartTimeOffset": 1092583580556, "RequestID": "28463948d03e4cce622a77a455894308930315c7", "TotalTokens": 3716}
{"ContextTokens": 1295, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "the two most frequently applied early - type galaxy distance indicators are the fundamental plane ( fp , and the related @xmath0-@xmath1 ) and surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) methods . in a recent study ( blakeslee  2001,2002 ) \n , we used @xmath2- and @xmath3-band data from the ground - based sbf survey ( tonry  2001 ) to calculate fp photometric parameters for 170 galaxies with velocity dispersions available in the homogenized smac catalogue ( hudson  2001 ) . to our knowledge , this is the largest galaxy - by - galaxy comparison of different standard candle / rod distance methods to date . \n fig.1a shows the comparison . \n overall the distance agreement was good , but several low - luminosity , s0 galaxies had systematically low fp distances , probably due in part to younger ages and lower mass - to - light ratios , although aperture effects may also contribute . \n the sbf distances are tied to the cepheids via measurements in spiral bulges , while the fp distances are tied to the hubble flow via distant clusters ; the hubble constant that results from this comparison is @xmath4 . \n however , we also derived independent distances for these galaxies based on their velocities and the gravity field inferred from the redshift - space galaxy density ; the resulting comparison with sbf yields @xmath5 ( fig.1b ) , formally discordant at the 2@xmath6 level with the fp - sbf result , but within the range of the systematic uncertainties in the various ties . \n another interesting facet of this work relates to the `` fluctuation number '' @xmath7 , which measures the galaxy luminosity in units of the weighted mean stellar luminosity . \n correlates tightly with stellar velocity dispersion ; it also correlates with galaxy color and is independent of galactic extinction . \n interestingly , sbf distances calibrated using the properties of , such as those shown in fig.1b , can be viewed as a hybrid of sbf and fp distances , and may be more accurate than those calibrated from galaxy color alone . \n we plan to investigate these issues in more detail . \n cepheids occur only in spirals and other late - type , star - forming galaxies . however , the most massive virialized structures in the nearby universe ( e.g. , the virgo , fornax , and centaurus clusters ) , are overwhelmingly dominated by early - type galaxies . although some spirals appear in projection against the virgo core , \n the various secondary indicators tied to the cepheid scale indicate that these galaxies are not at the same distance as the core ellipticals ( e.g. , tonry  2000 ; ferrarese  2000 ; kelson  2000 ; blakeslee  2002 ) . \n alternatively , it may be that the secondary indicators are yielding systematically different results for the calibrating spirals and the target ellipticals . \n we have an ongoing cycle  10 wfpc2 program to calibrate the early - type galaxy distance scale via cepheid distances to late - type galaxies that are physically associated with ellipticals . \n the target galaxies are the ngc4647/ngc4649 pair ( fig.2a ) and ngc5128 ( cena ) , an elliptical with a central dust lane and associated star formation , apparently resulting from the incursion of a gas - rich dwarf . \n the cena cepheid observations have yielded more than 60 superb cepheids , making this one of largest high - quality hst cepheid data sets . at present \n , we are still finalizing the analysis , but fig.2b shows some example light curves ; differential extinction within cena is a major issue for this program . \n sbf and type ia supernovae ( sneia ) studies have in the past disagreed on @xmath8 at the @xmath920% level , which is surprising for two methods that routinely achieve 510% internal accuracy . \n the excellent resolution of hst provides an enormous advantage over ground - based data for sbf studies , and we have recently used wfpc2 to measure high - quality hst / wfpc2 sbf distances to seven early - type galaxies that have hosted well - observed sneia ( ajhar  2001 ) . \n the results showed excellent agreement in the relative distances , but an offset of @xmath90.25 mag in zero points , which we traced to the different , and indeed dissonant , compilations of cepheid distances used in the past for the respective zero - point calibrations of the two methods . \n when calibrated consistently , sbf and sneia also agree in an absolute sense ( fig.3a ) and give @xmath10 . \n this is the first time the agreement has been demonstrated through a direct comparison of statistically significant samples of sbf and sneia galaxy distances . \n the most pressing problem in the measurement of extragalactic distances appears to be systematic uncertainties in the zero points . \n we have seen that there is significant uncertainty in the zero - point tie of the early - type galaxy distance scale to cepheids , but perhaps even greater is the uncertainty in the cepheid zero point itself , in part due to the poorly - constrained lmc distance . \n stellar population models can be used to predict sbf magnitudes and colors for a large range of metallicities and ages ( e.g. , blakeslee , vazdekis , & ajhar 2001b ) . \n these models reproduce the observed sbf colors and behaviors very well , but predict an sbf zero point fainter than the cepheid - calibrated one by @xmath11mag in @xmath3 ( the only band in which sbf is directly tied to the cepheids via spiral bulges ) . \n however , the model and empirical zero points would come into close agreement if the cepheid scale were revised to agree with the dynamical distance to the ngc4258 water maser ( herrnstein  1999 ) , for example , by changing the assumed lmc distance modulus from 18.5 to 18.3 mag . \n further refinements of the models should provide more stringent tests of the distance scale and guide future sbf programs ( fig.3b ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1101907084452, "RequestID": "c359f3fbf20a7b74aeaae4176f26cf7bdeb5b587", "TotalTokens": 1428}

perturbative nature of multiparticle production in a soft region , one has to apply the various semiphenomenological approaches , such as the model of quark - gluon string formation . at high energies , due to multiparton interactions \n , the formation of several pairs of strings becomes possible . \n the interaction between the strings could be observed as a collective phenomena in pp collisions . \n experimentally , the multiplicity correlation coefficient , defined as @xmath0 , has been measured in a wide energy range @xcite as a function of pseudorapidity windows width , their position and transverse momentum region . in the present paper , \n we study @xmath1 using the monte carlo model , that incorporates string collectivity effects in the form of string fusion @xcite , and compare the results with the data at @xmath2 from 200 to 7000 gev . \n the monte carlo model @xcite is based on the partonic picture of nucleon interaction . \n it preserves the energy and angular momentum conservation in the nucleon initial state and uses the dipole approach @xcite for description of elementary partonic collisions . \n multiplicity and transverse momentum are obtained in the approach of colour strings , stretched between projectile and target partons . \n the interaction of strings is realized in accordance with the string fusion model prescriptions @xcite . \n namely the mean multiplicity @xmath3 and the mean transverse momentum @xmath4 of the particles produced from a cluster of @xmath5 overlapping strings are related to those ( @xmath6 ) from a single string : @xmath7{k } { p_t}_{1}.$ ] for realization of the string fusion prescription , we have used the discrete approach , in which a lattice with the cell area equal to the string transverse area @xmath8 is introduced . \n the strings are thought to be fused if their transverse position centres belong to the same cell . for the multiplicity from one string ( or a cluster of fused strings ) we used poisson distribution , with gaussian transverse momentum spectra of produced particles . however , in order to provide to provide the possibility of a direct comparison with experimental data , the correct description of the transverse momentum spectra is required . for this purpose \n the mc model @xcite has been extended by taking into account the hardness of elementary collision . for this \n the mechanism similar to the one in dipsy event generator @xcite , has been incorporated in our model with the string fusion . \n it was assumed that the hardness an elementary collision is inversely proportional to the transverse size of the interacting dipoles : @xmath9 the mean transverse momentum of particles produced by a single string has the contributions from both edges of the string plus the additional constant term @xmath10 , corresponding to the intrinsic string transverse momentum : @xmath11 . \n accordingly , in the version with string fusion , the transverse momentum of a cluster of strings : @xmath12 where @xmath13 . \n parameters of the model are constrained from the data on total inelastic cross - section and multiplicity@xcite . in the present study , for the case with string fusion \n we have used @xmath14 ( in the case with string fusion ) . for the intrinsic string transverse momentum \n we have used @xmath15 , which provides a reasonable description of the transverse momentum distribution in pp collisions at the lhc energies . \n ) at midrapidities ( @xmath16 ) . \n lines  the results of calculation in the model with and without string fusion , points  the experimental data @xcite.,scaledwidth=90.0% ] \n figure [ fig : mv ] shows the dependence of the correlation coefficient on the width of the pseudorapidity windows at three energies . the cuts on the transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) applied in mc model calculations , \n enable direct comparison with the alice experimental data @xcite . \n it was found that the general trends , like the growth of @xmath18 with collision energy and width of pseudorapidity windows ) are well described by the model . \n the role of string fusion raises with @xmath2 , but using only midrapidity experimental data on multiplicity correlation coefficient at present energies it is hard to distinguish between cases with and without string fusion . also , it should be noted that at the small gap between rapidity windows there is a contribution of short - range correlation effects in the data ( such as the decays of resonances ) , which are currently not accounted by the model .        in fig . \n 2 the dependence of @xmath18 on the transverse momentum region of accounted particles is shown . \n the correlation coefficient is studied as the function of the lower bound of the @xmath19 interval , and compared to the atlas experimental data @xcite . \n the qualitative agreement of @xmath18 with experimental data is found . \n the increase of @xmath20 is accompanied by the decrease of the multiplicity in the given transverse momentum region , which restricts the phase space for particle production and the number of `` active '' strings , which leads to the decrease of correlation coefficient . \n numerically , the model calculations overestimate the value of the correlation coefficient in the hard transverse momentum area . \n it could be an indication that the direct approach with the soft strings is applicable at the @xmath19 region below @xmath21 , and different processes ( such as jet fragmentation ) begin playing a role at higher @xmath19 . \n on the other hand , this dependence is very sensitive to the shape of the transverse momentum spectra . whereas , the description of the @xmath19 spectra in our approach has an effective character and does not account the jet production and other hard phenomena accurately . \n figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the dependence of @xmath18 on the @xmath22 at four energies , calculated in the monte carlo model , with a comparison to the experimental data @xcite . \n the model calculations do not discriminate pp and @xmath23 scattering . \n the model reproduces the growth of the correlation coefficient with collision energy and qualitatively describes the decrease of the correlation coefficient with with increase of the gap between pseudorapidity windows . \n note that the short - range effects , such as the resonances decays and jets , which could contribute to the correlation coefficient at small @xmath22 are not accounted by the model . \n the results indicate that taking into account of the string fusion effects improves the agreement with the data . \n the forward - backward multiplicity correlation strength in pp collisions at high energy is studied in the monte carlo model with string formation and fusion . \n the monte carlo model reasonably describes the main features of the behaviour of the correlation coefficient in a wide energy range , such as general growth of the correlation coefficient with collision energy and with increase of pseudorapidity window size . \n the decrease of @xmath18 with the increase of the gap between windows and with increase of the lower @xmath24 bound is also qualitatively described . \n it is found that the version of the model with inclusion of string fusion effects is better supported by the data compared to the case without string fusion . \n the authors acknowledge saint -

algorithm to extract the frequencies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n we generalize this method to avoid an interpolation preprocessing step , which generally adds high noise to the signal , and improve the system performance by using a new stop criterion to avoid overfitting problems . \n the experimental results are obtained comparing our methodology with the others known in literature ( see @xcite

signal @xmath3 and random errors @xmath4 : @xmath5 . \n the problem we are dealing with is how to estimate fundamental frequencies which may be present in the signal @xmath6 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n if @xmath7 is measured at uniform time steps ( even sampling ) there are a lot of tools to effectively solve the problem which are based on fourier analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n these methods , however , are usually unreliable for unevenly sampled data @xcite . for instance , the typical approach of resampling the data into an evenly sampled sequence , through interpolation , introduces a strong amplification of the noise which affects the effectiveness of all fourier based techniques which are strongly dependent on the noise level . to solve the problem of unevenly sampled data , we consider two classes of spectral estimators :    spectral estimators based on fourier trasform ( least squares methods ) ;    spectral estimators based on the eingevalues and eingevectors of the covariance matrix ( maximum likelihood methods ) . \n classic periodogram @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , lomb s periodogram @xcite , scargle s periodogram @xcite , dcdft @xcite are the methods of the first class that we use , while music @xcite , @xcite , and esprit @xcite belong to second class . \n the methods based on the covariance matrix are more recent and have great potentiality . \n starting by this consideration , we develop a method based on the music estimator . \n it is compared with classic methods to highlight the results . \n in the last years several papers dealed with learning in pca neural nets @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite finding advantages , problems and difficulties of such neural networks . in what follows we shall use a robust

@xmath14 is learning function because it has been experimentally shown that it is the best performing one in our problem @xcite , @xcite . \n our neural estimator ( ne ) can be summarized as follows :    * preprocessing : calculate and subtract the average pattern to obtain zero mean process with unity variance . \n interpolate input data if it is the case . \n * initialize the weight matrix and the other neural network parameters ; * input the @xmath15 pattern @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 is the number of input components . * \n calculate the output for each neuron @xmath18 . * \n modify the

the weight matrix columns after the learning . \n the estimated signal frequencies are obtained as the peak locations of the function of following equation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the @xmath23th neural network weight vector after learning , and @xmath24 is the pure sinusoidal vector . in the case of an interpolation preprocessing @xmath25^{h}$ ] . in the generalization to \n non interpolated input data , @xmath26^{h}$ ] where @xmath27 are the first @xmath28 components of the temporal coordinates of the uneven signal . \n when @xmath29 is the frequency of the @xmath23th sinusoidal component , @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in practice \n we have a peak near and in corrispondence of the component frequency . \n estimates are related to the highest peaks    furthermore , to optimize the performance of the pca neural networks , we stop the learning process when @xmath33 @xmath34 , so avoiding overfitting problems . \n in fact leaving the stop condition used in the ne causes to the ne to find periodicities not present in the signal , while the new condition preserves it from this problem . \n a simple example is illustrated in figure 2 where we can see how the frequency identification varies depending on the stop condition ( see next section for signal information ) . \n in fact , without the early stopping ( see figure 2.b ) , @xmath35 after @xmath36 epochs remains at a value between @xmath37 and @xmath38 and we can not know when the system reaches the best performance . \n the new stopping criterion , instead , permits to @xmath35 to have a final value about @xmath39 just after @xmath40 epochs ( see figure 2.a ) . \n many experiments on synthetic and real signals were made , and in this paper we present the results obtained with one specific real signal , which highlights the main features of our problem . \n the real signal is related to the cepheid su cygni @xcite . \n the sequence was obtained with the photometric technique ubvri and the sampling made from june to december 1977 . \n the light curve is composed by 21 samples , and has a period of @xmath41 , as shown in figure 1 . \n the first experiment is concerning the interpolation . in this case \n we apply three different methods by using the signal processing mathlab @xmath42 toolbox : linear , cubic and spline , because they are quite simple and the most used ones . in figure 3 \n there is a plotting of the interpolating functions and the frequency estimates obtained by the ne with the spline interpolated signal as input .    in this case , the parameters of the ne are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 . \n the estimate frequency interval is @xmath47 $ ] . \n the estimated frequency without interpolation is @xmath48 ( 1/jd ) . \n a comparison is made with the other methods cited in a previous section and the experimental results are shown in figure 4 and in table 1 . \n only the lomb s periodogram is in agreement with the right periodicity , but showing some spurious peaks . \n furthermore , if we enlarge the frequency window for the two best performing methods , while the ne continues to work well , the lomb s periodogram does not work at all as illustrated in figure 5 . \n in this paper we have illustrated an improved technique based on pca neural networks and music to estimate the frequency of unevenly sampled data . \n it has been shown that it obtains good results on real data ( here we used the su cygni light curve ) compared with other well - known methods . \n in fact , it obtains a good estimate of the signal frequency also with few unevenly sampled inputs , it reduces the noise problems related to input data interpolation , it optimizes the convergence by introducing an early stopping criterion , and , finally , it is more resistant to the dimension of the frequency windows . \n future research lines regard the introduction of genetic algorithms to optimize the weight initialization of the pca neural networks and to use filters to extract and identify one frequency at each time when dealing with multi - frequency signals . \n m. rasile , l. milano , r. tagliaferri

[ agb ] ) by two nuclear burning shells , one burning he above a degenerate c - o core and another burning h , below a deep convective envelope . in between lies the intershell region composed mostly of he . \n the he - burning shell is thermally unstable , flashing every 10@xmath3  years or so . \n the energy produced by the thermal pulse ( tp ) drives a convective pocket in the he - intershell which acts to homogenize abundances within that region . after the occurrence of a tp \n the convective envelope may move inwards and mix products of partial he - burning ( mostly he left unburnt and c , see fig . \n [ agb ] ) from the core to the stellar surface . \n this is the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , and is the mechanism responsible for turning ( single ) stars into c stars , where c / o @xmath4 in the surface layers . \n the tdu also mixes heavy elements produced by the @xmath5 process from the he - shell to the surface , where they were created during the previous interpulse @xcite . \n following dredge - up , the star contracts , the h - shell is re - ignited and the star enters the interpulse phase where h - burning provides most of the luminosity .    hot bottom burning ( hbb ) can occur for stars with @xmath2 , when the base of the convective envelope dips into the top of the h - shell resulting in a thin layer hot enough to sustain proton - capture nucleosynthesis . \n observational evidence for hbb includes the lack of bright c - rich agb stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) @xcite ; many of these stars are also rich in li and @xmath5 process elements . \n hbb converts c into n and will prevent the atmosphere from becoming c rich @xcite . \n the copious amounts of n produced in this case will be primary owing to the primary c being dredged from the he - shell . \n intermediate - mass evolution is sensitive to the initial composition and the mass - loss law used in the calculation @xcite , where the minimum stellar mass for hbb is pushed to lower mass in lower metallicity models . \n there is evidence from agb stellar spectra @xcite , and from pre - solar grains @xcite that `` extra - mixing '' processes are also operating in low - mass ( @xmath6 ) agb stars , along with the tdu . \n the physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the extra mixing are not known , although various processes have been proposed including rotation and thermohaline mixing . \n the presence of a binary companion could have dramatic consequences for the evolution and nucleosynthesis , however i leave discussions to izzard , taam and podsiadlowski ( these proceedings ) . \n owing to fact that calculating a tp - agb model is a computationally intensive task , synthetic agb models , which use fitting formulae to model the evolution quickly , have proved to be a successful approach for population syntheses studies that require @xmath7 stars . \n historically this approach was validated by the fact that the stellar luminosity on the agb is nearly a linear function of the core mass @xcite , although this relation breaks down for stars undergoing hbb @xcite . \n synthetic agb models have successfully been used to model agb populations @xcite , and compute stellar yields @xcite . \n many of the parameterizations used in synthetic evolution studies are derived from detailed stellar models , such as the growth of the h - exhausted core with time , and as such are only accurate over the range in mass and metallicity of the stellar models they are based upon . \n an example is provided by @xcite who compute agb yields for initial masses between 0.9 and 8@xmath1 whereas the interpulse - period - core mass relation @xcite they use was only derived for stars with initial masses between 1 and 3@xmath1 . \n what affect this has on the yields is unclear since this relation will affect the number of tps during the tp - agb phase and hence the level of chemical enrichment . \n recent improvements in computer power mean that grids of detailed agb models can now be produced in a reasonable time @xcite ; however producing yields from @xmath8 agb stars for any given metallicity range is still challenging . \n for this reason synthetic models are still preferred for some applications . \n an example of the difference between detailed models and the fits used in synthetic agb algorithms is shown in fig . \n [ tau - ip ] for the interpulse - period core mass relation . \n we show results from detailed agb models of solar composition against two commonly used fits . \n the fits are a reasonable match to the detailed models with small core masses ( @xmath9 ) , but under - estimate the growth of the interpulse period for larger core masses . \n years ) as a function of core mass ( @xmath1 ) for the @xmath10 stellar models ( colored dots ) . \n the fits from @xcite ( dashed line ) and @xcite ( solid black dots ) are shown for comparison . \n [ tau - ip],title=\"fig : \" ] + \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in @xcite we present yields for pn , where we integrate the amount of matter lost over the last two tps . in table \n [ pnyield ] we show an example of the yields for a 3@xmath1 progenitor of solar composition . \n the columns contain the species @xmath11 , the atomic weight @xmath12 , followed by the net yield ( in @xmath1 ;

of - sight producing no residual . \n the timing residual amplitude will also increase with the source period . \n an example of the pre - fit timing residuals that would remain in the timing of a perfectly modeled pulsar @xmath12kpc away , due to the inspiral of two @xmath13 smbhs , can be seen in figure  [ fig : exampleresidual ] . \n kpc , with an angular separation between the source and the pulsar of @xmath14rads , caused by the coalescence of two @xmath13 black holes at a distance of 1gpc.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the low frequency component of the residual from the signal passing the pulsar can easily be distinguished from the high frequency component as the signal passes the earth . \n pulsar timing residuals observed before the smbh merger is seen in lisa would contain both components of the signal , although the high frequency component would likely be too high to be observed , but pulsar observations after the event is seen in lisa would only contain the low frequency ( i.e. at the pulsar ) component . \n lisa is expected to be launched within the next 1015 years , with a similar timescale to the proposed development of the ska , meaning there could be overlap between their operation . on these timescales \n the pulsar community hope to be timing many pulsars with @xmath15ns ( or less ) precision . however , overlap between these two experiments is not necessary for complementarity to exist between lisa and pulsar timing , as archive pulsar timing data could be looked at once lisa observations have been made , or vice versa . \n thus even current pulsar timing data sets could be useful , and would indeed give a longer time baseline of data to study in the future . \n first we will discuss a toy model showing one way in which lisa observations and pulsar timing could be complementary under a set of extremely optimistic assumptions : a method of pulsar distance determination . \n this application is more for use as a way of opening up discussion into other areas of complementarity than for its real world applicability . \n for the high signal - to - noise ratio inspirals seen with lisa the parameters describing the signal , including the source sky location , can be very well constrained . \n consequently the equivalent waveform present in the pulsar timing data can be approximated such that the only unknown is the distance to the pulsar . \n this provides a way of obtaining pulsar distances , for the stable millisecond pulsars used in gw searches at least , independently of the galactic electron density distribution model @xcite used in dispersion measure distance estimates , which can have large uncertainties @xcite . \n however , for such pulsars high precision measurements of parallax or the orbital period derivative have , and will in the future , be used to give extremely precise distance measurements with errors of order @xmath16 ( see e.g. @xcite . ) here we will see if our method can be competitive with these other methods . \n we create five years of data prior to a lisa observed merger , consisting of 500 equally spaced observations , containing a signal from a simulated system of two black holes with redshifted masses of @xmath17 at @xmath18 . \n this kind of system would be just within the lisa sensitive band before merger . \n we consider a pulsar with an angular separation of @xmath19 from the smbh binary , at a distance of @xmath12kpc , and , to estimate the limiting potential of this method , firstly subject to a highly _ _ \n un__realistic timing residual noise of around 0.02ns ( note that expected residuals will be of order 10100ns . ) in this case the pulsar distance can be determined to about 12% accuracy ( see figure  [ fig : distanceestimate ] . \n ) however , if the residual noise becomes just a few times larger the distance estimation will substantially degrade . \n black holes at @xmath18 and gaussian white noise with standard deviations of 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 and 0.08ns.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to obtain pulsar distances with a few percent error ( e.g. comparable to those in @xcite ) , using the potentially obtainable timing residuals of 100ns ( with the ppta ) up to 10ns @xcite would require the smbh system to be @xmath20 and @xmath21mpc away respectively . \n such high mass ( @xmath22 ) inspirals within these distance ranges are extremely rare ( see @xcite for predictions of event rates ) and lower mass systems would need to be even closer to give decent pulsar distance estimates . from this study \n it can be seen that the orbital period derivative and parallax methods show far better promise as a realisable and accurate pulsar distance measurement than our method . \n the ring - down of the smbh formed after mergers offers a better lisa detection rate for high mass systems ( greater than a few @xmath23 ) , due to their higher signal frequency and visibility to larger distances @xcite \n . however , lisa will be unable to obtain information about the inspiral phase for these systems . \n pulsar timing observations might , then , provide an opportunity to probe this unseen inspiral stage of the merger . \n some constraints on the system parameter space and the time of coalescence seen by lisa will yield a trigger with which to search in pulsar timing data . \n current pulsar distance estimates could be used to aid the search . \n unfortunately the ring - down does not provide information on the source s sky position making the parameter space more complicated , although there may be other electromagnetic counterparts to the signal that could give the source position . \n preliminary work suggests that to see any of the smbh ring - downs that occur at a reasonable rate within the lisa band ( i.e. are at cosmological distances ) , would be impossible with any single pulsar observations using current and projected achievable timing residuals . \n however , if we consider the fact that observations of multiple pulsars will be made ( potentially hundreds to thousands of separate objects with the ska ) then a global fit using data from them all will help dig into the noise and could reveal a signal . \n multiple pulsar observations could also be used to estimate the source position . \n this work will be discussed more thoroughly in a future paper . \n with the advent of dedicated pulsar timing of the most stable pulsars direct gw detection via measurements of their timing residuals may soon be possible . \n there are certain events which could overlap between being observed in the planned space - based gw detector lisa ( or even more distant future space - based detectors ) and the pulsar timing data . \n we have suggested some ways in which such measurements could be complementary and reveal astrophysics that would be more difficult , or unobtainable , with one alone . using current , and \n near term projected , pulsar timing accuracies , the measurement of pulsar distances as described above would require a very serendipitous event . \n the reconstruction of the inspiral , for events only observed as ring - downs in lisa , again would likely require more very stable pulsars observations and a serendipitous loud , nearby merger . \n this area of investigation is intended for further study and will hopefully reveal other areas of complementarity . \n the authors would like to thank the organisers of the amaldi conference for an excellent meeting . \n the authors are also very grateful to george hobbs for the many constructive and useful comments during the preparation of this manuscript . \n 99                        kramer m , backer d c , cordes j m , lazio t j w , stappers b w and johnston s 2004 _ science with the square kilometre array _ ( new astronomy reviews 48 ) ed c carilli and s rawlings ( amsterdam : elsevier ) http://www.skatelescope.org/pdf/sciencebook/chap3.pdf[chapter 3 ]    jenet f a , hobbs g b , van straten w , manchester r n , bailes m , verbiest j p w , edwards r t , hotan a w , sarkissian j m and ord s m 2006 _ ap . j. _ * 653 * 15711576 ( _ preprint _ http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609013[astro-ph/0609013 ] )          verbiest j p w , bailes m , van straten w , hobbs g b , edwards r t , manchester r n , bhat n d r , sarkissian j m , jacoby b a and kulkarni s r 2008 precision timing of psr j0437 -

{"ContextTokens": 3471, "GeneratedTokens": 116, "SynthesizedBody": "bloch oscillating transistor ( bot ) was initially conceived as a quasiparticle to n cooper pairs converter in which the current gain @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 @xcite . \n however , it was soon realized that incoherent tunneling plays a crucial role and coherent bloch oscillations were impossible to reach without a resistive environment which was unrealistic from technological point of view @xcite . in regular bot devices , substantial current gains ( @xmath4 ) have been hard to achieve @xcite . \n recently , it has been demonstrated that large @xmath5-values can be obtained in devices whose characteristics are close to bistable behavior @xcite . \n the base current can have two different steady - state values in the hysteretic regime and , consequently , the onset of hysteresis corresponds to a bifurcation point where the current gain of the device diverges . \n the applications of a bot are expected to be mostly in metrology @xcite , dealing with source resistances of a few m@xmath1 at low frequencies below 1 khz @xcite . \n one of the remarkable features of all bots is that they may operate below the shot noise limit as clearly demonstrated in ref . \n @xcite where a suppression factor of 4 was reached at base current 60 pa and input referred current noise , @xmath6 fa/@xmath7 was obtained . in this work \n we further suppress the shot noise by choosing to work with bot devices in which the onset of hysteresis can be tuned at small base currents . when operated near the onset of hysteresis , \n the regular current amplifier description is insufficient with realistic source impedances as the input impedance and the optimum noise impedance are also expected to diverge along with current gain @xcite . \n hence , the relevant figures of merit are the transconductance gain and the voltage noise which are experimentally characterized in the present work . \n one of the challenges of high - sensitivity , low - noise measurements is their susceptibility against external perturbations . as a consequence , \n differential amplifier stages are commonly preferred since they can eliminate common mode disturbances and detect only the differential signal from the source . in this paper \n , we also study the applicability of bots for differential measurements . \n we have connected two bots in a manner where we have been able to bias them separately with opposite bias voltages ( currents ) and measure the sum and difference signals in current and transconductance gain modes while changing the common mode ( cm ) signal , either voltage or current . \n we characterize the results in terms of common mode rejection ratio ( cmrr ) which is found to be 20 db even without properly optimizing the operating point in a slightly asymmetric device . \n moreover , we compare the noise properties of the bot in current and transconductance gain modes . \n the bot samples employed in this work were fabricated on oxidized si substrates . \n lor 3b was spun at 2000 rpm for 60s and baked on hot plate at 150 c for 10 mins . \n we repeated it for two times which gives total thickness of lor of @xmath8 800 nm . \n 20 nm thick ge was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.3  / s . \n pmma was spun at 4000 rpm on ge layer followed by baking for 3 mins at 170 c. rate of deposition of ge and baking of pmma found to be two important factors which play a role to generate cracks in ge film . \n the bot structures were patterned on this layer using e - beam lithography at 20 kev . \n after pattering the chips were subjected to mibk : ipa ( 1:3 ) solution for developing , followed by reactive ion etching with @xmath9 plasma to etch away the ge through the pmma window . \n finally , the lor under the germanium was etched in oxygen plasma up to the desired extent of undercut in an inductively coupled plasma etcher with temperature control for the substrate holder . \n shadow angle evaporation at four different angles was employed to generate the structures consisting of three metals . \n the process order in the evaporation sequence was ( ) chromium , ( ) aluminum , ( ) oxidization , ( ) aluminum , and ( ) copper . \n oxidation was done in ar : o@xmath10 ( 6:1 ) mixture at 80 mtorr for 1 min . \n nmp or pg remover was used for lift - off .    in short , al-@xmath11-al squid forms the emitter electrode while a cr thin film resistor works as the collector , and normal metal - insulator - superconductor ( nis ) junction corresponds to the base . even though the nominal process parameters for the bots on the same chip were equal , the characteristics of the individual devices varied substantially , as can be seen from table [ botparams ] which summarizes the parameters for the measured differential pair . \n the underlying cause is attributed to the nonuniform bending of the ge mask after the etching that was employed to create the undercut . due to this reason , \n angle evaporation of different metals did not give exactly identical sample structures among all the samples on the chip . \n lllllllll bot # & @xmath12&@xmath13&@xmath14 & @xmath15&@xmath16 + 1 & 53 & 27 & 550 & 17 & 40 + 2 & 123 & 19 & 660 & 18 & 45 +      the measurements were done on a plastic dilution refrigerator ( pdr-50 ) from nanoway ltd . \n the base temperature of the refrigerator was 50 mk . \n the filtering in the pdr consisted of 70 cm long thermocoax cables on the sample holder and 1 k@xmath1 series resistors at 1.5 k. also , microwave filters from mini - circuits ( blp 1.9 ) were used at the top of the cryostat in the bias lines . \n the electronic temperature , deduced from the @xmath17 characteristics , turned out to be 150 mk , which is presumably due to joule - heating of the extremely thin cr resistors . \n aluminum bonding wires were used to connect the e , b and c ( see fig . [ botschema ] ) contact - pads to the sample holder . \n surface - mount , metallic thin film resistors of @xmath18 k@xmath1 ( 510 k@xmath1 at 100 mk ) were soldered on the sample holder itself ; the whole configuration was cooled to base temperature to minimize the thermal noise coming from the resistors @xmath19 . \n two @xmath19s were connected to common - mode port with thin copper wire . in the transconductance @xmath20 and input impedance measurements @xmath21 , we measured the current through @xmath19 , which allowed us to determine the current division of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the base . \n knowledge on the division allowed us to determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the bots simultaneously . \n the base electrodes of the bots were dc biased , either by current or voltage depending on the configuration on the cm port . \n base currents were fed via equally large resistors @xmath26 g@xmath1 , located at room temperature . \n ground contact at the other end of @xmath19 converted the current bias into voltage bias . \n voltages at the base and at the collector were tracked by li-75a amplifiers while currents were measured using dl1211 preamplifiers . for noise measurement , \n sr780 spectrum analyzer was employed . \n first , we characterized both samples in the current bias mode and measured the current gain ( @xmath27 ) on the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 plane . \n similar cross - over curve between stable and bistable operation was observed as found in ref . \n @xcite . near the bifurcation point , \n large gains were obtained and we chose to operate in a regime where the cross - over curve is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath29 , which was expected to improve the long term stability of the cmrr measurement . \n close to the divergence point , it is also easy to tune the current gains to @xmath30 for the cmrr measurement . \n unfortunately , when the cm port was fed using current , the cmrr was found to be poor . \n this was traced back to the difference in @xmath31 values of the bots , because an equally large relative difference is there in the input impedances as @xmath32 . \n the main obstacle in balancing between @xmath24 values is the variation in the @xmath8 6.5 nm thick chromium resistor which is difficult to control within a few percent in our lithographic process . \n therefore , the common mode current is divided unevenly between the bots and no proper cancellation is achieved . \n hence , we conclude that the operation of a differential bot pair is more difficult in current gain mode than in transconductance regime where it is sufficient to match just the gains . \n second , we grounded the resistors @xmath19 and traced out the transconductances of the two bots ( @xmath33 g@xmath1 ) . in order to measure @xmath25 along the whole @xmath34 characteristics \n , we traced @xmath35 using different values for @xmath28 . \n @xmath36 was calculated by subtracting two @xmath37 traces for two different base currents , whereas @xmath38 was determined from the change in the division of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . \n [ cmdata]a shows the measured @xmath25 for both bots plotted against voltage @xmath39 . \n the absolute maximum value of transconductance peaks appear in the negative resistance regime of @xmath34 curves . \n the maximum for @xmath25 is found to vary from 2 @xmath40s to 9 @xmath40s in the present samples which corresponds to @xmath41 to @xmath42 . \n this coincides well with the simulations of ref . \n the transconductance was recorded across the hysteretic point of the current gain , but no abrupt change was found in @xmath25 . \n this finding reflects the fact that both @xmath24 and @xmath5 diverge and @xmath43 @xcite .    for a differential bot \n we define the signal to be the emitter difference current of the bots . in a realistic configuration \n the post - amplification could be arranged , e.g. , by transforming the currents to magnetic fluxes with opposite polarities in a squid postamplifier . \n thus we can define the cmrr as @xmath44 when the magnitude of the base bias voltage is the same . \n due to opposite bias in the non - hysteretic regime ( @xmath45 ) we can have @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . \n if @xmath49 , @xmath50 would be fully independent of the common mode signal and cmrr = @xmath51 .    fig . \n [ cmdata]b shows one example of the effect of @xmath52 on the output current @xmath50 . in this case , the two bots were biased at the points where they have almost equal magnitude of transconductance , @xmath53 @xmath40s and @xmath54 @xmath40s , but the values of which may increase slightly with @xmath55 . \n nevertheless , as @xmath55 is varied , @xmath56 changes rather weakly , and the straight line in fig . \n [ cmdata]b yields a cmrr value of 20 db . \n we also performed equivalent input noise measurements on bots in the transconductance mode , connected to a 510 k@xmath1 source impedance . \n since the source impedance is clearly less than the impedance for noise optimum , we are mostly sensitive to the voltage noise generator of the amplifier . fig . \n [ noiseintrans ] shows the noise spectral density on the emitter terminal under current and voltage biased conditions . \n [ noiseintrans]a displays the input referred current noise when the device is used as a current amplifier . \n the blue trace is at the operating point with @xmath57 . \n the bandwidth was found to be @xmath8 20 hz , which is consistent with the @xmath58 input time constant with @xmath59 10 m@xmath1 . \n the input referred current noise exceeds @xmath60 below 10 hz , which indicates slightly more @xmath61 noise compared with ref . \n @xcite . \n the equivalent input voltage noise @xmath62 in the transconductance mode is displayed in fig . \n [ noiseintrans]b . \n we find @xmath63 10 nv/@xmath7 at the maximum @xmath64 @xmath40s . \n the bandwidth is around 200 hz which is limited by the output impedance of @xmath65 k@xmath66 . \n simultaneously with these noise measurements , we determined the input impedance and obtained @xmath24 = 6 m@xmath1 . using the obtained @xmath62 and @xmath24 \n , we estimate for the optimum impedance @xmath67=5 - 10 m@xmath1 . \n the uncertainty in @xmath67 arises from the different operating conditions in the determination of @xmath62 and @xmath68 . in order to deduce @xmath67 \n we have made the assumption that the equivalent input noise of the bot near the bistability point is governed by the output switching noise , which allows scaling of the noise sources between different conditions . \n this estimate for optimum impedance supports the theoretical result @xmath69 of ref . \n @xcite .    in the transconductance mode \n the output current noise is @xmath70 100 fa/@xmath7 , which sets the criterion for the post - amplification . \n this requirement can be met , e.g. , with squid - based post - amplifier @xcite . within the source resistance range 1 m @xmath1 @xmath71 , the bot transconductance amplifier over - performs squid - based amplifiers as @xmath72 is in the range of 1 - 10 fa/@xmath7 , i.e. , lower than the current noise of the state - of - the - art squid ammeters at low frequencies . \n in conclusion , we have performed transconductance ( current gain ) , voltage noise ( current noise ) , and input impedance measurements in voltage ( and current ) biased , galvanically coupled bloch oscillating transistors in a differential pair configuration . we found that biasing with voltage works better for the cmrr measurement , providing easily a rejection ratio of 20 db . \n the superiority of the transconductance mode is attributed to the fact that it is then sufficient to match just the @xmath25-values of the two amplifiers , while careful matching of @xmath24 in addition to gain @xmath5 is necessary in the current gain mode . in the transconductance mode \n , we find for the input referred voltage noise @xmath73 nv/@xmath7 at @xmath74 @xmath40s and @xmath75 m@xmath1 , with the @xmath61 corner frequency at around 5 hz . \n altogether , we can say that by matching the @xmath25 values of the two bots closer to each other coupled bots will make an excellent candidate for a transconductance amplifier in metrological cryogenic applications . \n we thank mikko paalanen and heikki sepp for fruitful discussion . \n we acknowledge micronova cleanroom facilities for fabrication of our samples . financial support by academy of finland , technology industries of finland centennial foundation and tekes is gratefully acknowledged . \n likharev k k and zorin a b 1985 theory of the bloch -

[ p89-fig-1 ] ) increasing by  10% the information about this important subsystem of the galaxy ( glushkova et al .  2009 ) . \n the results of the ongoing study , sai open clusters catalog , are presented in a vo - ready form at the project . \n apart from convenient presentation and necessary vo access interfaces , the site provides advanced vo experience by a java applet providing possibilities of the direct interaction ( launch and manipulation ) of client vo applications right from the web browser ( zolotukhin & chilingarian 2008 ) . \n there is an ongoing effort to observe these clusters with 1-m class telescopes to confirm reliability of our method . \n this study showcases the potential of all - sky surveys and the virtual observatory for homogeneous studies which is far from being exhausted . \n in order to constrain sizes of some x - ray binaries we undertake photometrical measurements of those which do not possess reliable optical or infrared counterparts . given the x - ray luminosity and the observed optical / nir flux it is possible to estimate accretion disk size and overall system extent . \n this allows us to discover new ultracompact low mass x - ray binaries which is a small and poorly - studied population of the galactic objects expected to emit gravitational waves . \n we used vo data discovery methods to check large existing observational collections for the data on potential candidates and found a number of observed sources of interest without published measurements . \n three low mass x - ray binaries , 4u1323 - 619 , igr j17254 - 3257 and slx 1735 - 269 ( see two of them in fig . \n [ p89-fig-2 ] ) were identified in archival data then ( eso , _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ archives used ) . in case of 4u1323 - 619 there was a mis - identification based on _ einstein _ \n x - ray observations with an underestimated error radius . even without reliable identification \n , one can establish upper limit on brightness of a source that immediately implies upper limit on its disk size . \n this study demonstrates the importance of vo methods of data discovery since existing rich observational archives may contain comprehensive datasets which can give us clues about nature of poorly - known binary populations . \n we cross - identified a spectral sample of sdss dr7 galaxies lying at @xmath1 with ukidss dr5 data , and fitted their spectra with simple stellar population models , thus constructing a catalog of 200k galaxies with @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry measurements , redshifts , spectra , ages and metallicities . \n this allowed us to determine simple yet precise analytical approximations of @xmath4-corrections having great practical value for extragalactic research ( chilingarian , melchior , & zolotukhin 2010 ) . \n the traditional @xmath4-correction computation techniques based on the sed - fitting , require the multi - color photometry , which often is not available . \n our approach allows one to compute rest - frame galaxy magnitudes of the same quality using a minimal set of observables including only two photometric points and a redshift . \n using iphas ( int photometric h@xmath5 survey ) we identified the x - ray source ax j194939 + 2631 from asca galactic plane survey that initially had 1  positional uncertainty which contained hundreds of objects in modern surveys . by imposing highly selective criteria it becomes possible to distinguish between background stars and the object of interest if it is included in the survey . assuming that some set of unidentified asca x - ray sources should have hydrogen - rich accretion disks and therefore exhibit h@xmath5 emission excess , we used the method similar to color - color diagram analysis proposed by witham et al . \n ( 2006 ) ( see left panel in fig . \n [ p89-fig-3 ] ) to extract emitters in fields of interest . \n in bright case of ax j194939 + 2631 we confirmed the nature of the most prominent h@xmath5 emitter in the field by means of optical spectroscopy ( see right panel in fig . \n [ p89-fig-3 ] ) . \n this use - case is listed as an example of the comprehensive vo examination in order to identify x - ray source with challenging positional uncertainty . \n chilingarian , i.  et al .  2009 , \n science , 326 , 1379 chilingarian , i. , melchior , a .- \n , & zolotukhin , i.  2010 , accepted to chilingarian , i.  2009 , in multi - wavelength astronomy and virtual observatory , ed . \n d.  baines & p.  osuna , 165 ;

{"ContextTokens": 2427, "GeneratedTokens": 166, "SynthesizedBody": "the spin - ordered phase of bcc @xmath0he presents a difficult challenge to accurate theoretical description @xcite . \n the main problem is to explain why the transition temperature @xcite of 10@xmath2k is two orders of magnitude larger than the nuclear dipolar interaction @xmath310@xmath4k . \n we propose that magnetic ordering is due to correlations in the zero point atomic motion . in this respect \n it is similar to the current multiple - spin exchange ( mse ) model @xcite , though the zero - point atomic motion in our model however does not involve the exchange of atoms @xcite . \n this model has conceptual problems that arise from the fact that in order to fit experimental data , many exchange cycles involving a large number of atoms are needed . \n in fact , it is not sure that this expansion converges @xcite , i.e. may not be the spin - ordering mechanism . additionally , \n an overall consistent description of the experimental data has still not been achieved @xcite . \n it is therefore of interest to consider the possibility of another approach . \n the zero - point correlations we consider can be described as zero - point electric dipoles @xcite , and lower the energy of the ground state @xcite . \n this coherent state of oscillating electric dipoles modifies the transverse t@xmath5(110 ) phonon spectrum . \n we show here that this zero - point motion produces an oscillating magnetic polarization of the electronic cloud which interacts with the nuclear spin . \n this hyper - fine type interaction has the right order of magnitude to be related to the spin - ordering transition , and leads naturally to the distinct u2d2 antiferromagnetic phase . \n at temperatures which are high compared to the magnetic interactions ( t@xmath61mk ) , the local zero - point motion in bcc @xmath0he can be treated in the same way as in @xmath7he @xcite . \n we begin by observing @xcite that the crystal potential is highly anisotropic in the bcc phase , being especially wide and anharmonic along the major axes ( 100,010,001 ) . \n this means that the atomic wavefunctions will be particularly extended in these directions , resulting in dynamic - correlations , to reduce the overlap energy . \n the current treatment using variational wavefunction @xcite incorporates these correlations using a jastrow - type function in a self - consistent harmonic ( sch ) calculation . \n this gives a satisfactory description of the phonon branches , except for the transeverse t@xmath5(110 ) phonon , which in reality is much softer . \n introducing cubic terms soften the phonon spectra , but now ruins the good agreement with the other branches . \n we would like to describe the softening of this transverse phonon as resulting from the hybridization of the ( virtual ) harmonic phonon with a ( virtual ) local mode @xcite . the coupling is described as dipolar , where this zero - point dipole moment arises due to correlated atomic motion in the normal axes . \n the harmonic description of the crystal potential misses the low - lying vibration of the atoms due to the shallow ( even double - well ) potential in the normal directions , which is the one responsible for the dynamic correlations . \n we therefore treat them as two independent degrees of freedom . in this hybridization procedure \n we do rely on the sch calculation , taken from previous works @xcite . \n directional oscillation of the nucleus will break the rotational symmetry of the nuclear position relative to the electronic cloud . going beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation , \n the energy due to relative nuclear - electronic fluctuations is @xcite : @xmath8k , where @xmath9 is the electron mass , @xmath10 the nuclear mass , and @xmath11 the excitation energy of the he . \n this is of the order of the energy involved in the zero - point mixing of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 electronic levels : @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . since the nuclear motions are perfectly correlated this polarization results in zero - point dipolar interactions @xcite . \n the dipolar interaction energy @xmath1 , of the order of @xmath16 , is the energy associated with the zero - point correlated oscillations of the atoms along the major axes . \n the ground - state of the crystal in which the zero - point motion of the atoms is correlated may be described as a global state of quantum resonance between the two degenerate configurations shown in fig.1 , each of which minimizes the dipolar interaction energy @xcite .    due to the lower symmetry of the dipolar array ( fig.1 ) compared to the crystal symmetry , a coupling between the harmonic phonons and the dipolar modulation exists only along the ( 110 ) direction @xcite . at the edge of the brillouin zone \n this transverse phonon has the energy @xmath1 . \n in addition there appears a localized excitation of energy @xmath17 , which is involved in mass diffusion and contributes to the specific - heat @xcite , i.e. a quantum analogue of a point defect . \n there is good agreement of our approach with the experimental data for the t@xmath5(110 ) spectrum for bcc @xmath18he @xcite . \n this approch has the advantage over current techniques of explicitly describing the main quantum effect of the anisotropic and anharmonic potential . \n it also resolves previous inconsistencies relating to the properties of vacancies .    in bcc @xmath19he , sound velocity data indicates that the slope of the t@xmath5(110 ) phonon is about half of the sch calculation @xcite . \n we predict that this ratio should indeed be 0.5 , and therefore take half the energy of the calculated @xcite sch t@xmath5(110 ) phonon at the edge of the brillouin zone to be the bare dipole - flip energy @xmath20k at v=21.5cm@xmath0/mole . according to our model \n , the energy of the localized mode involved in thermally activated self - diffusion is @xmath22k . \n this value is in excellent agreement with the activation energy measured by x - ray diffraction , ultrasonics and nmr experiments @xcite at v=21.5cm@xmath0/mole . \n a similar activation energy is also obtained from the excess specific heat @xcite , and pressure measurements @xcite . \n we therefore establish the likely occurance of coherent zero - point dipoles in the ground - state of bcc @xmath19he . \n we now describe the magnetic interaction arising from our model . \n the lowest @xmath23 level of the he atom has the electrons in a spin @xmath24 state due to strong exchange interaction @xcite , of the order of 0.25ev . \n in addition this level is split into 3 sublevels with @xmath25 . \n the splitting , due to spin - orbit coupling @xcite , is of the order of @xmath26k .  in the ground state \n , the @xmath27 electrons will reside in the @xmath28 sublevel , with an oscillating magnetic moment @xmath29 of size @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the magnetic moment of an electron . because part of the magnetic moment is now in the @xmath23 state \n , there appears a net uncanceled moment of equal size in the @xmath32 component of the electronic wavefunction . in @xmath0he \n the nuclear magnetic spin @xmath33 will interact with the oscillating electronic magnetic moment , mainly due to the contact term of the @xmath32 electron at the nucleus . \n the magnetic interaction is of the hyper - fine type @xcite , and the energy associated with it , @xmath34 , is given by : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the nuclear magnetic moment and the calculation of the matrix element follows @xcite . \n we show below that the maximum value of @xmath37mk ( for v=24 cm@xmath0/mole ) , much larger than the direct nuclear dipole - dipole interaction , and is of the right magnitude to explain the high transition temperature of nuclear ordering in bcc @xmath0he .    in our model , \n the magnetic energy will change with pressure due to changes of the electronic magnetic polarization @xmath29 . \n the main effect as the solid is compressed , is that the 3 sub - levels ( @xmath38 ) broaden into partially overlapping bands . \n the effect of the broadening of the sub - levels with pressure can be approximated using the overlap integral of the three sub - levels : @xmath39 , where the overlap integral @xmath40 is calculated for the spin - orbit levels using a simple band calculation . the level broadening is the coulomb energy of the @xmath27 electrons due to overlapping wavefunctions on neighboring he nuclei @xcite . \n we find that the overlap factor @xmath41 is very sensitive to volume , changing from 1 at v=24 cm@xmath0/mole to @xmath42 at v=19 cm@xmath0/mole . \n one can see that as the volume decreases the broadening of the bands increase , thereby decreasing the net magnetic polarization of the oscillating electronic cloud . \n the strength of the magnetic interaction should be proportional to the measured curie - weiss temperature @xmath43 . \n in fig.2 we compare the normalized magnetic splitting @xmath44 with the normalized values of the measured @xcite @xmath43 . \n we find that the volume dependence of agrees very well . \n we now consider the symmetry of the ordered spin system . \n the existence of the hyper - fine splitting means that the simple quantum resonance condition on each site is broken . \n now , the two antiferoelectric configurations shown in fig . 1 are not degenerate , with an energy difference of @xmath44 per site . \n it is possible to restore the degeneracy of the overall ground state , and hence the quantum resonance condition . \n the possible arrangements of the nuclear spins that fulfill the resonance requirement on each simple sublattice are those that ensure an equal number of atoms with electronic and nuclear spins aligned ( and anti - aligned ) in both degenerate configurations of the electronic dipoles . \n these arrangements preserve the overall time - reversal symmetry of the system at zero field . \n we therefore end up with an u2d2 arrangements which is the symmetry of the ordered nuclear phase @xcite . \n we point - out that the u2d2 phase results from symmetry considerations , independent of any quantitative parameters ( as in mse @xcite ) . \n to conclude , our model enables us to describe the nuclear magnetic ordering of bcc @xmath0he using a single parameter , which is the thermal activation energy @xmath1 . \n experimental values of @xmath1 were measured in several experiments . \n the model describes correctly both the symmetry of the ordered phase and the volume dependence of the magnetic interactions . \n this work was supported by the israel science foundation , by the technion vpr fund for the promotion of research , the fulbright foreign scholarship grant , the center for advanced studies and nsf grant no . \n phy-98 - 00978 . \n the reduction in the ground state energy due to this coherent state is of the same order as the energy difference between the hcp and bcc solid phases ( n. gov , to be published in _ phys . \n b _ july 2000 , cond -

{"ContextTokens": 3344, "GeneratedTokens": 167, "SynthesizedBody": "stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of massive o / ne white dwarfs as a result of carbon burning . \n wds with masses exceeding 1m@xmath0 should be such o / ne wds , but there are other ways to produce massive wds , namely by binary merging or by mass accretion during close - binary evolution . \n the question is : is there evidence for the existence of o / ne wds ? \n a very useful overview about this topic has been given by weidemann ( 2003 ) at the last wd workshop at naples . \n we refer to his paper for a detailed discussion and references concerning stellar evolution scenarios , which we only briefly summarize here . \n o / ne wds should have masses of 11.3m@xmath0 . \n below a core mass of 1m@xmath0 c burning can not ignite . \n if the core mass exceeds 1.3m@xmath0 , an electron capture collapse will occur and probably result in a neutron star . \n there is a debate as to what initial - mass range this 11.3m@xmath0 core - mass range corresponds . \n depending on details in evolutionary models , the range of initial masses is between 911m@xmath0 or between 79m@xmath0 ( for solar metallicity ) . in any case , in order to stop the o / ne - core to grow ( by c burning ) beyond the 1.3m@xmath0 limit , the star must loose mass , either by wind mass loss or by envelope removal in close binary systems . \n the wd mass distribution does show the existence of such massive wds , however , their origin is not clear . \n it is possible that they are binary mergers . \n if o / ne wds exist , then they have c / o envelopes and , thus , they are spectroscopically indiscernible from c / o wds . possible evidence , however , are observed neon overabundances in several cases : in neon novae , in some low - mass x - ray binaries , and in one individual object ( h1504 + 65 ) . \n we will discuss here the lmxbs and h1504 + 65 . in the case of neon novae , \n only those very few objects with extreme neon overabundances ( over @xmath130 times solar , i.e.  3% mass fraction ) suggest o / ne wds , because up to 3% @xmath2ne is expected in c / o wds .    for the interpretation of ne overabundances in novae or lmxbs \n it is important to consider gravitational settling of ne into the core of a c / o wd . \n this problem is not yet solved theoretically . \n it could well be , that ne overabundances observed in eroded wd cores are the result of this process and not the result of c burning . \n spectroscopically , h1504 + 65 is an extreme member among the pg1159 stars , which are hot , h - deficient objects on or closely before the hot end of the wd cooling sequence . \n they are probably the result of a late he - shell flash that causes ingestion and burning of h , and the exposition of he / c / o - rich intershell matter on the surface ( e.g.  werner 2001 ) . \n h1504 + 65 is an extreme , and unique , pg1159 star because it is also he - deficient . \n the first quantitative analysis revealed that the photosphere is mainly composed of c and o , by equal parts ( werner 1991 ) , and it has been discussed that h1504 + 65 is either a naked c / o core or that we see the c / o envelope of a o / ne wd . the latter possibility is supported by the fact that h1504 + 65 is the most massive known pg1159 star , although the spectroscopic mass determination suggests a mass slightly below 1m@xmath0 . from the discovery of ne lines in optical and euv spectra ( werner & wolff 1999 ) we found ne=25% . \n this result is inconclusive concerning the nature of the star as a possible o / ne wd . \n soft x - ray and fuv spectra of h1504 + 65 were taken by chandra / letg and fuse , respectively , and the following atmospheric and stellar parameters were derived ( werner et al . \n 2004 ) : @xmath3}\\ ] ] @xmath4 @xmath5 estimated errors for abundances are : @xmath620% for mass fraction of c and o , and a factor of 3 for ne and mg . \n one significant result is the detection of mg in high amounts , which seems to confirm the o / ne wd nature of h1504 + 65 . \n however , a detailed discussion reveals that the abundance determinations of ne and mg still can not decide if h1504 + 65 exposes a c / o core or a c / o envelope . the final answer to this problem \n was hoped to be accomplished by uv spectroscopy with hst . planned observations during cycle  13 aimed at the detection of \n na which , if strongly overabundant , is a clear indicator for c burning . \n unfortunately , the stis spectrograph aboard hst died before the observations were carried out . \n it appears that this question will remain unanswered for many years to come . \n this is disappointing , because h1504 + 65 is the only object for which we can hope to proof that single o / ne wds do really exist . \n considering our mass determination , even if we stretch the result to the limit of our error bar , the mass of h1504 + 65 is slightly below 1m@xmath0 . \n however , we point out that the evolutionary tracks which we used to derive the mass , are those of post - agb remnants that have lastly burned helium but  h1504 + 65 has no helium \n . there are no appropriate evolutionary tracks available . \n the main problem is that we have no idea what is the evolutionary history of this unique star : what event caused the helium - deficiency ? \n we finally note that there is no indication that h1504 + 65 is in a binary system . \n it could be that agb - like mass loss of single stars during carbon burning is not sufficient to stop the growth of the o / ne core before the onset of electron - capture collapse . \n hence , close binary systems in which mass is transferred from the c - burning star onto a companion might be the only places where o / ne wds are created . \n first evidence for the existence of such systems came from neon overabundances detected by line emission in ( low resolution ) asca spectra of the lmxb 4u1626 - 67 ( angelini et al . \n evidence for neon - rich absorbing circumstellar material was found in chandra letg spectra of 4u0614 + 091 and three other lmxbs ( juett et al . \n the detection of double - lined emissions in the chandra hetg spectrum of 4u1626 - 67 ( schulz et al . \n 2001 ) suggests neon and oxygen overabundances in the accretion disk of this system .    in total \n there is now a group of five lmxbs , for which it is believed that they are ultracompact systems ( orbital periods below 1 hour , i.e.  separation of the order 1 light - s ) in which a neutron star or a black hole accretes matter from a low - mass ( @xmath7m@xmath0 ) degenerate star , the strongly ablated core of a wd . \n mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation . \n the luminosity of these systems is dominated by the accretion disk . in the soft x - ray and uv spectral regions \n we see the hot ( several 100000k ) innermost parts of the disk , which can be x - ray heated by the neutron star . \n the optical light is dominated by cooler ( about 10000k ) , outer parts of the disk . \n so we have the unique possibility to study the former wd interior composition by the determination of element abundances in the accretion disk .    for this purpose \n we have obtained optical medium - resolution spectra of two of these systems ( 4u1626 - 67 and 4u0614 + 091 ) . \n we have used the fors1 spectrograph attached to ut1 of eso s very large telescope to record long - slit spectra . \n we used two grisms ( 600b and 600r ) and obtained spectra in the regions 34505900  and 52507450  with a resolution of about 5 . \n the b magnitude of both targets is near 18.7 ; exposure times for both binaries were 87 and 58 minutes for the red and the blue spectra , respectively . \n the observations were performed in service mode during nov . \n 2003 and mar .  2004 . \n the spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures . \n they are presented in fig.1 , and show emission lines from cii / iii and oii / iii . \n they lack hydrogen and helium lines , apparently confirming the h- and he - deficiency of the donor stars . in the case of 4u0614 + 091 \n we confirm the line identifications of nelemans et al . \n ( 2004 ) , who have obtained vlt / fors2 spectra with slightly higher resolution . \n in addition to these data , we also make use of archival hst / uv data of 4u1626 - 67 , kindly provided in reduced form by homer et al . \n the hst spectrum is shown in fig.2 . \n it shows emission lines from civ , ov , and siiv . \n it does not show heii  1640 .    we have begun the construction of accretion disk models to calculate synthetic spectra and report here on the current state of our work . \n we use our accretion disk code acdc , which is described in detail by nagel et al . \n in essence , it assumes a radial @xmath8-disk structure ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . \n then the disk is divided into concentric annuli . for each annulus \n we solve the radiation transfer equation ( assuming plane - parallel geometry ) together with the nlte rate equations , plus energy- and hydrostatic equations , in order to calculate a detailed vertical structure . \n the integrated disk spectrum is then obtained by co - adding the spectra from the individual annuli . in comparison with the observed uv / optical spectra we present here first model spectra for particular , representative disk regions . \n 4u1626 - 67 has an orbital period of 42  min ( see e.g.  chakrabarty 1998 , and references therein ) . the accretor is a 7.7s x - ray pulsar with a magnetic field strength of @xmath9 g . the donor s mass is smaller than 0.1m@xmath0 . \n the system separation is 300000 km . \n the inner disk edge is at the co - rotation radius , at r=6500 km from the pulsar , and the outer edge at the tidal truncation radius , near r=200000 km . \n the mass transfer rate is roughly @xmath10m@xmath0/yr and the x - ray luminosity is about @xmath11erg / s . \n fig.2 shows the uv spectrum of two disk models extending from r=650015000 km , seen under an inclination angle of 17@xmath12 . \n they are irradiated by the neutron star , assuming the x - ray luminosity mentioned above and a blackbody energy distribution ( t@xmath13k ) . \n the two models differ by their chemical composition . \n one model is he - poor ( dominated by c , o , ne , mg ) , the other is he - rich with abundances typical for he - rich disks in am  cvn systems . \n this comparison shows that neither model exhibits a clearly detectable heii  1640  line . \n hence the lack of this line in the hst spectrum is no proof of he - deficiency . \n the situation is perhaps more favorable in the optical region . in fig.1 \n we have plotted two model spectra from c / o dominated disk regions at r=70000 km , one without h and the other with trace h ( @xmath14 by number ) . \n a strong h@xmath15 emission is seen in the second case , which is not present in the observed spectra . \n although we have not yet performed this test with helium , we hope that we can derive a tight upper limit for the he abundance from the lack of hei lines . \n the parameters of the system 4u0614 + 091 are poorly known . \n no orbital period was measured . from x - ray bursts \n it is assumed that the accretor is a neutron star . from the similarity of the x - ray spectral characteristics with 4u1626 - 67 , juett et al . \n ( 2001 ) suggest that this system is also ultracompact . \n the optical spectrum displays a number of c and o lines , as already identified by nelemans et al . \n the lack of hei and hi lines supports the suggestion of juett et al . \n the two c / o dominated models shown in fig.1 were computed for this system . \n irradiation by the central object is not taken into account . \n they do show emission features , which qualitatively match some observed features . \n it appears that the disk in this region is optically thin . \n angelini , l. , white , n. e. , nagase , f. , et al . \n 1995 , apj , 449 , l41 chakrabarty , d. 1998 , apj , 492 , 342 homer , l. , anderson , s. f. , & wachter , s. 2002 , aj , 142 , 3348 juett , a. m. , psaltis , d. , & chakrabarty , d. 2001 , apj , 560 , l59 nagel , t. , dreizler , s. , rauch , t. , & werner , k. 2004 , a&a , in press nelemans , g. , jonker , p. g. , marsh , t. r. , & van der klis , m. 2004 , mnras , 348 , l7 schulz , n. s. , chakrabarty , d. , marshall , h. l. , et al . \n 2001 , apj , 563 , 941 shakura , n. i. , & sunyaev , r. a. 1973 , a&a , 24 , 337 weidemann , v. 2003 , in white dwarfs , eds . \n d.de  martino , r.silvotti , j .- \n e.solheim , r.kalytis , nato science series ii , 105 , 3 werner , k. 1991 , a&a , 251 , 147 werner , k. 2001 , in low mass wolf -

{"ContextTokens": 3591, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "a meteoroid enters the earth s atmosphere at hypersonic speed and it collides with air molecules . the high kinetic energy involved in the process \n determine the transformation of a solid body into a plasma , which can scatter radio waves and can emit light ( meteor ) .    during sixties and seventies several works \n investigated the formation and evolution of the meteor , with particular attention to diffusion , in order to study mesospheric winds . \n a complete review of standard meteor science can be found in ceplecha et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n however , there are still some aspects not well understood about the physical properties of a meteor , specifically whether it is an ionized gas or a plasma . during past years \n , these two appellatives were often used as synonymous in meteor physics , even though they indicate two different states of the matter . in some studies , such as those about diffusion , \n specific plasma properties are taken into account ( e.g. ambipolar diffusion ) ; however in other studies , such as about radiowave scattering , the meteor is simply considered a long narrow column of ionized gas . \n this can appear as a futile debate , but it hides important concepts . \n specifically , a plasma has collective properties ( e.g. langmuir frequency ) that an ionized gas has not . \n a first attempt to study the meteor as a plasma was carried out by herlofson ( @xcite ) . \n he investigated the proper oscillations in the meteor and their interaction with radio waves . \n but , at our knowledge , none continued his studies . only in 1999 the question of collective oscillations in meteoric plasma \n was reprised ( foschini @xcite ) . \n perhaps , this gap may be explained by taking into account that , according to purposes of meteor astronomy , it was sufficient to use the approximation of the long narrow cylinder . \n however , the meteoric plasma is something more complex than a reflecting rod and it is necessary to study it . \n there are several types of oscillations and instabilities , which can interact with radio waves . \n the scattering is not the only process : for example , fluctuations from equilibrium may lead to transformation of waves ( longitudinal to transverse and vice versa ) . \n the question is : are such processes present in a meteoric plasma ? \n we think that the study of plasma collective oscillations may give new useful tools to understand the physics of meteors \n . some basic concepts about meteoric plasma were settled in a previous paper ( foschini 1999 ) , thereafter called paper i. according to the theory exposed there , radio echoes can be divided into two classes and two subclasses \n . then we have underdense and overdense echoes , according to whether the langmuir frequency is higher or lower than the radio wave frequency . \n overdense echoes totally reflect electromagnetic waves , but the presence of binary collisions among ions and electrons weaken the collective oscillations of the plasma , allowing the propagation of the waves , even though with strong attenuation . \n therefore , we can divide the overdense echoes into two subclasses : type i , when there is total reflection ; type ii , when binary collisions allow the propagation . \n the division between overdense type i and ii depends on the electron \n ion collision frequency , which in turn depends on electron density and ion cross section . in paper \n i , for the sake of simplicity , we considered potassium ion , that is the chemical element with lower ionization energy . \n in addition , recent studies show that potassium seems to be much more important in the evolution of meteor than previously thought ( von zahn et al . \n @xcite ) . with this assuption \n , the division between overdense echoes occurs at about @xmath0  m@xmath1 . \n it is worth noting that this border can be moved by considering other elements . \n but the calculation of particle distribution and evolution in a meteoric plasma will be object of other papers . \n the overdense type i echoes derives from total reflection of radio waves ( see fig . \n [ fig1 ] for an example ) . \n this allows to calculate the height of the meteor in an easy way , as shown in the paper i. here we want to present a statistical sample of several meteor showers , for which we have calculated the height . \n data will be discussed and compared with available data in literature . \n we shortly recall how to calculate the meteor height , as described in paper i. first , we have to take into account that the plasma has not a definite boundary and then , the incident electromagnetic wave penetrates a little into it before reaching the density necessary to allow total reflection . \n we can consider this something similar to skin effect in metals . \n we can consider a simple geometry , as shown in fig .  6 of paper i , and then use the definition of the attenuation @xmath2 in decibel units :    @xmath3      \\label{e : decib}\\ ] ]    where subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for incident and reflected wave . \n > from the solution of maxwell s equations we obtain that , for overdense meteors type i , the electric field is :    @xmath6    where the wave vector in eq . \n ( [ e : solu ] ) has the form :    @xmath7    we refer to paper i for explanation of symbols , even though they are commonly used in literature about electromagnetic fields . \n we substitute eqs . \n ( [ e : solu ] ) and ( [ e : wv ] ) in eq . \n ( [ e : decib ] ) and , taking into account that the amplitude of a totally reflected wave is equal to the amplitude of the incident wave , we can obtain an attenuation value of about @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the path of the wave into the plasma :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the incidence angle and @xmath12 is the penetration depth . \n then , eq .  ( [ e : decib ] ) becomes :    @xmath13      \\label{e : decib1}\\ ] ]    in the case of overdense type i ( total reflection ) the attenuation is simply a function of the angle of incidence . \n ( [ e : decib1 ] ) refers to an idealized case . \n when we deal with real meteors and radio waves , we have to take into account of several factors , i.e. antenna gains , losses in radio receiver and trasmitter , atmospheric absorption , and the distance of reflecting point from trasmitter and receiver . strictly speaking , eq . \n ( [ e : decib1 ] ) can be considered as the `` meteor cross section '' in the radar equation . \n we can consider common factors in radar theory , as described in kingsley & quegan ( @xcite ) . by means of \n commonly used values for forward scatter radar , we obtain that the attenuation recorded with our receiver is :    @xmath14      \\label{e : meyere}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the received signal amplitude [ v ] . > from the amplitude of the reflected wave , we can calculate the incidence angle with the eq . \n ( [ e : decib1 ] ) . \n therefore , we can calculate the meteor height by considering the geometry of fig . \n we can see that :    @xmath16    taking into account that the earth s mean radius @xmath17 is much larger than @xmath18 , we can calculate @xmath19 :    @xmath20    by substituting eq . \n ( [ e : hei2 ] ) in eq . \n ( [ e : hei1 ] ) , we obtain the height of the reflection for an overdense meteor type i :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 . \n the angle @xmath23 is the half angular distance between receiver and transmitter . \n the distance @xmath24 plays an important role in the derivation of the above formula . indeed , from a geometric point of view , the specular reflection in a forward scatter system occurs when the meteor trail lies along a tangent to an ellipsoidal surface , with the transmitter and the receiver stations in foci ( forsyth & vogan @xcite ) . \n this condition is fulfilled by different values of distances of the reflecting point from the source and from the receiver . \n if we do not know the path source  meteor  receiver , this introduces an uncertainty of about 40  km in the height of the reflecting point ( for our system ) . \n one way to overcome this problem is to set up a third station , but if it is not possible , as in our case , we can reduce uncertainties by making heuristic considerations . \n indeed , as explained by forsyth & vogan ( @xcite ) , the forward scatter system is most sensitive to meteor trails which are nearly horizontal and directed along the transmission line . \n a meteor perpendicular to the source  receiver line gives an echo that is about five times lower than the case of parallel direction ( forsyth & vogan @xcite ) . \n therefore , the choice of the reflecting point located closely to the middle of the transmission path appears to be reasonable and , as we shall see , is justified by facts . \n the general principle of meteor observation by forward scattering of radio waves is the following : a vhf radio receiver ( 30100  mhz ) is located at a large distance ( about 6002000  km ) from a transmitter at the same frequency . \n direct radio communication is not possible , owing to the earth s curvature , but the meteor allows the commuication over the horizon , by reflecting the transmitted signal .    in this study , observations were carried out mainly by m.  de meyere . \n his radio receiver is located in deurle , belgium ( longitude @xmath25  e , latitude @xmath26  n ) , while the trasmitter is located in sofia ( bulgary ) . \n it transmits radio signals at 66.50  mhz all over the day with 10  kw power . in this case , values of @xmath18 and @xmath23 are , respectively , @xmath27  km and @xmath28 . \n the receiving station consists of a crossed yagi antenna ( 4 elements ) , that is linked to a computer with a digital acquisition interface ( 150 samples per second , 8 bit resolution ) . \n data are recorded and stored into a file .    .observed meteor showers . \n in the last column , the percentage indicates the number of overdense meteors type i compared with the total number of recorded meteors . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     observations of several meteor shower were carried out during several years ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , with a total number of meteors recorded equal to 13401 . \n the overdense i meteors are 131 ( about 1% of the total ) and the height distribution for analysed showers are shown in figs . \n [ fig3][fig6 ] ( each bin is 1  km wide ) . \n values in table  [ tab1 ] refer to all echoes recorded during shower days . in order to evaluate also the sporadic background \n , we have analysed some days in february , without any shower . \n we have found a mean value for sporadic overdense type i meteors of about 0.2 meteor per hour , so that the contribution of background can be considered negligible . \n measured heights are in the range between 70 and 110  km , in good agreement with typical meteor heights ( 60110 km ) , even though the large part of meteors are in the range 95110 km . \n the peaks of distributions are not centered , but are located toward right . \n however , this seems to be an effect dues to a low number of data . \n indeed , the best fit for the observations , calculated with the @xmath29 test , is a gaussian distribution ( therefore @xmath30 is calculated with standard methods for this type of distribution ) . in table \n [ tab2 ] values of mean speed ( allen @xcite ) and height of overdense i meteor are shown . \n data obtained here show that the mean height is independent from the entry speed of the meteoroids ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . on the other hand \n , it is known that the height depends on entry speed of meteoroids : for example , greenhow & lovell ( @xcite ) wrote that the highest speed sporadic meteors , moving at 6070  km / s , ionize at a mean height of 100  km , whereas those with minimum speed ( 11.2  km / s ) reach a mean height of 85  km . \n the theory of radio meteor height was elaborated by kaiser ( @xcite , b ) and recently belkovich et al . \n ( @xcite ) proposed some changes , in order to take into account the fragmentation . \n kaiser found that the width of the height distribution depends on the atmospheric scale height and the mass distribution of incoming meteoroids . \n the mean height depends strongly on meteor speed , through two coefficients named @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and depends also on the probability of ionization . \n kaiser s theory refers to the point of maximum ionization , but it is known that in experimental radio observations the height of reflecting point does not necessarily lie in the point of maximum ionization ( greenhow & lovell @xcite ) .    if we observe a meteor shower with a given mean speed and mass distribution , the height distribution is related to the length of ionization curve . \n the point of maximum ionization corresponds to the most probable height . \n it is worth noting that kaiser s theory refers to underdense meteors . only mckinley ( @xcite ) referred to overdense meteors and found no clear dependence on speed . \n moreover , he found a two peaks distribution : the main peak is located at about 95  km , and the second one at 106  km . \n we can try to explain the differences between our results and data available in literature . \n the first reason is that we try to analyse overdense meteors , while the large part of published data refer to underdense meteors . \n it is very interesting to note that for bright meteors , which are surely overdense , the radio height of maximum echo duration is well above the mean height of maximum light , obtained from photographic data ( millman & mckinley @xcite ) . on the other hand , \n the situation is reversed for faint meteors . \n the reason for this difference is that overdense type i meteors reflect totally the incoming electromagnetic wave . \n total reflection is allowed only when plasma frequency is higher than the radio frequency and the collision frequency in the plasma is negligible ( see paper i ) . \n these conditions are achieved indipendently from speed of incoming of meteoroid , but it depends on the mass and chemical composition of the body . \n once an overdense type i meteor is created , the signal amplitude of the reflected wave remains constant until the collision frequency in the plasma or recombination and attachment processes subtract energy to the plasma frequency . \n we can say that collective properties of the plasma , which generate the long plateau of overdense type i meteor , `` hide '' in some way some properties of the incoming meteoroid . \n concerning the two peaks found by mckinley ( @xcite ) , we note that our distributions show only the secondary peak . \n this can be explained by taking into account that while mckinley made no distinction between overdense meteors , we have considered only overdense type i meteors . \n we have carried out an analysis of several overdense radio echoes , recorded during last years by a radio observer located in belgium . \n we have analysed a particular class of overdense meteors ( type i ) and measured height distributions are in good agreement with previous results obtained by mckinley ( @xcite ) , even though only for the secondary peak . \n we suppose that the first peak in mckinley s work should be due to overdense type ii meteors , while the secondary peak , recorded also by our system , appeared to be due to overdense type i meteors . \n we think that collective properties of the meteoric plasma ( langmuir oscillations ) hide some characteristics of the originary cosmic body , specifically there is no clear dependence on speed . \n further study , mainly theoretical and able to take into account collective properties of plasma , are required to assess the particle dynamics in the meteor . \n it should be noted that our studies were carried out with an amateur forward scatter system and we have no full control on it . \n moreover , heuristic considerations were introduced in order to minimize uncertainties , but results showed that they were justified by facts . \n the agreement with previous works , with other techniques , supports our conclusions . \n the future availability of a full forward scatter system would be of great help in more detailed studies . \n lf wishes to thank p.  farinella for useful discussions . authors are also grateful to the referee , p.  pecina , for useful

{"ContextTokens": 2427, "GeneratedTokens": 225, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent times , there has been an increased use of nuclear reaction codes in the nuclear data evaluation process for the computation of cross sections , spectra and angular distributions required for a large variety of applications  @xcite . \n the use of model codes in the evaluation of nuclear data offers several advantages , among them ; the preservation of energy balance and coherence of partial cross sections together with total and reaction cross sections , the prediction of data for unstable nuclei and providing data where experimental data are unavailable . where experimental data are available , they are used for fine tuning input parameters to model codes . \n the total monte carlo ( tmc ) method , developed around talys by the nuclear research group , petten , has the capability of incorporating microscopic nuclear physics and macroscopic nuclear reactor design into one simulation scheme  @xcite . in this way \n , uncertainties can be assigned to macroscopic reactor parameters together with their sensitivity to uncertainties in specific cross - sections . the probability distribution for various reactor parameters can also be observed . \n tmc has been tested for a variety of systems  @xcite . in this paper , we applied the total monte carlo approach in assessing the impact of pu-239 cross section uncertainties on the full core 3-d serpent monte carlo model of the european lead cooled training reactor(electra ) . \n electra is a 0.5 mw reactor proposed within the genius ( generation iv research in universities of sweden ) framework  @xcite . \n it aims at developing technology necessary for safe and economic deployment of generation iv nuclear reactors , in particular the lead cooled fast reactor . since pu-239 makes up of 30% of the total mass of the fuel , its uncertainties \n are expected to impact significantly on the core behavior of the reactor . a novel approach for the selection of benchmarks for applications \n is present in this work . \n the selection of benchmarks for applications is usually done with by eye judgment . \n this method is dependent on the experience of the user and therefore not suitable for the total monte carlo methodology which lays emphasis on automation and reproducibility  @xcite . \n also , an accept / reject criterion for reducing uncertainties in reactor macroscopic parameters based on limiting @xmath1 values is investigated using the pu-239 jezebel criticality benchmark . \n the input files used in this study are the serpent geometry input file developed at kth , sweden  @xcite and 740 random endf files obtained from the tendl project  @xcite . \n the pu-239 jezebel benchmark mcnp input file obtained from the international handbook of evaluated criticality safety benchmark experiments  @xcite was converted into a serpent file for simulations . \n the random files were processed into ace format using the njoy99.336 processing code at 1200k . \n simulations were performed with the serpent monte carlo code version 1.1.17  @xcite for the electra core at zero burnup with the absorber drums set at startup position . \n criticality calculations were performed for 20 inactive and 500 @xmath0 active cycles with 50,000 neutrons per cycle corresponding to 25 million histories resulting in a statistical uncertainty in @xmath0 of 21.5 pcm . \n endf-6 formatted files for pu-239 obtained from the latest major nuclear data libraries \n jeff-3.1.2 , endf / b - vii.1 and jendl-4.0 were processed in a similar way and criticality calculations performed . \n the results obtained are compared with mean of the @xmath0 distribution of the random nuclear data files . \n the fast tmc methology presented in  @xcite is used in this work . \n however , instead of using it to obtain short computation times it is used to obtain a very accurate and precise estimate of the uncertainty in reactor parameters due to nuclear data ( @xmath2 ) . in tmc , ( @xmath2 ) \n is obtained by running n different nd files . \n the result is a spread in the data ( @xmath3 ) that is both due to statistics ( @xmath4 ) and due to nuclear data ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath5 since both the parameter , e.g , @xmath0 , and its statistical uncertainty , @xmath6 , is determined by most transport codes , we obtain a distribution of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 when we run with our n random files . \n the spread in the distribution of @xmath0 is then @xmath3 and the @xmath7 is equal to @xmath4 . \n [ yi ] holds assuming that there is no correlation between statistics and nuclear data ; the correlation between @xmath0 and the corresponding statistical error was investigated and no correlation was observed . \n the methodology produces an accurate estimate of @xmath2 if @xmath7 is accurately determined by the transport code . to test this we executed the serpent input file 740 times with constant nuclear data , but with different random seeds . \n if @xmath3 = @xmath7 then the transport code determines @xmath6 correctly ; in our case with serpent and electra and this was found to be true . \n criticality benchmarks are used mostly for validation of calculational techniques in reactor calculations and for establishing minimum subcritical margins for operations with fissile material  @xcite . in the nuclear data evaluation process , benchmarking evaluated data against differential and integral data is very important . \n this is mostly done by selecting large sets of criticality , dosimetry , fusion , activation benchmarks among others . \n the selection varies from one application group to another as a results of different expertise , purpose of the evaluation and accessibility to benchmarks  @xcite . to solve this problem , we proposed the tmc methodology for the selection of benchmarks . \n first , random files obtained from the tendl project are processed into usable format for reactor codes . \n criticality simulations are performed for 1 ) the @xmath8 benchmark under consideration and for 2 ) the specific reactor system using same processed random files . \n a correlation test is then performed by plotting the @xmath0 obtained for the reactor system against that of the benchmark . \n if a strong correlation exists between the two systems , this can be interpreted as a good representation of your system . \n this methodology has been tested only on the pu-239 jezebel benchmark and we plan to investigate this in more detail taking into consideration fusion and shielding benchmarks . \n the proposed method also opens up possibilities for assigning weights to each benchmark based on the goodness of fit or the correlation coefficient . in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , a correlation between the @xmath0 computed for electra and that of the pu-239 jezebel benchmark is presented .     determined for electra and the pu-239 jezebel benchmark for pu-239 random files . ]      an accept / reject criterion is investigated to study how limiting @xmath1 values for accepting random files could reduce nuclear data uncertainties in safety parameters . \n simulations were performed for pu-239 random files  @xcite and with pu-239 jezebel criticality benchmark and with the electra serpent monte carlo code input file . \n limiting chi squares were set and corresponding nuclear data uncertainty calculated.in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , we present a plot of limiting chi square verses pu-239 random files index . \n a distribution in @xmath0 was obtained for 740 pu-239 random endf files and the mean compared with results from other nuclear data libraries . the jeff-3.1 ( the reference library ) \n temperature dependent cross -

vii.1 was @xmath10 , jeff-3.1.1 was @xmath11 , jendl-4.0 was @xmath12 . \n this can be attributed to the contribution of the well known fission cross section of pu-239 which has a relatively high impact on the effective multiplication factor . \n the uncertainty due to nuclear data was determined and found to be @xmath13 pcm . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , we present a plot of limiting @xmath1 values against the random file index . \n nuclear data uncertainties were determined for each limit and the results is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig3 ] .        the correlation between @xmath0 computed for electra and for the pu-239 jezebel benchmark \n is shown in fig . \n it can be seen from the plot that there exists a strong correlation between the two systems implying that , the pu-239 jezebel benchmark is a good representation of electra . \n the pearson correlation coefficient which is a measure of the strength of the relationship between the two systems was computed and found to be r=0.84 , further underscoring the strong correlation observed . for the computation of @xmath1 for a large set of benchmarks \n , we propose that a weighted factor ( @xmath14 ) , which should be equal to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ( @xmath15 ) be set for the @xmath8 benchmark . \n we plan to test this methodology on a large set of benchmarks and for different nuclides . \n the approach has however been applied am-241 in burnup evaluation of electra  @xcite . \n it was observed that , a 25% reduction in nuclear data uncertainty was achieved after a setting a more rigid acceptance criteria . in fig . \n [ fig3 ] , we present the nuclear data uncertainty against limiting @xmath1 . it can be observed from the figure that by setting a minimum limiting @xmath1 of 5.31e-06 , we were able to reduce the uncertainty in nuclear data from 748 to 443 pcm . \n this therefore implies that , by implementing an accept / reject criterion in the total monte carlo method for accepting random files , nuclear data uncertainty can be reduced significantly . \n a study has been carried out by using benchmarks within the total monte carlo methodology on nuclear data uncertainty propagation for the european lead cooled training reactor ( electra ) . \n it was observed that , nuclear data uncertainties could be reduced considerably in criticality calculations after introducing an accept / reject criterion based on integral benchmarks into the tmc calculation chain . \n a method for the selection of benchmarks with tmc was also proposed which opens up possibilities for assigning weights to benchmarks . \n 9 iaea , final report of a coordinated research project ripl-2 , august 2006 . \n a. koning and d. rochman , nuclear data sheets * 113 * , 2841 ( 2012 ) . \n d. rochman , a. koning nuclear science and engineering , * 168 * , 1 ( 2011 ) . \n j. wallenius , e. suvdantsetseg and a. fokau , nuclear technology * 177 * , 303 -

{"ContextTokens": 2366, "GeneratedTokens": 275, "SynthesizedBody": "chemical evolution of the universe has been one of the major issues in the modern astronomy . \n heavy elements , or metals , have been generated and accumulated in the universe since its birth mainly through supernovae . an important clue to understand the chemical evolution of the universe \n will no doubt be brought about by systematic study of a well - defined sample of supernova remnants . in x - ray observations , we are able to extract information of plasma temperature , metal abundance , explosion energy , ionization age , and so on from optically thin thermal plasma emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) \n . these pieces of information will lead to understand galactic chemical evolution and star formation history . \n a systematic study of snrs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) suits well for this purpose , because of its well - known distance ( 50kpc ; @xcite ) and small interstellar absorption to lmc . \n the fact that lmc is face - on to us is another advantage . because of these characteristics \n , systematic x - ray studies of the thermal snrs in lmc have been carried out with some major x - ray observatories ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n these observations are , however , limited in terms of energy resolution in the low energy band below @xmath01  kev , which is important to study the nature of the snr plasma in detail , because the temperature of the plasma in most snrs is less than @xmath02  kev . \n in particular , hydrogenic and he - like oxygen lines that appear in 0.50.7  kev dominate a spectrum of the plasma with a temperature of @xmath61  kev , and hence , high resolution spectroscopy in this energy band is of great importance in evaluating the parameters of the low temperature plasma , such as the temperature , the density , the ionization parameter and the abundances of the metal . \n we therefore have decided to perform a systematic study of the snrs in lmc with the suzaku xis ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which has the best energy resolution in the oxygen 0.50.7  kev energy band among the ccds currently in orbit . in this paper \n , we study the snr n23 , as a beginning of our systematic study project .    n23 is identified as a snr with radio observations at 5 and 14.7  ghz for the first time ( @xcite ) . \n its x - ray emission extends @xmath7 in the sky ( @xmath8pc at a distance of 50  kpc ) , showing a semi - circular morphology with only the south - eastern hemisphere being bright @xcite . \n based on the observation , @xcite classified n23 as a young snr with an age of @xmath9 from the spectrum of the entire remnant . \n @xcite carried out spatially resolved spectroscopy of n23 with , and estimated the age of north - western rim to be @xmath04600  yr . \n these observations result in consistent estimation of the temperature and the ionization parameter ( @xmath10 ) in the bright south - eastern shell , which is @xmath00.50.7  kev and @xmath11@xmath12 , respectively . \n they are , however , not be able to resolve hydrogenic and he - like lines from oxygen clearly because of limited energy resolution below @xmath01  kev . \n in addition , @xcite have revealed that there is a point source around the center of n23 . from its 0.510  kev flux ( @xmath13 ) and \n power - law spectrum with a photon index of 2.2 , the source is probably a rotation - powered pulsar and/or a pulsar wind nebula . \n if so , the progenitor of n23 is a core - collapsed massive star ( @xcite ) . \n this paper is organized as follows . after describing how the observation and data reduction are carried out in   [ sec : obs ] , we report the results of spectral analysis of n23 in   [ sec : spec_ana ] . \n owing to high spectral resolution of the xis in the oxygen band , we have clearly resolved hydrogenic and he - like k@xmath14 emission lines from oxygen for the first time , which leads to identification of a new low temperature component . \n based on these results , we discuss the plasma parameters and evolutionary phase of n23 in   [ sec : dis ] . finally , the summary is given in \n [ sec : sum ] . \n n23 was observed with @xcite on 2005 august 1617 . \n the observation log is summarized in table  [ tab : suzakuobslog ] .    .observation log . [ cols= \" < \n , < , < \" , ]     using eq . \n ( [ eq : sedovage ] ) with @xmath15  pc , @xmath16 estimated from the low and high temperature components becomes @xmath08000 and @xmath05000  yr , respectively , which are consistent with the lower limit of @xmath17 . \n this is a direct consequence of eq . \n ( [ eq : sedovage ] ) , implying @xmath16 being proportional to @xmath18 . \n the high temperature component is younger than the low temperature component . in the sedov scheme , this can be interpreted as the high temperature component being heated recently . on the other hands , @xmath19 of the low and high temperature components are 9300@xmath20 and 12000@xmath20 , respectively , using eq . \n ( [ eq : coolage ] ) with @xmath21 given in table  [ tab : n23phi ] (  [ sec : n23_phys ] ) . since @xmath22 for both components , n23 is likely to be at a late stage of the sedov phase , and if so , its age is @xmath08000  yrs old from the newly discovered low temperature component . \n note , however , that this discussion depends on the estimation of the volume filling factor @xmath23 . \n accounting for the highly anisotropic image ( fig . \n [ fig : n23image ] ) , we have normalized @xmath23 by 0.1 . \n however , if the shock wave of n23 propagates in a higher density ism , like the edge of the open cluster hs  114 @xcite , the total volume should be smaller for the given emission measure , resulting in a smaller @xmath23 . \n if , for instance , @xmath24 , @xmath25 of the low and high temperature components are @xmath05000 and @xmath07000  yr , respectively . since @xmath26 , the low temperature component should be regarded as in the radiative phase . \n in addition , we would also like to remark that , in   [ sec : n23_phys ] , we have calculated the plasma volume , assuming that the shell thickness is 1/12 of the shell radius , which is expected for a spherical strong shock . \n this holds only if n23 is still in the sedov ( adiabatic ) phase . \n if n23 has been in the radiative phase , then the shell thickness should be smaller due to radiative cooling , and hence , the plasma density would be larger than the current estimation . as a result , the cooling time scale estimated from eq . \n ( [ eq : coolage ] ) should be smaller , and @xmath27 . \n consequently , we can not deny possibility that n23 has been in the radiative phase .    in summary \n , the age of n23 is estimated to be @xmath08000 yr from the newly discovered low temperature component as long as it still stays in sedov phase . \n this condition is , however , uncertain , because the discussion depends on the volume filling factor of the plasma . \n if , for instance , the shock propagate in the higher density ism , n23 may have already entered into the radiative cooling phase . in this case , the remnant age estimated from the cooling timescale is smaller . \n finally , we can make an independent age estimation from the central source detected by @xcite . \n its luminosity is @xmath28  erg in the 0.510.0  kev @xcite . \n if the central source is a pulsar ( although the pulsation has not been detected ) , the characteristic age is @xmath29@xmath30  years , which is consistent with our age estimation update . \n the main component of x - ray emission originates from the swept - up ism in n23 . \n hence the elemental abundances of n23 reflect those of its environment . \n figure  [ fig : ab ] shows the abundances obtained from the spectral analysis ( table  [ tab : n23bestfitpar ] ) . \n ( 80mm,80 mm ) ./figure \n / figure4.eps    the abundances of n , o , ne and fe agree roughly with the lmc average @xcite . \n the si and mg abundances are smaller than those obtained ( @xcite ) , although their errors are relatively large . \n the mg and si abundances obtained by suzaku are consistent with those from asca ( @xcite ) , respectively , which seem slightly less than the lmc average . \n we observed n23 in the large magellanic cloud with suzaku , and discovered the new soft emission component with a temperature of @xmath31  kev , in addition to the @xmath320.7  kev component so far known . \n this alters the estimate of the ionization parameter ( @xmath33 ) significantly from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . with the aid of imaging capability , we are able to calculate the density of the plasma , and have confirmed that the supernova explosion of n23 occurred in a high density region with an ism density of @xmath048  @xmath3 . \n the relatively high ambient density may be related to the open cluster hs 114 @xcite near the remnant @xcite . \n the parameters of the plasma from our analysis indicate that n23 is either at a late stage of the sedov phase or in the radiative cooling phase . assuming it is still in the sedov phase , we have estimated the age of the remnant to be @xmath08000  yr from the newly discovered soft component , which is twice as old as the estimation by @xcite . \n given the uncertainty of the volume filling factor , however , we can not deny the possibility that n23 has already entered into the radiative phase . \n the abundances of n23 is roughly consistent with the lmc average ( @xcite ) . \n the si and mg abundances obtained by spectral fitting are smaller than those obtained by @xcite , although their errors on si and mg abundances are relatively large . \n the mg and si abundances obtained by are consistent with those from ( @xcite ) . \n we thank dr . \n y. maeda for his useful discussion and comments . \n we would like to express our gratitude to all members of the suzaku team for their contributions to the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in -

{"ContextTokens": 3300, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "magnetic fields play a double role in the cosmos : first , planetary , stellar , and galactic fields are produced by the homogeneous dynamo effect in moving electrically conducting fluids . \n second , magnetic fields can accelerate tremendously the formation of stars and black holes by enabling outward directed transport of angular momentum in accretion disks by virtue of the so - called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . \n this instability was discovered as early as 1959 , when velikhov showed that a taylor - couette flow in its hydrodynamically stable regime ( i.e. with outward increasing angular momentum ) can be destabilized by an applied axial magnetic field @xcite . \n it was only in 1991 , however , that the importance of mri for accretion disks in the vicinity of young stars and black holes was realized in a seminal paper by balbus and hawley @xcite . \n the last decades have seen tremendous theoretical and computational progress in understanding the dynamo effect and the mri . \n the hydromagnetic dynamo effect has even been verified experimentally in large - scale liquid sodium facilities in riga , karlsruhe , and cadarache , and is presently studied in laboratories around the world @xcite . \n in contrast , attempts to study the mri in the laboratory have been less successful so far . \n recently , an mri - like instability has been observed on the background of a turbulent spherical couette flow @xcite , but the genuine idea that mri would destabilize a hydrodynamically stable flow was not realized in this experiment . \n one of the basic problems for the experimental investigation of the  standard mri \n , with only an axial magnetic field being externally applied , is the need for flows with large magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath0 . \n the crucial point is that the azimuthal field , which is essential for the mri mechanism to work , must be produced from the applied axial field by induction effects proportional to @xmath0 . \n the natural question , why not substitute the induction process by externally applying the azimuthal field as well , was addressed by hollerbach and rdiger @xcite . exemplified in a taylor - couette configuration \n , it was shown that the scaling properties for this  helical mri  , as we call it now , are completely different from those of the  standard mri  . while the latter is governed by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 and the lundquist number @xmath1 , \n the former depends only on the hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath2 and on the hartmann number @xmath3 . for liquid metals , with their small magnetic prandtl number @xmath4 \n , this makes a dramatic difference for the feasibility of mri experiments , since @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n =    we have to point out , though , that there is no real breach between  standard mri \" and  helical mri \" . \n this can be clearly seen in fig . 1 of @xcite , where the critical @xmath0 is plotted against the rotation ratio @xmath7 of outer to inner cylinder of a taylor - couette set - up . the extremely steep increase of this curve at the rayleigh line , which occurs for a purely axial magnetic field , is just smeared out when an azimuthal field is added . \n in this paper , we summarize the main results of a first experimental verification of this idea obtained in the framework of the promise experiment ( potsdam rossendorf magnetic instability experiment ) which were already published in @xcite , and we report some new results of an improved version of this experiment . \n the basic part of promise is a cylindrical containment vessel v made of copper ( see fig . \n the inner wall of the vessel v is 10 mm thick , and extends in radius from 22 to 32 mm ; the outer wall is 15 mm thick , extending from 80 to 95 mm . \n this vessel is filled with the eutectic alloy ga@xmath8in@xmath9sn@xmath10 which is liquid at room temperatures . \n the vessel v , which is completely made of copper in the first version of the experiment ( henceforth called promise 1 ) , is fixed , via an aluminum spacer d , on a precision turntable t ; the outer copper cylinder of the vessel represents the outer cylinder of the taylor - couette cell . the inner copper cylinder \n i of the taylor - couette flow is fixed to an upper turntable , and is immersed into the liquid metal from above . \n it has a thickness of 4 mm , extending in radius from 36 to 40 mm , thus leaving a gap of 4 mm between this immersed cylinder i and the inner wall of the containment vessel v. the actual taylor - couette cell extends in radial direction over a cylindrical gap of width @xmath11 mm , and in axial direction over the liquid metal height @xmath12 mm , resulting in an aspect ratio of 10 . \n = hz ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 a ( i.e. ha=7.9 ) . \n ( b ) promise 1 with @xmath17 a ( i.e. @xmath18 ) . \n ( c ) promise 2 with @xmath19 a ( i.e. @xmath20).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]    in the promise 1 configuration , the upper endplate is a non - rotating plexiglass lid p fixed to the frame f. the bottom , however , is simply part of the copper vessel v , and rotates with the outer cylinder . with respect to both their rotation rates and electrical conductivities , \n there is thus a clear asymmetry in the end caps . \n figure 2a shows the changes made for promise 2 to improve this situation : first , both end caps are made of insulating material in order to avoid short - circuiting of currents along the copper end cap at the bottom ( those currents had been shown to be dangerous by possibly changing the rotation profile via azimuthal forces @xcite ) . \n second , both the upper and the lower end caps are split into two rings , the inner rotating with the inner cylinder and the outer rotating with the outer cylinder . in @xcite \n it had been shown that this splitting yields a minimization of the ekman pumping if the position of the splitting is at 0.4 of the gap width @xmath21 . \n third , the co - rotation of the two rings with one of the cylinders made it necessary to change the signal path of the ultrasonic transducers . \n these two transducers provide full profiles of the axial velocity along the beam - lines parallel to the axis of rotation . \n while in promise 1 they are inserted in the upper plexiglass end cap that is fixed to the laboratory frame , in promise 2 they must be connected via a sliding contact to the signal processing computer ( dop 2000 ) . \n the configuration of magnetic fields is the same for promise 1 and promise 2 . \n an axial magnetic field in the order of 10 mt is produced by a double - layer coil with 76 windings ( c in fig . \n the omission of windings at two symmetric positions close to mid - height , as seen in fig . \n 1a , was motivated by a coil optimization to maximize the homogeneity of the axial field throughout the fluid volume . \n the coil is fed by currents up to 200 a , beyond which a significant heating of the coil sets in . the azimuthal field , also in the order of 10 mt , is generated by a current through a water - cooled copper rod r of radius 15 mm . the special power supply ( ps in fig . \n 1c ) for this axial current is capable of delivering up to 8000 a. \n we have carried out a large number of experimental runs in order to cover a wide range of parameter dependencies . typically , the duration of an experimental run was 1900 sec , after a waiting time of one hour and more . \n many details for the promise 1 set - up can be found in the publications @xcite . \n = 0.245 , 0.255 , 0.265 , and 0.275 , at @xmath22 hz , @xmath23 a , @xmath24a . , \n title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]    = hz , @xmath23 a , and two values of @xmath24 a and 7000 a , which corresponds to @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . \n the experimental values ( full lines ) are compared with the numerical results of a 2d solver , and with the results for the absolute and the convective instability of a 1d solver ( courtesy of jnis priede).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]    one of the most significant features of the mri is that , for fixed @xmath2 and fixed azimuthal field @xmath27 , it shows up only in a finite interval of the hartmann number @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the conductivity of the liquid , @xmath30 its density , and @xmath31 its kinematic viscosity ) . \n this appearance and disappearance of a travelling mode is a suitable indicator for the existence of the proper mri mode and its distinction from other possible flow structures .    in fig . \n 2b , c we represent the results for rotation rates of @xmath32 hz ( i.e. @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) which is slightly above the rayleigh value @xmath33 . the current in the coil was fixed to @xmath16a ( i.e. ha=7.9 ) . in the promise 1 case ( fig . \n 2b ) , the axial current was set to @xmath17 a ( i.e. @xmath34 ) , in the promise 2 ( fig . \n 2c ) case to @xmath19 a ( i.e. @xmath20 ) , a difference that is , however , not essential . \n the grey scale of the plots indicates the axial velocity component @xmath35 measured along the ultrasound beam , from which we have subtracted the ( z - dependent ) time average in order to filter out the two ekman vortices which appear already without any magnetic field . \n these ekman vortices , which in the promise 1 version are characterized by inward radial flows close to the upper and lower end - plates and a jet - like radial outflow in the centre of the cylinder @xcite , are significantly suppressed in the promise 2 version due to the use of split end caps . in promise 1 , \n the wave dies away at the position of the radial jet ( which is not always at mid - height ) . \n in contrast to this , in promise 2 the wave propagates throughout the total height of the cell . \n this much improved behaviour of the mri in promise 2 can be visualized nicely when crossing the rayleigh line . \n it is known @xcite that the travelling wave appears already with a stationary outer cylinder , i.e. at @xmath36 , although with a very low frequency . with increasing @xmath37 , the wave frequency increases and typically reaches a value of @xmath38 at the rayleigh value @xmath39 . \n figure 3 shows now in detail what happens with the travelling mri wave when @xmath37 crosses the rayleigh line . \n the parameters for this run were @xmath22 hz ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , @xmath23 a ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , @xmath24 a. it is clearly visible that the mri wave is still present at @xmath42 , becomes significantly weaker at @xmath43 , and has completely died at @xmath44 . \n this transition is further analyzed in fig . \n 4 which shows the rms of the axial velocity perturbation in dependence on @xmath37 , now both for @xmath24 a and @xmath19 a ( which corresponds to @xmath25 and 4.5 , respectively ) .    the measured values ( full lines ) \n are compared with the numerical results of a 2d solver ( dashed lines ) , but also with the results of a 1d solver for the onset of the absolute and the convective instability @xcite ( courtesy of jnis priede ) . \n it is most remarkable that the 1d results for the onset of the absolute instability correspond nearly perfectly with the results of the 2d solver , while the thresholds for the convective instability are situated at much higher values of @xmath37 . \n compared to the 2d numerical curves , the experimental curves are shifted only slightly towards higher @xmath37 . as expected , we see also that for increasing @xmath45 the threshold of the instability shifts to higher values of @xmath37 . \n we have obtained experimental evidence for the existence of the mri in current - free helical magnetic fields . \n the symmetrization of the axial boundary conditions and the use of split end caps in promise 2 has led to a strong reduction of the ekman pumping and hence to an avoidance of artefacts in the radial jet flow region . \n the mri wave extends clearly beyond the rayleigh line , and its behaviour is in good correspondence with both 2d simulations and 1d simulations for the absolute instability , but in stark contrast with 1d simulations for the convective instability . \n this indicates that the observed mri wave is indeed a global instability and not only a noise triggered convective instability as claimed recently @xcite . \n further dependencies of the mri on parameters like @xmath2 , @xmath45 , and @xmath3 , as well as their comparison with numerical predictions will be published elsewhere . \n .  9 ( 1959 ) , pp .  995998 . . \n , vol .  376 ( 1991 ) , \n 214222 . . \n , vol .  74 ( 2002 ) , \n .  973990 . . \n , 88 ( 2008 ) , 930954 . . \n , vol .  93 ( 2004 ) , art . \n , vol .  95 ( 2005 ) , art . \n 97 ( 2006 ) , art . \n 184502 . . . , vol \n .  649 ( 2006 ) , pp . \n l145-l147 . . . \n , vol .  9 ( 2007 ) , art . no . 295 . . \n , vol .  329 ( 2008 ) , \n pp .  652 -

qcd using ads / qcd . \n as noted above , the forces that bind quarks are related in ads / qcd to the modification of the ads space curvature , the dilaton profile @xmath38 encoding confinement dynamics  @xcite . \n this modification of the ads geometry is constrained by the form of the potential dictated by the daff mechanism . \n the same constraint also prescribes the form of @xmath4 at small @xmath36 .    in pqcd \n , the effective coupling @xmath2 is defined at high @xmath36 by folding short - distance quantum effects into its evolution . \n analogously , as we will show , the @xmath36-dependence of the ads / qcd effective coupling stems from the effects of the large - distance forces folded into the coupling constant  @xcite .    to determine @xmath40 , \n consider first the ads action . \n it has the same form as general relativity s action : @xmath41 but with @xmath42 , the ricci scalar , and @xmath43 , newton s constant , replaced by their qcd -

distance quantum effects . similarly , the initially constant ads coupling @xmath52 is redefined to absorb the effects of the ads deformation : @xmath53 . transforming to momentum space yields  @xcite @xmath54 here , @xmath55 , \n the effective charge in the @xmath56-scheme defined from the bjorken sum rule  @xcite , is normalized to @xmath57 at @xmath58 due to fulfill straightforward kinematical constraints  @xcite . \n this coupling can serve as the qcd - analog of the gell - mann - low coupling @xmath59 of qed  @xcite . since lf - holography neglects quantum effects , the short - distance phenomena which lead to the pqcd evolution of the running of pqcd coupling \n are not incorporated in @xmath60 . \n indeed , the gaussian form of eq . \n ( [ alphaads ] ) falls much faster than the pqcd prediction at large @xmath36 . \n the large @xmath36-dependence of @xmath61 is well known  @xcite . \n its evolution is given by the qcd renormalization group equation where the logarithmic derivative of the coupling defines the @xmath62 function . \n if @xmath4 is small , one can use the perturbative expansion : @xmath63 the @xmath64 for @xmath65 are scheme -

shock gas falling onto the central black hole . \n we consider a non - rotating black hole as the central black hole . \n we employ 1-dimensional supernova simulation data of bruenn ( 1992 ) @xcite to obtain the initial density , pressure and radial velocity distribution . \n we add the effect of stellar rotation and intrinsic magnetic field . \n the initial rotational velocity distribution is assumed to be a function of the distance from the rotation axis only . \n the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and parallel to the rotational axis . \n see mizuno et al . \n ( 2003 ) @xcite for details . \n the stellar matter falls onto the central black hole at first . \n this collapse is anisotropic due to the effects of rotation and magnetic field . \n the accreting matter falls more slowly on the equatorial plane than on the rotational axis . \n the matter piles up on the equatorial plane , and a disk - like structure is formed near the central black hole . since the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma , it is dragged by the accreting matter and amplified . \n the amplified magnetic field expands outwards as alfvn waves and launches an outgoing shock wave . \n the jet - like outflow is generated behind the shock wave . \n the shock wave has the high magnetic pressure gradient force and high centrifugal force . \n these forces push back the accreting matter and construct the jet - like outflow . \n the jet - like outflow formed in the simulation is thus magnetically driven . \n the jet has a mildly relativistic velocity , @xmath4 c ( the poloidal velocity is @xmath5 c ) . \n it exceeds the escape velocity . \n thus , the jet is likely to get out of the stellar remnant . \n the magnetic field plays an important role in the collimation . \n not only the pinching force of the toroidal magnetic field but also the geometry of the poloidal magnetic field ( i.e. poloidal magnetic pressure ) plays a crucial role .      as the initial magnetic field strength increases , the jet velocity increases and the magnetic twist decreases . \n however , for stronger magnetic field the jet velocity decreases with increasing initial magnetic field strength and the magnetic twist still continues decreasing . as the initial rotational velocity becomes faster , the jet velocity becomes faster and the magnetic twist becomes stronger up to a certain value . \n for faster initial rotational velocity , the vertical component of the jet velocity and the magnetic twist are almost constant .    in order to produce a strong jet \n , the magnetic field has to be twisted significantly so that it can store enough magnetic energy . \n if the initial magnetic field is strong , the magnetic field can not be twisted significantly because alfvn waves propagate as soon as the magnetic field is twisted a little bit . as a result , the jet velocity does not rise up and the magnetic twist remains weak . \n therefore , weaker initial magnetic fields are favorable for a stronger jet \n . the dependence on the initial rotational velocity can be understood by a same reason as the dependence on the initial magnetic field strength . \n if the initial rotation is sufficiently fast , the magnetic field is twisted significantly and stores enough energy to produce a fast jet . however , the stored magnetic energy has a limit . \n it is determined by the competition between the propagation time of alfvn waves and the rotation time of the disk ( or the twisting time ) . \n we have studied the generation of a jet from gravitational collapse of a rotating star with magnetic field by using the 2.5d general relativistic mhd simulation code . \n the maximum velocity of the jet is mildly relativistic ( @xmath0 0.3c ) . \n this result is consistent with newtonian case @xcite . \n the jet is too slow for the jet of grbs . \n we have to consider other acceleration mechanism . \n the break out of the jet through the stellar surface is the most applicable acceleration mechanism . \n when the jet goes through the stellar surface , the strong density gradient may accelerate the jet . \n in fact , some authors @xcite have showed numerically that a significant acceleration of the jet occur and the terminal lorentz factor becomes as high as @xmath6 . \n we think it is important to simulate the propagation of the jet outside the stellar surface by a grmhd code properly evaluating the importance of magnetic fields for the dynamics and further propagation of the jet . \n this work was partially supported by a grant -

{"ContextTokens": 2432, "GeneratedTokens": 278, "SynthesizedBody": "the exciting evidence for evolution in distant clusters of galaxies @xcite has diverted attention from nearby clusters . \n this is unfortunate , since although nearby clusters show less evidence of galaxy activity they may be studied to much greater depth . \n the findings may then be applied to studies of higher redshift clusters and to the general understanding of the cause for evolution in cluster populations with redshift . \n the potential importance of dust in the active galaxies of distant clusters @xcite underscores the need for selecting samples independent of the effects of dust extinction . \n radio continuum emission ( in this study we will use a frequency of 1.4 ghz ) is a powerful probe of activity caused by both active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and current star formation @xcite . \n it is particularly attractive for this latter type of activity , as the radio continuum emission is directly related to the star formation rate ( sfr ) . \n consequently , a radio flux - limited sample drawn from a given cluster will select all agn and galaxies forming stars at a rate greater than some adopted threshold . \n we have constructed a sample of radio galaxies in 20 nearby abell clusters @xcite . for the nearer clusters , \n the radio data are taken from the nrao vla sky survey @xcite while for the more distant clusters we have collected our own vla data @xcite . \n the luminosities associated with the flux limits of these data correspond roughly to that of the milky way , meaning our completeness limit is a sfr of 4m@xmath0 yr@xmath1 ( for stars with masses @xmath2 m@xmath0 , using the relationship of @xcite ) . \n the more sensitive observations ( i.e. , the nearest nvss clusters and our vla data for the more distant clusters ) detect sfrs as low as 1m@xmath0 yr@xmath1 . \n velocity measurements based on optical spectra indicate whether the radio galaxies are members of their respective clusters , or merely seen in projection . \n the full sample contains over 400 cluster radio galaxies and over 150 foreground and background radio galaxies . \n we have quality optical spectra for about half of the cluster radio galaxies , which enables us to identify the source of the radio emission as either star formation or an agn .    using this sample \n , we ask the question : do any clusters show more evidence for activity and if so , why ? \n the motivation is to understand the butcher - oemler effect , including both the trend and its scatter . \n as noted , we also wish to establish a nearby benchmark for evolutionary studies of distant clusters . \n analogous to the blue fraction of butcher - oemler studies , we calculated the fraction of cluster galaxies associated with radio emission ( @xmath3 ) . \n for this calculation , we used all galaxies brighter than @xmath4 ( determined from the systemic velocities of the clusters ) . \n the optical spectroscopy indicated which radio galaxies were cluster members and which were foreground / background objects , while the total number of galaxies for each cluster was corrected for estimated background counts . to place the clusters on even footing , we used only sources with radio luminosities greater than the nvss completeness limit for the most distant cluster which used nvss data ( i.e. , radio detections at lower luminosities were considered non - detections for the fractional testing ) . in each cluster \n , we surveyed from the cluster center out to a radial distance of 3@xmath5 mpc , or @xmath6 . for the @xmath3 calculations we applied a radial limit of 2@xmath5 mpc in order to reduce variation caused by the background correction . \n the @xmath3 values were then compared via a @xmath7 test . \n two clusters showed an enhancement in activity ( larger @xmath3 than the other clusters of the sample , significant at @xmath8 confidence ) , abell 1185 and abell 2255 . to explore what types of galaxies cause these enhancements \n , we investigated @xmath3 as a function of optical magnitude . \n three bins in optical magnitude were created : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . for reference , \n @xmath12 for ellipticals @xcite \n so these approximately correspond to bright ellipticals , larger spirals and s0s , and later - type spirals and irregulars , respectively . \n the increased @xmath3 for abell 1185 was revealed to be caused by the intermediate optical magnitude galaxies . for abell 2255 , \n the increased @xmath3 was caused by both the optically brighter and fainter galaxies ( see figure [ fig - comprlf ] ) . in fact , the excess of the fainter galaxies was significant at over @xmath13 . \n this result is robust against variations in the background count . \n in fact , should _ all _ optically - faint galaxies in the direction of abell 2255 be cluster members ( hence no background correction and a minimum value for @xmath3 ) , the radio galaxy enhancement would still be significant at @xmath14 confidence .      with complete optical spectroscopy for abell 2255 , we further analyzed the emission source for the radio galaxies . \n of the 23 optically - faint galaxies in this cluster , 21 had radio emission associated with star formation . \n the other two were weak emission - line agn . among the star - forming galaxies \n there were many examples of rigorous star formation , including three starbursts with ew([oii])@xmath15 40@xmath16 and four dusty starbursts with slightly weaker ew([oii ] ) but strong h@xmath17 absorption ( see @xcite ) . \n additionally , one galaxy had a strong post - starburst spectrum . \n thus , there is strong evidence for current and dramatic activity within the galaxy population of abell 2255 . \n why is abell 2255 so special ? \n we searched for correlations between @xmath3 and parameters such as cluster richness and overall galaxy distribution ( i.e. , is the cluster compact or fairly dispersed ? ) , but found none . in studies of more distant butcher - oemler clusters , an increased @xmath3 for abell 2125 as compared to abell 2645 \n was noted despite the nearly identical redshift and richness of these clusters @xcite . \n the authors concluded that the discrepancy was likely the result of abell 2125 being a cluster - cluster merger rich in substructure whereas abell 2645 is more virialized . \n this explanation is attractive in the case of abell 2255 , as it is also a strong merger candidate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the main problem with this explanation is that other clusters in our sample are also probable mergers . as a case example , we discuss abell 2256 ( see @xcite for merger evidence ) . \n radio observations of this cluster were performed concurrently with those of abell 2255 , and the two clusters are also comparable in richness and redshift . however , with the possible exception of the optically - brightest galaxies the @xmath3 values for abell 2256 were normal ( see figure [ fig - comprlf ] ) . \n consistent with this result is the measured blue fraction for abell 2256 , @xmath18 @xcite . \n the key appears to be a combination of the merger stage and large - scale structure . \n we assessed the substructure in each cluster using a variety of techniques , including the dressler - schectman test @xcite and a kmm analysis to separate galaxies into respective substructures @xcite . \n each cluster showed evidence for substructure , but the specific distributions of the star - forming galaxies are illustrative . in abell 2255 , the star - forming galaxies were found in a strong north - south alignment which proved statistically significant through monte carlo testing . \n this alignment is perpendicular to the merger axis , which is east - west and fairly close to the plane of the sky @xcite . \n we would expect such an arrangement if the cluster - cluster merger initiated bursts of star formation as galaxies experienced spikes in ram pressure as they crossed the shock front of a very recent merger @xcite . \n presumably , the precursors to these starbursts were field - like spirals at the peripheries of the pre - merger systems . in abell 2256 \n , the star - forming galaxies are clustered slightly to the north of the cluster center , and prove to be almost exclusively associated with a high velocity group composed of around 30 members . \n interestingly enough , this substructure is not one of the culprits suggesting a large - scale merger in abell 2256 ; many more galaxies are associated with the primary cluster and a large infalling subcluster , the two obvious merger partners from the x - ray @xcite . that the star - forming galaxies originate in an infalling group \n underscores that the merger of a pair of rich clusters alone is likely not enough to cause an increase in the active galaxy population relative to other clusters . \n some `` fuel '' is required , in particular a population of gas - rich galaxies which can undergo a starburst . \n these are apparently supplied by outlying groups and field galaxies which are thrown into the mix by the merger . \n note that the main population responsible for the increased @xmath3 in abell 2255 are galaxies one to two magnitudes fainter than @xmath19 , similar to the magnitudes of late - type field spirals and the blue galaxies observed in butcher - oemler studies @xcite . in summary \n , we apparently see an enhancement in activity for abell 2255 as a result of both timing ( viewing the system after very recent core passage ) and large - scale structure ( having available galaxies which could undergo a starburst ) . \n the relationship of this explanation to the butcher - oemler effect is also quite attractive . \n currently favored cosmological models indicate that clusters are actively being assembled from smaller clusters and groups since @xmath20 , with the rate of such mergers increasing with redshift . \n consequently , the trend of increased blue fraction ( and @xmath3 ) with redshift is indicative of the assembly history of clusters . \n by @xmath21 , most clusters are fairly well assembled and virialized and consequently contain fewer active galaxies . \n the spread in the fraction of active galaxies at any given redshift is a reflection of the diversity of cluster dynamical states . \n more relaxed clusters would have fewer active galaxies , while clusters in the process of assembly would have more active galaxies . \n in fact , this explanation has been noted to alleviate the discrepancy in galaxy activity observed for the morphs and cnoc clusters , as the cnoc sample are x - ray selected and consequently more frequently associated with relaxed clusters @xcite . \n lastly , this spread in dynamical state indicates that galaxy activity may be observed even in nearby clusters . \n of course , this explanation requires a much larger sample of clusters to fill in necessary details . \n similar results are being found for very rich clusters at higher redshift , in a sample which includes the aforementioned abell 2125 @xcite . \n we have also obtained deep , wide - field radio and optical images of several nearby clusters ( out to @xmath22 ) in a range of merger stages . \n the author thanks the carnegie observatories for an informative and enjoyable conference , and frazer owen , bill oegerle , and john hill for their involvement in this work . \n the author also acknowledges the national radio astronomy observatory for a predoctoral appointment , and the national research council for postdoctoral support through an associateship award held at nasa goddard space flight center .", "StartTimeOffset": 1280241673464, "RequestID": "cca21b3d3d85165e43d6e0b85981803497242344", "TotalTokens": 2710}
{"ContextTokens": 3813, "GeneratedTokens": 173, "SynthesizedBody": "time - reversal symmetry is a fundamental concept in many branches of physics . \n a recent overview of applications in optics can be found in  @xcite . \n for example , time - reversal symmetry was exploited to achieve efficient absorption of a microwave by an antenna  @xcite or strong focusing in the microwave domain  @xcite as well as in the optical domain  @xcite . \n an early discussion about focusing onto an atom utilizing time - reversal arguments can be found in  @xcite . \n furthermore , time - reversal techniques have found applications in light - matter interaction such as in the storage and retrieval of photons in atomic ensembles  @xcite . \n very recent experiments report on the experimental realization of time - reversed lasing  @xcite . \n others utilize a time reversible scheme to optimize the quantum state transfer between two atoms trapped in distant cavities  @xcite .    within the field of light - matter interaction , \n an experiment relying crucially on the application of time - reversal arguments is the absorption of a single photon by a single two - level system ( tls ) in free space . following the time - reversal argument given in  @xcite \n , the absorption probability can reach unity if the photon s shape is exactly the time reversed version of a spontaneously emitted photon and the momentum transfer to the atom can be neglected . for the temporal profile of the single - photon wavepacket \n this implies an exponentially rising envelope with a time constant matching the lifetime of the tls .    in recent experiments , time - reversal techniques \n were succesfully applied to demonstrate a high absorption probability of a single photon by an atomic ensemble  @xcite . \n the benefit of pulse shaping in the case of single atoms and multi - photon pulses was demonstrated in  @xcite . \n however , experiments aiming at an efficient single - photon single - atom absorption process in free space remain challenging . until now , \n absorption probabilities of 0.03% have been reached in a three - level system  @xcite .    to demonstrate the dynamics of such a free - space single - photon single - atom absorption experiment in a simple set - up , we make use of the analogy between a tls and an empty optical resonator which was highlighted in earlier work  @xcite . following this analogy , the energy stored inside the resonator is the equivalent to the probability of a single photon to be absorbed by the tls , i.e. to the tls to be found in the excited state . \n the field which is directly reflected by the cavity corresponds to the light transmitted by the atom . \n the field leaking from inside the cavity through the incoupling mirror is the counterpart to the light coherently scattered in direction of the transmitted beam while the cavity leakage through the end mirror is the counterpart of the coherent scattering into all other directions . \n the cavity leakage through the incoupling mirror and the direct reflection ( respective forward scattered and transmitted light ) show destructive interference . in case of \n a perfectly reflecting end mirror ( @xmath1 ) and an incident pulse with rising exponential shape matching the cavity lifetime these two fields have equal amplitudes and the interference results in a zero net field amplitude during the pulse time - span . until the end of the pulse there is no cavity reflection and the complete pulse energy is stored inside the resonator . \n an imperfect end mirror ( @xmath2 ) leads to unavoidable losses to the stored energy because the leakage through the end mirror can not interfere with the incident light . \n this is equivalent to illumination of the atom from a limited solid angle smaller than @xmath3 while the scattering occurs into the full solid angle . \n more precisely , the solid angle of illumination corresponds to the asymmetry @xmath4 of the cavity mirrors , with @xmath5 being the transmission coefficients of the incoupling and end mirror , respectively .    in this paper , we present the experimental implementation of such a coupling experiment , demonstrating the power of time - reversal symmetry in optics . \n figure  [ setup ] shows a schematics of the experimental set - up . \n we use a frequency - doubled diode laser operating at a wavelength of 370 nm . \n this is the transition wavelength of an ytterbium ion which is our target system for the equivalent experiment  @xcite . \n the desired pulses are cut out of the continuous - wave laser beam by means of an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) working at a center frequency of 400mhz . \n it is driven by an arbitrary - waveform generator ( awg ) providing the radiofrequency signal with a suitably shaped envelope according to the desired pulse shape . \n the rise- and fall - time of the complete generation system amounts to 5ns and the repetition rate of the pulses is 200khz . \n details about the generation and characterization of rising exponential pulses can be found in  @xcite . \n here we checked the pulse shapes with a fast photodiode ( bandwidth 2ghz ) . \n the pulsed beam is coupled to a single - mode optical fibre and sent to the resonator set - up . \n two lenses and a filtering pinhole ensure the spatial mode matching of the beam to the cavity . \n the latter consists of two spherical mirrors at a distance of l=12.5 cm , each having a focal length of 7.5 cm . \n the reflectivity of the incoupling mirror is determined by direct transmission measurements with a power meter . \n it amounts to @xmath6 . according to manufacturer information , the scattering and absorption losses of the mirrors \n are two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath7 and can thus be neglected in this work . \n the reflectivity of the end mirror is obtained from ring - down measurements of the asymmetric cavity revealing a lifetime of @xmath8ns . in combination with the knowledge of @xmath9 we deduce a reflectivity of @xmath10 . since a reflectivity larger \n than one is unphysical , we set the upper bound of @xmath11 to 1 in the following . in order to tune the cavity length , \n the end mirror is mounted on a ring - shaped piezo actuator . \n this cavity set - up corresponds to an atomic experiment where the incident light is focused from 97% of the full solid angle . \n the lifetime of the cavity used here is comparable with atomic lifetimes .    by means of a polarizing beam - splitter followed by a quarter - wave plate \n the cavity reflection is separated from the incident beam . \n the reflected signal is detected by the photodiode pd1 , amplified and finally recorded by a fast oscilloscope with a sampling rate of 25gs / s . \n the detection bandwidth is limited by the bandwidth of the amplifier spanning the range from dc to 200mhz . \n a second photodiode pd2 is installed to observe the cavity transmission . however , for an asymmetric cavity the leakage through the end mirror is very weak , resulting in a signal to noise ratio smaller than one when measuring with sufficient detection bandwidth for the coupling experiment . \n thus , the complete dynamics of the system is extracted from the reflection signal pd1 . \n pd2 in turn is used in 1m@xmath12 coupling to determine the spatial mode matching of the incident beam to the cavity . for this purpose , \n the cavity length is scanned and transmission spectra of a continuous wave beam are taken . in the measurements presented here \n , the fraction @xmath13 of the incident light found in the tem@xmath0 mode lies between 94% and 96.5% . \n as mentioned above , the transmitted signal is too weak to be measured with the necessary temporal resolution due to the asymmetry of the cavity . \n consequently we have to reconstruct the energy storage and the cavity leakage through the end mirror from the reflected signal making use of the experimentally determined mirror reflectivities . in the following , \n we describe the data analysis algorithm .    for each pulse shape we record two datasets : for the first one the cavity is tuned to resonance , for the second one the cavity is tuned far off resonance . in the latter case \n the pulse is reflected with hardly any interaction with the cavity . \n thus , the corresponding dataset gives the incident pulse shape . in the following \n , the two datasets will be referred to as reflected intensity @xmath14 and incident intensity @xmath15 , respectively .    in a first step \n we need to correct the data for imperfect spatial mode matching because light in higher - order spatial modes is not resonant with the cavity in either measurement . \n this fraction of light will always be directly reflected and experiences no interference with the cavity leakage . \n thus , we replace the incident intensity by @xmath16 and the reflected intensity by @xmath17 where @xmath13 is the intensity fraction of light in the tem@xmath0 mode . for simplicity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 will directly denote the mode matching corrected quantities in the following .    in the next step , \n we reconstruct the energy inside the cavity and the leakage through the end mirror as a function of time . \n let @xmath20 denote the energy incident onto the cavity accumulated until time t , @xmath21 the energy which has left the cavity in reflection until time t and @xmath22 the corresponding quantity for the transmission . \n then the energy stored inside the cavity can be written as    @xmath23    with a being the cavity area and @xmath24 the transmitted intensity . @xmath15 and @xmath14 are directly obtained from the measurement . \n the unknowns @xmath25 and @xmath26 are linked to each other by the electric field inside the cavity . \n let @xmath27 denote the amplitude of the field running in one direction . \n the standing wave inside the resonator is then built up by two counterpropagating waves each having the amplitude @xmath27 : @xmath28 the leakage through the end mirror is determined by its transmission coefficient @xmath29 : @xmath30 plugging [ eq : standingwave ] and [ eq : transmission ] into [ eq : integral ] leads to an integral equation for @xmath31 : @xmath32 it is analytically solved yielding @xmath33\\exp(t_2t'/t_{\\text{rt}})\\,\\text{d } t'\\ ] ] with @xmath34 being the round - trip time .    inserting this result into [ eq : standingwave ] we are able to reconstruct the energy stored inside the cavity from the measurement :    @xmath35\\exp(t_2t'/t_{\\text{rt}})\\,\\text{d } t'\\ ] ] \n additionally we obtain the cavity transmission as    @xmath36    finally , all energies are normalized to the total energy @xmath37 incident onto the cavity . in the implementation of this analysis , \n the lower bound of the integrals is set to the beginning of the measurement window which was chosen to cover at least the complete incident pulse and ten lifetimes of the cavity decay .    in the last step of the analysis process \n we search the maximum of @xmath38 . \n this quantity will be referred to as energy coupling efficiency @xmath39 in the following . \n since no assumptions on the incident pulse shape are made , the above method is applicable to any pulse shape . \n first , we discuss the analysis method outlined above using the example of an exponentially rising pulse with a time constant @xmath40 close to the cavity lifetime . all numbers given in this section \n refer to the fraction of the light which is spatially mode matched to the cavity . \n figure  [ singlepulse ] shows the measured intensity traces as well as the reconstructed energies for a @xmath41ns pulse . \n if the cavity is tuned into resonance ( black line ) , the reflection is strongly suppressed until the end of the pulse . if plotting only the light in the tem@xmath0 mode ( inset ) , hardly any rising of the photodiode signal can be observed until t=0 , indicating that a huge amount of the energy is stored inside the cavity and only emitted after the end of the incident pulse . \n this is confirmed by the energy reconstruction displayed in figure  [ singlepulse ]  ( b ) . \n the accumulated incident energy rises until the end of the pulse and remains then constant . \n the stored energy fraction follows closely nearly until the end of the pulse . \n the small difference can be explained by the finite fall time of the incident field after the radiofrequency signal driving the aom was switched off . \n the reflected energy stays close to zero as long as the incident field is exponentially rising due to the interference of direct reflection and cavity leakage . \n when the incident pulse is switched off , the accumulated reflected energy amounts to only 1% of the incident energy and 94% are stored inside the cavity . for @xmath42 \n the cavity is decaying freely and most of the light is detected in reflection because of the asymmetry of the mirrors reflectivities . in total , \n 7% of the incident energy is transmitted through the cavity , partly already during the storage and partly during the decay .     in this measurement . \n for clarity , the plots are restricted to a time window shorter than the one used for measurement and analysis . ] \n next , we discuss the response of the cavity to exponentially rising pulses with different time constants . \n figure  [ lifetimes ] shows the experimental results for pulses each having a total duration of @xmath43 .     in this measurement . \n ]    the error bars are based on the uncertainty of the mirror reflectivities . in agreement with the time - reversal argument \n , the energy coupling efficiency reaches a maximum when the time constant equals the independently measured cavity lifetime . \n the solid line reflects the theoretical prediction for perfect exponential pulses  @xcite . \n the dashed line is the result of a simulation which takes the measured incident pulse shapes as input signal . \n the outcome of the latter simulation and the measured energy storage efficiencies agree very well quantitatively . \n the difference to the first simulation can be explained by the finite fall time of the aom causing a smoothed edge at the end of the exponential pulse .    for a pulse with time constant equal to the cavity lifetime \n , the effect of an imperfect temporal pulse shape can be described in a particularly simple way : it reduces to a single number , namely the overlap of the incident field amplitude with the ideal one . in the measurement presented here , \n this field overlap amounts to @xmath44 . following the reasoning of  @xcite \n , this implies an upper limit for the experimental energy coupling efficiency as @xmath45 . \n the same analysis could be performed for all other pulse shapes , bearing in mind that this simplified method is only valid for comparison with an ideal pulse , i.e. a perfect rising exponential pulse matching the cavity lifetime . \n thus it does nt reveal the difference to the simulation given by the solid line , but rather to its maximum , that is to say the maximally reachable coupling efficiency for a given pair of mirrors .    according to the time - reversal argument  @xcite \n , the perfectly matched pulse has to start at @xmath46 with an infinitely small intensity . \n however , in experiments pulse generation is limited to a finite time window which we refer to as pulse duration . \n the influence of finite pulse durations on the energy coupling efficiency is displayed in figure  [ durations ] . \n for this plot , we created exponentially rising pulses each having a time constant of @xmath47ns with durations varying between @xmath48 and @xmath43 . \n ns . symbols : experimental values . \n solid line : simulation for perfect pulse shapes . dashed line : simulation using the measured incident pulse shapes as input signal . \n the spatial mode matching amounts to @xmath49 in this measurement . ]    for long pulses , the energy coupling efficiency shows an asymptotic behaviour . \n the asymptote is approached in good approximation for pulse durations of four times the pulse time constant or longer . \n thus experiments as they underly figure  [ lifetimes ] with pulses of duration @xmath43 can be considered as experiments with practically infinitely long pulses . \n finally we measured the energy incoupling efficiency for rectangular pulses with different durations ( figure  [ rects ] ) . in this case , the deviation of the incident pulse from a perfect rectangular shape has hardly any influence . \n the measured energy coupling efficiency shows very good agreement with the theoretical prediction .     in this measurement . \n we implemented a cavity set - up with an asymmetry of @xmath50 to simulate the absorption dynamics of a single photon by a single atom . \n experiments with exponentially rising incident pulses demonstrate the power of time - reversal arguments in optics : by choosing a time constant matching the cavity lifetime , we achieved an energy coupling efficiency of @xmath51 . \n as defined in section  [ secanalysis ] , this value refers to the fraction of the light which is spatially mode matched to the cavity . \n while for an ideal system the complete pulse energy can be coupled to the resonator , any real implementation is subject to several restrictions as summarized in table  [ tab : restrictions ] . \n a conceptual limitation is given by the choice of the mirror reflectivities . \n in an experiment as performed here , the maximally attainable coupling efficiency is exactly the asymmetry of the mirrors reflectivities  @xcite . in an atomic absorption experiment , \n a similar constraint is given by the geometry of the set - up limiting the solid angle used for focusing onto the atom . \n the spatial beam shaping and the temporal pulse forming are technical restrictions for both kinds of experiments . \n taking into account also light in higher - order spatial modes , the experimentally observed fraction of the total incident energy stored inside the resonator amounts to 88% . considering all these constraints to our implementation \n , the measured energy coupling agrees very well with the theoretical prediction . \n p5mmp50mmc + & asymmetry @xmath4 & 97% + & spatial mode matching @xmath13 & 94% + & temporal mode matching @xmath52 & 97% +   + ideally & & 100% + & + & experimentally achievable & 94% + & measured value & @xmath53% + & + & experimentally achievable & 88% + & measured value & @xmath54% + \n m.s . acknowledges financial support from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) . \n g.l . wants to thank the german federal ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) for financial support in the framework of the joint research project `` quorep '' .", "StartTimeOffset": 1283144543094, "RequestID": "321d82af9eb5a9478029b494895dffd213913207", "TotalTokens": 3986}

current drell - yan processes naturally decompose into qed and weak contributions , i.e.  they build gauge invariant subsets and thus can be discussed separately . \n the radiation of collinear photons off quarks requires the factorization of the arising mass singularities into the pdfs which introduces a dependence on the qed factorization scale , @xmath15 .    in fig . \n [ fig : one ] we show the effect of the qed corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the final state lepton pair . \n photon radiation strongly affects the shape of the @xmath16 distribution . \n this is due to the mass singular terms associated with final state photon radiation , which are proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the final state lepton . \n +    at the z pole , the differential cross section is reduced by about 30% in the electron case and by about 20% in the muon case . below the z peak , qed corrections \n enhance the cross section by up to a factor  2.7 ( 1.9 ) for electrons ( muons ) . \n when lepton identification requirements are taken into account , the large contributions from mass singular logarithms largely cancel in the electron case because electron and photon momenta are combined for small opening angles between the two particles . for muons , \n the energy of a photon which traverses the same calorimeter cell as the muon is required to be @xmath19  gev , and only the momenta of muons and photons with @xmath19  gev are combined . as a result , the mass singular logarithmic terms survive , and the effect of radiative corrections becomes more pronounced , especially at large di -

like logarithms , the non - resonant weak corrections strongly increase in magnitude with increasing transverse masses . \n both , the resonant and non - resonant electroweak corrections reduce the differential cross section . \n the high transverse mass tail can be used for a direct measurement of the width of the w boson , @xmath9 , which in the sm is predicted to be @xmath31  gev . in run \n i , @xmath9 has been been measured by cdf and d  with a combined uncertainty of 105  mev from the @xmath22 tail  @xcite . in run \n iia , with an integrated luminosity of 2  fb@xmath32 , one expects to achieve a precision of 50  mev per lepton channel and experiment  @xcite . in order to determine how non - resonant electroweak corrections affect the w width extracted from the tail of the transverse mass distribution \n , it is useful to consider the ratio of the normalized @xmath22 distribution for an arbitrary w width to the normalized @xmath22 distribution with sm w width , @xmath33\\over \\left[d\\sigma(sm)/dm_t\\right]}~{\\sigma(sm ) \\over\\sigma(\\gamma_w)}\\ ] ] when resonant @xmath11 corrections only are taken into account . \n it is easy to show that @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35 for @xmath36 . \n @xmath34 is shown for @xmath37 at the tevatron in fig . \n [ fig : three ] . \n the dashed , dotted and dash - dotted curves represent the predictions for @xmath38  gev , 2.042  gev and 2.052  gev , respectively . \n the solid line shows the result if , instead of a non - standard w width and resonant corrections , the full @xmath11 electroweak corrections with @xmath31  gev are used . \n the error bars represent the expected statistical uncertainties for 2  fb@xmath32 . \n experimental lepton identification criteria and detector resolution effects are taken into account in fig . \n [ fig : three ] . \n figure  [ fig : three ] shows that both , non - resonant electroweak corrections and a w width smaller than that predicted in the sm , lead to similar effects in the tail of the @xmath22 distribution . \n this effect sets on gradually in case of the non - resonant corrections . for a non - standard w width in contrast \n , the ratio drops rapidly above the w pole position , and becomes constant for @xmath39  gev . \n since the experimental precision in the tail of the @xmath22 distribution quickly decreases with increasing values of the transverse mass , one concludes that non -

{"ContextTokens": 3355, "GeneratedTokens": 130, "SynthesizedBody": "the energy spectrum of cosmic rays , an important key to realize the origin and acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays , can be simply described by a power law over many magnitudes of energy from @xmath1 ev to @xmath2 ev @xcite , except for a few distinctive structures , such as the knee phenomenon around @xmath3 ev . \n the spectral power index rapidly steepens from about @xmath4 before the knee to @xmath5 over the knee @xcite . \n numerous works on cosmic ray propagation and acceleration mechanisms have been done to investigate the origin of the knee . \n these include the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) spectra origin of the knee based on the theory of non - linear diffusive particle acceleration by shock waves from supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite , and the contribution of nearby pulsar wind producing very hard spectra in the power - law spectra in the knee region @xcite . however , the origin of the knee structure is still unconfirmed . \n currently , the interpretations of this phenomenon are based on phenomenological models from experimental measurements . \n many results have been given by direct observations with balloon detectors @xcite and indirect observations with air - shower detectors on high altitude mountains @xcite . \n the cream experiment , as a balloon detector , has announced precise measurements of energy spectra for individual nuclei ranging from @xmath6 tev to @xmath7 tev @xcite . as an air - shower ground - based detector located @xmath8 m above sea level \n , the tibet-@xmath0 array has presented an all - particle energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays from @xmath9 tev to @xmath9 pev , revealing a sharp knee structure around @xmath10 pev . another air - shower experiment with the same altitude as tibet-@xmath0 , argo - ybj , recently gave a new measurement of the energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei , exhibiting a clear knee structure @xcite . \n the latest measurements released by argo - ybj are investigated by the joint operation of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) detectors and a cherenkov telescope . \n this hybrid detection bridges the gap between balloon detectors and ground - based experiments , improves the shower energy resolution and enhances the capability to discriminate showers induced by light nuclei from events initiated by heavier nuclei . \n they yield clear evidence for a knee - like structure in the spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei under 1 pev @xcite .    in the following discussions , \n we explain the knee spectra measured by argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 by phenomenological models . \n the superposition of energy spectrum of individual components described by a simple broken power - law can not reconcile the light components and all - particle energy spectra . \n we therefore propose a parametric model to reconcile them . in sec . \n @xmath6 we give two different scenarios and parameters to fit the experimental data . \n @xmath11 presents the average mass . \n finally , sec.@xmath10 gives some discussion and conclusions . \n cosmic rays emitted from the sources are most likely accelerated in the strong shock fronts of snrs by the dsa mechanism . \n the particles are deflected by chaotic magnetic fields , cross shock fronts frequently , and therefore gain energy up to the pev region . \n this acceleration leads to the observed approximate power - law spectrum . \n the energy spectrum is modified during diffusive propagation . \n the spectra near the sources vary from that observed on the earth , which may due to nuclear spallation or decay , ionization losses , leakage from the galaxy and solar modulation for low energies . \n we try to adopt two different phenomenological models to explain the observed energy spectra around knee structure . \n one is an expression of a simple broken power - law and the other is the broken power - law with non - linear modification term . \n the all - particle primary energy spectra derived from extensive air shower experiments can be described by a broken power - law function . \n we therefore use this kind of function to parameterize the observed differential energy spectra for individual elements of cosmic ray , which can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the differential flux of the individual element with energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the normalization constant , @xmath16 represents the break point of the proton spectrum , @xmath17 is the atomic number , @xmath18 is the power index in the energy range @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes the power index when @xmath21 . \n we try to use this expression to fit both the combined energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei observed by argo - ybj and the all - particle energy spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . \n the interaction model sibyll for tibet data is used in this work . \n we firstly fix the energy spectra of each component below the knee region , and then extrapolate the spectra beyond the knee . \n the observed data of individual elements ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) from cream are adopted . \n for the spectrum index of each element , see @xcite . \n an expression of simple power - law @xmath30 is used to fit the spectrum of each component , with the fitting parameters @xmath31 and spectral indices listed in table 1 . \n cccc @xmath17 & element & @xmath32 & @xmath18 + 1 & h & @xmath33 & 2.66 + 2 & he & @xmath34 & 2.58 + 6 & c & @xmath35 & 2.61 + 8 & o & @xmath36 & 2.67 + 10 & ne & @xmath37 & 2.72 + 12 & mg & @xmath38 & 2.66 + 14 & si & @xmath39 & 2.67 + 26 & fe & @xmath40 & 2.63 +    with equation ( [ eq : zy1 ] ) , we fit the combined spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei observed by argo - ybj @xcite , and get the fitting result of energy break point @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the proton . \n the break point for other elements can be calculated by @xmath43 . \n the spectral indices of all elements at the higher energy range beyond the knee region are assumed to be the same value as the result from argo - ybj , i.e. @xmath44 . \n we sum up the energy spectra of all elements to get the approximate all - particle spectrum , seen as the red solid line in fig . \n [ fig : zy1 ] . \n it can be seen from fig . \n [ fig : zy1 ] that this all - particle spectrum based on argo - ybj observation with this simple broken power - law model can not match the observed all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . \n the simple broken power - law function therefore can not describe the energy spectrum in the knee region , which perhaps is due to the influence of the dsa mechanism . \n [ fig : zy1 ]      since the differential energy spectrum in the form of the simple broken power - law can not reconcile the observations of argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 , a new correction term is added , so the broken power - law can now be expressed as @xmath45(1+\\frac{e}{z\\epsilon_{b}})^{-\\delta\\gamma } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is assumed to be a @xmath17-dependent parameter , and @xmath47 is a constant . \n the dsa mechanism may result in a spectrum with concave - up curvature , so we multiply the non - linear term @xmath48 into the simple broken power - law to structure a concave - up form as a phenomenological model . without this non - linear term , the superimposed all - particle spectrum from all elements is smooth and can not fit the sharp knee structure as measured by tibet-@xmath0 . \n in addition , we have tried some parameters in a non-@xmath17-dependent form , but these can not match the data , so we finally adopt the form in equation ( [ eq : zy2 ] ) . \n an equation to express the non - linear effects is proposed in @xcite . \n they propose the non - linear process by a modified exponential cut - off expression for the spectra from sources , and then deduce the observed spectra by the superposition of these spectra . from their formula , the model they deduced is a kind of broken power - law multiplied by a complex modified term . while our expression form is simpler , we modify the simple broken power - law directly as the observed spectra and then parameterize this scenario . \n combined with the newly published measurements from argo - ybj , our model is easier to quantify the parameters precisely . a model with precisely confirmed parameters \n will help us to review its intrinsic physical issues . from equation ( [ eq : zy2 ] ) , we get a good fit result to match the observations from both argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 with parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the proton . \n @xmath53 values of other elements are assumed to obey the formula @xmath54 . \n the fitting spectra are plotted in fig . \n [ fig : zy2 ] , where the solid red line represents the all - particle spectrum . from fig . \n [ fig : zy2 ] we can see that the all - particle spectrum based on argo - ybj observation can match the observed all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . based on this model , the distinctive knee structure is mostly contributed by heavy elements such as @xmath29 . \n [ fig : zy2 ]    in order to obtain the best fitting parameters for the non - linear model , we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite , a very efficient algorithm , to achieve our goal . considering that the calculation of @xmath55 will be affected by the too small errors of all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 \n , we amplify the errors of this spectrum by taking account of energy resolution . \n the initial form of data with errors listed in the literature @xcite are expressed by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the flux and @xmath58 denotes the systematic error . as a new deduced additional error , a new term \n is added to this expression , i.e. @xmath59 , where @xmath18 denotes the spectrum index . \n we take the energy resolution @xmath60 as a constant . \n the following @xmath61 parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath47 , @xmath16 and @xmath53 , are set free for the mcmc algorithm , where @xmath46 consists of free parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and redshift @xmath17 . \n the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath53 here refer to protons as mentioned above . \n because every spectrum index of elements in the higher energy band beyond the knee is supposed to be the same value , we can get the @xmath53 of other components from the @xmath53 of the proton . by this mcmc algorithm \n , we obtain the best fitting parameters as follows : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the proton . \n the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath16 decide the shapes of the energy spectra . \n different values result in different spectra , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : zy3 ] , where the elements @xmath22 and @xmath29 are taken as examples .          [ fig : zy3 ]    the best fit result is shown in fig . \n [ fig : zy4 ] . \n the measurements of hydrogen and helium nuclei spectra using the sibyll model by the kascade group @xcite are compared with our model in fig . \n [ fig : zy4 ] . \n the kaskade group claimed that the energy spectra of both proton and helium show a knee - like feature , but in our model , this seems not to be the case . \n [ fig : zy4 ] \n a commonly - used quantity to characterize the mass composition of cosmic rays is the mean logarithmic mass , which is defined as @xmath69 @xmath70 being the relative fraction of nuclei of mass @xmath71 . \n the average mass is reported by many air shower experiments , but the results are divergent because of the poor primary mass resolution . \n we calculate the average mass for two cases : one for the former non - linear model and another for the latter best fitting case , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : zy5 ] .    from our derived average mass of cosmic rays , we can see @xmath72 goes up between several hundreds of tev and several tens of pev . \n it implies that heavier components occupy an increasing proportion with the increase of energy , and predicts an iron - dominant composition above the knee . \n but the components above the knee are not all @xmath29 , because @xmath72 for @xmath29 is about 4.0 . \n further experimental measurements of the chemical composition of high energy cosmic rays will verify our prediction . \n if the light components dominate the knee structure , this model can be excluded , while if the heavy components dominate the knee structure , this model will be confirmed , and the measurements will be helpful to improve the model parameters .     [ \n fig : zy5 ] \n many mechanisms have been discussed to explain the knee structure of cosmic rays , including the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays in supernova explosion shock fronts , leakage from the galaxy , interactions with background particles in the interstellar medium , and new physics of interactions in the atmosphere . \n some models are likely to be excluded , however , such as the leaky box model , interactions with background particles and new types of interactions in the atmosphere . \n the leakage from the galaxy does not give a distinct change of the spectral slope at the knee . \n the scenario of interactions with background particles yields a very light mean logarithmic mass , while the measurements indicate an increase of mass with energy . for new types of interactions in the atmosphere , \n there are no inconsistencies between the different air shower components by the simultaneous observations from kascade , and the measurements of different air shower components can be interpreted with standard particle physics @xcite . \n we propose two scenarios to reconcile the light components and all - particle energy spectra by phenomenological models . in the first scenario \n , we use a simple broken power - law model to fit the combined energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei measured by argo - ybj and the all - particle spectrum measured by tibet-@xmath0 , but the all - particle spectrum can not be fitted by this model . hence , the simple broken power - law fails to explain the knee structure . in the second scenario , \n a non - linear modification term is added to the broken power - law . \n this modified broken power - law model with non - linear acceleration effects can describe the sharp knee structure . \n the mechanism of non - linear effects at shock fronts of snrs has been explained in earlier works @xcite . \n particles with higher energies can scatter farther ahead of the shock , which results in an effectively higher compression ratio , so a more locally hard spectrum is produced , and a concave - up curvature to the accelerated - particle distribution is expected . \n in addition , this modified model predicts that heavy elements dominate at the knee . based on this model , some models holding the viewpoints of weak knee structure or protons dominating the knee are likely to be excluded . \n precise measurements of energy spectra of individual elements in the knee region will test our model .", "StartTimeOffset": 1312140951480, "RequestID": "0fc4961ee3ac2ea4c7f4340f250d1c3b94d1a807", "TotalTokens": 3485}

[ fig : geometries ] . in the scheme \n the base of each detector is turned by an angle of 50@xmath2 to the horizontal . the most efficient way to pack fibres together to form inclined columns \n is not obvious . \n `` rows '' of fibres are defined along the layers in the direction of the detector base . for column angles between 30@xmath2 and 60@xmath2 \n the arrays can be formed in a way that all fibres of a column touch each other ( closed columns ) , but leaving gaps to the corresponding fibres in neighbouring columns . \n alternatively , the arrays can be formed with corresponding fibres of neighbouring columns touching ( closed rows ) , leaving gaps between fibres within a column . finally , for column angles @xmath5 below 30@xmath2 both columns and rows can be closed . for column angles of 30@xmath2 and 60@xmath2 \n the fibre centres are forming a hexagonal lattice . for a column angle of 45@xmath2 the fibre centres are forming a square lattice . \n the hexagonal packing , in which each fibre is surrounded by 6 touching fibres , has the highest packing density of @xmath7 0.90 . \n square and hexagonal packing geometry are used most often for fibre arrays . \n each geometry corresponds to a different overlap fraction , a different column pitch , a different detector width and length for a given number of layers and read - out pixels , and a different average thickness . \n the relevance of these design criteria for choosing the detector geometry vary with the specific application . \n primarily , the fibre array needs to provide a high enough light yield per read - out pixel to discriminate the signals against noise . \n light yield and detection efficiency depend on the diameter and overlap fraction as well as on the number of layers . \n secondly , the spatial resolution depends on fibre diameter and column pitch . a detector geometry with closed columns \n as shown in the figure will have a relatively large column pitch and a relatively small spatial overlap . \n this leads to low spatial resolution and low detection efficiency . \n both can be avoided by placing the layers not along the base of the detector , but with a smaller column pitch and larger spatial overlap . \n that will create a shift between the first fibres of each column and the base - line it was supposed to track . by occasionally ( every 3 or more columns ) moving the column position one full fibre diameter in the direction of the base - line \n the shift will be corrected . \n these geometries have the advantage of being better adapted to practical applications , but have less symmetry . for column angles above 60@xmath2 geometries with neither columns nor rows \n closed can be created in a similar way . in practice , only those fibre arrays can be built which allow precise mounting and alignment during all stages of the processing : gluing , bending , and installation . \n [ fig : design](left ) shows the ratio of the column pitch to the fibre radius , @xmath8 , i.e.  the distance between two fibre centres along the base direction in units of fibre radius , as a function of the column angle , @xmath5 . \n the main branch starting at a ratio @xmath9 2 corresponds to a geometry with both , closed rows and closed columns , for which @xmath10 . \n the branch splitting off at @xmath11 corresponds to a geometry with closed columns , where @xmath12 . \n the continuous curve is calculated for the geometry in which the rows are closed . \n the branch splitting off at @xmath13 follows a @xmath14 dependence and corresponds to closed columns . \n spatial overlap is important to avoid relying on the detection of events with only a grazing contact of the charged particle with the fibres . \n a particle which crosses the gap between two fibres in one of the layers needs to traverse a significant portion of the full fibre diameter in the other layer . fig . \n [ fig : design](right ) shows the overlap fraction , @xmath15 , which is the overlap of two neighbouring fibre columns in units of the fibre radius . \n it is directly related to the pitch to radius ratio by @xmath16 . \n fibre diameter and overlap fraction relate to the theoretical spatial resolution of fibre arrays expected from the geometry . for events \n in which exclusively one column was hit , the the spatial resolution is @xmath17 . for events in which the particle trajectory covered purely the inter - column region , \n the spatial resolution is given by @xmath18 . \n averaging both event types leads to a combined resolution of @xmath19 . for fibre detectors in hexagonal packed arrays \n the total overlap is @xmath20 with a pitch of @xmath21 . \n the theoretical spatial resolution of such an array is @xmath22 . \n the spread of energy deposition in a fibre bundle is proportional to the detector thickness variation . \n [ fig : thickness ] shows how the double layer thickness varies as a function of the base coordinate . in the hexagonal packing with a column angle of @xmath23 60@xmath2 \n the variation is @xmath24 ( minimum to maximum ) per double layer . for \n all other column angles the variation can become smaller , depending on the fibre array geometry . \n the design criteria discussed so far only apply when all particles cross the detector with the same incident angle . \n the expected response of a detector to diverging particles can be evaluated in a simulation . \n different fibre arrays , in which particles were crossing the detector with finite incident angles with respect to the column angle , were included in a detector simulation within the geant4 framework  @xcite . \n incident electron trajectories were averaged over the base . \n the simulation gave information on the energy deposition in individual fibres and on interactions of the particles with the material , e.g.  small angle scattering , ionisation and bremsstrahlung . \n the total energy deposited in the active cores of the four corresponding fibres of each column was calculated . \n signals above a given threshold were assigned to the corresponding read - out pixel . \n the increase in channel multiplicity for detectors with column angles of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is presented in fig . \n [ fig : multiplicities ] as a function of the incident angle @xmath3 . \n it is shown that the multiplicity increases gradually to smaller incident angles but steeper to higher angles . \n owing to the symmetry of the fibre arrays , a local maximum of the multiplicity appears for @xmath13 at @xmath1 30@xmath2 , and for @xmath27 at @xmath1 0@xmath2 . \n it is obvious that the columns must be aligned with the incident particle direction and the particle s divergence must be small to achieve a minimal multiplicity and an optimal spatial resolution . \n the simulation can further help to define the optimum threshold so that a detector becomes insensitive to incoming particles with large angles w.r.t  the nominal angle . \n that is important when a detector is exposed to a large number of background particles . \n the angular dependence of the detector efficiency is plotted in fig . \n [ fig : efficiency ] for 4 different relative thresholds . \n the relative threshold of 100% corresponds to the mean signal of a detector pixel for events with particles hitting the detector with nominal angle . \n the plateau width for 100% efficiency depends crucially on the threshold . for incident angles much smaller than the nominal angle \n only one fibre of each column is hit , but many neighbouring channels . \n thus , the probability for having a signal in at least one pixel above threshold is strongly dependent on the distribution of energy deposition and the value of the threshold , but almost independent on geometry and incident angle . \n when a set of fibres from a multi - layered fibre detector is coupled to a multi - channel read - out device a multitude of different fibre array geometries is possible . \n it is the experimenter s choice to select the geometry , which is matching the application best , according to the relevant design criteria . in this paper the dependence of column pitch and overlap ratio on the fibre array column angle \n is discussed . \n both criteria are also reflected by the thickness variation of a double layer , which is shown for a selection of column angles . \n the effect of diverging particles incident on fibre arrays with inclined columns was studied with the help of a monte carlo simulation . \n the resulting curves of channel multiplicity versus incident angle can be folded with the incident angle distribution of an experiment to get the average channel multiplicity . \n large multiplicities compromise the position resolution of the fibre arrays , which is the key issue for tracking detectors . with the choice of the detection threshold , the sensitivity of the detector to particles with large deviations to the nominal angle can be varied . \n this work was supported by the federal state of rhineland -

luminous , non - baryonic weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , that could form the majority of the matter in the universe @xcite . \n each detector is a disk 7.6 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick . \n the detectors are operated at cryogenic temperatures @xmath4 40 mk to collect the athermal phonons created upon an interaction in the crystal in four independent sensors . \n in addition , the electron hole pairs created by a recoil are drifted in a field of 3v / cm ( ge ) , 4v / cm ( si ) towards two concentric electrodes lithographically patterned on one flat side of the crystals @xcite . in the analysis events from the outer part of the detectors \n are removed by a fiducial volume cut based on the partitioning of energy between the two concentric charge electrodes . \n the simultaneous measurement of the phonon and ionization recoil energy of an interaction in the crystals not only allows an accurate measurement of the recoil energy independent of recoil type ( nuclear / electron recoil ) , but also allows the discrimination between nuclear and electron recoils by the so called ionization yield parameter , which is the ratio of the ionization and phonon energy , providing a rejection factor of @xmath5@xmath6 . \n nuclear recoils produce fewer charge pairs , and hence less ionization energy than do electron recoils of the same energy . \n the ionization yield for electron and nuclear recoils is determined from @xmath7ba and @xmath8cf calibrations respectively , providing the bands shown in fig.[fig : yieldtiming ] . \n passive shielding , consisting of lead and polyethylene layers , are used to reduce external gamma and neutron backgrounds , leaving decays of radioactive contamination inside the shielding as the dominant natural background . \n monte carlo simulations with the geant4 toolkit of the radioactive contamination ( isotopes of the @xmath9u and @xmath10th chain as well as @xmath11co and @xmath12k ) of materials inside the experimental apparatus match the observed background spectra very well , revealing no unidentified spectral lines , which would indicate an additional contamination . \n the whole experimental setup is surrounded by an active scintillator veto to reject events caused by cosmogenic muons or showers . \n neutrons induced by radioactive processes or cosmogenic muons interacting near the experimental apparatus , can generate nuclear recoils which can not be distinguished from possible dark matter interactions on an event -

energy electrons from surfaces near the detectors . \n a correlation analysis between alpha - decay and surface - event rates provides evidence that @xmath14pb is a major component of our surface event background . \n the remaining surface - event rate is compatible with the rate expected from photon induced events @xcite .            to discriminate surface events against nuclear recoil events the timing properties of the phonon pulses are used . \n the two parameters used to cut out surface events and select nuclear recoils are the delay of the slower phonon signal with respect to the ionization signal and the risetime of the leading phonon pulse ( which is the one with the highest amplitude ) , since surface events have smaller delays and faster risetimes than bulk nuclear - recoils . \n the cut , based on the sum of risetime and delay provides good surface event rejection , improving the overall rejection of electron recoils to @xmath5@xmath15 . \n the cut is designed for each detector independently by using calibration data only as shown in fig.[fig : yieldtiming ] . only single scatters with a timing parameter value greater than the cut value \n are considered as wimp candidates . \n a single scatter is required to deposit energy in one and only one detector . in the analysis \n the signal window is constrained by the 2@xmath16 nuclear recoil band . \n the current analysis used data ( 397.8kg -

ii . \n the redesign of the phonon readout , which maximizes the active phonon collection area , and new sensor configurations are expected to improve the discrimination between surface events and nuclear - recoils . \n the first two super towers consisting each of six 1inch thick detectors will be installed at the soudan site by 2009 to demonstrate the improved discrimination capabilities , and show that the operation with a background free signal region can be maintained . at the supercdms 25 \n kg stage seven super towers will be installed and operated at snolab . as shown in fig.[fig : exlimits ] , supercdms 25 kg aims to reach a sensitivity of 1@xmath0@xmath3@xmath19 at a wimp mass of 60gev / c@xmath18 . \n the cdms -

{"ContextTokens": 2013, "GeneratedTokens": 172, "SynthesizedBody": "studying the early universe requires describing the evolution of interacting fields in a dense , high - energy environment . \n the study of reheating after inflation and the subsequent thermalization of the fields produced in this process typically involves non - perturbative interactions of fields with exponentially large occupations numbers in states far from thermal equilibrium . \n various approximation methods have been applied to these calculations , including linearized analysis and the hartree approximation . \n these methods fail , however , as soon as the field fluctuations become large enough that they can no longer be considered small perturbations . \n in such a situation linear analysis no longer makes sense and the hartree approximation neglects important rescattering terms . in many models of inflation preheating can amplify fluctuations to these large scales within a few oscillations of the inflaton field . \n moreover , such large amplification appears to be a generic feature , arising via parametric resonance in single - field inflationary models and tachyonic instabilities in hybrid models . \n the only way to fully treat the nonlinear dynamics of these systems is through lattice simulations . \n these simulations directly solve the classical equations of motion for the fields . \n although this approach involves the approximation of neglecting quantum effects , these effects are exponentially small once preheating begins . \n so in any inflationary model in which preheating can occur lattice simulations provide the most accurate means of studying post - inflationary dynamics . \n in 2000 g.f.and igor tkachev released latticeeasy @xcite , a c++ program for simulating scalar field evolution in an expanding universe . in the ensuing years latticeeasy \n has been used by us and other groups to study such topics as preheating , baryogenesis , gravity wave production , and more . \n these simulations have been extremely useful , but they have for the most part been confined to relatively simple toy models , primarily due to computational limitations . \n to study cosmology in more complex models such as the mssm or gut theories will require the use of large , parallel clusters . \n clustereasy is a version of latticeeasy that can be run in parallel on multiple processors . \n section [ overview ] of this paper gives a brief overview of what latticeeasy does and how to use it , and notes the modifications that must be made in the latticeeasy files to run them in clustereasy . \n section [ implementation ] describes the algorithms used to parallelize the simulations . for more detailed documentation \n the reader is referred to the latticeeasy website ` http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/physics/fstaff/gfelder/latticeeasy/ ` \n latticeeasy consists of several c++ files , but only two are designed to be modified by most users . \n each particular scalar field potential that the program solves is encoded in a _ model file _ called model.h , in which the user enters equations for the potential and its various derivatives . \n the parameters that control individual runs are stored in a file called parameters.h . \n these parameters include physical quantities such as masses and couplings , numerical quantities such as the number of gridpoints and the size of the time step , and parameters to control what types of output are generated by the simulation . \n to use clustereasy the user must replace all of the non - user - modifiable files from latticeeasy with the new , clustereasy versions . the parameter files from latticeeasy can be used with no changes , however , and the model files only need the addition of two lines , described in the online documentation . \n the formats of the outputs created by clustereasy are the same as those from the serial version . \n one of the output options is to create a grid image that can be used to resume a run and continue it to later times . \n grid images created by latticeeasy can be read in by clustereasy and vice - versa . the only way to distinguish clustereasy output from latticeeasy output is the file info , which contains basic information about the run such as the potential used and the physical and numerical parameters . in clustereasy this file has an additional line specifying the number of processors used for the run .    to run clustereasy \n you need a cluster with mpi . \n mpi is a standard set of libraries used for parallel programming in c , c++ , and fortran , and should be installed on any standard cluster . \n you also need the freely available fourier transform library fftw . \n ( see the online documentation for possible compatibility issues with the way fftw is installed on different systems and how to resolve them . )    the makefile that comes with clustereasy assumes that the command for compiling a c++ mpi program is mpicc . \n if this command is different on your system you will need to modify the makefile accordingly \n . otherwise you should be able to compile the code simply by typing `` make . '' \n you should consult your system documentation for the correct syntax for running a parallel program , but on most clusters it is ` mpirun -np < number of processors > latticeeasy ` note that the number of processors is determined at execution - time , not at compile - time . \n latticeeasy uses a staggered leapfrog algorithm with a fixed time step . \n this means that at each step the field values @xmath0 and their derivatives @xmath1 are stored at two different times @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . \n the derivatives are used to advance the field values by a full step @xmath4 and then the field values are used to calculate the second derivatives @xmath5 , which are in turn used to advance the field derivatives by @xmath4 . \n this evolution is done in place , meaning the newly calculated field values and/or derivatives overwrite the old ones .    to implement this scheme on multiple processors clustereasy uses `` slab decomposition , '' meaning the grid \n is divided along a single dimension ( the first spatial dimension ) . \n for example , in a 2d run with @xmath6 on two processors , each processor would cast a @xmath7 grid for each field . at each processor \n the variable _ \n n _ stores the local size of the grid in the first dimension , so in this example each processor would store @xmath8 , @xmath6 . note that _ n _ is not always the same for all processors , but it generally will be if the number of processors is a factor of _ n_.    in practice , the grids are actually slightly larger than @xmath9 because calculating spatial derivatives at a gridpoint requires knowing the neighboring values , so each processor actually has two additional columns for storing the values needed for these gradients . \n continuing the example from the previous paragraph , each processor would store a @xmath10 grid for each field . within this grid the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 \n would be used for storing `` buffer '' values , and the actual evolution would be calculated in the range @xmath13 , @xmath14 . \n this scheme is shown in figure  [ clusterimage ] . at each time \n step each processor advances the field values in the shaded region , using the buffers to calculate spatial derivatives . \n then the processors exchange edge data . at the bottom of the figure i ve labeled the @xmath15 value of each column in the overall grid . during the exchange processor 0 \n would send the new values at @xmath16 and @xmath17 to processor 1 , which would send the values at @xmath18 and @xmath19 to processor 0 . \n the actual arrays allocated by the program are even larger than this , however , because of the extra storage required by the fourier transform routines . in two and three dimensions clustereasy uses fftw . \n when you fourier transform the fields the nyquist modes are stored in extra positions in the last dimension , so the last dimension is @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 . \n the total size per field of the array at each processor is thus typically @xmath22 in 1d , @xmath23 in 2d and @xmath24 in 3d . in 2d \n fftw sometimes requires extra storage for intermediate calculations as well , in which case the array may be somewhat larger than this , but usually not much . \n this does not occur in 3d . \n we have found that the speed of the simulation scales roughly as the number of processors , provided that number is significantly smaller than @xmath21 , the number of gridpoints along each edge of the lattice . \n a good rule of thumb is that you probably wo nt get much benefit from using more processors than @xmath25 . \n also , you will get slightly better performance per processor if the number of processors is a factor of @xmath21 so that the processors can divide the lattice up evenly . \n clustereasy offers the opportunity to do simulations of much larger , more complex , and more realistic early universe theories than was possible with serial simulations . \n we offer it in the hope that it will be useful to the research community . \n the usual thanks offered in a paper are inadequate for the impressive contributions made by students and other collaborators on this project . \n significant work on the project was done in particular by sirein awadalla , douglas swanson , and hal finkel . \n others who contributed include jing li , dessislava michaylova , and olga navros . \n i would also like to thank richard easther for valuable discussions and the canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics for hosting me during part of this work . \n finally , i would like to thank igor tkachev , my collaborator on latticeeasy , without whom none of this would have been possible . \n g.f . was supported by nsf grant phy-0456631 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1337734378464, "RequestID": "b3e6d8088b185f5a62399eef29c77bfc14ad47dd", "TotalTokens": 2185}

body lifetime calculations using the gw approximation @xcite have clarified the role of electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) interactions as well as the relative importance of intraband and interband scattering and screening . the damping rate due to electron - phonon scattering is also quantitatively understood @xcite . however , comparing theoretical with stm - derived experimental damping rates of electronic excitations with energies above the fermi level @xmath2 show that the experimental decay rates increase more rapidly with increasing energy @xmath1 . recently a similar discrepancy between image state lifetimes measured by means of the stm and two - photon - photoemission spectroscopy was lifted @xcite . \n it was shown that the applied electric field during the stm - measurement causes an increase in both the efficiency of the image state decay channels as well as their number . in the light of this work , becker _ \n et al . _ theoretically investigated the impact of the stm - induced electric field on the inelastic _ e - e _ damping rate of the electron- and hole - like excitations in the shockley surface state band at ag(111 ) @xcite . \n their results indicate that under typical tunnelling conditions the stm does not significantly alter the surface state wave function and so previous stm - derived shockley state lifetimes need not be corrected . \n nevertheless , while experimental and calculated lifetimes agree quite well over a range of energies , a quantitative difference remains for unoccupied states of energies @xmath3  mev . \n the origin of this different energy dependence , which is still an open question , is addressed in this report . \n the calculations presented here are based upon the approach developed by chulkov _ et al . _ \n @xcite , and used widely in calculations of surface state dynamics @xcite . within this approach the damping rate or inverse lifetime of an excitation in the state @xmath4 with energy @xmath1 \n is obtained from the expectation value of the imaginary part of the electron self -

dimensional pseudopotential varying in the direction perpendicular to the surface @xcite . \n the pseudopotential does not describe the @xmath19-electrons of the substrate , which are anyways too low in energy to play a significant role as final states for the decay , but their contribution to the screening is included via a polarisable background @xcite . \n ( color online ) ag(111 ) surface band structure . \n shaded area and solid line are the projected bulk and surface state dispersion from _ ab -

phonon contribution to the linewidth is taken to be constant @xmath22  mev for energies in excess of @xmath23  mev above the fermi level @xcite . \n previous calculations of the decay rate of the ag(111 ) shockley state have assumed parabolic dispersion with effective masses of @xmath20 and @xmath24 for the intrinsic surface state and the lower band edge respectively @xcite . \n however , over the extended energy range of interest here , this approximation needs to be improved as evident from fig . \n [ fig : disp ] . figure [ fig : disp ] shows the parabolic dispersions ( dashed lines ) for the surface state band and the band edge with effective masses as mentioned above . \n the grey shaded area and the solid line are the projected bulk and surface state dispersion , respectively , that are found from _ ab - initio _ calculations . \n the parabolic dispersion underestimates the gap between surface state band and band edge . \n we have therefore used the _ ab - initio _ \n dispersions for our lifetime calculations . \n as previously noted @xcite there are important changes in the shape of the surface state wave function with @xmath25 , the surface wave vector , and we take these into account by recalculating the wave function for different @xmath25 with the pseudopotential parameters changed to take into account the appropriate _ ab - initio _ band edges and surface state energy . \n we focus on the energy range between @xmath26 and @xmath27  ev above the fermi level where the surface state is energetically separated from the bulk states and thus is well defined . \n this energy range is of interest as according to ref . \n @xcite there is a cross - over in the primary decay channel from intraband to interband dominated decay . \n our calculated results for the total damping rate @xmath28 are shown in fig . \n [ fig : damp ] as a solid line .    for energies below @xmath29 \n ev we find that our results for the inelastic _ e - e _ damping rate of excitations in the shockley state band agree well with the inverse lifetime estimation from echenique _ \n ( dashed line ) @xcite using similar methods but with an effective mass approximation . \n this agreement is due to the fact that the effective mass approximation gives a very good description of the projected _ ab - inito _ surface band structure for energies with @xmath30  ev as evident from fig . \n [ fig : disp ] .    for larger energies \n we find that the _ e - e _ damping rate as a function of energy increases more rapidly with the _ ab - initio _ dispersion than calculated with parabolic dispersions . \n this result can be understood as follows : for energies @xmath31  ev the parabolic dispersions underestimate the energy gap between surface state band and the bulk band edge . \n consequently , the _ ab - initio _ dispersions reveal a reduced penetration of the surface state wave function into the interior of the crystal and an increased probability amplitude in the proximity of the metal surface . \n this modification leads to two competing effects . \n since screening is reduced at the surface @xcite intraband decay becomes more efficient . \n on the other hand , interband decay becomes less probable owing to the reduced overlap with bulk states . \n it turns out that the increase of intraband decay outweighs the decrease in interband transitions . the net result is a more steep increase of @xmath0 than obtained from parabolic dispersions . \n we thus find the intraband contribution to dominate up to @xmath32  ev where the interband and intraband contributions become similar in magnitude . \n comparing to published experimental data ( symbols in fig . \n [ fig : damp ] ) the agreement is improved .    in summary , we have presented a theoretical many -

{"ContextTokens": 3062, "GeneratedTokens": 101, "SynthesizedBody": "although a homogeneous neutron matter is one of the simplest nuclear systems , its importance can not be overemphasized since it constitutes the main component of neutron stars . \n the density of the neutron matter forming neutron stars ranges from subnuclear densities ( in the inner crust ) up to extremely high values of @xmath4 ( expected in the center of the star ) , where @xmath5 is the saturation density@xcite .    in the regime of sufficiently low densities \n one can perform very precise calculations since the neutron - neutron interaction is completely dominated by the scattering in @xmath6 channel , which is determined by two parameters only : the scattering length @xmath7 and the effective range @xmath8 . \n indeed , at the densities @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the influence of other channels as well as of three - body forces is marginal and can be neglected@xcite . \n the values of the scattering length and the effective range are well known from the low energy scattering experiments and read : @xmath11 , @xmath12@xcite . at the densities where @xmath13 the dilute neutron matter is an example of a strongly correlated system . moreover , \n the influence of the effective range can not be ignored except for very low densities where @xmath14@xcite . \n it implies that only non - perturbative approaches are able to gain a reliable insight into physics of this system . the large class of such methods , which are known under the general name of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , has been applied for the dilute neutron matter@xcite . in spite of a considerable theoretical effort some of its static properties \n are still vaguely known . \n the open questions mostly concern the superfluid state , which is generated at sufficiently low temperatures . \n for example the predicted value of the zero temperature energy gap differs significantly for various approaches , revealing a strong dependence on the details of the applied method ( see@xcite and references therein ) . \n the same concerns the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal phase transition , where the well known bcs formula @xmath15 is believed to be valid .    here \n we present the selected results concerning the superfluid state , obtained within the afqmc approach at non - zero temperatures@xcite for the dilute neutron matter of density @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . \n this study can be regarded as a continuation of the investigations presented in the papers @xcite , where the details of the afqmc algorithm and the procedure of adjusting the interaction , have been discussed . in the present study we focused on two basic quantities which characterize a superfluid state : the critical temperature and the pairing gap . \n in the case of superfluidity the convenient order parameter is specified by the long - distance behavior of the two - body density matrix @xmath18 where the field operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 obey the fermionic anticommutation relations . \n such a long - distance behavior is directly related to the condensate fraction @xmath21 , which measure the fraction of cooper pairs forming a condensate@xcite . \n this quantity can be efficiently computed within afqmc , provided the information concerning the one - body density matrix @xmath22 is also included . \n the condensate fraction is given by:@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the number of particles and the correlation functions @xmath25 are defined as : @xmath26     as a function of temperature ( in units of fermi energy @xmath27 ) for three lattice sizes @xmath28 . \n the inset presents the rescaled condensate fraction obtained for lattices @xmath29 ( squares ) and @xmath30 ( circles ) . \n the intersection of the fitted lines determines the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal phase transition , @xmath31 . ] \n the figure [ fig : nm_alpha ] presents the condensate fraction versus the temperature for three different lattice sizes @xmath28 . \n it is clearly visible that the results for @xmath32 significantly deviate from those obtained for larger lattices . \n it is due to the fact that for small lattices the limiting value of @xmath33 is rather poorly determined . indeed , \n the infinity  in this case is equal to the half of the box size and is only a few times larger than the interaction range . \n consequently , it will generate a large systematic error when the lattice is too small . \n the presented results indicate that this is exactly the case for @xmath32 and therefore these data were not included in the process of determination of the critical temperature .    in the thermodynamic limit \n the condensate fraction has to vanish at the critical temperature @xmath2 . \n however , in the case of calculations in the box the finite size effects come into play and smooth out all singularities typical for the phase transition . \n still , one can estimate the critical temperature using the method based on the finite size scaling . \n similar technique has been used to determine the critical temperature for cold atomic gases ( see@xcite for details ) . \n the volume - dependent estimation of the critical temperature @xmath34 is obtained by finding the intersection of the rescaled condensate fraction @xmath35 for two different lattice sizes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the universal critical exponent and @xmath38 is the volume of the box . as @xmath39 \n the thermodynamic limit is recovered and the series @xmath34 converges to the critical temperature . to extract @xmath2 \n we have used two largest of the available lattices , namely @xmath40 . \n the filling factor in both cases reads : @xmath41 . according to our experience , \n the above methodology is sufficient to estimate the critical temperature with an uncertainty smaller than @xmath42 ( in fact this procedure applied to the unitary gas provides the value of @xmath2 with the relative error smaller than @xmath43 ) . \n finally , the estimated value of the critical temperature reads @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , where @xmath27 is the fermi energy ( see the inset of fig . [ \n fig : nm_alpha ] ) . \n in order to determine the gap in the single particle spectrum , we have computed the spectral weight function @xmath46 . this quantity has been extracted from the imaginary time propagator @xmath47 through the analytic continuation@xcite . \n the procedure is equivalent to solving the integral equation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the inverse of the temperature and @xmath50 is determined from the monte carlo calculations for the discrete set of values @xmath51 . \n numerically , however , the above integral equation represents an ill - posed problem i.e. there is an infinite class of solutions for @xmath46 which satisfy eq . \n ( [ eqn : ap ] ) within uncertainties generated by monte carlo method . \n therefore we have used two methods which were in particular designed to deal with such tasks : the truncated svd method and the maximum entropy method@xcite . \n for the dilute neutron matter at selected temperatures : a )  @xmath52 , b )  @xmath53 , c )  @xmath54 , d )  @xmath55 . \n the nonzero energy gap is present up to the critical temperature @xmath31 . ] \n the spectral functions for selected temperatures ( below and above @xmath2 ) are presented in fig . \n [ fig : nm_spectral ] . \n our results admit the gapped solutions up to the critical temperature and above @xmath2 the gap vanishes . \n one has to remember , however , that there is a finite resolution of both methods concerning the value of the gap . \n namely , the gap can not be resolved if its value decreases below @xmath56 . \n the value of the energy gap @xmath57 extracted from the spectral function at the temperature @xmath58 is expected to provide a good approximation of its value at zero temperature . \n it reads : @xmath59 .    . \n ]    in fig . \n [ fig : gap_comparison ] our results are compared to those obtained by other authors within _ \n ab  initio _ \n calculations for zero temperature . \n we have found our results in agreement with the recent green function monte carlo calculations of gezerlis and carlson@xcite . \n the calculations including other scattering channels together with the three body forces were performed by gandolfi _ \n et al.,_@xcite and predict larger paring gap . however , it is difficult to establish the source of this discrepancy since their method ( auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ) has been constrained in order to avoid the fermionic sign problem and therefore can be regarded as a variational approach \n .    an interesting result can be noticed by considering the ratio of the energy gap at zero temperature to the critical temperature . \n namely , the ratio @xmath60 exceeds almost twice the well - known bcs value @xmath61 . \n a similar situation has been encountered for the unitary gas , where the existence of the exotic `` pseudogap '' phase above @xmath2 was recently reported@xcite . \n it indicates that the dilute neutron matter at this density is not a bcs - type superfluid . \n we have performed the fully non - perturbative calculations for the dilute neutron matter of density @xmath62 at finite temperatures . \n we focused on the basic quantities which characterize the superfluid state and extracted the value of the critical temperature and the pairing gap . \n our results are free from uncontrolled approximations and are essentially exact with only uncertainties related to statistical errors and finite size effects . \n the large value of @xmath60 suggests that the dilute neutron gas can not be described by the bcs theory and thus is not a bcs superfluid at low temperatures . \n support from the polish ministry of science under contracts no . \n n n202 328234 , n n202 128439 and by the unedf scidac collaboration under doe grant de - fc02 - 07er41457 is gratefully acknowledged . \n calculations reported here have been performed at the interdisciplinary centre for mathematical and computational modelling ( icm ) at warsaw university . \n muller , s.e . \n koonin , r.  seki and u.  vankolck , _ phys . \n rev . _  * c61 * , 044320 ( 2000 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 1803, "GeneratedTokens": 458, "SynthesizedBody": "the planck telescope is designed as an off - axis tilted system offering the advantage of an unblocked aperture . \n the baseline configuration has been selected among thirty different optical designs . \n the current configuration has been obtained by optimizing the telescope performance for a set of equally distributed in frequency ( from 30 to 857 ghz ) and space ( within the focal plane box ) representative feed horns . \n both mirrors have an ellipsoidal shape ( aplanatic configuration ) . \n the conical constants , the focal lenght , the tilting , and the decenter of the mirrors have been combined to reduce the main beam aberrations , the curvature of the focal surface , and the spillover as well . \n the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) is one of the two instruments onboard the planck satellite @xcite that shares the focal region of the telescope . \n it is an array of 54 hemt - based pseudo - correlation receivers coupled to the telescope by 27 dual profiled corrugated feed horns . \n the baseline layout of the lfi focal plane unit ( fpu ) foresees the 27 feed horns located around the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) : 16 feed horns at 100 ghz , 6 at 70 ghz , 3 at 44 ghz and 2 at 30 ghz . \n the lfi team has carried out an exhaustive study of the lfi optical interface devoted to optimize the angular resolution ( 12 arcmin at 100 ghz as a requirement , 10 arcmin at 100 ghz as a goal ) and at the same time to minimize all the systematics coming from the side lobes of the radiation pattern . \n different techniques can be applied to predict the radiation pattern : geometrical optics ( go ) , geometrical theory of diffraction ( gtd ) , physical optics ( po ) and physical theory of diffraction ( ptd ) . \n the simulations have been performed considering each feed ( gaussian , x axis polarized @xcite ) as a source and computing the pattern scattered by both reflectors on the far field . \n the go / gtd methods have been used to model the sub reflector , while the main reflector has been modelized using the po .      the angular resolution ( expressed here in term of full width half maximum , fwhm ) of the beam on the sky depends on the illumination of the primary mirror . \n the illumination can be represented by the edge taper , defined as the ratio of the power per unit area incident on the centre of the mirror to that incident on the edge . \n decreasing the edge taper has a positive impact on the angular resolution but lower is the edge taper and higher is the side lobes level since they are largely due by diffraction and scattering from the reflector edges . \n the trade - off between the angular resolution ( which impacts the ability to reconstruct the anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation at high multipoles @xcite ) and the edge taper ( which impacts the systematics of the detected signal from receivers @xcite ) has been carried out for some lfi feed horns @xcite . \n the dependence of the angular resolution improvement on the edge taper degradation is almost linear until a certain edge taper is reached , when increasing the illumination on the primary mirror does nt involve a further angular resolution betterment . \n the latter because a strong illumination of the mirrors increases the aberrations on the main beam . obviously , the amount of the improvement depends on the feed horn location , since the primary mirror is illuminated in a different way . \n the amplitude field incident on the main reflector has been computed for each lfi feed horn . \n the model of the feed we used is a x axis polarized gaussian horn with an edge taper of 30 db at 22@xmath0 of angle @xcite . \n the x axis ( y axis ) of the contour plot lies on the symmetry ( asymmetry ) plane of the telescope . \n the + z direction corresponds to the main beam peak direction and the ( x , y , z ) is a standard cartesian frame . as a conseguence , \n the top edge of the main reflector is at x @xmath1 750 mm and y@xmath1 0 mm on the contour plot coordinate system . \n we used the geometrical optics ( go ) and the geometrical theory of diffraction ( gtd ) on the sub reflector to calculate the total amplitude of the field incident on the surface of the primary mirror , in the reference system of the main beam . \n the contour plots show that , as expected , the illumination of the primary mirror is roughly elliptical . as a consequence \n the field amplitude on the primary mirror rim is not constant ( see figure [ fig : inc ] , left panel ) . \n the amplitudes of the field on the main reflector contour have been used to set the requirements on the edge taper values for all the lfi feed horn illuminations . \n the field amplitude on the mirror contour is a function of the @xmath2 angle ( @xmath3 ) , defined in the reference system of the main beam ( @xmath4 in the direction of the top edge of the main reflector and has a counterclockwise direction ) . \n the edge taper of each feed , at a reference angle ( 22@xmath0 or 24@xmath0 ) , has been chosen comparing the field amplitute , @xmath5 , with that corresponding to a _ \n worst reference _ case , @xmath6 , for which a full straylight analysis has been performed , showing acceptable contamination levels from the galactic emission @xcite . \n the edge taper correction of each feed horn , in order to assure a straylight rejection analogous to the reference case , was calculated by computing the lowest difference between the edge taper curve of each feed and the reference edge taper curve ( @xmath7 ) . \n we decrease by this difference the horn s edge taper at the reference angle and the results are reported in table [ tab : beams ] . in this way , for each lfi feed horn , no single point on the main reflector rim has an edge taper value lower than that of the reference case @xcite . \n polarization properties of the beams are mainly determined by the feed position and orientation in the focal plane unit . \n the lfi polarization properties have been optimized rotating each feed horn about its axis , in order to obtain the right orientation of the polarization direction of each beam . \n the polarized radiation in the far field is fully described by giving the projection of the electric field vector in two mutually orthogonal directions . \n far field amplitude radiation patterns reported here are given in the co and cross polar basis according to the ludwig s 3rd definition . \n the reference system in which each beam is computed has been rotated about their z axis in order to find out the main polarization direction on the sky . \n when this condition is reached , a well defined minimum appears in the crosspolar component , in corrispondence to the maximum of the copolar component ( see figure [ fig : inc ] ) .    6 , tech . rep . \n sci -

{"ContextTokens": 2802, "GeneratedTokens": 105, "SynthesizedBody": "lattice qcd has always been plagued by the fact that towards realistic quark masses the simulation costs increase drastically due to the large correlation lengths of the light states and the large lattice volumes that one employs in order to avoid finite - size ( fs ) effects . \n this difficulty has , in fact , prevented us until this day from carrying out simulations with truly physical parameters . \n instead one resorts to computations with several un - physically large quark masses in fs - effect - free volumes , followed by an extrapolation to the physical quark mass . \n however , the chiral extrapolation introduces uncertainties that can be reduced only by increasing the overlap of lattice simulations with chpt . \n it is thus inevitable to look out for feasible ways to obtain lattice results at light quark masses . \n current approaches like overlap , domain - wall or improved staggered fermions are still very costly , especially if one goes beyond the quenched approximation . \n faced with limited computer resources we therefore investigate the feasibility of an approach that restricts itself to the use of standard wilson fermions . \n the aim of the _ gral _ project is to carry out a systematic study of fs effects in the light hadron spectrum in the parameter regime accessible to us . with simulations on series of small to medium - sized lattice volumes ( at fixed coupling and quark mass , respectively ) we also want to address the issue of whether one can use formulae obtained from this investigation to extrapolate hadronic observables to the infinite volume . \n in 1983 m.  lscher published a universal field theoretic formula for the shift in the mass of a stable particle enclosed in a finite box  @xcite . \n the formula states for asymptotically large volumes that the fs mass - shift vanishes exponentially with increasing box size at a rate that depends on the particle considered and on the spectrum of light particles in the theory . \n if , in qcd , we consider a stable hadron in a box of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions and sufficiently large ( euclidian ) time - extent @xmath1 , its mass @xmath2 becomes a universal function of @xmath3 ( where , at fixed @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) in the finite - volume continuum limit . since fs effects probe the system at large distances and are thus insensitive to the form and magnitude of the uv cutoff , this function is expected to hold also for finite lattice spacings . with the ( constant ) lo chiral expression for the @xmath6-@xmath6 forward scattering amplitude the relative mass - shift for the pion \n is given by @xmath7    if we assume , for simplicity , the pion - nucleon forward scattering amplitude to be constant , too , then the formula for the nucleon involves a term that is  up to low -

{"ContextTokens": 2382, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has been the first practical realization of communication based on the laws of the quantum mechanics . as bennett and \n brassard showed with their pioneer protocol bb84 \n @xcite , nonorthogonal quantum states , together with an unjammable classical channel , can be used to prevent an eavesdropper ( eve ) from gaining information on the key without being revealed . \n there are already different working realizations of bb84  @xcite . \n some of them  @xcite exploit entanglement in polarization to encode a random string of bits in two unbiased polarization bases of a single photon , thus following the original proposal . however , polarization is not the most suitable degree of freedom for fiber communication because birefringence usually fluctuates randomly in a fiber , making the encoded information impossible to decode . \n the most appealing setup for real telecom communications is based on the phase degree of freedom .    as an example we consider the setup shown in the upper part of fig.[bb84 ] , that has been used for a qkd up to 30 km  @xcite . in this arrangement a relative phase @xmath0 between two time - bins of a photon state is realized by the sender ( alice ) with an unbalanced interferometer and a phase modulator . \n the receiver ( bob ) measures incoming bins by means of a second interferometer , matched to the sender s one , set to @xmath1 . with a probability of 50% the phase difference between alice and \n bob s interferometers will be @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and their measures will be correlated ; in the other half of cases measures will be discarded by the two users . \n schematics of two interferometers for bb84 . \n the upper one , in blue , has been used for qkd up to 30 km ; the lower one , in red , is the plug - and - play setup used for qkd up to 67 km . ] \n another realization of phase encoded qkd , namely the  plug - and - play \" setup  @xcite , is reported in the lower part of fig.[bb84 ] , and it has been used for qkd up to a distance of 67 km  @xcite . using an intense pulse , \n bob populates two time - bins with relative phase @xmath4 , and sends them to alice . \n alice applies a relative phase @xmath0 , reflects the pulses on a faraday mirror , let them pass through an attenuator , and sends them back to bob . \n the two pulses retrace in their backward path all the fluctuations they suffered in the forward path , thus arriving at bob s interferometer ready for being interferometrically revealed . as in the previous scheme bob sets at random @xmath1 , and \n measures the outcomes , completing the _ \n qkd run pertaining to bb84 . \n this mechanism of automatic compensation of noise earned this setup the name of  plug - and - play \" . \n recently bostrm and felbinger  @xcite presented a variant for qkd , and named it  ping - pong \" cryptography ( pp ) for its peculiarity of a forward and backward use of the quantum channel . \n this peculiarity seems to suit perfectly with the forward and backward dynamics typical of plug - and - play setups , as the one described above , and this motivated the present work . \n the main advantage of pp is the deterministic nature of its _ encoding - decoding _ procedure ; its main flow is that it has been proved to be not completely secure  @xcite . \n a number of variants , still based on the polarization degree of freedom of a photon , have been proposed to solve this problem , some making use of entanglement  @xcite , and others making no use of it  @xcite . \n we envisage here a protocol with phase - encoded information to have a secure , completely deterministic , quantum communication . \n a few variants and applications of the protocol are also discussed . \n the receiving user , bob , prepares a photon in a superposition of two time - bins with a relative phase @xmath5 randomly chosen between the values @xmath6 . \n he sends the photon to alice , the transmitting user , who chooses one of two possible tasks , _ control mode _ ( cm ) or _ message mode _ ( mm ) , with probability @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ; the former realizes a control on the security of the channel , the latter the deterministic communication between the users . \n alice encodes a bit of information with an unitary operation on the two time - bins : she can either apply the identity operation , choosing @xmath9 and encoding a ` 0 ' , or introduce a ` phase - flip ' , by applying a phase @xmath10 between the time - bins and encoding a ` 1 ' . \n the photon is sent back to bob who measures it with his apparatus set with the same phase @xmath5 he prepared initially . \n in this way bob s measurement is _ deterministic _ , because the initial phase of the state ( that he does know ) is changed by an amount of 0 or @xmath3 ; he can thus guess alice s operation without any needs of a classical channel . \n alice detects the photon with her interferometer randomly set to @xmath9 or @xmath11 . \n after that alice prepares a _ new photon state _ with a phase @xmath12 , and sends it back to bob who , analogously to what he did in mm , measures it with the same phase @xmath5 he prepared initially . \n we notice that if phase difference between bob s interferometer and alice s one is @xmath2 or @xmath3 then the two users share correlated information , while in the other two cases they do not . \n it is straightforward to realize that alice procedure in preparing the new photon let the two users interferometers to be necessarily correlated either in the forward path or in the backward one . \n this entails that the cm of our protocol results as deterministic as the mm is , thus achieving that doubling of the whole rate transmission we mentioned before . \n none of the qubits , neither destined to mm nor to cm , is discarded . \n given un unjammable public channel two users can exchange information in a secure manner by means of the above protocol . \n eve can try to gain information by inquiring the phase of the photon both on the forward and in the backward path ; alternatively , she can prevent bob from gaining information ( dos attack  @xcite ) by randomly measuring the state of the traveling photon ; finally , on a lossy channel , she can conceal her presence behind losses  @xcite . \n nevertheless no attack can remain undetected by the control procedure since it is akin to a bb84 check test , performed either on the forward path or on the backward one . \n this guarantees the protocol is unconditionally secure , as bb84 is , even if the security threshold may be different . \n our protocol gives a probability of 25% to detect dos attack as well as a general attack providing eve with full information . \n the practical implementation requires to gather the two interferometers of fig.[bb84 ] . \n the resulting scheme is shown in fig.[pppp84 ] : the upper interferometer is devoted to cm , the lower to mm , and they are connected by a 1x2 fiber - coupler . \n the signal prepared by bob goes at random into cm or into mm with probability @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . \n later on , when the photon is on the backward path , this device redirects it to bob .     final setup for deterministic plug - and - play cryptography . \n it merges the two interferometers of fig.1 , reported in blue ( cm ) and red ( mm ) . the black represents the common elements between the two , while the green indicates new components . \n an automatic switch between mm and cm is performed by a 1x2 coupler . ] \n the mm - interferometer resembles the one used for testing bb84 up to 67 km  @xcite . \n it is a typical plug - and - play scheme , with the unique difference that the attenuator is inserted just after the laser - diode ( ld ) , at bob s side . \n a laser pulse with a mean photon number much lower than unity goes through bob s interferometer and comes out into two time - bins with a relative phase @xmath5 and opposite polarizations . in the plug - and - play setup \n an intense pulse is sent to alice to provide a trigger signal for alice s electronics . in our case , as the pulse is already attenuated at bob s side , a further synchronization system , such as usually used in other practical qkd setup  @xcite , is necessary . \n after reflection on the faraday mirror , the photon travels back to bob , retracing exactly those paths that let him compensate any undesired phase : this makes unnecessary the stabilization of the polarization . eventually , raileigh backscattering is not a problem in this case because of the low value of the average photon number from the beginning of the protocol . \n the cm - interferometer resembles the one used for bb84 qkd up to a distance of 30 km  @xcite . as a time - polarization division technique \n is implemented , this task is sensible to random phase changes , and needs adjustments during the protocol runs . \n a value of @xmath13   rad / min for slow thermal drift in the interferometer was estimated , thus requiring a compensation step every @xmath14  @xcite . \n also in this case alice must synchronize her electronics with detectors , phase - modulator , and laser - diode using a suitable synchronization system . \n we proposed a setup that fully exploits the potentialities of the two - way unbalanced interferometers of certain implementations of bb84 to merge the features of plug - and - play setup for bb84 and ping - pong cryptography . \n the scheme is completely deterministic , both in the encoding - decoding procedure and in the control one , thus achieving a doubling in the rate of information transmission . \n it seems to be quite practical to implement since it is based on existing working implementations .    besides , due to its deterministic nature , several other advantages are available . \n bases revelation on the public channel is avoided , and this feature , together with a slightly different alice s preparation procedure during the cm , leads to a qkd more secure than that achieved by means of bb84  @xcite . \n furthermore a ` quantum direct communication ' ( qdc ) between users is also possible  @xcite . \n finally , we notice that once qdc is available also the novel protocol called ` quantum dialogue '  @xcite can be achieved : if alice delivered a message to bob by means of a secure qdc , then bob can use the message just received as the key of encryption of his answer , and simply communicate it to alice on the public channel .                    g. l. long and x. s. liu , phys . \n a * 65 * , 032302 ( 2002 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 2743, "GeneratedTokens": 72, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum states encoded in optical fields are an obvious way to implement quantum communication protocols @xcite . \n the optical approach offers also a route towards scalable quantum computing , with the particularly promising linear - optics scheme of knill , laflamme , and milburn @xcite . \n optical fields are distinguished from standard qubit models of quantum information processing in two ways . \n first , photons are bosons that can occupy field modes in arbitrary numbers . \n although a qubit can be implemented as a superposition of a single photon in two orthogonal modes , the entire hilbert space describing optical fields has plenty of room to go beyond this standard , dual - rail representation . \n secondly , most important error mechanisms that affect optical fields have a specific form . \n this enables one to optimize strategies for shielding quantum information from their deleterious effects . \n the above features can be illustrated with the example of photon loss , also referred to in literature as amplitude damping . \n such a mechanism can be modeled as a transmission of optical fields through a partly reflecting beam splitter . \n this attenuates the transmitted field , leading to a random removal of photons from the initial state . \n the effects of photon loss can be dealt with by adopting the strategy of quantum error correction @xcite , which consists in designing so - called code subspaces in which qubits are protected from dominant errors . \n such codes can be constructed from states that contain more than one photon per mode @xcite , which makes them more efficient in terms of required numbers of photons and modes .    a natural method to manipulate optical codes \n is to use linear optics networks @xcite . in the simplest scenario , \n such networks are passive , i.e.  they do not involve auxiliary photons , conditional detection , or feed - forward operations . in this contribution \n we review the recent proof @xcite that even the simplest codes , which correct for just a single photon loss , can not be universally processed using passive linear optics only . \n as we will see below , the same properties that make the codes correctable for photon loss , also prohibit a range of linear - optics manipulations . \n logical qubits can be protected from the effects of errors by preparing more complex states of physical systems @xcite . \n such states span the so - called code subspace , within which an arbitrary quantum superposition remains preserved despite the occurrence of an error from a certain class . in the most elementary case , \n the subspace is spanned by two orthogonal states which we shall denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n the specific scenario we shall consider here is shielding logical qubits carried by optical fields from amplitude damping by encoding them in suitable multiphoton states . \n let us restrict our attention to errors induced by the loss at most one photon from the field . \n if we make two assumptions :    * the code is constructed in a subspace with a fixed total photon number , * the damping parameter is identical for all the modes involved ,    then the necessary and sufficient conditions for a code constructed in a system of bosonic modes to be robust against one - photon loss are given by @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the field modes , and the indices @xmath5 run over all of @xmath6 bosonic modes . \n the action of an operator @xmath7 on the code states can be interpreted as an event when a third party has observed in the leaked portion of the field one photon in the @xmath8th mode . \n the third party belongs to the external environment , and her actions , as well as the outcome of her measurement are of course unknown to the owner of the qubit . \n the equation @xmath9 implies a simple constraint : it must not be possible to pass between two orthogonal code states by moving just one photon between the modes , i.e.  annihilating it from the mode @xmath7 and creating one in the mode @xmath3 . starting from this observation , it is easy to construct two elementary examples of photon - loss codes using four photons distributed between two modes @xcite : @xmath10 are mutually orthogonal and have identical norms . \n a code subspace can be conveniently characterized with the help of the corresponding projection operator @xmath11 , which in our two - dimensional case takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a certain @xmath14 matrix . \n this matrix is hermitian , which is easily proven by considering the hermitian conjugation of eq . \n ( [ eq : correctpc ] ) . \n a general passive linear optics transformation of a system of @xmath6 modes can be written as : @xmath15 where the operators @xmath3 describe the input representation , the operators @xmath16 refer to the output representation , and @xmath17 is a unitary @xmath14 matrix . \n the unitarity of the matrix @xmath18 guarantees the preservation of commutation relations for the field operators . \n any linear - optics transformation can be reversed , therefore the labels of input and output representations are purely conventional . \n let us now write the correctability condition given in eq . \n ( [ eq : correctpc ] ) in the representation of the output modes @xmath19 . \n a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote respectively the transposition and the complex conjugation of the matrix @xmath18 . \n this means that after the application of the network @xmath18 the subspace @xmath11 remains a photon - loss code , and that the only change is the transformation of the matrix @xmath23 on the right hand side of the correctability condition . \n this property reflects the fact that in our error model the correctability condition is independent of the specific modal decomposition . \n indeed , the third party monitoring the leaked field can decompose it in an arbitrary basis of modes and measure them individually for the presence of a photon . because the damping coefficients are assumed to be identical for all the modes , such a procedure performed on the leaked field \n does not alter the error model . \n the fact that the photon - loss code is preserved by passive linear - optics transformations has important implications for encoding and decoding . \n suppose that we start from a qubit in the standard , dual - rail representation , with the aim of mapping it onto the encoded subspace . a simple way to accomplish this would be to combine it with auxiliary modes prepared in a certain state and apply a passive linear optics transformation . \n however , the reversed version of the argument presented above implies that if the output is a photon - loss code , then the input needs to be such a code as well . \n this means that the input qubit itself is protected against photon loss , which obviously is not the case for the dual - rail representation . \n the same applies to decoding : if we know a priori that no photon loss occurred , we can not convert the encoded qubit back into the dual - rail representation using a passive network . \n therefore , there can not exist a passive network that would work more universally for the input affected by errors and provide a decoded qubit with the error syndrome contained in the state of auxiliary modes . \n we will now consider single - qubit gates operating on the encoded qubit that can be implemented with passive networks . \n thus we are looking for networks that do not mix the code subspace @xmath11 with the remaining complement of the hilbert space . \n let us consider a linear - optics transformation of the annihilation operators given by eq . \n ( [ eq : linopttransf ] ) . \n the transformation of the modes induces a certain unitary operator @xmath24 in the hilbert space of the multimode bosonic system . \n the condition that the operator @xmath24 does not take us beyond the code subspace can be written as : @xmath25 the set of all networks that preserve the code subspace forms a group . \n let us now suppose that this group is continuous . \n this means that we can find a one - parameter subgroup composed of elements @xmath26 parameterized with a real parameter @xmath27 according to : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an @xmath14 hermitian matrix . \n mathematically , @xmath30 is an element of the lie algebra associated with the lie group of unitary @xmath14 matrices . \n the unitary operator @xmath31 can then be written as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the representation of the matrix @xmath30 for the multimode bosonic system . \n it is given by a bilinear combination of the creation and annihilation operators @xcite : @xmath34 the correctness of this expression can be verified by considering operators @xmath35 and writing differential equations for @xmath36 , whose solution recovers eq . \n ( [ eq : linopttransf ] ) with the transformation matrix given by eq . \n ( [ eq : gammas = exp - slambda ] ) . \n let us now consider an infinitesimal transformation of the form @xmath37 . \n the second term , given explicitly in eq . \n ( [ eq : rlambda ] ) , comprises a sum of expressions of the form @xmath38 that appear also in the correctability condition given in eq . \n ( [ eq : correctpc ] ) . \n it is easy to see that : @xmath39 where we introduced a real coefficient @xmath40 . inserting this result to eq . \n ( [ eq : prgammap = rgammap ] ) yields : @xmath41 this means that for general , not necessarily infinitesimal , operators @xmath31 we have @xmath42 . \n therefore the operator @xmath31 restricted to the code subspace generates only an irrelevant , uniform phase factor . \n consequently , there does not exist a continuous group of linear transformations that would produce non - trivial gates on the encoded qubit . \n we demonstrated in the preceding section that groups of transformations which can be implemented on photon - loss codes using passive networks must be discrete . for two examples of codes presented in section  [ sec : photonlosscodes ] \n these groups can be found analytically . in the case of the four - photon code defined in eq . \n ( [ eq : fourphoton ] ) , one can use the parameterization of special unitary @xmath43 matrices in terms of euler angles to show easily that all gates preserving the code subspace are generated by two transformations given , up to overall phase factors , by : @xmath44 the above transformations are realized respectively by a balanced beam splitter and a @xmath45 phase shift . in order to gain an insight into the structure of the set of gates , it is helpful to consider transformations of the state @xmath46 . \n the application of @xmath47 and @xmath48 generates two other states given , up to phase factors , by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which together form an equilateral triangle in the bloch sphere of the encoded qubit , shown in figure  1(a ) . \n gates that can be implemented with passive linear optics form the rotation group of this triangle . \n a more lengthy , but still elementary reasoning @xcite shows that for the three - photon code defined in eq . \n ( [ eq : threephoton ] ) the transformations preserving the code subspace are obtained from two generators : @xmath51 which correspond respectively to a tritter @xcite and a @xmath52 phase shift on one of the modes . \n starting from the initial state @xmath53 , these transformations generate a regular tetrahedron in the bloch sphere of the encoded qubit , with vertices corresponding to the states @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , shown in figure  1(b ) . as before , \n passive networks realize the rotation group of this solid .    ) and ( b ) the three photon code defined in eq . \n ( [ eq : threephoton ] ) . \n the points represent states that can be produced from the logic state @xmath1 using passive networks , and dashed lines depict rotations that are generated by unitary transformations defined respectively in eqs . \n ( [ eq:4phtr ] ) and ( [ eq:3phtr ] ) . ] \n we have shown that restrictions on manipulating photon - loss codes with linear optics are intimately linked to the correctability condition itself . \n the invariance of the correctability condition with respect to unitary transformations realized by passive networks prohibits their use for encoding and decoding . \n furthermore , passive linear - optics networks are obtained from infinitesimal generators of the form @xmath56 that either move one photon between modes , or introduce linear phase shifts . however , in the code subspace these expressions need to reduce to @xmath57-numbers to ensure correctability , which severely limits available manipulations on encoded qubits . \n this work has been supported by the european commission under the integrated project qubit applications ( qap ) funded by the ist directorate as contract number 015848 , polish mnisw grant 1  p03b  011  29 and afosr under grant number fa8655 -

{"ContextTokens": 3383, "GeneratedTokens": 227, "SynthesizedBody": "the elemental abundance in galaxies is an essential parameter for understanding how galaxies evolve , and provides important constraints on current models for their formation \n . it also constrains models for stellar evolution and for primordial nucleosynthesis .    the elemental abundance in spiral galaxies was first thought to depend essentially on local properties of the interstellar medium , such as the density of gas . \n recent studies have shown that it depends predominantly on global properties of the galaxies , such as mass or hubble type , but the situation is still rather confused . \n garnett & shields ( 1987 ) find evidence for a correlation between mean metal abundance and total luminosity . \n oey & kennicutt ( 1993 ) find no such correlation for early - type ( sa to sb ) galaxies , but note that early - type galaxies have higher metal abundances than late - type ones . using a different sample of galaxies , zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra ( 1994 ; hereafter zkh ) confirm that the abundance is correlated with total luminosity ; they also state that stochastic events , such as starbursts and external accretion of matter , could only contribute to the scatter in the abundance values .    a first evidence that starbursts are in fact a driving mechanism in the chemical evolution of spiral galaxies has been presented by coziol ( 1996b ) . \n he finds that the starburst nucleus galaxies ( hereafter sbngs ) are less chemically evolved than galaxies with similar morphologies and comparable luminosities , and that the sbngs seem to follow the same luminosity \n metallicity linear relation as the irregular and elliptical galaxies .    in this _ letter _ \n , we use new spectroscopic data on a large sample of markarian sbngs ( contini 1996 ) to establish coziol s claim on firmer observational ground . in other words \n , we compare the global chemical characteristics of early- and late - type sbngs with those of normal giant galaxies , of hii galaxies , of irregular and elliptical galaxies . \n our sample of sbngs is composed of 62 markarian barred galaxies from the study of contini ( 1996 ) , of a sample of 40 compact kiso galaxies ( comte et al . \n 1994 ) and of a sample of 20 sbngs from the mbg survey ( coziol et al . \n 1994 , 1996 ) . \n the starburst nature of all these galaxies was established by the different authors in the original articles using standard diagnostic diagrams of emission line ratios ( baldwin et al . \n 1981 , hereafter bpt ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 , hereafter vo ) . \n the comparison samples were taken from the literature . \n we used the sample of normal spiral galaxies of zkh , to which we added the sample of early  type spirals observed by oey & kennicutt ( 1993 ) . \n the sample of irregular galaxies is from skillman et al . \n ( 1989 ) . as samples of hii galaxies ( see coziol 1996a , for a definition of the two main types of starburst galaxies ) , we used those of the caln - tololo survey ( pea et al . \n 1991 ) and those of the catalogue of terlevich et al . \n finally , we also included a sample of luminous arp interacting galaxies ( keel et al . \n 1985 ) . \n since we are using various sources for our samples of galaxies , we must verify the consistency of the derived abundances . \n those of the giant spiral galaxies are average values ; they were estimated by measuring the mean values , normalized to a mean radius , of the abundances of at least 10 disk hii regions . \n for the starburst galaxies , the measures were done with long slits centered on the nucleus ( sbngs ) or on the most luminous part of the galaxy ( hii galaxies ) . because the hii galaxies have small angular dimensions \n , the slit aperture usually covers the entire galaxy and the measured metallicities are therefore good estimates of their mean metallicities . in the case of the sbngs , which have higher angular dimensions than the hii galaxies , \n the abundances are mostly those of the nuclei . in normal spirals \n , the metallicities usually increase toward the center of the galaxies ( zkh ) ; preliminary results indicate that this is probably also true for the sbngs ( considre et al . in preparation ) . \n the abundances of the sbngs represent therefore upper limits of their mean metallicities . \n the metallicities ( [ o / h ] ) of the hii galaxies were estimated by determining the electron temperature using [ oiii]@xmath04363 . for the sbngs \n this line is usually not observed and we used the metallicity index r@xmath1 ( pagel et al . \n 1979 ) , or some comparable methods based on r@xmath1 . \n we verified that all these methods give similar results . \n one of the methods ( coziol et al . 1994 ) is based on the calibration of a diagnostic diagram using hii region samples where the electron temperature is determined using [ oiii]@xmath04363 and covering metallicities between -0.9 and 0.3 dex . \n the differences between the metallicities obtained by this method and the others are generally much lower than the typical uncertainty of 0.2 dex associated to each of these methods . \n the redshifts and the adopted morphologies for all the galaxies are as given in the original papers or were found in ned or in leda . \n for some galaxies , the b magnitudes were not given in the original papers and were found in ned . \n no internal extinction correction was applied . \n all the absolute magnitudes were determined or corrected for the value h@xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . \n table 1 gives the mean absolute magnitudes and metallicities for the different samples of galaxies . \n the early  type sbngs are poorer in metals on average by 0.2 dex with respect to the late  type sbngs and by nearly 0.3 dex with respect to the giant spirals . \n on the other hand , both types of sbngs share the same distribution in luminosities . \n this is a strong indication that the differences between the two types of sbngs are real , and not a selection effect . \n moreover , the low abundance can not be an artefact caused by the small aperture used in our spectroscopic setup , since this tends to raise , rather than lower , the measured abundance .    in figure 1 \n , we compare the behavior of the abundance with respect to morphology for the sbngs and the normal and hii galaxies . \n as expected , the normal galaxies show a morphology  metallicity trend : the metallicity increases from the late  type spirals to the early  type ones . \n this trend is not observed for the hii galaxies , which have lower mean abundances than normal galaxies ; this is not new and is related to the low luminosities and small masses of these galaxies . \n but our luminous sbngs do not follow the morphology  metallicity trend either . \n although chemically richer than the hii galaxies , the sbngs are nonetheless significantly deficient in metals as compared to normal galaxies . in figure 1 , this phenomenon is most evident for the early - type sbngs ( t @xmath4 ) . \n our results are based on the assumption that the main source of ionization of the gas in the sbngs is ob stars , like in normal hii regions . \n this is implicit in the definition of starbursts based on diagnostic diagrams of emission line ratios . \n but the spectra of the sbngs show one important difference with respect to those of disk hii regions : their ratios [ nii]/h@xmath5 are on average 0.2 dex higher \n ( coziol et al . 1996 ) . \n if this excess emission corresponds to a supplementary nonthermal ionizing source , like a hidden agn or shock  heated gas , such as embedded supernova remnants , this could indeed produce a false effect of lower metallicity .    to verify this hypothesis \n , we compare in figure 2 the ratios [ sii]/h@xmath5 with the ratios [ nii]/h@xmath5 . \n both ratios would increase in the presence of a nonthermal ionizing source . \n we find no relation between the ratios of these two lines . \n we also verified that there is no relation between [ sii]/h@xmath5 or [ nii]/h@xmath5 and the metallicity . in figure 2 , \n the dot  dashed line corresponds to the lower limit predicted by shock models ( see vo and ho et al . \n the values for the sbngs are well below this value . \n in fact , the majority of sbngs have [ sii]/h@xmath5 ratios within 0.2 dex of the mean ratios observed in normal hii regions ( greenawalt & walterbos 1996 ) . in figure 2 \n , we also see that very few sbngs have nitrogen emission above the lower limit proposed by ho et al . \n ( 1993 ) for transition galaxies ( that is galaxies with agn @xmath6 hii region spectra ) . \n vron et al . ( \n 1996 ) also found very few transition galaxies . \n the presence of a hidden agn in the sbngs is also ruled out because of the weakness of [ oi]@xmath06300 : only @xmath7 40% of our galaxies show this line and their ratios log([oi]/h@xmath5 ) @xmath8 are similar to those of normal hii regions ( bpt , vo ) . \n we conclude that there is nothing in the spectra of the sbngs to prevent us from applying normal hii region models to sbngs , and the low metallicity of the sbngs is therefore real .    a first assumption that comes to mind for explaining the low metal abundance in sbngs is massive accretion of unprocessed gas during gravitational interaction with another galaxy ( coziol 1996b ) , which would explain both the reduced elemental abundance and the starburst . \n but most sbngs are isolated ( contini 1996 ; coziol et al . 1996 ) and there is no evidence of lower abundances in the sample of luminous arp interacting galaxies . \n this suggests that the low \n metallicity is a characteristic of the sbngs , which depends on their particular history of formation .    in figure 3 , we show the diagram of metallicity as a function of luminosity for the galaxies of our samples . \n the solid line is the linear relation for the irregular and elliptical galaxies reported by zkh . \n it appears that the early  type sbngs scatter around this relation more closely than do the other galaxy types . to test this hypothesis , we calculated the differences between the abundances predicted by the linear relation and the observed abundances for each of the galaxies . \n the distributions of these differences are shown in figure 4 . \n the early - type sbngs have the same distribution as the irregulars , whereas the late  type sbngs show the same type of deviation as the giant spirals . the hypothesis that the distributions for the early and late  type sbngs come from the same parent population \n is rejected at a confidence level of 99% with a kolmogorov \n smirnov test . \n the deviation of the hii galaxies from the linear relation in figure 3 and 4 is a consequence of the starbursts , because their luminosity is more affected by starbursts than that of massive galaxies , and they are therefore more luminous than their metallicity suggests . \n our new data on sbngs allow us to confirm the phenomenon discovered by coziol ( 1996b ) : the sbngs are less chemically evolved than normal galaxies . \n this is inconsistent with the current hypothesis that sbngs are evolved galaxies which were rejuvenated by interactions . \n the difference between the early and late  type sbngs is also very meaningful , because , among the mechanisms considered by coziol ( 1996b ) for explaining the metal deficiency of sbngs , only one predicts such a difference . \n this is the model of hierarchical formation of galaxies ( tinsley & larson 1979 ) , according to which ellipticals and bulges of spiral galaxies are formed by a sequence of mergers of stellar and gaseous systems . therefore , bulge - dominated sbngs must follow the same luminosity \n metallicity relation as ellipticals . \n this implies that bulges of spirals are similar to elliptical galaxies , which is now supported by observations ( see jablonka et al . \n 1996 ) . \n if a sufficiently large fraction of gas is left from the initial merger , it will collapse to form a disk . struck  marcell ( 1981 ) showed that when the gas fraction of matter accreted increases , the successive generations of star have higher abundances than in the merger case . during galaxy formation \n , the metallicity of the gas will therefore increase faster in the disk  dominated sbngs than in the bulge  forming sbngs . \n it is very interesting to find that the disk  dominated sbngs share the same position in the luminosity  metallicity diagram as the giant spirals . indeed , \n following kennicutt ( 1983 ) , one explanation for the nearly constant star formation rates of the giant spiral galaxies over the last few gyrs is that they have accreted extra gas in their disk . \n we confirm coziol s ( 1996b ) claim that luminous sbngs are less chemically evolved than normal spiral galaxies . \n this is a strong indication that luminous sbngs are in fact galaxies still in the process of formation . \n we have also found a difference between the abundances of the early and late  type sbngs . \n this difference is consistent with the predictions of the model of hierarchical formation of galaxies . \n our results suggest that galaxy formation is a continuing process and that the starburst phenomenon is a normal phase in the formation of all galaxies . \n this scenario has some important implications for the observation of galaxies in formation at high redshifts . \n it predicts that the fraction of interacting and merging objects should be higher in the past ; at high redshifts the number of early  type galaxies should be lower and the grand \n design late \n type spirals should appear later . \n these predictions may already have been verified by observations ( kauffman et al . 1996 ; van den bergh et al . 1996 ) . \n r. coziol acknowledges the financial support of the fapesp under contract 94/3005 - 0 and of the cnpq , under contracts 360715/96 - 6 ( nv ) . \n this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , and of the lyon meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , supplied by the leda team at cral - observatoire de lyon ( france ) . \n we thank sylvain blaize for his contribution to this project . \n lccc giant spirals&53&20.28 @xmath9 1.43&0.03 @xmath9 0.05 sbng ( early ) & 76&19.68 @xmath9 1.28&0.25 @xmath9 0.04sbng ( late ) & 46&19.74 @xmath9 1.66&0.05 @xmath9 0.08 irregulars & 20&15.20 @xmath9 5.09&1.06 @xmath9 0.13 hii galaxies & 44&17.64 @xmath9 2.93&0.86 @xmath9 0.07", "StartTimeOffset": 1389458592330, "RequestID": "52225cd8f29f9650dd3fd93463899674e57a2031", "TotalTokens": 3610}

material for device applications@xcite . \n graphene can be accessed as a single sheet of carbon atoms , monolayer graphene(mlg ) or as two stacked sheets of carbon atoms , bilayer graphene(blg ) . \n both types of graphene are gapless semiconductors . \n mlg has a linear band structure and the charge carriers can have very high mobility exceeding 200,00 @xmath0/vs@xcite . \n this high mobility which greatly exceeds the values found in si opens the way to new type of electronic devices from mlg . \n however , these high values of mobility are only found in suspended samples implying that supported samples have sources of scattering which limits their mobility . \n blg , on the other hand , has a parabolic band structure and a quadratic energy dispersion . \n because of the reduced symmetry of the blg , applying an electric field perpendicular to the plane of blg opens a band gap . \n this band gap tunability makes blg a very promising material for digital electronics applications@xcite . \n the isolation of mlg and blg from graphite , the three dimensional form of carbon , gave rise to the field of graphene experiments and theory . \n the exfoliated sheets are then studied by depositing them on a silicon dioxide substrate . \n graphene can also be prepared by epitaxy on silicon carbide substrates@xcite , irridium@xcite and ruthenium@xcite as well as chemical vapor deposition growth on copper@xcite and nickel@xcite . \n every technique has its own advantages and disadvantages . \n epitaxial graphene needs to be delocalized enough from the substrate to be useful for nanoelectronic devices . \n however , these growth techniques tend to provide much larger samples than the exfoliation technique , up to wafer size in the case of silicon carbide which is useful for commercial applications . \n current growth techniques produce large samples which are not uniform in thickness and show reduced quality compared to exfoliated samples . \n exfoliated graphene has been shown to have intrinsic ripples and not be atomically flat @xcite . \n these ripples can influence the electronic properties by changing the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude . \n this variation in the hopping amplitude leads to a shift in the electrochemical potential and hence the dirac point @xcite . \n exfoliating graphene on silicon dioxide substrates leads to random charged impurities on the sheet due to impurities trapped between the oxide layer and graphene sheet . \n these impurities also influence the electrical properties of graphene and may be the source of the reduced mobility in supported samples . to examine the effect of ripples and charged impurities on exfoliated mlg and blg \n we have performed measurements using a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) . \n mechanical exfoliation of graphene , a seemingly simple but intricate technique @xcite was used to prepare our samples . \n graphene flakes were then transferred to the sio@xmath1 substrate . \n ti / au electrodes were deposited on the graphene using a shadow mask technique described elsewhere @xcite . \n the use of a shadow mask for the electrodes eliminates the need to use pmma as a resist which is a possible source of charged impurities . eliminating the pmma \n has also been seen to increase the cleanliness of the graphene devices . \n this is evidenced by atomic resolution topography of freshly prepared samples without the need for high temperature cleaning . \n the cleanliness is also seen in an improved mobility in samples fabricated with the shadow mask technique . \n the samples were transferred to the ultrahigh vacuum ( p @xmath2 mbar ) stm and cooled to 4.6 k. electrochemically etched tungsten tips were used for imaging and spectroscopy . \n these tips were checked on a au surface to ensure a constant density of states prior to measurements on graphene . \n figure 1(a ) shows the setup for scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on graphene flakes . \n the voltage is applied to the tip attached to the piezo tube and the sample is grounded . \n stm images show the hexagonal lattice characteristic of mlg @xcite and the triangular lattice for blg @xcite as shown in fig . \n 1(c ) and 1(b ) respectively . \n blg shows a triangular lattice because the two layers of carbon atoms reduce the symmetry of the graphene and therefore only one of the two sublattices is visible . \n we have recorded the local density of states for both mlg and blg with di / dv point spectroscopy measurements . here \n the tip is fixed at a definite position on the sample , the feedback loop is deactivated and the sample voltage is ramped within an energy window \n . an ac modulation voltage of 5 mv rms , 570 hz is applied to the tip and the resulting di / dv spectrum is recorded using lockin detection . \n 1(d ) shows one such di / dv spectrum for blg while the results for mlg are in fig . \n the minimum of each spectrum corresponds to the local dirac point . in the blg , \n this minimum clearly occurs away from the fermi energy which is at 0.0 v. this is evidence that the local electrochemical potential has shifted but the origin of this shift is not clear without further analysis as discussed below . \n previous stm studies have shown that in case of mlg impurities @xcite and phonons @xcite influence the charge - carrier scattering mechanisms in graphene . \n there has also been the observation of electron and hole puddles due to localized charged regions of the mlg.@xcite . however , the connection between the localized charge puddles and the topography of the graphene has not been firmly established . \n here we have measured the spatial variation of the dirac point in order to correlate it with the local topography . \n figure 2(a ) shows the topography recorded for a 100 nm @xmath3 100 nm area of mlg . for this area , \n spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a 1 nm @xmath3 1 nm grid with an energy resolution of 5 mev . \n these measurements were used to create a local density of states ( ldos ) map . from this map , we have calculated the shift of the dirac point at each point based on the minimum in the density of states . \n the energy shift of the dirac point as a function of position is plotted in fig . \n the bright regions correspond to a positive shift and the dark regions represent a negative shift . \n the average shift is 88 mv and the standard deviation of the shift is 84 mv . \n the average shift indicates that the dirac point is shifted away from the fermi energy while the variation indicates the strength of the puddles . \n the spatial extent of the puddles is approximately 8 - 15 nm in size . \n these sizes match well with the roughness of the sio@xmath1 substrate @xcite . \n theory calculations have predicted that the ripples in graphene generate an electrochemical potential which varies as the square of the local curvature of the graphene flake @xcite . to investigate the influence of ripples in our measurements \n , we used the topography image ( fig . \n 2(a ) ) to calculate the curvature of the graphene and thereby get a map of the electrochemical potential generated by the ripples \n . then we carried out a cross correlation of this electrochemical potential with the map of the dirac point shift ( fig . \n the cross correlation image is shown in fig . \n if the shift in our measurements were to be a consequence of the ripples , it would be manifested as a peak in the center of the cross correlation image . \n however there is no peak or any structure in the cross correlation image ( fig . \n 2(c ) ) . in all locations \n the degree of correlation , r@xmath4 is less than 0.5@xmath5 . \n this indicates that there is no correlation between the topography and the dirac point shift in the case of mlg . \n we have repeated the analysis for blg . \n figure 3(a ) shows the topography for a 60 nm @xmath3 60 nm area of blg . \n spectroscopy measurements were taken on a 0.6 nm @xmath3 0.6 nm grid with a 5 mev energy resolution . \n figure 3(b ) shows the plot of the shift of the dirac point . here \n the average shift is -44 mv and the standard deviation of the shift is 27 mv . \n the size scale of the puddles is once again approximately 8 - 15 nm . \n similar to mlg , we have calculated the curvature and electrochemical potential variation from the topography image . \n this image is then cross correlated with the dirac point shift image to produce fig . \n once again the two images show no correlation as the correlation coefficient for the unshifted images is approximately the same as for any shift of the two images . \n we have mapped the dirac point by spatially resolved spectroscopy for monolayer and bilayer graphene using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy . using cross correlation \n we have shown that there is no correlation between the topography and spectroscopy images for monolayer and bilayer graphene . \n therefore , we can rule out curvature as the mechanism for creating the shift in the electrochemical potential . \n hence , we attribute the shift of the dirac point to random charged impurities . \n a recent technique of making graphene on mica substrates instead of silicon dioxide seems promising in terms of reducing the ripples @xcite . \n spectroscopy measurements need to be carried out with exfoliated graphene on mica substrates to check the effect of impurities . \n further studies can also be done on suspended graphene devices where

{"ContextTokens": 3301, "GeneratedTokens": 94, "SynthesizedBody": "markarian 501 ( mkn501 ) is an extragalactic bl - lac type object at z=0.034 . \n it is observed in radio , optical and x - ray bands , and can be characterized in flat spectrum radio , highly optically polarized and optically violently variable . \n bl - lac type objects are considered to be a kind of agn , which have a jet oriented to our line of the sight . \n recently , mkn501 ( @xcite ) , mkn421 ( @xcite ) , and 1es 2344 + 514 ( @xcite ) have been identified as tev gamma ray sources , and they are all bl - lac objects . gamma rays from mkn501 around 100mev to 10gev was not observed by the cgro egret detector(@xcite ) , however , emission in the tev energy region were discovered by the whipple telescope ( @xcite ) and confirmed by the hegra telescopes ( @xcite ) . \n detailed study of gamma rays from agn will give us information about the environment surrounding the huge black hole located at the center of the agn , and the high energy phenomena and particle acceleration in the jet . \n the time scale of the intensity variations of the tev gamma rays may explain the particle acceleration site is close to the black holes . \n tev gamma rays from such extragalactic object interacts with the infrared background photons , and a cutoff of the energy spectrum is expected around 7 - 15tev(@xcite ) . \n there is an ambiguity in the prediction of the cutoff energy due to the uncertainty of the number density of infrared photons . in the discovery stage , \n the intensity in the tev energy range was very small , corresponding to 8% of the crab nebula flux , however , from mar 1997 it increased dramatically and variated from 0.3 to 4 crab flux . \n it is found that the variation of the intensities are larger in the tev range than x - ray and other ranges(@xcite ) . \n these flares are observed by whipple , hegra , cat , tactic and the telescope array prototype ( tap ) ( @xcite ) . \n the flares were continuously observed until the end of july 1997 . \n here we will report the details of the mkn501 observations by tap . \n the telescope array prototype detector @xcite , a seven telescope array is under construction at utah , dugway . \n its geographical position is @xmath0 n , @xmath1 w at an altitude of 1600 m above sea level . \n the prototype detector works in dual modes : the cherenkov and the air fluorescence mode . \n construction started in the summer of 1996 , and currently three telescopes with the respective separation of 120 m are in operation . \n the seven telescopes will be arranged in a hexagonal grid with a separation of 70 m to maximize the detection efficiency of tev gamma rays . \n each telescope is the alt - azimuth mount with a 6m@xmath2 main dish . \n the main dish consists of 19 hexagonal shape segmented mirrors coated with anodized aluminum . \n the reflectivity of mirrors are about 90% at wave length of 400 nm . at the focal plane , \n a high resolution imaging camera of 256ch photomultipliers is installed to measure detailed images of cherenkov light from gamma rays and cosmic rays . \n the cherenkov light images are used to distinguish the gamma rays from the huge number of background cosmic rays . \n the typical cosmic - ray rate is about 1000/min and the gamma - ray rate from the crab nebula is about 0.5/min ( @xcite ) with three telescopes . \n therefore rejection of cosmic ray background events using the shape parameter of the cherenkov light is essential to obtain a reasonable s / n ratio in this experiment , and we use the techniques originally developed by the whipple group ( @xcite ) . \n the absolute pointing accuracy of the telescopes is typically 1 arcmin which is frequently calibrated by imaging bright stars . \n the signals from the 256ch camera are amplified just behind the camera in order to minimize electric noise and to obtain better timing resolution , and are then fed to adc and tdc modules mounted at the telescope base to measure the amplitude and the timing after passing through 10 m of twisted pair cables . the triggering requirement to record \n the event is four folds out of 256 tubes . \n the threshold of the discriminators are set at 5 photoelectron level . \n the single counting rates in each tube are set to 3 - 5khz in each channel . \n the threshold energy for detectable gamma rays is 600 gev for vertical showers . \n the mkn501 was observed with the raster scan tracking mode . in this mode \n , the telescope tracking center scans the sqaure region of @xmath3 in right ascension and declination coordinate centered on the target . \n there are several advantages in this method compared with the conventional on - source / off - source tracking mode . \n the on - source and off - source sky region can be observed simultaneously . \n the systematics of the imaging devices can be reduced significantly . by observing the bright star images , \n the calibration of the telescope absolute direction can be done with the accuracy of @xmath4 . \n our telescopes will be described in more detail elsewhere . \n this observation of mkn501 was carried out from the end of march to the end of july , 1997 . \n we observed a total number of 47 nights for a total observation time of 105.4 hrs . \n we have observed 3,400,000 events in the f.o.v . of @xmath5 around mkn501 , which are mainly cosmic - ray protons and helium nuclei . in the analysis \n , we have limited the zenith angle to the range of @xmath6 to @xmath7 in order to reduce the systematic errors in the energy and the aperture estimates . \n this leaves 2,160,000 events and 64.0 hrs of live time , with an average event rate of 9.4hz with three telescopes . among these events \n , we selected gamma ray candidates using the shape parameters of cherenkov images and their directionality . \n we can determine the arrival direction of gamma rays and the cosmic rays with an accuracy of @xmath8 ( the elliptical errors ) in each event . \n therefore , 97% of the background events around the target , say within @xmath9 , can be rejected . \n the cosmic rays show larger images than gamma rays , and they are rejected with 95% efficiency through the image selection . \n therefore , typically 99.95 % of the background events around the target are rejected with the image and the arrival direction using the present analysis method . \n 35 % of the gamma rays remain through this process . therefore , even if the original @xmath10 is bad as @xmath11 , we can obtain @xmath10 of order @xmath12 . \n at first , the clean cherenkov images are obtained by removing the background photons with the timing information . \n the signal timings of each photomultipliers are recorded with an accuracy of 1nsec . \n the cherenkov light signals from gamma rays and cosmic rays are concentrated within a 10 nsec interval , however noise including the photons from star light and the air glow are randomly distributed in time . therefore we require a timing alignment with a software gate set at 40 nsec . \n then we require the clustering of hit tubes , geometry . \n after these selections , the chance coincidence events due to the random coincidence are completely rejected and the pure cherenkov events induced by gamma rays and cosmic rays remain . \n then , the image parameters are calculated : signal size size , the centroide position of images ( x , y ) , width , length and conc . \n the events with images located near the camera boundary are cut by requiring the condition @xmath13 , because the images near the camera boundary are distorted due to the boundary . \n the gamma rays show the compact images compared with the hadronic showers , so we then selected the events which has a smaller width and length region similar to what is predicted by a monte carlo simulation . \n we select events with the following conditions , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to 30% and 50% of the points obtained by integrating the width distribution from off - source events ( hadron events ) . \n the typical values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and they naturally contain the zenith angle dependencies and the weather conditions , and we could obtain the constant fraction of data as gamma ray candidates . \n the size of 400 corresponds to the the average value of size . \n the second terms ( 0.020 and 0.023 ) represent the size dependence of the images as predicted by the monte carlo simulation . \n the parameter @xmath20 corresponds to the light concentration , as gamma ray showers have a higher light concentration than hadronic showers . \n after these selections , 8 - 10% of events remain . finally , we select for gamma ray showers using the directional information obtained by the asymmetry of shower images . \n we select for events which develop from neighbouring of the target source to outer direction . \n finally , 97% of the hadronic showers are rejected and 30 - 40% of gamma rays are selected . after these cuts we obtained the excess of @xmath21 from the direction of mkn501 . \n the monthly excesses in the alpha distribution are shown in figure 1 . \n the absolute gain calibration is carried out by the measurement of a single photoelectron . \n we found that a single photoelectron corresponds to 4 adc counts . \n the relative gain of each channel of 256ch is adjusted to within 5% accuracy using the led pulsar . \n we confirmed that the @xmath22 distribution observed is consistent with the simulated showers assuming the cosmic ray energy spectra in each composition . \n the uncertainty of the absolute gain or the @xmath22 and the energy relation is estimated as to be 20% . with a monte carlo simulation \n , we can determine the effective area for gamma rays and hadrons , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . \n we also obtain experimentally the number of the excess events @xmath25 , and number of background events @xmath26 . in order to minimize the systematic errors \n , we took the ratio @xmath27 . \n the denominator @xmath28 has a weak dependence on size with our imaging selection of approximately @xmath29 . \n the energy and the @xmath22 relations for gamma rays and hadrons are determined by our monte carlo simulation to be @xmath30 tev and @xmath31 tev , respectively . \n then we can obtain the gamma ray energy spectrum from @xmath32 . \n the derived energy spectrum is shown in the figure 2 . \n . the differential energy spectrum can be well fit with the power law spectrum of index -2.5 up to 5 tev . \n the spectrum becomes steeper above 5tev which may suggest a cutoff of the energy spectrum . \n however , it is possible that statistical fluctuations may make this effect . \n we need more statistics to obtain conclusive results . \n the saturation of the photomultipliers , the amplifiers , and the adc is considered to occur at higher energy , above 30 tev . \n we could minimize this saturation effect by the above ratio method . \n the observation of the mkn501 was carried out for 47 nights from the end of march to the end of july . \n the gamma ray event rate is plotted as a function of mjd in figure 3 . for reference , \n the gamma ray rate from the crab nebula measured by our detectors is shown by a horizontal line . \n the event rate was highly variable day by day , and the maximum event rate was about 4 crab and the minimum rate was @xmath34 crab . \n the time scale of the intensity change was about a few days . \n we searched for a short time variation of the intensity but we could not find clear evidence of any short time variation in our data set . \n we can see high states and low states clearly in our data set . \n this feature ( the time scale and the intensity change ) in april and in july appear to be similar , showing `` u '' shapes , and the interval of the two high states are 14 days and 12 days . \n may and june data each show only one high state `` @xmath35 '' shapes . in order to examine the periodicity in the data set , the data shifted by 25.5 days are superposed in the bottom pannel of figure 3 . \n we can see good coincidence of the high states . \n this test suggests a @xmath36 day periodicity . \n the periodicity of the gamma ray intensities was examined by the rayleigh test . \n we calculated the powers ( amplitude when fitting sinusoidal function ) in each test period from 5 days to 45 days . in order to evaluate the significance in each test period , \n we have generated @xmath37 data set artificially by shuffling the relation of ( @xmath38 , mjd ) , where @xmath38 is 47 flux points in figure 3 . \n ( these data set also has the same gaps in the observation time . ) \n they are analyzed in the same way as the real data set . by comparing the amplitude of the real data set with the amplitude distribution of the generated @xmath37 data sets , we can estimate the probability of the appearance of observed amplitude in each test period . with this method \n we could remove the spurious effect ( the gaps in the observations making the false periodicities ) , and succeed to obtain the chance probability . \n figure 4 shows the obtained chance probability as a function of the test period . \n we can see prominent peak at 12.7 days with the chance probability of less than @xmath39 . \n this period corresponds to a half of the period obtained in the simple test mentioned above . \n we obtained the differential energy spectrum of the gamma rays from mkn501 . \n it shows a possible cutoff feature above 5 - 7 tev . \n this cutoff is predicted to be caused by the interaction with the infrared photons or the the limit of the electron acceleration in the jet . \n the cutoff energy of the gamma rays due to the infrared photon interaction from the distance of the mkn501 , z=0.034 is estimated 7 tev to 15 tev by @xcite .    in the time variation of the gamma ray intensities \n , we found a periodicity , which may be a quasi periodic oscillation . the observed periodicity corresponds to 12.7 days or 25.5 days . \n the relationship of this periodicity with high energy phenomena around the massive black holes could be influenced by factors including the precession of the jet , and the rotation of the black hole(s ) . \n r. protheroe ( @xcite ) suggested the interaction of the shock wave and the helical structure of the jet may cause this observed type of periodicity . \n authors would like to thanks to j.como , a.larsen , r.smith , f.misak , l.sutton , d.gardener , s.davis , c.davis , j.parry and b.larsen for their contribution to our experiment in usa . \n this project is supported by the grant aid ( # 07247102 ) and aid ( # 08041096 ) by monbushou ( the ministry of education and science ) and also partly supported by the science research promotion fund of japan private school promotion foundation .", "StartTimeOffset": 1404702009162, "RequestID": "2f82778f4e3d08f3463c547011b4eaf65889668c", "TotalTokens": 3395}
{"ContextTokens": 2789, "GeneratedTokens": 300, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery of asymptotic freedom is an important corner stone of the foundation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of the strong interaction . despite the substantial effort in testing the predictions of this theory at e@xmath0e@xmath1 colliders like e.g.petra  @xcite and lep  @xcite , \n qcd is less precisely surveyed than the electroweak sector of the standard model of electroweak and strong interaction . \n the precision of the determination of the strong coupling constant , @xmath2 , at centre - of - mass energies of up to @xmath11  gev at lep ii is only at the level of a few percent ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    to test the details of the running of @xmath2 , which means the asymptotic freedom \n , one has to strive for a precision of better than one percent . \n this could be achieved by a determination of @xmath2 at a linear collider operating at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3 gev or above . \n it would provide a long lever arm for the test of the asymptotic freedom . \n besides the running of the coupling constant , qcd also predicts the value of the renormalised quark masses to depend on the scale of the interaction process  @xcite . \n first investigations of this running of the quark masses were performed by the lep and slc experiments  @xcite , which suffered from large statistical uncertainties . \n further experimental manifestation of the effect is , therefore , still required . \n this could be achieved at a linear collider due to its high luminosity and by using very high resolution silicon vertex detectors . here \n the silicon micro vertex detectors allow to distinguish bottom and charm quark flavours created by the annihilation process from the other lighter quarks . \n the identification of the primary quark flavour could furthermore be used to study the properties of quark and gluon jets . \n such studies have already be successfully conducted at lep i and slc ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . at the higher energies of lep ii , however , the data statistics is scarce for a significant investigation of the quark and gluon properties . \n again , a linear collider would allow such studies because of its high specific luminosity . \n apart from the advantage of very high luminosity , qcd studies at a linear collider also gain from the high centre - of - mass energy . \n this is because the impact of hadronisation , which blurs the view at the quarks and gluons , diminishes with a reciprocal power of the scale of the process . \n hence the distortion due to hadronisation effects at @xmath3  gev is only about @xmath12 of that at the z mass scale  @xcite . \n this article presents a scrutiny of the potential of the tesla linear collider to perform a determination of the strong coupling constant at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3  gev . \n the study is restricted to an investigation based on monte carlo generator simulations using the pythia 5.722 @xcite , herwig 5.9 @xcite , and ariadne 4.8 @xcite programs which , except for herwig , have been tuned by the opal collaboration at lep  @xcite . \n these generators are used to simulate the production of quark - antiquark pairs from the annihilation . to account for the substantial production cross - section of massive gauge boson pairs ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , background from hadronic decays of z and w bosons is considered , where in addition also the decay w@xmath13 is included . \n all other leptonic decays of these massive bosons can easily be identified and , hence , rejected . \n likewise , background contributions from @xmath14 scattering and @xmath15 pair production are not included . \n their contribution can be removed very efficiently as is known from the experiments at lep ii ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . \n the production of top quarks leads to significant effects . \n this is due to its large mass and the appearance of typically three jets of particles from its decay . \n top quark events , therefore , appear rather spherically in the detector , thus immitating multijet events . \n figure  [ fig - top - distortions ] shows the impact of the pair - produced top quarks on the thrust observable and the jet rates , both of which are usually used to determine the value of the strong coupling constant . \n it is therefore indispensable to exclude the contribution from top quarks when performing an @xmath2 determination . \n the impact of initial state radiation is accounted for using its next - to - leading order treatment in the pythia generator . \n radiative events constitute a large fraction of the hadronic final states , especially radiative returns to the z pole . \n most of these can easily be rejected by requiring the reconstructed mass of the whole event to be close to the centre - of - mass energy of the colliding beams . \n such a cut on the effective centre - of - mass energy , @xmath16 , is usually applied in the hadronic event selection at lep ii ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n it effectively takes out radiative z return events as can be seen in figure  [ fig - isr+bs ] . \n beamstrahlung , which is of relevance at a linear collider only , is simulated using the program circe 1.28  @xcite which has been interfaced to the pythia generator . \n when using the parameters proposed for the tesla linear collider , only a negligible fraction of the events is lost due to beamstrahlung ( see figure  [ fig - isr+bs ] ) if the cut @xmath17 is applied which is usually used by the lep experiments . \n to study the prospects of a determination of @xmath2 at the tesla linear collider , an integrated luminosity of @xmath18 fb@xmath19 has been simulated . \n this corresponds to roughly one year of data taking at the design luminosity of the collider . \n .[tab - no - of - events ] approximate number of events for @xmath18  fb@xmath19 and the cross - sections taken from pythia  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the error budget of an @xmath2 determination is compiled from different sources . since \n a perfect detector has been assumed , the corresponding experimental uncertainties are adopted from measurements at lep ii ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n effects due to the roughly @xmath20 background from boson pairs are neglected . \n the statistical uncertainty is estimated by considering a @xmath21 selection efficiency and an expected integrated luminosity of @xmath22 within one year . \n this corresponds to about @xmath23 million hadronic events which have been generated using the pythia generator employing the tuned set of parameters . \n the simulated events are used to assess the remaining uncertainties due to hadronisation corrections and due to the choice of the hadronisation parameters by fitting the @xmath4-matched second order ( @xmath5 ) and resummed calculations ( nlla ) to distributions of the observables in the hadronic final state . \n distributions from the thrust , heavy jetmass , total and wide jet broadening , @xmath24-parameter , and the @xmath25 to @xmath26-jet flip @xmath27 value , @xmath28 , obtained from the durham jet algorithm are used . \n hadronisation correction factors are applied to these distributions before fitting the theoretical expressions . \n the result of the fits is exemplified for thrust , heavy jetmass , wide jet broadening , and the jet flip in figure  [ fig - evshapes ] . in general good fits \n are obtained . \n however , for the heavy jetmass and the wide jet broadening an excursion of the fitted curve from the simulated data is visible at small values of these observables . \n this could indicate a problem of either the theoretical formulae or of the event generator program . \n the fit must , therefore , not go too far into this @xmath25-jet region , which represents the bulk of statistics indeed . \n finally , also the impact of a variation of the renormalisation scale factor , @xmath29 , is considered . as has become usual @xmath29 is varied from unity to @xmath23 and @xmath25 , respectively , assigning the change in @xmath30 as the uncertainty due to the choice of the renormalisation scale factor . \n table  [ tab - alphas - error - budget ] lists the individual contributions to the total uncertainty of @xmath2 at the z mass scale , @xmath31 . to calculate a total uncertainty , \n the individual error contributions from all six observables are averaged for each systematic variation individually . \n the total error is then obtained by adding the individual contributions in quadrature . excluding the uncertainty derived when \n choosing the herwig generator to correct for hadronisation effects , because it is not tuned to the lep data yet , the total error becomes @xmath32 . \n this error incorporates a significant contribution of about @xmath33 due to the scale uncertainty . \n it should be noted that it is of similar size as the typical error obtained by the lep and slc experiments . \n the error @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath35 . \n a feasibility study of the determination of the strong coupling constant , @xmath2 , at the tesla linear collider has been presented starting from the selection of hadronic events . \n neither initial state radiation nor beamstrahlung constitute a substantial problem for such a qcd investigation at this collider . \n the major background stems from the pair production of w and z bosons . \n both can be easily suppressed by cutting on the hemisphere masses and on the polar angle of the thrust axis . \n top quarks significantly distort event shape and jet rate distributions and must , therefore , also be excluded from an @xmath2 determination based on such observables . \n it has been found that a cut on the minimum value of the jet broadening effectively removes the contribution from top quarks without affecting the selection efficiency . \n the hadronisation corrections and the associated uncertainties are very small at tesla energies . \n however , the contribution from different hadronisation models could become a dominating source of error . \n fits of the @xmath4-matched second order and resummed calculations to six observables have been performed to assess the systematic uncertainties of the derived value of @xmath2 using data from monte carlo generators only . \n exerimental uncertainties have been adopted from the lep ii experiments and are found to be small . \n a very significant contribution to the total uncertainty of @xmath36 stems from the choice of the renormalisation scale . \n its absolute contribution will shrink with increasing centre - of - mass energy but the relative uncertainty is not diminished . to improve on the scale uncertainty theoretical calculations of third order in @xmath2 \n are absolutely required . \n i would like to thank the organisers of the third ecfa workshop which took place from november 7 -

{"ContextTokens": 1555, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "the mathematical model of quantum computation has appeared in the 1980-th with the works of david deutsch [ 1 ] and others [ 2 - 4 ] . in 1994 \n peter shor [ 5 ] proposed an effective quantum algorithm for solving the npi - candidate task  factorisation of big composite numbers . \n this breakthrough allowed to expect , that any task from np could have an effective solution on a quantum computer . \n this hope was weakened after the lov grover s work [ 6 ] in 1996 , which proposed the general quantum algorithm for solving any task from np . \n the algorithm was designed to search the particular point in the unsorted database of size n with only @xmath0 oracle queries . \n grover has shown that under the considered assumptions the algorithm is optimal , so only quadratic speedup can be achived by the quantum computer compared to the classical one , if we do nt have additional information about the oracle functioning . \n this paper describes the improvement of the quantum database search algorithm , exhibiting the exponential speedup over the classical search , by changing some preliminary assumptions about the model of computation . \n the reasoning goes as follows . in section 2 \n we recall the grover s database search algorithm . \n section 3 describes the new quantum computation model with von neumann architecture applied , and the new algorithm for the unsorted database search is proposed along with its complexity estimation . \n section 4 glues everything together thus serving as a conclusion . \n first , let us recall the algorithm proposed by lov grover . let s consider the function f :    @xmath1 @xmath2    which is some decision function over the set of n - bit strings . \n @xmath3  is the number of all possible n - bit strings , thus the number of all possible inputs to f. function f is implemented as a black box . \n our purpose is to find the n - bit string @xmath4 on which f returns 1 . \n grover defines the quantum oracle @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where x is n -

{"ContextTokens": 2385, "GeneratedTokens": 166, "SynthesizedBody": "high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) processes in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have been suggested as a probe to investigate the physics of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions more than a decade ago and have become a cornerstone of the experimental heavy - ion program both at rhic and lhc . yet , compared with for instance the modelling of the bulk medium evolution using hydrodynamics where an era of precision fits to differential data has begun ( see e.g. @xcite ) , theoretical progress in the physics of hard probes is slow .    partially , this can be attributed to the structure of the problem : hard probes are at the same time sensitive to the microscopical degrees of freedom of the medium and the macroscopical medium density distribution and evolution . \n thus high @xmath0 observables have the capability to potentially do both tomography and transport coefficient measurements in the medium , i.e. to constrain its microscopical and macroscopical dynamics . \n while the microscopical physics of the medium and hence the basic structure of the parton - medium interaction is currently in detail unknown , the density evolution ( in terms of fluid - dynamical modelling ) is constrained by bulk data , but not unambiguously determined . as a result , the description of any single observable in terms of a parton - medium interaction scenario and a medium evolution model is usually far from unique and does not allow a firm conclusion with regard to either question . \n however , systematic multi - observable studies of a matrix of parton - medium interaction and medium evolution models can reduce the allowed model space significantly , resulting in a class of models which shows good consistency across rhic and lhc observables . \n in vacuum , at the core of the computation of hard processes in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is the factorization of the hard , short - distance interaction part and the long - distance physics of initial state parton distributions and final state parton showers . in a medium , \n qcd factorization is not strictly proven , but remains a plausible working assumption . \n a sufficiently large separation of hard and thermal momentum scale then ensures that the hard process itself receives no medium corrections and can serve as a standard - candle , producing high @xmath1 partons at a known and calculable rate . \n the partons emerging from the hard process are typically characterized by a large virtuality scale @xmath2 . \n if one takes the uncertainty relation to estimate the timescale at which intermediate shower states at lower virtuality can be formed , one finds @xmath3 with @xmath4 the virtual parton energy . comparing this scale with typical medium lifetimes @xmath5 fm \n , one finds that for typical rhic and lhc kinematics a significant part of the partonic shower evolution ( i.e. with @xmath6 ) takes place in the medium , with the shower being gradually boosted out of the medium at top lhc energies and on the other hand hadrons with large mass @xmath7 being produced in the medium . \n however , over a large kinematical range and for sufficiently light hadrons it can reasonably be assumed that the medium modification largely concerns the evolution of a parton shower with subsequent hadronization as in vacuum .    as a baseline example for in - medium shower modelling , consider a virtuality - ordered parton shower such as implemented in the pyshow algorithm @xcite \n this is treated as an interated series of splittings of a parent into two daughter partons @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 and where the virtuality of partons in terms of @xmath11 decreases in each branching . \n the splitting probability is given by        where @xmath13 are perturbatively calculable objects , the so - called splitting kernels . \n the splittings cease when the parton virtuality reaches a non - perturbative lower scale @xmath14 gev at which point a hadronization model needs to be used . in this way \n , the original high virtuality of the shower initiator is converted into the transverse momentum distribution of the final shower partons ( and the initial virtuality sets a kinematic bound for observables like jet shapes ) . \n an important thing to note is that the splitting kernels @xmath13 are scale invariant , i.e. they do not depend on an absolute momentum scale . as a result , \n the fragmentation functions generated by a series of splittings is self - similar ( the momentum distribution of hadrons in a subjet looks almost the same as the distribution in the whole jet when plotted as a function of @xmath15 ) and up to logarithmic corrections has no strong energy dependence .    estimating the timescale associated with the initial , hard branchings which largely determine jet shape and subjet structure , one finds @xmath16 fm , i.e. well before any medium can be formed . \n this gives rise to the expectation that subject structure and jet shape at high @xmath0 should not be very sensitive to medium modifications . \n there are two main processes by which this pattern can be modified in a medium : 1 ) direct loss of energy ( by elastic collisions , drag ,  ) into the medium as parametrized by a transport coefficient @xmath17 and 2 ) enhanced soft gluon radiation by medium - induced virtuality as parametrized by a transport coefficient @xmath18 . \n the first mechanism is in general incoherent and the energy is lost into the medium , the second mechanism involves a de - coherence time for the radiated gluon and transfers energy from the leading parton into an increased number of subleading shower partons . \n note that this distinction can be made on average on the basis of transport coefficients , but not for a single interaction graph with the medium which may involve both direct and radiative energy loss . \n a recently suggested additional mechanism is the modification of color flow by the medium , leading to a modification of the hadronic shower evolution @xcite . \n models may now be classified based on what part of the dynamics they include , how they treat the medium and how they solve the shower evolution equations . \n the most complete approach are models which simulate the whole in - medium shower evolution such as jewel @xcite , yajem @xcite , q - pythia @xcite or resummed higher twist ( ht ) @xcite . however , if one is only interested in observables which probe the leading shower fragments , such as single inclusive high @xmath0 hadron suppression , which probe dominantly showers in which a large fraction of the energy flows through a single parton , then leading parton energy loss modelling in which the medium evolution is cast into an energy loss probability @xmath19 before vacuum fragmentation is applied is sufficient . \n models of this type include the asw @xcite , amy @xcite or whdg @xcite frameworks . \n finally , in hybrid approaches a vacuum shower is computed down to some scale , then the produced partons are put on - shell and each propagated through the medium using a leading - parton energy loss model . \n an example for hybrid modelling is martini @xcite .    of considerable interest \n is how the medium is included into the modelling process . \n a number of models come with an explicit treatment of medium partons and their interaction with shower partons , typically as a thermal gas of quark and gluon quasiparticles @xcite . \n such a description requires that the medium is , at least to some degree , perturbatively tractable , which is not in line with the basic assumption underlying almost ideal hydrodynamical modelling which assumes that the medium is strongly coupled and the mean free path essentially vanishes . \n usually an explicit treatment of interactions with medium partons breaks the scale invariance of the fragmentation function around the momentum scale of the medium partons and below , while it largely remains intact above . \n in addition , the medium provides additional kinematic phase space for transverse shower broadening . \n a different approximation is to cast all medium effects into a modification of the splitting probability , in essence replacing @xmath20 with the detailed form of @xmath21 motivated by a specific physics scenario as done e.g. in q - pythia @xcite . \n such a prescription explicitly conserves energy and momentum inside the shower , i.e. there is no additional phase space for transverse broadening . \n it also perserves scale invariance of the fragmentation function , but it alters its shape to a different functional form .    finally , the medium can be ( without any explicit reference to its degrees of freedom ) appear via transport coefficients such as @xmath22 and alter the kinematics of propagating partons as implemented in yajem @xcite . \n this again breaks scale invariance of the fragmentation function around the medium momentum scale and below and leads to additional phase space for transverse broadening . \n there are two main strategies to solve the shower evolution equations  analytical and mote - carlo ( mc ) techniques . in general , analytical techniques \n get exact treatment of quantum interference effects while they often rely on kinematic approximations such as eikonal propagation or infinite parent parton energy which violate energy - momentum conservation . \n in contrast , mc frameworks usually have exact kinematics , but have to resort to phenomenological prescriptions for interference effects . \n it is immediately evident that the combination of all observables cuts the available model space down much more than any single observable . \n most of the constraints are provided by the combination of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath23 at lhc which probes the dynamics of leading partons in combination with a dihadron correlation @xmath24 which is a probe of subleading fragment dynamics . \n current jet measurements do not have strong constraining power beyond this , however they do highlight the need to go beyond a purely probabilistic implementation of medium modification and also provide constraints for transverse dynamics of showers . \n a number of conclusions with regard to the nature of jet - medium interaction can be drawn from this :    * the combined data is compatible with a fairly standard pqcd picture of medium - induced radiation and a subleading component of elastic interactions leading to energy transfer into the medium * there is no evidence for exotic scenarios , the data neither indicate an @xmath25 dependence of energy loss as suggested by some variants of ads / cft inspired models nor a modification of the hadronization stage . * \n data from rhic and lhc consistently indicate that some moderate amount of energy is transferred from the hard parton directly into the non - perturbative medium rather than into subleading jet fragments . \n however , the amount of direct energy transfer is constrained by pathlength - dependent observables and found to be significantly smaller than if the medium can be described as a near - ideal quark - gluon gas . \n this may imply that the observed degrees of freedom in the medium are massive or correlated quasiparticles .    to make these conclusions more quantitative , \n further high - statistics multi - differential measurements are needed from the experimental side , followed by systematic multi - observable studies from theory . \n in particular , the systematics of h - h , jet - h and @xmath26-h correlations ( with decreasing geometry bias ) as a function of the reaction plane angle for various system centralities is expected to be a sensitive probe of both the parton - medium interaction mechanism and the medium density evolution . \n once these questions are reliably addressed , the precise nature of the mechanism by which the energy deposited from hard partons is carried by the medium presents itself as the next goal .", "StartTimeOffset": 1427575986462, "RequestID": "bb6a8f0c01ccef464ad07811161e6bec8fbb664e", "TotalTokens": 2551}

known book@xcite on the connection between particle phenomenology and theoretical cosmology discusses possible candidates \n axions , wimps , machos  for the constituents of the dark matter . in the present article \n i shall provide a complete solution to the dark matter problem which is in the macho category and surprisingly simple : the dark mattter is all black holes ! \n let me first consider low mass dark matter candidates suggested by particle phenomenology . \n there are two especially popular candidates . \n the lighter is the invisible axion predicted by @xcite . \n its mass denotes any integer between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \n ] must be in an allowed window @xmath4 . \n although there are compelling arguments@xcite that the invisible axion requires stronger fine tuning than the strong cp problem it purports to solve , it has staying power and remains the subject of experimental searches . \n the other very popular low - mass dark matter candidate , at a proposed mass typcally a trillion times that of the invisible axion , is the wimp ( weakly - interacting massive particle ) exemplified by the neutralino of supersymmetry . \n the fact that wimps can naturally annihilate to an acceptable present abundance of dark matter is sometimes cited as support for wimps as dark matter . \n but if my proposal for identification of the constituents of dark matter as black holes with masses above @xmath5 is correct , particle - phenomenology - inspired dark matter candidates are , unfortunately for their creators , irrelevant . \n higher mass dark matter constituents are generically called machos ( massive astrophysical compact halo objects ) . \n my proposed constituents fall into this class with masses in the range @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the solar mass ; equivalently @xmath8 or @xmath9 gev . \n even the most die - hard opponent to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) could not take seriously that the lhc could create a black hole with fifty orders of magnitude times the available lhc energy of @xmath10 so the present article thus might convince that the lhc is safe . \n the machos are truly compact , all being smaller in physical size than the earth . \n it is the small size and large mass which have enabled these dark matter constituents to escape detection for 75 years . \n we discuss two methods for their detection , their formation then what , for me , is the best motivation - the entropy of the universe .    . \n note that for the range of masses between @xmath11 and @xmath12 all halo mass can be imbhs . \n taken from @xcite.,height=491 ] \n in the late twentieth century heroic searches were made for microlensing events and many spectacular examples @xcite of machos were identified with masses up to @xmath11 . \n the length of time of a microlensing event depends on the velocity and mass of the lensing macho . \n since the velocities do nor vary widely it is the macho mass which is most crucial in determining longevity . \n the longevity is directly proportional to the square root of the lens mass . \n machos were discovered with microlensing longevities up to about 400 days . \n insufficient machos to account for more than a few percent of the dark matter were discovered . to detect machos up to mass @xmath12 , the current upper limit for halo black holes , necessitates study of microlensing events with duration up to 4.5 years . \n nature has provided delicate astrophysical clocks whose accuracy is sensitive to the possible proximity of machos . \n these clocks are binaries with separations up to 1 pc and therefore can be bigger than the solar system in which the distance from the sun to the outermost planet is only @xmath13 pc .    because these wide binaries are so weakly bound they are the most sensitive to disruption by nearby machos . \n after formation they retain their original orbital parameters as a reliable clock except when affected by gravitational encounters with machos . \n the detailed study of wide binaries is a young and promising technique for macho detection . in the first pioneering presentation@xcite the range of masses allowed for machos which provide all dark matter was @xmath14 . \n it seemed unlikely , though logically possible , that all dark matter machos could have masses within such a narrow range . \n a revisit and reanalysis@xcite of wide binaries has , however , recently discovered that one of the key examples used in @xcite was spurious . \n this leads to quite different and much more promising restrictions on machos , with the allowed mass range extending up to @xmath12 . \n the new constraint is displayed in fig . 1 . and \n it is now far more likely that all dark matter is in the form of black hole machos . \n because intergalactic dust shows evidence of metallicity which involves nuclei heavier than lithium , the heaviest element formed during big - bang nucleosynthsis , it has been hypothesized @xcite that there must have existed pop iii stars in an era before galaxy formation . \n these subsequently exploded producing the dust nuclei heavier than lithium , and leaving massive black holes which are macho candidates . \n numerical simulations of dark matter halos@xcite have given insight into the likely general features of the halo profile . \n the spatial resolution of such simulations is , however , far too coarse to study the formation of machos smaller than the earth whose radius is @xmath15 . \n nevertheless , dark matter is known to clump at large scales and may well do so at such far smaller scales . \n i have assumed that dark energy possesses no entropy . \n let me argue that this is a very weak assumption . \n recently the planck satellite was launched and is on its way to lagrangian point 2 where it will attempt to measure with unprecedented accuracy the dark energy equation of state @xmath16 where @xmath17 are respectively pressure , density . \n the key quantity is @xmath18 . if @xmath19 vanishes identically the assumption of zero entropy for dark energy is justified because it is fully described by one parameter , the cosmological constant . \n if non - zero @xmath19 were observationally established , it would imply a dynamical dark energy with concomitant entropy . \n however , without black holes , the dark energy dimensionless entropy would be much less than one googol and so the identification of the dark matter as black holes and the rest of the present discussion would be unchanged . \n the identification of the dark matter constituent has been an intellectual pursuit for over 75 years . \n particle theorists have naturally suggested light mass solutions which include the invisible axion and wimps . according to theoretical cosmology , however , the most likely solution is that all dark matter is black holes . \n according to the recently updated analysis of wide binaries the permitted mass range is between 30 and 500 solar masses . \n taking a universe comprised of @xmath20 halos each of mass @xmath21 , and using a central macho mass @xmath22 , there are @xmath23 machos per halo and @xmath24 in the universe . \n the dimensionless entropy per macho , using the pbh formula @xcite is @xmath25 and the total is 1000 googols . for galactic - core supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , there are @xmath20 of them so that for a central mass @xmath26 and individual entropy @xmath27 their total entropy is also 1000 googols .    because @xmath28 , the total mass of machos is much larger than that of smbhs . for the central values \n it is @xmath29 times larger . \n the total macho mass is @xmath30 so i hereby predict several thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion kilograms of black holes !", "StartTimeOffset": 1460775451974, "RequestID": "07f054f43aca66f14b0de03ea5f7bbd7847f9a4d", "TotalTokens": 1819}

hadrons transition , the nucleosynthesis of light elements and the formation of structures , as galaxies and cluster of galaxies \n . the scale factor growth to about @xmath9 up today , with an age of about @xmath10s . \n finally , very recently the universe starts a new accelerating phase , dominated by a cosmological constant term or a dark energy fluid . \n this is a very brief history of the universe . \n an unified model that could describes all the phases of evolution of the universe is a difficult task . \n the several orders of magnitude involved from the inflation to recent cosmic acceleration forced the researches to divide the evolution of the universe in different parts , each one characterized by different kind of particles that dominate at different stages . \n these ingredients form the standard model of cosmology . \n the inflationary phase of the universe can be constructed with a single scalar field that drive the inflation while the scalar field rolls down to the bottom of its potential . \n several potentials that satisfies the fine tunings of the inflationary phase have been studied in last decades ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for observational constraints on several potentials . ) . \n after inflation , the scalar field ends in a rapid oscillation around the minimum of its potential and its energy is transferred to the baryonic particles in the next phase of evolution , including radiation , in a process known as reheating . \n radiation and baryons corresponds to about 5% of the total content of the universe . \n the scalar field do not act anymore and the universe goes to the radiation dominated phase and subsequently to the matter dominated phase . during the matter dominated phase there is the necessity to add a new kind of non - baryonic matter in the universe in order to correctly explain structure formation , thus the standard model admits the presence of the dark matter , about 25% of the total content of the universe . after evolving dominated by dark matter \n , observations shown that a recent accelerating phase of expansion needs a new ingredient , the so called cosmological constant or even a new kind of energy , called dark energy , acting as a vacuum energy density and representing about 70% of the total energetic content . \n as previously stated , a model describing all phases of the evolution of the universe is a challenge for the present cosmology . \n recently , a new class of fermions with mass dimension one named elko @xcite was proposed and established in solid quantum bases very recently @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . such new spinorial field is a natural candidate to dark matter in the universe since that it is constructed as spin-@xmath11 particles describing fermions that are eigenstate of the charge conjugation operator , being neutral and weakly coupled to the electromagnetic sector of the standard model of particles . \n several cosmological applications of such field have recently appeared in the literature @xcite . in @xcite \n has been studied numerically the possibility of the fermionic elko field driven the evolution of the universe from inflation , passing by the dark matter dominated epoch and finishing with the recent cosmic acceleration . \n the potential used was of symmetry breaking type and the mass of the elko field needed to drive the evolution was found to be about @xmath12gev , a very huge value . \n due to numerical difficulties , the time scale used was very short , not allowing a complete estimate of the growth of the scale factor up today . \n in the present paper the numerical solution concerning the elko field evolution in the presence of a potential with a quadratic mass term and quartic self interaction term was obtained . \n contrary to the previous paper , here it is shown that all the evolution can be driven by the quartic self interaction term , leaving the mass term free to be smaller if necessary , depending on other tests to constrain it . \n also , the time scale used here allows to estimate the real growth of the scale factor up today . \n in the flat space - time , there are four elko spinors satisfying invariance by the charge conjugation operator @xmath13 , they are labelled as @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for self - conjugate and @xmath16 for anti - self - conjugate . \n the index @xmath17 stands for two possible helicities . \n they satisfies @xmath18 @xcite and are normalized satisfying the relation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the usual spinor and its dual , respectively . \n the dual have been redefined recently @xcite in order to maintain locality and lorentz covariance . \n the corresponding quantum fields can be redefined in order to satisfies a normalization relation as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands here for any of the four spinors , with normalization @xmath24 for the two self - conjugate and @xmath25 for the two anti - self - conjugate .    in this paper \n it was used just one fermionic elko field satisfying a positive normalization . \n also , in order to use the elko field in a curved background , it was factored out the time dependence of the field as @xcite @xmath26 and the action for the model reads : @xmath27 \\ , , \\label{actione}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 with @xmath29 . \n the tilde denotes the presence of torsion terms into the ricci scalar @xmath30 and covariant derivatives , namely , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the connection associated to spinor fields , containing the spin connections . for the potential it was used a constant term plus a quadratic mass term and a quartic self - interacting term , namely : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant , @xmath36 is the physical mass of the field and @xmath37 a dimensionless coupling . \n such kind of potential follows naturally from the theory of mass dimension one fermions @xcite .    in a flat friedmann -

cartan framework and also due to spin connections terms . \n in particular , since that @xmath44 , in the limit @xmath45 and @xmath46 these additional terms can be discard and the equations are exactly like that ones for the standard scalar field . \n thus the limit @xmath47 represents a kind of transition of the elko field from a high energy regime dominated by torsion and spin connection terms when @xmath48 and a low energy regime of a standard scalar field free of torsion and spin connection terms when @xmath49 . \n surprisingly , it has been found numerically that such transition from a high energy regime to a low energy one can be the responsible for the inflationary phase of the universe . \n given a potential @xmath50 , the slow - roll parameters @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the elko system were obtained in @xcite : @xmath53 @xmath54 and the condition to inflation occurs is @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in which follows it will set the initial conditions and values of the parameters in order to make a numerical analysis of the system . \n in order to perform a numerical analysis for the evolution of the scale factor @xmath7 and @xmath39 it was chosen to work with the coupled equations ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ phielko ] ) . \n it is also necessary to fix some parameters of the potential ( [ potential ] ) and initial conditions satisfying the slow - roll conditions ( [ eqvl])-([eqvll ] ) . \n since that ( [ h2 ] ) is a first order differential equation in @xmath7 it needs just one initial condition at @xmath57 , and it was chosen @xmath58 . \n equation ( [ phielko ] ) is a second order differential equation and needs two initial conditions . in order to test the hypothesis that inflation occurs due to a transition of the elko field from a high energy scale @xmath48 to a low energy regime @xmath49 , it was chosen @xmath59s@xmath60 , similar to chaotic inflationary model by linde @xcite . \n the inflation must occur when @xmath39 decay from @xmath61 to zero , at the bottom of the potential . \n it has been also considered that before inflation occurs the universe was filled with a nearly homogeneous and isotropic gas of elko particles , nearly at rest , so it was chosen @xmath62 . \n thus the unique energy present at the beginning is its potential energy @xmath63 . \n after some numerical analysis it was found that the beginning of the evolution , namely the phase that includes the inflation , can be driving just by the self - interacting quartic term of the potential if @xmath64 , which is obvious since that it is proportional to @xmath65 while the mass term is proportional to @xmath66 and the initial condition for @xmath67 is nearly greater than the planck mass . by choosing @xmath68 \n the condition for the mass is @xmath69gev . \n it was chosen @xmath70gev so that it does not contribute to the evolution at the beginning . \n when the field decays below about @xmath71s@xmath60 the quadratic mass term starts to dominate . \n numerically this occurs at about @xmath72s , very far in the past . finally , the value for the constant @xmath35 of the potential was chosen as @xmath73 in the first analysis . \n having stated the initial conditions and the value of the parameters , the slow - roll parameters can be tested in order to warranty the inflationary phase to occur . \n the values are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are reasonable values lesser than @xmath76 . \n it is also important to satisfies the condition @xmath77 to warranty that the total energy of the field is below the planck scale , so that quantum effects are not present . \n such condition is satisfied due to tiny value of @xmath37 . \n now it is possible to make a numerical analysis of the system of equations ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ phielko ] ) . in order to have the time scale in seconds , \n it was used @xmath78gev@xmath79s . \n the initial time @xmath57 was chosen as @xmath80s . \n it is expected that inflation occurs up to about @xmath0s and after that the universe expand in a nearly power law in time . \n figure 1 contains the main result of the paper . \n the evolution of the scale factor @xmath7 with time ( in seconds ) for the above initial conditions and parameters of the potential shows that inflation in fact occurs up to about @xmath0s and the scale factor growth for about @xmath8 order of magnitude , which corresponds to about 99 e - foldings . \n after that the universe enters a power law evolution , which is indicated by the strait line in the logarithm scales . in a non - logarithm scales it was verified that the evolution is of the type @xmath81 . \n such behaviour was also observed in @xcite for the symmetry breaking potential . \n the reason is obvious . \n as the field rolls down to the bottom of the potential its values goes to zero , and the pressure of the field also goes to zero . \n so the elko field satisfies a dust equation of state type , exactly as desired for a dark matter fluid . \n thus the elko field act as a dark matter in the rest of the evolution of the universe for a long time . \n having nearly null kinetic energy the elko particles could be attracted to other local potentials , initiating the growth of small structures , as dark matter halos . \n remember that it is one the main characteristic of the elko field , a candidate to dark matter particle . \n the numerical analysis of the equation of state parameter @xmath82 also indicates that @xmath83 starts from @xmath25 then begins to oscillate around @xmath84 for the rest of its evolution . \n another very interesting and surprising results from the figure 1 is that today , when @xmath85s , the scale factor growth to about @xmath86 , in a good accord to the previous estimate from @xcite of about @xmath9 for the standard model . \n the numerical analysis was done and is represented by the solid line , while the continuation of the strait line was extrapolated due to a very long time of computations after about @xmath87s . \n nevertheless , it is obvious that such extrapolation can be done , since that the model has no other kind of particle present to dominate in other phases . \n + ( a)(b )    figure 2 ( a ) shows the numerical results for the decaying of the elko field @xmath39 from its initial value @xmath88 . before reach the bottom of the potential the field oscillates for a long time around its minimal value . \n figure 2 ( b ) shows in detail just the inflationary phase , showing a strong dependence with the initial value @xmath61 of the field . \n the other parameters are the same of previous analysis . \n it is possible to see clearly that the number of e - foldings of the inflation is strongly dependent on the initial condition for the field . \n this is a kind of fine tuning for the model . \n the numerical analysis of the coupled system of equations concerning a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of elko fields filling the whole universe was performed . \n the potential under which the elko field slows down is a quadratic mass term and a quartic self - interaction on the field . \n it was found that the evolution for the scale factor reproduces the expected exponential growth during the inflationary epoch up to about @xmath0s driven just by the self - interaction term of the potential , and after inflation the universe evolves dominated by a dark matter fluid of elko particles with nearly zero kinetic and potential energy . \n this opens the possibility to the elko field be attracted to other local potentials and start to form the first structures of the universe , contributing to dark matter haloes for instance . \n notice from figure 1 and figure 2 ( a ) that inflation occurs exactly when the field goes from @xmath61 to zero . \n as the field decays to the bottom of its potential it starts to oscillate and its amplitude diminishes with time . \n the growth of the scale factor up today can be extrapolated from the numerical analysis into figure 1 and it was found that today the scale factor is about @xmath86 order of magnitude greater than its initial value . \n it is in good accord to an estimate of about @xmath9 for the standard model of cosmology . \n certainly the difference is due to the fact that here it has been considered the elko as the only particle , not including radiation and baryonic matter . \n a more complete model must also include such particles as well .    in this analysis \n the mass of the elko field was taken as @xmath89gev and its effects during the inflationary phase is not important , thus the mass of the elko field must be estimated by others observational constraints , as when starting to form structures for instance . \n it was also obtained ( figure 2 ( b ) ) that the number of e - foldings during the inflationary phase is strongly dependent on the initial value of the field , here taken as @xmath90 , as occurs in chaotic inflationary models .    in order to also address the problem of recent cosmic acceleration , the constant term of potential , namely @xmath35 , \n must be taking as non null , exactly as a cosmological constant term . \n thus , all phases of evolution of the universe can be obtained in a very elegant way by the dynamic evolution of the mass dimension one elko field in a frw background . \n shp is grateful to cnpq -

dimensional supergravity has been investigated in various situations intensively . \n as particular examples , the non - linear sigma models coupled to @xmath2-extended supergravity were studied  @xcite . \n the geometry of the target manifolds parametrized by scalar fields were classified completely : the target space is riemanian , khler , and quaternionic for @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . \n for @xmath5 it generally decomposes into two separate quaternionic spaces , associated with inequivalent supermultiplets . for @xmath6 \n there is a symmetric space for any given number of supermultiplets . for @xmath7 and @xmath8 \n there are only theories based on a single supermultiplet associated with coset spaces with the exceptional isometry groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .    moreover , the three - dimensional maximal ( @xmath11 gauged supergravity were constructed  @xcite . the duality relation between the gauge fields and the scalar field plays an important role in the derivation of the ungauged @xmath12 supergravity : in order to expose its global @xmath13 isometry , all vector fields obtained by dimensional reduction of the @xmath14 supergravity in an eight - torus must be dualized into the scalar fields . \n moreover , in order for the supergravity to gauge , the chern - simons term ( rather than the yang - mills term ) must be required in the lagrangian . \n recently the supersymmetric vortex solutions in @xmath0-gauged @xmath15 supergravity whose scalar sector is an arbitrary khler manifold with @xmath0 isometry were constructed  @xcite . \n it has been found that the einstein equations and the matter field equations of the model can be recast into a set of self -

simons terms , give rise to extra terms in supersymmetry transformations . in order to compensate these terms , \n the extra yukawa - type bilinear fermionic terms and a scalar potential must be added to the lagrangian \n .    then the bosonic parts of the @xmath0-gauged @xmath16 , @xmath1 supergarvity lagrangian is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a covariant derivative and @xmath30 denotes the khler metric @xmath31 . \n @xmath32 is an abelian field strength and @xmath27 is a gauge coupling constant . \n @xmath33 is a real scalar potential , which will be mentioned in the next section . \n we restrict ourselves to the simple case of the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) considered in the preceding section . \n we adopt a single complex scalar field case , that is @xmath34 . \n moreover we assume that the @xmath35 is a function of @xmath36 only and the khler potential is @xmath37 in order to obtain the canonical kinetic term for the scalar field . \n we thus find that the @xmath38 is unity . \n then , the eighth - order scalar potential is reduced to : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary real constant parameters . \n we assume the three - dimensional metric for a circularly symmetric spacetimes as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only .    for the single complex scalar field , we also assume the following dependence on the coordinates : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only and @xmath49 is a constant . \n we impose the boundary condition that @xmath50 approaches zero when the radial coordinate @xmath46 is taken to infinity , in order to obtain the non - topological soliton .    for the vector field @xmath51 , we choose the gauge , in order to require finite energy solution for the scalar field at radial infinity , in which @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only .    varying the lagrangian with respect to the gauge field , the scalar field and the metric yields equations of motion . \n the equation of motion for the chern -

topological solitions in three - dimensional @xmath0-gauged @xmath64@xmath65 supergravity . \n the non - topological soliton does not preserve the supersymmetry , in general , because the metric is described by the btz solution at radial infinity . \n we have found that the region of the solutions can exist for the non - topological solitons in fig .  1 , shown with the btz mass @xmath66 , the angular momentum @xmath67 and the magnetic flux @xmath68 for various values of the cosmological constant @xmath60 . in fig .  2 , we find two branches in a sequence of the solutions which are obtained numerically by the different conditions ( values of the scalar field and the vector field at the origin ) . \n one branch is the solutions from the origin to the maximal value of the @xmath66 , the other is from the point @xmath69 to the maximal value . as studied in  @xcite , one can also compare the results with black hole physics . in the case of the black hole \n , it is known that a black hole with a larger angular momentum than the critical one has a naked singularity and can not be the usual black hole . \n moreover there is the relation @xmath70 which is satisfied by the extreme black hole . \n if the non - topological soliton becomes a black hole , the soliton with @xmath71 can become the usual black hole . \n the non - topological soliton with @xmath72 can not be the usual black hole and the soliton with a large mass can certainly become an extreme black hole . \n thus , the region of the solutions for the non - topological solitons is plausible as self - gravitating systems because all of the maximal values for the soliton s mass exist in the area @xmath71 . in fig  3 , \n if we fit the plotted line with a solid line , one can find that the @xmath67 is proportional to the square of the @xmath68 . \n this is the same results as in the minkowski space - time case , as known in  @xcite . \n therefore , the relation between the angular momentum and the magnetic flux is not dependent of the cosmological constant . \n there is a phase transition point between the symmetric and the asymmetric phase in the abelian chern - simons higgs model in minkowski space - times . on the other hands , in the @xmath0-gauged @xmath64@xmath65 supergravity \n , differed from the usual phase transition , there is not a non - topological soliton in the transition point because the metric approaches asymptotically anti de - sitter space - time \n . it may be crucial in cosmological situation though this model has still three - dimensions .    in the present paper , \n we have treated the soliton with zero - winding number case , i.e. @xmath73 only . \n we will further investigate the binding energy , the stability of the soliton . \n the authors would like to thank n.  kan for useful advice . \n m.  baados , c.  teitelboim and j.  zanelli , phys .  rev \n .  lett .  * 69 * , 1849 ( 1992 ) ; m.  baados , m.  henneaux , c.  teitelboim and j.  zanelli , phys .  rev .  * \n d48 * , 1506 ( 1993 ) . for a review of btz black holes , s.  carlip , class . \n * 12 * , 2853 ( 1995 ) gr -

{"ContextTokens": 3921, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "the majority of large  disks studied to date are warped : the plane of the gas tilts as a function of galactocentric radius ( bosma 1991 ) . \n furthermore , there are regularities to this warping : the inner parts of the disk ( typically within @xmath0 ) are coplanar , then between this radius and the holmberg radius the disk often warps with a common line of nodes , and then at yet larger radii the line of nodes tends to form a leading spiral ( briggs 1990 ) . \n the  layer of the milky way is known to be warped as well : while its amplitude is small ( ca . \n 5@xmath1 maximum tilt , burton 1988 ) , it follows the same pattern out to a radius of 1.5@xmath2 . at larger radii \n , however , the plane is no longer simply tilted , but distorted : the outermost  in the milky way disk is displaced towards the ngp by about 1kpc . \n several other examples of regular and irregular warps exist .    as with spiral structure , warps present a winding problem : because of differential precession of bending wave packets at different radii , large - scale bending waves in a galaxy disk will soon wind up , in conflict with the observed straight line of nodes for the inner regions of the disk . in this case , also , self - gravity of the disk has been invoked as a mechanism for halting the differential winding . \n sparke & casertano ( 1988 ) , building on the work of hunter & toomre ( 1969 ) , showed that a disk in the equator of a flattened halo could support standing bending waves provided the disk was not too extended , or the halo too flattened . \n [ isolated cold disks are not able to support such waves : unless the disk surface density @xmath3 is truncated at the outer edge of the disk such that @xmath4 with @xmath5 , bending waves will slow down and dissipate before reaching the edge and being able to reflect off it . ] \n the sparke & casertano modes are large - scale , global modes of the disk , which makes it instructive to step away from the local wkb approximation and to consider the dynamics of the entire system . \n this can be done most easily by considering a galactic disk as consisting of a collection of concentric spinning rings , able to tilt with respect to each other , and moving in the combined gravity field of the other rings and a surrounding massive halo . \n it can be shown that a set of stars on initially circular orbits behaves in the same way as such a ring under the action of torques . \n such a system is clearly in equilibrium when all the rings are co - planar , and moreover , if the halo is spherical , a new equilibrium is obtained when all rings are tilted through the same angle . \n sparke & casertano recognised the normal modes they calculated as a continuation of this trivial mode to non - spherical halos . \n the halo exerts a net torque on the disk once it is tilted , causing an overall precession of the spin axis of the disk ; and by allowing the disk to warp , the precession speeds of the rings can all be adjusted to that same common value . \n [ rings which would naturally precess more slowly than the overall pattern need to be further from the halo equator , so that the torque on them can be augmented by the gravity of the remaining , less - inclined parts of the disk . ] \n the precession speed @xmath6 of the pattern is also simply obtained as the ratio of the torque exerted by the halo ( with circular & vertical frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) to the spin of the disk ( given by the total angular velocity of the disk matter @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 the numerator in this expression is the overall torque from the halo experienced by the disk if it is inclined by unit angle , and the denominator the torque exerted by the coriolis force in the frame rotating with the precession frequency of the mode @xmath6 . \n the balance as a function of radius of the coriolis and halo torques determines the shape of the warped equilibrium . \n if the coriolis torque dominates over most of the disk , the warp will be away from the halo equatorial plane ( type  i in sc s notation ) , otherwise the outer parts of the disk will warp down towards the halo equator ( type  ii ) . \n the linear analysis of sparke & casertano can be extended to non - linear tilt amplitudes ( kuijken 1991 ) : such calculations reveal that realistic amplitudes can indeed be attained with models of this kind , though the maximum amplitude of the type  i warps is rather small . \n a possible worry ( toomre 1983 ; binney 1992 ) is that the halo has been assumed to be a fixed potential bath for the disk to precess in . \n at least , this assumption violates conservation of angular momentum of the system as a whole , unless the halo is considered to have an infinite moment of inertia . \n more crucially , if real dark halos are stellar dynamical entities , they will respond to gravitational fields on dynamical time scales , and in particular the central regions of a halo may be expected to respond to the disk precessing through it . \n typical precession speeds for a sc normal mode are @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the circular speed and half - mass radius of the disk and @xmath14 is the flattening of the halo potential ; for typical halo flattenings of 0.1 ( much smaller amplitudes will not generate warps of the observed amplitudes ) the precession of the disk might be expected to provoke a significant response of the dark halo at radii inside @xmath15 . \n the importance of this back - reaction may be assessed in two ways : either by considering the effect of the precessing disk on halo orbits , from which a first - order halo over - density ( and hence the gravitational effect of this over - density , or wake , on the disk precession ) can be derived ; or from numerical simulations , which give fully self - consistent , but less general , results . \n the first approach has been taken by nelson & tremaine ( 1995 ) , and the second approach by dubinski & kuijken ( 1995 ) . \n results agree : the effects of halo response to the disk precession are _ strong _ , operating on the dynamical time - scale of the halo . as a consequence \n , halos can not be viewed as rigid background sources for a torque , but it is essential to view the disk - halo system as one , coupled , whole .    a representative numerical simulation of the evolution of a tilted , precessing disk in a flattened halo is illistrated in figure  [ fig - nbody ] . even though initially the precession is set to agree with the sc formula \n , the halo responds quickly to the misaligned disk , and the inclination of the disk with respect to the halo decays before the disk has been able to complete a single precession . since dynamical times are longest in the outer parts of the system , the disk - halo alignment spreads outwards , completing on ca . 3 local orbital times . \n responsive dark halos appear unable to support the warp modes envisaged by sc . \n inaccuracies in the n - body simulations are not the cause of this finding : when the disk particles are replaced by a solid , spinning disk whose dynamics are followed with the euler equations the same result is found , whereas keeping the halo particles fixed in space and only allowing the disk particles to evolve in the passive halo yields the long - lived normal mode predicted by sc . \n nelson & tremaine ( 1995 ) derive slightly longer time - scales from their analytic work , presumably because the self - gravity of the halo response is not included in their calculations . \n their calculations also show that radially anisotropic velocity dispersion in the halo ( a plausible consequence of a collapse formation for the halo ) lead to faster damping than isotropic velocity ellipsoids . \n interestingly , they find that under certain circumstances bending can be excited rather than damped by the halo , on similarly short time - scales : this can occur when the halo is prolate ( i.e. the disk lies perpendicular to the longest halo axis ) , or the halo rotates retrograde to the disk . \n the prediction for excitation in counter - rotating halos has since been verified by dubinski & nelson ( in preparation ) with n - body simulations . in any case , only under very special circumstances can a misaligned , precessing disk survive for a large number of dynamical times in a dark halo . \n given the problems for the normal mode theory , we are still left lacking an explanation for this common phenomenon of disk warping . \n promising avenues to possible explanations include :      if isolated galaxies are unlikely to be able to sustain warps for very long , interaction with the environment perhaps offers a solution . in \n closed or critical - density universes , galaxies continue to accrete matter from ever - larger distances as time goes on . \n tidal torquing between different collapsing galaxies will give this infalling material some non - zero angular momentum , and as this material merges into the dark halo , the changing angular momentum will probably result in some realignment of the halo axes . the time - scale for this realignment \n is set by cosmology , and is probably close to the hubble time . \n how will a disk respond to such realignment ? \n if the disk were rigid , it would certainly change its orientation under the influence of the changing tidal halo field it was experiencing . in reality , disks are floppy , with different natural precession frequencies at different radii , so this overall disk slewing will be accompanied generically by warping .      the energy associated with a warp mode excited to realistic amplitude is found to be comparable to the orbital energy of a massive globular cluster in the halo . \n if there is sufficient time for equipartition to be established , and if the halo is dominated by object in this mass range , then statistical physics dictates that warps will have to be excited stochastically to observed amplitudes . \n the main argument against this possibility are the standard ones against halo objects of such high mass : they would also strongly heat the stellar disk . furthermore \n , if the microlensing results reported by freeman at this conference are to be believed , halo objects have much smaller masses . \n m.  weinberg recently showed that the resonant response of the milky way halo to the orbiting magellanic clouds raises sufficient tides in the halo to have a noticeable effect on the stellar disk ; moreover , it does not take excessively high estimates for the mass of the lmc to obtain the observed amplitude for the milky way s warp . \n this result highlights the importance of self - consistent treatment of the halo response to perturbations , and the strength of coupling of a wake raised at large radius to the inner regions of the halo . \n ( weinberg s model for the halo is a scalefree isothermal halo , but the same gravitational propagation of the response to smaller radii would be expected in other halo models too ) . as a ubiquitous explanation for warps , \n this work may be criticized on the grounds that not all warped galaxies have satellites as important as the lmc , and that while the warp of the milky way is rather low - amplitude compared to other examples , the mass of the lmc is quite possibly lower than assumed by weinberg s calculations . \n nevertheless , this striking result is a vivid reminder of the importance of collective and resonant effects in galaxy interactions . \n = 7truecm    if not all warped galaxies have companions which may have distorted them , perhaps infrequent passages by other galaxies may raise sufficient tides in the halos to warp the disks noticeably . a very naive model ( see fig . \n [ fig - sketch ] ) shows that such an effect might be important : consider a galaxy as made up of a massive , spinning inner disk , and a surrounding dark halo which we here model as a rigid , possibly spinning , concentric ring surrounding it . \n if we now tidally perturb such a galaxy with a distant passage , what will happen to the system ? assuming all tilt angles are small , it is possible to show that the dynamics of symmetry axes of the disk and surrounding ` halo ' are governed by the equations @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the orientations of the polar axis of the disk and halo , where @xmath19 , etc.for spherical polar coordinates @xmath20 . \n the coefficient @xmath21 expresses the gravitational coupling between the halo and the disk , @xmath22 is the strength of the tidal torque ( the perturber is assumed to move uniformly along the @xmath23-axis ) , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the moments of inertia of disk and ` halo ' .    in the absence of the halo ( @xmath26 ) , the disk will respond to the tidal field , and execute a small precessing motion . after the passage is over , \n overall energy and angular momentum conservation of the disk return it in its original state . \n [ a real disk would warp during the reaction to the tidal field , but eventually the bending waves would dissipate and the disk would return to its original orientation . \n ] however , if we include the coupling between the disk and the halo , the result becomes very different . \n the halo , having a larger radius and a smaller spin than the disk , responds more strongly to the tidal field than the disk . as it tilts , however , it exerts its own tidal field on the disk , and , because of the halo s proximity to the disk , this field is stronger than the external one . \n the net result is that the halo mediates the external field , and transmits it onto the disk more strongly than the original one . \n depending on the rotation of the halo , this response is stronger or weaker : simple numerical experiments with equations ( [ eq - tilts ] ) show that a factor of five enhancement is not difficult to attain ( fig . \n [ fig - response ] ) . \n =    less drastically simplified models of the halo give comparable results ( lynden - bell 1985 ;

dubinski & kuijken 1995 ) , leaving us to search for other possibilities . \n perhaps the answer lies in magnetic generation of warps ( battaner et al . , \n 1990 ; see binney 1991 for a critical discussion of this possibility ) , but other gravitational possibilities remain . in this article \n , i have tried to stress the point that the dark halo should be considered an integral , dynamical part of the galaxy , rather than just a potential energy bath . with the discovery by weinberg ( 1994 ) that spherical models can undergo very weakly damped modes \n , goes the implication that once disturbed , halos can ring for a large number of dynamical times , forcing oscillations and warps in embedded galaxy disks . combined with the enhanced excitation of tides on the disk by the halo , \n perhaps most galaxy warps are such weakly - damped , tidally induced ringing ? \n we still lack a clear observational study of the statistics of warps . \n in particular , it would be good to know how regular warps are , if there is any relation between warps and bars , warps and lopsidedness , kinematic peculiarities and warps , links with environment , etc . on \n the theoretical side , simulations of some of the suggested scenarios would be very useful : in particular , the details of the response of the halo , and hence the disk , to secondary infall are difficult to predict and would benefit from such a study . \n battaner , e. , florido , e. & sanchez - saavedra , m. l. 1990 , a&a 236 , 1 binney , j. 1991 , in dynamics of disk galaxies , b.sundelius , ed . \n ( gteborg ) , 297 binney , j. 1992 , , 30 , 51 bosma , a. 1991 , in warped disks and inclined rings around galaxies , s. casertano , p.d.sackett & f.h.briggs , eds . \n ( cambridge university press ) , 181 briggs , f.h . \n 1990 , , 352 , 15 burton , w.b . \n 1988 , in galactic and extragalactic radio astronomy , g.l.verschuur & k.i.kellerman ( springer : heidelberg ) , 295 dekel , a. & shlosman , i. 1983 , in internal kinematics and dynamics of galaxies , e. athanassoula , ed . \n ( reidel : dordrecht ) , 187 dubinski , j. & kuijken , k. 1995 , , 442 , 492 hunter , c. & toomre , a. 1969 , , 155 , 747 kuijken , k. 1991 , , 376 , 467 lynden - bell , d. 1985 , in the milky way galaxy , ed . h. van woerden ( dordrecht : reidel ) , 461 nelson , r.w . & tremaine , s. 1995 , , 275 , 897 nelson , r.w . & tremaine , s.d . \n 1996 , in gravitational dynamics , o. lahav , e. terlevich & r.j . \n terlevich , eds . \n ( cambridge university press ) , 73 ostriker , e.c . & binney , j. 1989 , , 237 , 785 sparke , l. & casertano , s. 1988 , , 234 , 873 toomre , a. 1983 , in internal kinematics and dynamics of galaxies , e. athanassoula , ed . \n ( reidel : dordrecht ) , 177 weinberg , m.d . \n 1994 , , 421 , 481 weinberg , m.d . \n 1995 , , 455 , l31", "StartTimeOffset": 1497169880916, "RequestID": "8606c7784b5108f8400b044dabb392052c0563a5", "TotalTokens": 4038}
{"ContextTokens": 2977, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "many advantages are present when going in space . \n the most exploited one has been the access to wavelengths not transmitted through the atmosphere . for photometry near the visible part of the spectrum \n , there are many benefiting aspects : no atmosphere means no absorption bands of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , no scintillation , no emission or diffusion from the sky ( dark sky ) , no variable extinction . furthermore depending on the satellite orbit , it may be possible to make long continuous monitorings ( however eclipses by the moon or the earth may occur ) or to make a global sky coverage .    as a comparative example , the corot team ( see section  6 ) studied fictive earth projects ( cf . \n baglin 1997a ) and showed that even an immoderate project of 8 8m - class telescopes disseminated around the earth would not surpass their small space mission . \n the drawbacks of space projects are their complexity , cost , aging , limited operation time , and many technical constraints . \n space missions are fragile on technical and also political point of views . \n the global budgets of esa and nasa in local currencies have been relatively flat for about 8 years , but they may be subjected to high volatility according to changes in the policy . \n three main types of missions will be presented : one performing astrometry , one oriented towards asteroseismology and one aiming at detecting telluric planets . \n many of these projects lead to massive photometric surveys and have thus very valuable scientific returns as discussed by paczyski ( 1997 ) . then , an overview of the distinctive features of some specific satellites will be given . \n after the pioneering mission hipparcos , projects performing astrometric measurements are flourishing . \n thanks to the advance of technology ( ccd , interferometry ) , the jump in astrometric precision is of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , thus making a new mission very attractive . \n the accuracies reached by these projects are now labeled in @xmath2as ( micro arcsec ) , cf . \n table  1 . \n the interest for variable stars is threefold . \n first , several proposed missions are scanning the whole sky and performing photometry . \n they will thus give , as hipparcos did , huge amounts of photometric measurements , achieving magnitude completeness . \n as the scanning law is optimised for the astrometric purpose , the time series have a semi - regular sampling which produce aliasing . \n second , the information of parallax is a stringent constraint for testing stellar models when used in asteroseismology ( cf . \n baglin 1997b , favata 1999 ) . in the case of hipparcos for instance , \n matthews et al . ( 1999 ) showed a comparison of asteroseismologic parallax versus trigonometric parallax . on an other hand , \n absolute luminosities or masses derived from parallaxes can be used as starting point of the seismologic models . \n third , parallaxes are also of primordial importance for calibrating distance indicators as cepheids , rr lyrae and miras . \n all the presented missions will literally pin down many of these objects . \n .summary of several experiments performing astrometry . \n mag is the magnitude range or limiting magnitude , n the number of measured stars in million , @xmath3 the astrometric precision in @xmath2as at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the date for realisation decision ( month / year ) , @xmath7 is the year of the launch . [ \n cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      several unsuccessful attempts have been made to measure solar - like oscillations from earth , for such measurements the precision in luminosity determination to be reached is as high as few ppm , furthermore high frequency resolution is required which imposes very long continuous monitoring . as previously remarked , \n the scintillation is a limiting factor which is magnitude independent as long as photon noise is not dominating . with space missions \n these requirements can be reached .      among several methods to detect planets , the most famous is the measurement of the periodic variation in radial velocity that a planet induces on its host star . \n another promising technique , shown to be more appropriate for the discovery of telluric planets , is the detection of the luminosity decrease during an eclipsing transit of the planet . in this case \n , the system planet - star should be in a favorable configuration for the observer . \n thus large numbers of stars must be observed to achieve valuable statistics . \n the goal of the gaia ( `` http://astro.estec.esa.nl/sa-general/projects/gaia/ ) satellite is to describe our galaxy and its history by making an inventory of 1% of its stars ( down to magnitude v=20 ) in terms of their kinematical and physical properties . \n however , the impact of gaia will go well beyond gaining knowledge of the galaxy , it will infiltrate many domains of astronomy such as stellar astronomy , general relativity and cosmology . \n gaia should not be seen merely as a super - hipparcos ; it has several instruments among them one is performing astrometry reaching the precision of 4 @xmath2as for magnitude @xmath8 and 10 @xmath2as for magnitude @xmath5 . \n these measurements lead to parallaxes and proper motions . on board \n , gaia has a spectrometer which measures radial velocities ( with precision of 3 - 10 km / s for @xmath9 ) to complete the 3-dim velocity field . \n a provisional 11 intermediate band photometric system was specially designed in order to determine the temperature , gravity and metallicity of the observed stars . \n gaia will produce photometric time series of about 100 measurements spread over 5 years . \n the precision is magnitude dependent ( cf . \n grenon et al . \n 1999 ) and for a single transit is of the order of 0.05 mag at @xmath10 in the band f51 ( centered at 570 nm and of 90 nm width ) . \n the time sampling is semi - regular as a result of the scanning law of the satellite . \n eyer & cuypers ( these proceedings ) are studying the expectation for variable star numbers . \n although the estimations are at preliminary stages , gaia might detect a few thousand cepheids and about 90000 rr lyrae . \n gaia will permit to study star pulsations in terms of the physical parameters , especially the metallicity . \n fame ( `` http://aa.usno.navy.mil/fame/ ) stands for full - sky astrometric mapping explorer . \n fame will observe 40 million stars and will perform a galactic survey magnitude complete up to @xmath5 . \n the astrometric precision will be @xmath11 50 @xmath2as for mag @xmath12 and @xmath11 500 @xmath2as for mag @xmath13 . \n it will collect photometric measurements in four bands of the sloan system ( fukugita et al . \n the announced precision of the photometry is 1.6  mmag for mag 9 and 25  mmag for mag 15 in the astrometric filter . \n the scanning law will determine the time sampling . \n the rotation period of the satellite is 40 minutes , the length of the mission is 2 years and a half . \n the satellite will furnish thousands of measurement per star , with a semi - regular sampling grouped in sequences of 9 - 31 - 9 etc minutes . \n the diva ( ` http://www.aip.de/groups/diva/ ` , double interferometer for visual astrometry ) satellite is a project of the german space agency ( dlr ) . \n diva will reach an astrometric precision of 150 @xmath2as at @xmath4 and 5 mas at @xmath5 . \n diva will have broad - band and narrow - band systems . \n the photometric precision is under study . \n the scanning law is very similar to the hipparcos one , with a rotation period of 2 hours . \n the corot ( ` http://www.astrsp-mrs.fr/www/pagecorot.html ` , convection and rotation ) satellite has two major goals , first it was designed for doing asteroseismology , focussing on 5 principal fields for very precise and continuous monitoring of 5 months each . \n the noise level is 0.6 ppm for g type stars over 5 days . \n the long time base makes possible a high accuracy on frequencies determination ( 0.1 @xmath2hz ) necessary for the detailed seismic investigation of the stellar structure proposed for corot . \n a planet detection program using the transit method was added , this other goal has to survey large sample of stars ( 30  000 to 60  000 ) with a photometric precision of 0.1  % for 16 minutes of integration time in order to detect telluric planets . \n this survey is achieved in dense fields down to mag 15 . \n two - color information will be available for @xmath14 1/3 of the targets to establish the achromaticity of the phenomenon . \n there is also an exploratory program where corot will measure 50 to 80 solar - like stars with @xmath15 at a precision better than 2.4  ppm . \n mons ( ` http://www.obs.aau.dk/mons/ ` , measuring oscillation in nearby stars ) is a project of the danish small satellite program , which already launched one successful satellite ( rsted ) . \n mons will observe about 20 solar - like stars over two years as a primary scientific objective ; it will also measure @xmath16 scuti , roap stars and samples of stars of all types as a secondary objective . \n its eccentric orbit with high apogee ( molniya orbit ) permits access to a large part of the sky \n . it will measure changes in colour ratio . \n oscillations of amplitude of 1 - 10 ppm will be detected ( cf . \n kjeldsen et al . \n furthermore , mons will obtain science data from the star imagers designed for attitude control ; they will permit measurement of about 900 stars , 700 in with the imager si 1 , and 200 with the imager si 2 \n . the accuracy will be about 11 ppm ( si 1 ) and 26 ppm ( si 2 ) at magnitude @xmath17 . \n most ( ` http://www.astro.ubc.ca/most/ ` , microvariability and oscillations of stars ) is a funded project which is the first satellite of the canadian space agency \n . most will observe several ( 3 - 5 ) solar - like stars over 40 days . \n it will also observe roap , wolf - rayet and @xmath16 scuti stars . \n the photometric precision for a @xmath17 star is better than a few ppm for 10 days of integration . \n although the kepler project ( ` http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/ ` ) was not selected due to questions about the ability to perform the photometry in space , the scientific case was rated very highly . \n the kepler team is planning to resubmit the project . \n its goal is to `` explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems '' by performing differential photometry . \n it will monitor 100000 main - sequence stars in the magnitude range from 9th to 14th with an accuracy of 0.002  % including instrument noise , shot noise and stellar variability for a star of @xmath8 . \n the mission would point continuously at a single field in cygnus during 4 years . because only data for preselected stars are saved , all objects to be monitor must be pre - specified . \n the team will probably entertain `` guest observing '' for additional interesting objects like variable stars . \n a subset of a few hundred brighter stars will also be incorporated and observed with a shorter integration time for asteroseismological purposes . \n many of these projects might be selected in a near future for their realisation . \n the projects performing astrometry will provide deep galactic surveys and thus an inventory for galactic variable stars . \n the asteroseismological projects have common goals but they use different ingenious techniques and have different and diverse by - products .    the future spatial projects will open new domains in variable star studies , therefore precise predictions are delicate . since some presented missions are already funded , there is the conviction that after the projects like hipparcos or the microlensing surveys , the domain of variable stars will still be under a strong evolution . \n baglin , a. 1997a , cnes , cor - sp-0 - 83-proj baglin , a. 1997b , in the first results of hipparcos and tycho ( jd 14 of the xxiii general assembly of the iau ) , ed . c. turon , 555 grenon , m. , jordi , c. , figueras , f. , torra , j. 1999 , to be published favata , f. 1998 , in the first mons workshop : science with a small space telescope , eds . h. kjeldsen , t.r . bedding , 89 fukugita , m. , hichikawa , t. , gunn , j.e . , doi , m. , shimasaku , k. , schneider , d.p . \n 1996 , 111 , 1748 kjeldsen , h. , bedding , t.r . , christensen - dalsgaard , j. 1999 , document no . \n mons-99/01 matthews , kurtz , d. , & martinez , p. 1999 , 511 , 422 paczyski b. 1997 , in variables stars and the astrophysical returns of the microlensing surveys ( 12th iap astrophysics colloquium ) , eds . \n r. ferlet , j .- \n maillard & b. raban , editions frontires , 357", "StartTimeOffset": 1503010078098, "RequestID": "445325338759722b1355238a5b5bbd1ac5064152", "TotalTokens": 3119}

qubit logic gates and one - qubit local operations universal . \n the standard paradigm of quantum computation is the dynamical one where the local interactions between the qubits are controlled in such a way so that one can enact a sequence of quantum gates . on the other hand \n , it has been recognized that the quantum gate operations can also be implemented through the geometric effects on the wave function of the systems , this is the so - called geometric quantum computation @xcite . \n compared with the dynamical gates , the geometric quantum computation possesses practical advantages . \n it is well known that geometric phases depend only on some global geometric features , and do not depend on the details of the path , the time spent , the driving hamiltonian , and the initial and final states of the evolution @xcite . \n therefore the geometric quantum computation is largely insensitive to local inaccuracies and fluctuations , and thus provides us a possible way to achieve fault - tolerant quantum gates .    in the implementation of geometric quantum computation , \n one practical question we usually meet is how to remove or avoid the dynamical phases since geometric phases are generally accompanied by dynamical ones which are not robust against local inaccuracies and fluctuations . to this end \n one simple method is to choose the dark states as qubit space , thus the dynamical phase is always zero @xcite . \n another general method is to let the evolution be dragged by the hamiltonian along several special closed loops , then the dynamical phases accumulated in different loops may be canceled , with the geometric phases being added @xcite . \n this is the so -

waveguide structure .    to simulate the spectral response of the coupled cavity - waveguide structure , a gaussian source with frequency center 0.2980 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) and frequency width 0.02 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) \n is located at the left end of waveguide and the energy flux has been detected at the right end . shows the normalized transmission spectrum of the light . \n as waveguide mode frequencies are far away from the cavity resonant frequencies , light transmits from one end of the waveguide to another end with almost 100% transmission without any coupling with the cavity . when waveguide modes are resonant or nearly resonant with the cavity modes , light couples into the cavity resulting in dips in the transmission spectrum . \n three dips in the transmission spectrum in fig . \n 1(b ) correspond to three resonant modes of the h1 cavity . \n shows the z components of the magnetic fields of the cavity modes corresponding to the three dips in the transmission spectrum in . \n the mode of shows a hexapole mode corresponding to the dip denoted by _ \n while the modes of and ( c ) are nearly degenerate quadrupole modes for _ b _ and _ c _ in . \n the cavity mode field distributions indicate that the cavity couples with the waveguide via the evanescent field . \n the cavity resonance frequencies of , ( b ) and ( c ) are 0.2961 , 0.2996 and 0.3002 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) and the corresponding quality factors are 2890 , 5960 and 2770 , respectively . \n a cavity mode with low quality factor has a large coupling strength with the waveguide , thus a deeper dip appears in the transmission spectrum with a broad linewidth .      to realize fano resonance , partially reflecting elements are introduced into the coupled phc cavity - waveguide structure . \n two air hole barriers have been placed in the center of the waveguide , as shown in . \n the amplitude transmissivity @xmath5 is determined by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the resonant frequency of the cavity mode . \n @xmath8 is the amplitude transmission coefficient of the partially reflecting elements . \n @xmath9 is the intrinsic cavity loss rate . \n @xmath10 is the cavity decay rate due to coupling into one port of the waveguide . when there is no partially reflecting elements existing ( @xmath11 ) , the transmission line shape is lorentzian symmetric . when @xmath12 , the light from the incoming port of waveguide to the outgoing port has two pathways . \n one with light transmitting through the cavity provides discrete modes , and the other with light passing through the partially reflecting elements gives rise to continuum modes . \n the constructive and destructive interferences between these modes induce an asymmetric fano type transmission line shape . \n the amplitude transmission coefficient @xmath8 determines whether the transmission line shape is symmetric lorentzian type or asymmetric fano type . \n the simulated and normalized transmission spectrum is shown in . \n two fano type peaks are observed in the spectrum . \n when the waveguide modes are non - resonant with the cavity modes , the light can not be coupled into the cavity and is reflected mostly by the two air hole barriers . \n the light with the cavity mode frequency can couple into the cavity and transmit to the other port of the waveguide . \n therefore , fano type peaks appear in the transmission spectrum . \n the simulated cavity mode distributions show that , there are three cavity modes in the frequency range of the transmission spectrum in . \n the z components of the magnetic fields of the three modes are shown in , ( b ) and ( c ) . \n the cavity resonance frequencies of the three modes are 0.2956 , 0.2998 and 0.2998 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) and the corresponding quality factors are 1830 , 2980 and 4570 , respectively . \n the resonant frequencies of cavity modes in and ( c ) are so close that the cavity modes can not be distinguished in the transmission spectrum in \n .      the asymmetric and steep line shape of fano resonance is beneficial for optical switches and optical sensors . \n the steep line shape of fano resonance can significantly reduce the frequency shift required for on / off switching . \n optical sensors with high sensitivity can be constructed based on the spectral shift associated with asymmetric line shapes . \n recently , investigations have been performed to enhance the fano resonance . \n @xcite reported that the fano resonance can be modified by adjusting the partially reflecting elements . in this work , \n we introduce gain material into the phc cavity to enhance the fano resonance .    in the two dimensional phc slab structure , \n it is straightforward to couple quantum dots into a cavity @xcite , with which the optical gain can be obtained by pumping the quantum dot either optically or electrically . as the quantum dot transition and the cavity mode \n are tuned into resonance , the loss of the cavity mode is compensated by the photons emitted by the quantum dot , resulting in increasing of the quality factor of the cavity mode . to simulate the gain supplied by quantum dot , we consider the material structure in maxwell s equations which is determined by the relative permittivity @xmath13 . \n it should be noted that @xmath14 does not depend only on position , but also on frequency ( material dispersion ) , electric field ( nonlinearity ) , and the orientation of the field ( anisotropy ) @xcite . material dispersion is generally associated with absorption loss or gain in the material , which is given by the following expression : @xmath15 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the instantaneous dielectric function , @xmath17 is the electric conductivity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are user - specified constants , and @xmath20 is a user - specified function of position giving the strength of the _ n_-th resonance . \n note that the imaginary part of @xmath14 can be expressed by conductivity @xmath17 as @xmath21 . here , we only consider the absorption loss or gain in a narrow bandwidth , thus the imaginary part of @xmath14 can be set to some known experimental value , and a dispersionless real part of @xmath14 can be set with a value in our bandwidth of interest . in fdtd simulation , the imaginary part im@xmath22 is set by choosing the conductivity @xmath17 at our frequency @xmath23 of interest . \n the absorption loss ( gain ) in the material is associated with positive ( negative ) value of the imaginary part of @xmath14 . \n a series of negative values of im@xmath14 has been used to simulate the gain , which can be achieved by pumping quantum dot in the cavity .    in our coupled phc cavity - waveguide structure ( shown in ) , \n gain material is located at the center of the h1 cavity with a radius of 0.6 @xmath24 and thickness of 0.6 @xmath24 . \n the frequency @xmath23 is set around the resonant frequency of the degenerated quadrupole modes . \n the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the gain material introduced into the h1 cavity is set as -0.001 , -0.01 , -0.0135 and -0.01415 at frequency 0.2998 @xmath25 . \n the normalized transmission spectra are shown in . \n as the gain increases , the normalized transmissivity becomes larger and larger , and the linewidth of the transmission line shape becomes narrower . \n light trapped in the cavity is fed by the gain so that the light energy flux is enlarged . \n then the enlarged light energy flux is coupled into waveguide , resulting in enlarged transmissivity . without gain material in the cavity , \n the normalized transmissivity corresponding to the degenerated quadrupole modes is 0.246 . \n when gain material with im@xmath14=0.01415 is introduced into the cavity , the normalized transmissivity is 1.564 , which is about six times larger than that of the case without gain . \n it can be clearly seen that the line shapes become steeper as the gain increases .    with the coupled cavity - waveguide structure , we further analysed the transmission spectra in the cases with and without gain material in h1 cavity . with the same frequency shift , \n the transmission contrast with gain material is much larger than the case without the gain . \n the large transmission contrast with a small frequency shift is very promising for realizing optical switches @xcite . \n in addition , the resonant mode can be easily perturbed if there are nano - particles adhere to the h1 cavity , which gives a frequency shift in the transmission spectrum . \n the narrow and steep fano asymmetric transmission lineshape could make the coupled structure much more attractive as a nano - particle sensor @xcite . \n we have theoretically proposed that the fano resonance in a coupled phc cavity - wavegudie structure can be greatly enhanced when gain material is introduced into the cavity . \n the fano spectral line shape becomes steeper and steeper as the gain increases . \n with im@xmath26 the transmission is enhanced by six times in our case . the optical gain in the cavity supplies photons with frequency of the cavity mode . \n the supplied photons compensate the losses of cavity mode . as a result , \n the quality factor of the cavity mode is increased , corresponding to a narrower linewidth . the discrete cavity mode with narrower linewidth interferes with the continuum modes , generating a steeper fano asymmetric linedwidth . \n the doubly degenerate modes at 0.2998 @xmath25 are chosen to enhance fano asymmetric lineshape because the field of the degenerate modes distributes in a large volume in the cavity , which can enhance the gain . with the gain enhanced fano resonance , a large contrast can be achieved by only a small frequency shift , which could be useful in ultralow - energy and high - contrast optical switches . \n the steepened transmission line shape can be also sensitive to nano - particle adhering to the designed structures , which enables such coupled phc structure to be used as optical sensors . \n * acknowledgments * + this work was supported by the national basic research program of china under grant no . \n 2013cb328706 and 2014cb921003 ; the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . \n 91436101 , 11174356 and 61275060 ; the strategic priority research program of the chinese academy of sciences under grant no . \n xdb07030200 ; and the hundred talents program of the chinese academy of sciences .    * author contributions * + x.x . and k.j . \n conceived the project . \n y.z . designed the structure and carried out the calculations . \n , k.q . , j.t . \n , y.s . and x.x . \n discussed the results and the experimental implementations . \n y.z . and x.x . \n co -

collaborator has directly contributed software , all must use the software and help debug it . \n the current code set consists of tens of millions of mostly c++ code , organized into 294 packages . \n these packages are further organized into major reconstruction , simulation , and physics categories : tracking , calorimetry , muon , time of flight , luminosity counters , top , tau , electroweak , b physics , and infrastructure . at cdf \n the offline includes all of the software and computing need for the real time software trigger ( the level3 trigger ) , the online monitoring of the detector , the primary reconstruction , the detector simulation , physics group analysis software , tools such as the detector event display and software used to measure the performance of the above , such as tracking efficiency and purity . \n in 1996 when work on the run 2 offline started , very few people at cdf knew c++ . \n the advantages of using a language that supported memory management was considered large enough to out way the cost of learning c++ . \n we claimed that we would start by writing all of the infrastructure code in c++ but still make provisions for the physics code to be written in f77 . \n people involved with the run 1 experiment wanted to reuse as much of the run 1 code as possible , so the code was wrapped into c callable routines and fed it s input data via the c++ infrastructure . \n output was in the form of arrays that were also managed by the infrastructure . \n as new people entered the project there was a desire to replace this code with algorithms written in c++ so that it would be maintainable . \n this happened for every subsystem until everything was c++ . \n the next generation of maintainers after this second round has not felt it necessary to rewrite everything . \n we now have people entering the project with prior c++ experience from other experiments . during the development of the code we never had enough people to work on all of the tasks \n we wanted done . \n strong leadership to prioritize during these early times was essential . at any one time we had about 6 to 10 highly productive developers , one per subsystem . \n the release schedule reflects the pace of development and managements decisions about how to best serve our users . \n our users were the detector commissioning physicists , and farm and data handling hardware developers . during the first year that we started making major releases , 1999 , there were 5 releases reflecting the difficulty of these first integrations . in 2000 and 2001 \n there were about 10 each year . \n this was our time of extreme programing . \n many of the major rewrites occurred at this time , including a change from a fortran array based edm ( event data model ) to a root based edm . at the same time \n the experiment was commissioning the detector and these customers required that we keep the code working for their use . \n for this reason many subsystem developers were maintaining two versions of the code for their system . \n one of the advantages of this situation was that both versions could be run to see if they resulted in the same answer . \n many bugs were discovered while investigating differing answers . some were in the c++ but \n some were found in the run1 fortran code as well . in 2002 \n there were about 5 releases . \n this reflected the need for stability in preparation for presenting physics results at the early 2003 winter conferences .      throughout the history of the project cdf was greatly aided by using the work of others outside of cdf . \n babar donated their framework , evtgen and ideas . \n the support of the root team especially phillippe canal was essential . \n many of the zoom / clhep classes we use were developed by those groups at our request . \n many of the classes in existence before cdf started developing c++ software were greatly improved in performance through collaboration with the supporters of clhep . \n unfortunately our compiler vendor , kai was also a collaborator in that we had to report bugs to them . despite this , \n the decision to use kai was not a bad one . \n it allowed us to write c++ standard code much earlier then we would otherwise have been able to . \n this has served us well in transitioning back to g++ now that kai is becoming unsupported . \n the most important step in creating stability and robustness in the software system was the development of rules and procedures . \n there are rules about how releases are put together and what can be integrated at different phases of the cycle . \n there are well defined procedures for validation and regression testing of all new releases . \n these are documented on the web and the manpower for doing these tasks comes from the collaboration as part of an offline shift . \n a shifter is given recipes for running purify , debuggers and software management tools as well as instructions for running the tests . \n monitoring the running of automated systems like the reconstruction farms is also part of the job . \n use of a bug tracking tool has also greatly aided in finding problems and documenting solutions for out users . \n the shifter can try to answer questions that are sent to the list , or forward them to the relevant system expert . \n here is a list of some of the things that were surprising and were learned over the course of the project :    * you never really understand a problem until it is solved once . \n the strategy of studying and recoding run 1 code in c++ for run 2 served us well in many areas of the project . \n * performance has not been a problem , wasteful copying was eliminated early in the development of the code and there are still gains that we can make . choosing efficient algorithms gains more performance the hand optimizing the code . * \n keep the system clean in terms of physical design and organization . \n physics analysis codes will follow the patterns of the reconstruction and be more generally usable if the reconstruction is kept clean . * \n a code browser is important for both the developers and users of the software system . * \n beware of code generation , it can produce code bloat if not done carefully . * \n memory leaks are supposed to be the biggest problem in large c++ systems , however for us uninitialized variables has been a bigger problem . \n memory leaks can be traced with standard tools . \n uninitialized memory reports from these same tools are too numerous to be useful . \n many of these reports are completely harmless and finding the bad ones buried underneath is very hard . \n we have had releases in which the farms operation of the reconstruction was tested to be 1 crash in a million events . \n the same exact code when recompiled with a shorter name for the file system it lived on crashed in less then a thousand events processed . \n this was traced to an error in using uninitialized memory . * start commissioning as early as possible . \n mock data challenges did nt completely prepare us for the turn on of real data . \n count on having to change things once you have really customers with real needs . \n * many people will leave the project one year after the first physics data arrives . \n if faced with the choice of two solutions to a problem always choose the most maintainable one . \n insure that there is sufficient overlap between the original developers of the code and the junior people who will take over the maintenance of it . \n the cdf offline software system was flexible and serviceable . \n it was able to help commission the detector even while it was undergoing large transitions to improved software . \n it helped take the data , reconstruct it , and perform the physics analysis on it in a timely manner .", "StartTimeOffset": 1526528071812, "RequestID": "e5a90c87a76cb45b6542027beee9eb7052155dbf", "TotalTokens": 1649}
{"ContextTokens": 3123, "GeneratedTokens": 258, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum mechanics gives the most accurate description of many physical systems of interest . in turn \n , the most accurate characterization of a quantum device is given by its quantum mechanical model . \n thus , efficient methods for the honest estimation of the distribution of parameters in a quantum mechanical model are of utmost importance , not only for building robust quantum technologies , but to reach new regimes of physics . \n bayesian experimental design ( see , e.g. @xcite ) is a methodology to ascertain the utility of a proposed experiment . \n bayesian experimental design has been successfully applied to problems in experimental physics , such as in the recent examples of @xcite and @xcite . in classical theories of physics and statistics , the measurement simply reveals the state of the system at that instant . \n by contrast , quantum theory presents with the following physical ( and conceptual ) barrier : no single measurement can reveal the state . \n rather , each potential kind of experiment admits a probability distribution from which we draw our data . \n thus , the methodology of experimental design seems tailor - made for quantum theory . \n the structure of the paper is as follows . \n we begin by reviewing the general outline of bayesian experimental design . \n we then apply the technique to devise an algorithm for the estimation of quantum hamiltonian parameters . \n we show that in a particular case , this strategy is nearly globally optimal and demonstrate its improvement over standard algorithms numerically . finally we conclude with a discussion on the applicability of this technique to real experiments on more complex quantum systems . \n we assume some initial experiment @xmath0 has been performed and data @xmath1 has been obtained . \n the goal is to determine @xmath2 , the probability distribution of the model parameters @xmath3 given the experimental data . to achieve this we use bayes rule @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the _ likelihood function _ , \n which is determined through the process of modeling the experiment , and @xmath6 is the _ prior _ , which encodes any _ a priori _ knowledge of the model parameters . \n the final term @xmath7 can simply be thought as a normalization factor .    at this stage \n we can stop or obtain further data . \n experimental design is well suited to quantum theory since an arbitrary fixed measurement procedure does not give maximal knowledge as is often assumed in the statistical modeling of classical system . \n we conceive , then , of possible future data @xmath8 obtained from a , possibly different , experiment @xmath9 . \n the probability of obtaining this data can be computed from the distributions at hand via marginalizing over model parameters @xmath10 we can use this distribution to calculate the expected _ utility _ of an experiment @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the utility we would derive if experiment @xmath9 gave result @xmath8 . \n this could in principle be any function tailored to the specific problem . \n however , for scientific inference , a generally well motivated measure of utility is _ information gain _ @xcite . in information theory , \n information is measured by the entropy @xmath13 thus , we search for the experiment which maximizes the expected information in the final distribution . that is , an optimal experiment @xmath14 is one which satisfies @xmath15 \n as an example of how to apply the bayesian experimental design formalism to problems in quantum information , we consider a simple situation with a single qubit . \n in particular , we suppose that the qubit evolves under an internal hamiltonian @xmath16 here @xmath17 is an unknown parameter whose value we want to estimate . \n an experiment consists of preparing a single known input state @xmath18 , the @xmath19 eigenstate of @xmath20 , evolving under the hamiltonian @xmath21 for a controllable time @xmath22 and performing a measurement in the @xmath20 basis . \n this is the simplest problem where adaptive hamiltonian estimation can be used and is the problem studied in reference @xcite .    in the language of bayesian inference , the data @xmath23 is the outcome of the measurement . \n an experiment @xmath0 consists of a specification of time the @xmath22 that the hamiltonian is on , while the model parameter @xmath3 is simply @xmath17 . \n the likelihood function is given by the born rule @xmath24 experimental design is a decision theoretic problem based on the utility function @xmath25 the optimal design is any value of @xmath22 which maximizes this quantity . \n we proceed by performing the optimal experiment and obtaining data @xmath8 . using bayesian inference we update our prior @xmath26 via bayes rule : @xmath27 \n if we are not satisfied , we can repeat the process where this distribution becomes the prior for the new experimental design step . \n this algorithm is depicted in figure [ fig : overview ] . \n overview of a step in the online adaptive algorithm for finding locally optimal experiments . \n top : method for calculating the utility function @xmath28 , given a simulator and a prior distribution @xmath29 over model parameters @xmath3 . \n bottom : method for updating prior distribution with results @xmath1 from chosen actual experiment . ] \n the preceding problem had a single unknown variable . \n if we desire an estimate @xmath30 of the true value @xmath3 , the most often used figure of merit is the _ squared error loss _ : \n @xmath31    the _ risk _ of an estimator @xmath32 is its expected performance with respect to the loss function : @xmath33 for squared error loss , the risk is also called the _ \n mean squared error_. the average of this quantity with respect to some prior @xmath34 is the _ bayes risk _ of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the estimator which minimizes this quantity is called a _ bayes estimator_. in this case the bayes estimator is the mean of the posterior distribution . let us assume then that the estimators we choose are bayes . \n let us also choose a uniform prior for @xmath3 . \n then , the final figure of merit is the average mean squared error ( amse ) : @xmath37 we would like a strategy which minimizes this quantity . \n non - adaptive fourier and bayesian strategies were investigated and compared to an adaptive strategy in reference @xcite . \n their adaptive strategy fits into the bayesian experimental design framework when the utility is measured by the _ variance _ of the posterior distribution : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean of the posterior . \n recall that the mean is a bayes estimator of amse , so @xmath40 . for a single measurement \n this utility function satisfies @xmath41 . that is \n , maximizing the utility _ locally _ at each step of the algorithm is equivalent to minimizing the amse at each step . \n hence , when using the negative variance as our utility function , the adaptive strategy summarized in figure [ fig : overview ] is an example not only of a local optimization , but also a _ greedy algorithm _ with respect to the amse risk . in the future , we shall refer to this choice of utility function together with the local optimization algorithm as the greedy algorithm for this problem . \n we can write the risk of this strategy recursively as follows . \n suppose at the @xmath42th , and final , measurement we have the updated distribution @xmath43 . \n then , the risk of the local strategy is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the locally optimal design satisfying @xmath46 the expected risk at any other stage is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is , again , the locally optimal design satisfying @xmath49 then , the bayes risk of the greedy strategy is @xmath50    again , it is clear that the greedy algorithm is globally optimal on the final decision , as there is no further hypothetical data to consider . \n that is , the optimal solution at the @xmath42th measurement is @xmath51 where @xmath45 is the locally optimal design satisfying @xmath46 however , the globally optimal risk at any other stage @xmath52 where now @xmath53 is the globally optimal design satisfying @xmath54 then , the bayes risk of the greedy strategy is @xmath55    in general , @xmath56 . nor is it the case that @xmath57 for an arbitrary prior . \n however , for the special case of the uniform prior , we have found numerically that the bayes risk of the greedy strategy and the bayes risk of the global strategy are similar enough that the greedy strategy is useful .      in reference \n @xcite , it was shown via simulation that the posterior variance of the greedy strategy is best fit by an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath42 , the total number of measurements . \n in contrast , all off - line strategies decrease at best as a linear function of @xmath42 .    in figure \n [ fig : results ] , we show that the local information gain optimizing algorithm also enjoys an exponential improvement in accuracy over naive off - line methods \n . moreover , we show nyquist rate sampling is unnecessary and , indeed , sub - optimal . \n all results stated are obtained using a uniform prior on @xmath58 $ ] and are computed numerically by exploring every branch of the the decision tree , in contrast to simulation . \n in order to be `` fair '' to the off - line methods , we restricted the adaptive methods to explore the same experimental design specifications . \n that is , for this particular problem , the adaptive algorithm was allowed to select measurement times from @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the total number of measurements . in principle , these methods could only do better with a larger design specification . \n performance of the estimation strategies . \n the bayesian sequential and the strategy labeled `` nyquist '' sample at the nyquist rate .

strategy can exponentially improve the accuracy over offline estimation strategies . \n moreover , we have shown that sampling at the nyquist rate is not optimal in the case of strong measurement . \n we have derived a recursive solution to the risks for both the local and global optimal strategies . using this solution \n , we numerically found that the local strategy is nearly optimal in the special case of a uniform prior . that the greedy algorithm is nearly optimal in a case relevant to experiment demonstrates that an adaptive bayesian method may be computationally feasible , in that an implementation need not consider all possible future data when choosing each experiment . \n together , these results demonstrate the usefulness of an adaptive bayesian algorithm for parameter estimation in quantum mechanical systems , especially in comparison with other algorithms in common use . in the presence of noise , \n this improvement becomes still more stark , as demonstrated by the results shown in figure [ fig : results ] . \n why is it the case that the nyquist times are not optimal ? \n first , why should we expect them to be optimal ? \n the nyquist theorem states that a signal which contains no frequencies higher than @xmath65 is completely and unambiguously characterized by a discrete set of samples taken at a rate greater than or equal to @xmath66 . \n however , the classical notion of sampling fails for the strong - measurement case that we consider here . \n what we have is a periodic _ probability _ distribution which can be sampled , not a periodic function whose _ values _ can be ascertained . \n that is there is no _ signal _ , in the classical sense of the word , which can be reconstructed . \n the failure of the nyquist rate sampling is exemplified in figure [ fig : utils ] .     the information gain ( left ) and variance ( right ) utilities for the prior followed by three simulated measurements . \n the vertical grid lines indicate the nyquist times . \n note that the times at which the utilities are maximized do not necessarily increase with the number of measurements.,title=\"fig : \" ]   the information gain ( left ) and

maximized do not necessarily increase with the number of measurements.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this paper , we have chosen to measure success via the squared error loss . \n although this is a standard metric , note that it is not practically useful in the context of estimating the parameters of a quantum mechanical system . \n we motivate this claim as follows . \n a typical application of our algorithm is to inform control theory algorithms , which can achieve significantly higher fidelities if given a distribution over hamiltonians rather than a single best estimate . indeed , in the case of nuclear magnetic resonance , the physical ensemble of qubits produces a real distribution of hamiltonians to which control theory algorithm must be robust against @xcite . \n any single estimate of the hamiltonian parameters will thus artificially exclude dynamics which will appear as decoherence in the resultant pulses . \n thus , we must measure the success of our algorithm via a loss function of the true _ distribution _ and estimated posterior . noting that relative entropy is broadly considered the correct loss function for probability estimators , our algorithm , which maximizes expected information gain , becomes the optimal solution . \n we expect that in more complicated systems , the bayesian adaptive method will remain useful , especially in applications such as optimal control theory , where having a distribution over hamiltonians is significantly more useful than a single best estimate . \n u.  von toussaint , t.  schwarz - selinger , m.  mayer , and s.

particle theory representing a cardinal simplification of the original many - body problem . \n however , the lda becomes inadequate in materials exhibiting strong spatial correlations between different electrons in atoms with localized orbitals , temporal correlations ( retardation ) associated with coulomb screening , etc . \n the corresponding difficulties are extremely hard to overcome within the dft without sacrificing the first - principles approach . \n one of the methods used to correct the deficiencies of lda in the description of excited states in metals and semiconductors is the gw approximation ( gwa).@xcite the gwa usually improves the band gaps in semiconductors and insulators;@xcite in metals it may provide information on the quasiparticle lifetimes and renormalization which is absent in the dft.@xcite however , in all treatments used until recently , the gwa was employed in a non - self - consistent fashion , by using unrenormalized green s functions based on the kohn - sham wave functions obtained in lda . \n such an approach is easier to implement , but it is internally inconsistent , does not correspond to any luttinger - ward functional@xcite and hence violates basic conservation laws,@xcite and produces different results depending on the approximation used to solve the kohn - sham equations . on the other hand , studies of the homogeneous electron gas \n have shown that gw self - consistency worsens the agreement with experiment at typical metallic densities,@xcite highlighting the limitations of gwa which is strictly correct only in the high - density limit .    recently , two self - consistent realizations of the green s function method were demonstrated . \n one of them@xcite was tailored for transition metals and employed the one - site approximation for the self - energy which is based on the assumption that dynamical screening in @xmath2-metals is well described at the intraatomic level . \n some spin - selective diagrams beyond the gw set were also included . \n the results for fe and ni were quite reasonable , although no improvement was obtained compared to lda . \n while the choice of gw diagrams is unjustified for the homogeneous electron gas at typical metallic densities and likewise for semiconductors ( the diagrams that are left out do not contain any small parameter ) , it was noted that the situation may be better in transition metals , because high orbital degeneracy provides an additional enhancement to the diagrams with the largest number of closed electron loops favoring the gw set.@xcite in addition , for transition metals the `` local '' ( one - site ) approximation for the self - energy is quite reasonable due to the short screening length and greatly facilitates self - consistent calculations . \n another realization@xcite using gw set with the full @xmath3-dependence of the self - energy was applied to elemental semiconductors . \n it was found that self - consistency and accurate treatment of core electrons improve the agreement with experiment for the band gaps in si and ge . \n while the adequacy of gwa for the studies of metals and semiconductors has not been firmly established from the point of view of the many - body theory , this method may be regarded as one of the possible steps toward a consistent green s function - based scheme . \n therefore , it is important to establish the accuracy of this approximation for different materials , and in particular for transition metals where , as noted above , there are reasons for it to work better than in the homogeneous electron gas . to this end , in this paper we calculate the conduction - band spectra for all elemental @xmath0 and @xmath1 metals using the self - consistent gw approach of ref .   and compare them with the observed ones and with those given by the lda . \n the technique used in this paper was introduced in ref .  . \n here we describe some points in more detail . \n the self - energy @xmath4 is obtained from the luttinger - ward generating functional @xmath5 defined by the set of skeleton graphs . \n @xcite the hartree diagram gives the local contribution @xmath6 , and the exchange diagram contributes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coulomb potential . \n the total contribution of the remaining gw sequence ( the `` correlation term '' ) is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the effective ( screened coulomb ) interaction defined by the integral dyson equation @xmath11 and the polarization operator @xmath12contour of integration in eqs . \n ( [ sigmac]),([pi ] ) is directed along the imaginary axis and embraces the cut on the real axis from the fermi energy @xmath13 to the external energy . \n the gw approximation may be modified by the inclusion of vertex corrections in the polarization operator ( [ pi ] ) which may improve the results in some cases . \n the calculations are drastically simplified by the use of the one - site approximation  @xcite ( osa ) , in which the self - energy is calculated only on one lattice site neglecting all non - diagonal maxrix elements connecting different lattice sites . \n thus , in osa the self - energy depends on energy and on the coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 belonging to the same unit cell . in order to implement osa \n we first need to choose an appropriate on - site basis . \n inspired by the good description of the band structure of densely packed solids achieved in the atomic sphere approximation within the linear muffin - tin orbital method ( lmto - asa ) , we used a very similar , minimalistic approach . for the basis set \n we also use just one function per each angular momentum @xmath16 and its projection @xmath17 ( below we denote @xmath18 ) , along with its energy derivative . the radial basis functions @xmath19 satisfy the `` schrdinger - type '' equation @xmath20 \\phi_l(r)=0   \\label{schroed}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the radial part of the laplasian , and @xmath22 is an integral radial operator whose kernel is obtained from @xmath23 by projecting onto the @xmath16 subspace : @xmath24 where we denoted @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the spherical harmonics , and integration is over the directions of @xmath14,@xmath27 . the operator @xmath22 may be represented as the sum of a local part @xmath28 similar to an external potential and a nonlocal part @xmath29 which ( after acting on @xmath30 ) gives a linear combination of @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    similarly to the lmto - asa method , the solutions of eq . \n ( [ schroed ] ) are only found at one energy @xmath33 for each @xmath16 which is fixed at the center of gravity of the corresponding band . \n we may safely discard the imaginary part of the self - energy operator because it is small in the vicinity of @xmath13 where @xmath33 is usually chosen . \n thus , our radial basis functions are real . \n the non - local equation ( [ schroed ] ) is solved by iterations . \n if @xmath34 is the solution after @xmath35 iterations , then the solution on iteration @xmath36 is obtained using auxiliary functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 f_l(r)&= & \\widehat\\sigma_l^{(n)}(\\epsilon_l)\\phi_l^n , \\\\ \n \\left[\\epsilon_l+\\frac{\\delta_l}{2}-v_{\\mathrm{h}}\\right ] g_l(r)&=&0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to @xmath40 , where the coefficient @xmath41 is found by normalizing @xmath42 . \n just as in the lmto method , in addition to @xmath30 we compute its energy derivative @xmath43 : @xmath20 \\dot\\phi_l=-\\phi_l+\\frac{\\partial\\widehat\\sigma_l(% \\epsilon_l)}{\\partial\\epsilon_l}\\phi_l   \\label{schroed1}\\ ] ]    to stabilize the solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ schroed ] ) , we added the exchange with the nearest - neighbor cells to @xmath44 . \n the corresponding matrix element was subtracted from green s function ( gf ) below .    with the on - site self - energy @xmath45 defined for @xmath46 within the single unit cell \n we can calculate its matrix elements between the muffin - tin `` eigenfunctions '' @xmath47 , which in turn are the linear combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath48 . due to the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath47 the self - energy also acquires @xmath3-dependence , just as the local potential in lda . \n finally , on - site green s function is found by integration using the tetrahedron method : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are right and left eigenvectors , and @xmath52 the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian operator @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the hartree hamiltonian . \n ( [ gf ] ) imposes the locality condition and is equivalent to the self - consistency condition of the dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite \n using the technique described above ( below referred to as `` gw '' ) we calculated the spectral densities @xmath55 for elemental @xmath0 and @xmath1 metals , where lda has long been the only appropriate approximation . \n we used the fcc structure for hcp elements ( sc , ti , y , zr , tc , ru , co ) and the bcc structure for mn . \n all atomic volumes were taken from experiment . \n cr was treated within the single bcc cell , and hence was non - magnetic . \n the iterations were started from the lda potential , and at each iteration the non - local self - energy was mixed to this potential with a gradually increasing weight , so that in the end only @xmath44 was left . in the final state the magnitude of @xmath44 differs by about 40% from its initial value based on the lda wave functions . \n the iterational procedure is rather stable in all metals except ni where the magnetic moment is very sensitive to the details of the calculation . \n the results are shown in figs . \n 1,2 along with the lda densities of states ( dos ) and the experimental xps and bis spectra taken from refs .  . \n strictly speaking , comparison with experiment requires the calculation of the corresponding matrix elements , but we believe that in the present context some qualitative conclusions can be drawn based on the spectral densities .    the main differences between the lda dos and gw spectral density may be summarized as follows . \n the conduction band widens as all dos features are pushed away from @xmath13 ; this outward shift is roughly proportional to the distance from @xmath13 . \n moreover , all dos features are increasingly smeared out due to the decreasing quasiparticle lifetime as the distance from @xmath13 increases . \n substantial spectral weight is transferred from the quasiparticle states to the incoherent `` tail '' extending far below @xmath56 . \n the lda dos for @xmath2-metals is typically too small to account for experimentally measured electronic specific heat @xmath57 . as seen from figs .  1,2 \n , the gw spectral density at @xmath13 is generally smaller compared to lda . \n although to obtain @xmath58 we have to remove the renormalization factor @xmath59 from @xmath60 , the gw method does not improve the overall agreement with @xmath58 measurements . \n the differences between the gw and lda spectra are most notable for early transition metals ( treated here in the fcc structure ) where the strongest unoccupied peaks given by lda are almost completely smeared out in gw . \n notably , the worst agreement with experiment for the lda spectra is observed for the same elements . \n in particular , the position of the fermi level obtained in lda for hcp sc and y appears to be off by nearly 1  ev.xps    the agreement between lda and gw improves as we progress to later transition metals and as the fcc structure is replaced by the bcc one . \n already in v and nb the gw and lda curves are quite similar except for the shift of the unoccupied @xmath2-peak by 1.52  ev to higher energies .    as in lda , the @xmath0 metals from mn to ni were magnetic in our calculation . for simplicity \n , we used the bcc structure for mn , and also the fcc structure for co ( this structure is often realized in thin films ) . as it is seen from fig .  1 , \n the general features of the gw spectral density described above are observed in these metals as well . in general , the gw description also gives a reasonable exchange splitting and magnetic moment . \n we obtained the moments of 0.9  @xmath61 for mn compared to 1.03  @xmath61 in lda , 2.3  @xmath61 for fe compared to 2.25  @xmath61 in lda , and 1.85  @xmath61 for fcc co compared to 1.62  @xmath61 in lda . from these results \n it is clear that there is no systematic trend for gw to give larger or smaller magnetic moments compared to lda . \n the magnetic moment in ni is rather sensitive to various details of the calculation , and proper convergence turned out to be problematic . \n we believe that the approach based on matsubara green s functions is necessary to stabilize this problem . apart from the exchange \n splitting , the shape of the spectrum is quite stable . \n we also note that the magnetic moment is expected to be sensitive to the choice of the skeleton graph set .    as an example of the general trend of band dilatation off the fermi level , \n the distance from @xmath13 to the upper edge of the fully occupied @xmath2-band in cu and ag is notably larger in gw compared to lda , which results in a better agreement with experimental xps spectra . on the other hand \n , we also observe a rather strong upward shift of the unoccupied peak in v , nb , fe and mo in obvious disagreement with the bis spectra . \n this shift is more pronounced compared to the downward shift of the occupied states at a similar distance from @xmath13 . \n the results presented above demonstrate that self - consistent gf approach with one - site approximation can be used for ground state studies . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems we have shown that the gw spectral density is generally similar to the lda density of states , while the gf approach includes typical fermi - liquid effects such as finite quasiparticle lifetime and self - consistent renormalization . \n the preliminary comparison with experiment is rather satisfactory and clearly indicates the problems that need improvement beyond our simple gw - osa technique are similar to those in lda  the exchange splitting in ferromagnets , value of @xmath62 , and the unoccupied peak position which is too high for some metals . \n in general , the presented technique based on the luttinger - ward functional is a practical alternative to other methods based on the density functional theory and can serve as a reliable starting point for more sophisticated methods .. \n this work was carried out at the ames laboratory , which is operated for the u.s . \n department of energy by iowa state university under contract no . \n w-7405 -

{"ContextTokens": 3905, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "rapid oscillations in some of ap - stars were discovered by kurtz & wegner ( 1979 ) , and kurtz ( 1982 ) . \n these oscillations are due to high - overtone p - mode pulsations , and appear as rapid periodic photometric variations in b and v filters of the johnson broadband photometric system . periods of oscillations are in the range 416 min . , \n and photometric variations exhibit low amplitudes . \n they are independent on photometric variations caused by the stellar rotation .    rapidly oscillating ap - stars \n are often refered to as roap - stars , and this class presently contains 32 stars ( kurtz & martinez 2000 ) . \n search for rapid variations of the radial velocity in @xmath0 equ ( hd 201601 , a9p srcreu , @xmath7 mag ) was initialized by bychkov ( 1987 , 1988 ) . \n paper by zverko et al . \n ( 1989 ) reported the search for a rapid variability of its magnetic field and radial velocity . \n all these early investigations used the photometric technique of observations , and did not yield conclusive results due to low accuracy . \n recently , kochukhov & ryabchikova ( 2001 ) performed similar research using modern equipment , and have obtained reliable phase variations of the radial velocity in @xmath0 equ . \n recently some research groups attempted to observe rapid variations of its magnetic field . \n particularly interesting is a possible variability of the magnetic field with the pulsation period of @xmath0 equ . \n leone & kurtz ( 2003 ) reported a discovery of rapid variations of the stellar longitudinal ( effective ) magnetic field @xmath1 with a period of 12.1 min . , and the amplitude equal to @xmath8 g. in a later communication savanov et al . \n ( 2003 ) have found variations of the magnetic field modulus with the period 12.53 min . with the amplitude @xmath9 \n g. the authors reported in their paper variability of a separation between the resolved zeeman components of the fe ii 6149.2 a line .    on the other hand , kochukhov et al . \n ( 2004a ) reported the absence of variations of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath1 in @xmath0 equ , which directly contradicts earlier claims by leone & kurtz ( 2003 ) . \n kochukhov et al . \n ( 2004a ) obtained a series of 210 spectropolarimetric observations with a high time resolution , and found no @xmath1 variations with amplitudes above @xmath10 g in the circularly polarized components of 13 nd iii lines . \n such a limit represents their @xmath11 confidence level . \n moreover , kochukhov et al . \n ( 2004b ) have shown that possible variations of the surface magnetic field in @xmath0 equ do not exceed @xmath12 g in short time scales ( observations in fe ii 6149.25 and fe i 6173.34 lines ) . \n recently hubrig et al . \n ( 2004 ) concluded a search for rapid variability of the longitudinal @xmath1 field in several magnetic stars ( observations in circularly polarized profiles of hydrogen lines ) . \n unfortunately , their results on @xmath13 equ are not conclusive due to a small number of @xmath1 points . \n this paper presents results of our search for rapid periodic variations of the longitudinal @xmath1 field in @xmath0 equ . \n we have performed fourier spectral analysis of archival time series of 1720 @xmath1 continuous measurements in the search for periods . \n individual @xmath1 points were measured with a very fine time resolution ( @xmath14 6 seconds on the average ) . \n we used the hydrogen line polarimeter ( bychkov et al . 1988 ; shtol 1991 , 1993 ) for measurements of the longitudinal stellar magnetic field @xmath1 . \n the polarimeter was placed in the prime focus of the 6-meter telescope in order to minimize the influence of instrumental effects from other optical elements of the telescope . \n the hydrogen line polarimeter was used to determine circular polarization of radiation ( @xmath15 ) simultaneously in both wings of a hydrogen line . \n actual observations were performed in two balmer lines , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n the polarimeter cuts out two narrow bands from the line wings of the width 18  each , using a special mask . \n both spectral transmission bands were located symmetrically about the line core , and the edges of transmission were shifted by 2  away from the core . \n profiles of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 lines are usually very similar but are not identical .    first , we determined the average profiles of both lines separately with the same mask , which was described above . \n then the averaged line profiles were used to determine the transformation coefficient between the degree of circular polarization measured in line wings , and the stellar effective magnetic field @xmath1 . \n that transformation was measured in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 line wings simultaneously , taking into account a real contribution of each line to the total flux ( weighted by the number of photons received per second ) . at the time of actual observations of @xmath0 \n equ the transformation coefficient was equal to @xmath18 g per 1  % of the circular polarization . \n measurements of the circular polarization were performed both in the blue and red line wings simultaneously , which allowed us to find and take into account instrumental contribution to the observed polarization . \n stability of the modulator and other optical and electronic components of our instrumentation were constantly monitored at the time of observations . moreover , at the time of the observing run we measured also other stars with the well known values of the magnetic field @xmath1 , usually 2 - 3 times per run . \n observations of the magnetic field @xmath1 in @xmath0 equ were performed during a single night of 20/21 august 1989 . \n heliocentric moments of the beginning and the end of our observations \n are jd 2447759.414471 and .545842 , respectively .    time length of a single exposure was determined by the time of accumulation of up to 800000 photons , and it varied between 3 and 24 seconds . \n the average time length of a single observation was equal to 6.6 sec in our run . \n time span between the end of a previous exposure and the beginning of the following one did not exceed 0.05 sec , which means that a series of measurements was practically continuous . \n the total time length of our observing run of @xmath0 equ was equal to 189 minutes , which enabled us to collect 1720 estimates of @xmath1 of this star . \n such a large number of @xmath1 points in a single , uninterrupted series allowed us to compute reliable power spectra of the above data . \n photon statistics implies some rough estimates of the error @xmath19 of a single magnetic field determination . \n the error @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the number of accumulated photons ( shtol 1993 ) . \n the error of a single @xmath1 measurement can be estimated in an independent way . \n we assume that the projected magnetic field @xmath1 does not change at the time of observations , and the scatter of individual @xmath22 points results from random observational errors . \n then , the error of a single measurement equals @xmath23^{1/2 } = 2837 \\ , { \\rm g } \\ \n , ,   \\label{equ : sigma2}\\ ] ] for the actual series of @xmath24 measurements . \n one can see that both independent estimates of the error of an individual @xmath1 observation differ rather insignificantly . \n we stress here that we have presented in this paper the first magnetic field measurements obtained with such a fine time resolution , without any significant readout time between measurements . \n we have performed spectral analysis of the above @xmath1 time series using two different numerical techniques : the power spectrum and the amplitude spectrum analysis . \n first , the standard fast fourier transform subroutines were used to analyse the above series of 1720 @xmath1 measurements of @xmath0 equ . \n we have computed its power spectrum in the frequency range @xmath25 , which corresponds to periods ranging from 90 min . to 1 min . \n [ fig : power ] shows the power spectrum , which is rather noisy in this frequency range . \n we have identified the distinct peak at 4.635 mhz , significantly exceeding the level of a spectral noise . \n the peak frequency corresponds to the period @xmath4 min .    numbers on the vertical axis of fig . \n [ fig : power ] denote the values of the normalised power of our @xmath1 series . \n spectral power of a time series is the square of the fourier transform . in case of magnetic @xmath1 observations power \n can be measured in g@xmath26/mhz@xmath26 . \n normalised power of a signal is defined as the ratio of the true power and its variance , and therefore it is a dimensionless variable ( horne & baliunas 1986 ) . \n the advantage of using the normalised power is that scargle ( 1982 ) proposed a relation between the power at a spectral peak and the probability that the peak corresponds either to real or false period in a time series ( false alarm probability test ) . \n the value of a normalised power at the peak of 4.635 mhz in our @xmath1 measurements equals 6.327 . \n false alarm probability test of the latter paper predicts , that the peak is real with the probability 67 % ( cf . \n section ii.b in horne & baliunas 1986 ) . \n therefore , the spectral peak is a 1 sigma event and the corresponding period is not necessarily a real feature . \n subsequently , we have analysed the amplitude spectrum of our @xmath1 time series with the method developed by kurtz ( 1985 ) and with his software ( kurtz 2004 ) . fig . \n [ fig : amplitude ] shows the amplitude spectrum which is also flat with a much lower amplitude peak at the same frequency . \n [ fig : amplitude ] allows one to estimate the noise level of our data , which is of the order of 250 g. the amplitude of possible periodic @xmath1 variations shown there is of the order of 350 g.    fig . \n [ fig : p3 ] presents the magnetic phase curve for @xmath0 equ corresponding to the period @xmath4 min . \n phase curve was fitted to ten @xmath2 points , which were obtained by averaging of individual noisy @xmath1 measurements in phase bins of the width @xmath27 . \n the value of @xmath2 averaged over all phases equals @xmath3 g , and the amplitude of the phase curve is @xmath28 g.    one should note that the phase plot in fig . \n [ fig : p3 ] does not confirm the reality of the peak in fourier transform . \n any high peak in the ft will produce a phase plot where you can see apparent variation . \n that is true whether the peak is real or spurious ( kurtz 2004 ) . \n the only useful information given by fig . \n [ fig : p3 ] is that the phase coverage of the @xmath1 data in our series is satisfactory , assuming that the @xmath4 min period , or rather 4.635 mhz peak frequency , is real . \n most of the previously analysed magnetic measurements of @xmath0 equ were obtained in metal lines . \n consequently , the results could be affected by a nonuniform distribution of these elements over the stellar surface . \n such a well known effect is common among ap stars . \n moreover , @xmath1 measurements in metal lines in principle may be distorted by other effects , e.g. by complex blending of lines , cross - over effect , etc . \n the only exception is the paper by hubrig et al . \n ( 2004 ) who obtained their @xmath1 measurements in wings of the hydrogen balmer lines . as a consequence , \n their @xmath1 data are free of the above effects , and they seem to be more credible since the hydrogen line @xmath1 data represent best the value of the longitudinal component of the global magnetic field integrated over the stellar disc .    it is a well known fact , that the profiles and equivalent widths of the balmer lines exhibit periodic variations in most of ap stars . \n such variations are the result of stellar rotation , and proceed with the corresponding rotational period . for example , observations of the periodic variability of @xmath16 line with @xmath29 were presented by madej ( 1983 ) and musielok & madej ( 1988 ) for a group of bright ap stars . \n the presence of rapid variations in the wings of balmer lines in @xmath0 equ can not be excluded , since momentary line profiles should reflect all changes in the structure of a stellar atmosphere caused by pulsations . \n however , the impact of a possible rapid variability of balmer line profiles on the @xmath1 determinations is unknown and will be the subject of our research in future . \n one can also note , that the amplitudes of magnetic curves observed in hydrogen lines can be distinctly larger than the amplitudes measured in metal lines . \n such an effect arises since ( in atmospheres of magnetic ap stars ) far wings of hydrogen lines are formed mostly in much deeper layers than metal lines . \n therefore , if strength or direction of the local surface magnetic field depends on depth , i.e. if it exhibits nonzero gradient , then the apparent intensity of @xmath1 and its temporal variations can differ depending on the depth of a spectral line formation .    hubrig et al . ( \n 2004 ) presented only 18 individual measurements of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath1 of @xmath0 equ , due to the cloudy weather during their 2.5 hour observing run . \n they did not find any significant traces of the period . \n in particular , hubrig et al . \n ( 2004 ) did not confirm any periodic variability close to the four pulsation periods in the range 11.6812.44 min . \n ( martinez et al . 1996 ) . \n we have taken 18 magnetic field @xmath1 points from hubrig et al . \n ( 2004 ) , and searched for a period @xmath30 disregarding small number of available points . \n they show pure spectral noise with amplitude of @xmath31 g in the frequency range @xmath32 mhz , hence they do not confirm our marginal period of @xmath33 . \n we can not rule out the possibility , that processes which cause rapid pulsations in @xmath0 equ are not stable , and cause a drift of pulsation periods and amplitudes with time . \n one can speculate , that our observations and the period of @xmath1 obtained in 1989 ( @xmath34 min . ) \n do not correspond to @xmath1 periods obtained at a later time . \n such a hypothesis would explain , why leone & kurtz ( 2003 ) , and savanov et al . \n ( 2003 ) could obtain a period close to the photometric period @xmath6 min . on the other hand , kochukhov et al . \n ( 2004a , b ) might have observed @xmath0 equ during a time interval , when the amplitude of rapid variations of @xmath1 decreased below the detection limit . \n kochukhov et al . \n ( 2004a , b ) measured magnetic field @xmath1 in lines of fe i , fe ii , and nd iii , which may not be very sensitive to the magnetic field variations ( nd iii lines were useful to measure variations of radial velocity ) . \n plachinda & polosukhina ( 1994 ) showed , that values of @xmath1 determined in different lines can differ by a factor up to a few times . \n therefore , we propose that the most representative values of @xmath1 are those measured in wings of hydrogen balmer lines . \n in this paper we present our high time resolution observations of the global longitudinal magnetic field in the ap star @xmath0  equ = hd 201601 . \n the series of 1720 measurements was obtained during 189 min . of a single uninterrupted run on august 20 - 21 , 1989 . \n we found that the average value of @xmath2 at the time of observations equals @xmath3 g.    spectral analysis of this time series has shown that the frequency spectrum of @xmath0 equ is flat . \n however , we have found possible variations of the global - scale @xmath1 with the period @xmath34 min . there is only a 67 % probability that this period is a real feature ( 1 sigma event ) , and \n therefore , its significance is not high . \n both the power spectrum and the amplitude spectrum of our data reveal no signal at the frequency of pulsations , which was identified with the well - known period of rapid photometric variations , @xmath6 min . our amplitude spectrum ( fig . \n [ fig : amplitude ] ) shows , that if rapid variations of @xmath1 with the period 12.44 min . existed in 1989 , then their amplitude was lower than @xmath14 250 g ( noise level ) . \n there exists a number of theoretical papers , which attempt to explain the existence of nonradial pulsations in ap stars with very short periods of the order @xmath35 10 min ( bigot et al . \n 2000 ; cunha & gough 2000 ; bigot & dziembowski 2002 ) . \n we believe , that the model of inclined pulsator presented in the latter paper is the most relevant one to discuss possible variations of the global magnetic field in @xmath0 equ with periods as short as 3.6 min . \n our thanks are due to don kurtz for providing his fortran software used here to compute the amplitude spectrum of @xmath0 equ and for critical comments regarding our results . \n we also thank kazik stpie for careful reading of our paper and numerous suggestions . \n this paper was supported by grant no \n . 1 p03d 001 26 from the polish committee for scientific research .", "StartTimeOffset": 1546149941094, "RequestID": "ad8399ff0a3eedce4221d96c57a223d27e379088", "TotalTokens": 4133}
{"ContextTokens": 3609, "GeneratedTokens": 213, "SynthesizedBody": "the observations of gravitational microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have revealed that a significant fraction of the milky way s halo consists of solar or sub - solar - mass compact objects , which are called massive compact halo objects ( hereafter machos ; alcock _ et al . \n _ 1993 , 1996 , 1997 , aubourg _ et al . \n so far at least six microlensing events have been detected toward the lmc , and recent analyses have shown that the macho mass is about @xmath3 ( alcock _ et al . \n the fractional contribution of the machos to the galactic halo mass is also estimated to be @xmath4(alcock _ et al . \n _ 1997 ) , but may vary between 15 and 100% ( e.g. , kan - ya , nishi & nakamura 1996 ) .    the mass estimate of @xmath5 is consistent with red dwarf stars and old white dwarfs as baryonic candidates for machos , but both halos have serious difficulties . \n a red dwarf halo can not be consistent with the observations since red dwarfs do not appear in the star counts of galactic halo fields ( graff & freese 1996 ) . if machos are old white dwarfs , the initial mass function ( imf ) of the progenitor stars must be strongly peaked around @xmath6 ( adams & laughlin 1997 , chabrier , segretain & mra 1996 ) , being completely different from the present day imf ( e.g. scalo 1986 ) . \n moreover , the halos of distant galaxies must be brightened by progenitor stars of the present day macho white dwarfs , which contradicts with the number count of distant galaxies ( charlot & silk 1995 ) . \n the overproduction of helium , carbon and nitrogen is also a major problem for a white dwarf halo ( charlot & silk 1995 ; gibson & mould 1997 ) . \n furthermore , the age of the white dwarfs which are cool and faint enough to be consistent with the negative result of hdf star count ( flynn , gould & bahcall 1996 ) is very old ( chabrier , segretain & mra 1996 ) . \n the age estimated by chabrier _ \n ( 1996 ) is not consistent with recent observations of the hubble constant . \n on the other hand , brown dwarfs are possible and attractive candidates for machos , since it is free from problems concerning metals and star counts . \n the largest problem of a brown dwarf halo is the consistency with the mass estimate of @xmath7 . \n the mass estimate is , however , based on the  standard halo model , in which the rotation curve is flat out to the lmc . \n hence , if the standard halo model does not represent the galactic halo well , the macho mass would be changed considerably . \n recently , honma & sofue ( 1996 ; 1997a ) revealed that the outer rotation curve of the galaxy could be declining if the galactic constant @xmath8 , which is the rotation velocity of the galaxy at the solar circle , is 200 km s@xmath1 or less , and several studies indeed suggested @xmath9 of @xmath10 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. , kuijken & tremaine 1994 ; olling & merrifield 1998 ) . \n furthermore , many observations have revealed declining rotation curves in the outer region of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; olling 1996 ; bland - hawthorn et al 1997 ; see also honma & sofue 1997b and references therein ) , indicating that declining rotation curves are not uncommon .    for these reasons , \n it is important to re - analyze the macho mass with \n non - standard halo models for which the outer rotation curve decline . in this letter we study the macho mass and the halo macho fraction based on such halo models and investigate the possibility of a brown dwarf halo . \n since this investigation is motivated by declining rotation curves , we focus on the halo models whose density profiles decrease faster than the standard halo model , @xmath11 , of which hernquist model and plummer model are common examples . \n the density of hernquist models is proportional to @xmath12 at large radii , and it is known to trace the luminosity profile of elliptical galaxies moderately well . \n the density of plummer models decreases faster than hernquist model at large radii , proportional to @xmath13 . \n the plummer model is known to trace the light distribution of globular clusters to some degree . \n conveniently enough , the potential - density pairs and the distribution functions are obtained analytically for both models . \n below we summarize the analytic form of the potential - density pairs and distribution functions . \n the relative potential and the density for hernquist model ( hernquist 1990 ) are written as , @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , @xmath17 is the total mass of the halo , and @xmath18 is the scale length . \n hernquist ( 1990 ) obtained the distribution function for this model as @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n note that the relative energy @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 . \n the potential - density pair for the plummer model ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) are @xmath24 and @xmath25 the distribution function for this model is written as @xmath26    note that both of hernquist and plummer models contain only two parameters , the total mass @xmath17 and the scale length @xmath18 . \n based on the models described above , we calculate the optical depth @xmath27 and the macho mass @xmath28 . \n paczynski ( 1986 ) defined the optical depth as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the einstein ring radius , @xmath28 is the macho mass , and @xmath31 is the distance along the line of sight . \n we assume that the distance to the lmc is 50 kpc , and also that all machos have a unique mass @xmath28 . \n @xmath27 is related to the halo macho fraction , but independent of the macho mass because @xmath28 cancels out in eq.(7 ) . \n a quantity related to @xmath28 is the differential event rate @xmath32 ( griest 1991 ; see also alcock _ et al._1996 ) , which may be written as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the maximum impact parameter , @xmath35 is the einstein ring crossing time , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the radial and tangential velocities of machos , respectively . \n we set @xmath38 following alcock _ \n et al._(1997 ) . \n the total event rate @xmath39 can be obtained by integrating eq.(8 ) with respect to @xmath40 , namely , @xmath41 . \n the expectation of @xmath40 can be obtained as @xmath42 note that @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 ( griest 1991 ) , and hence , the macho mass can be estimated by comparing @xmath43 with the observed one , @xmath45 . to be conservative , \n we adopted @xmath46 and @xmath45 of 80 days from six events so far detected ( alcock _ et al . \n note that this @xmath45 is the simple arithmetic mean of the blending - corrected timescales for the six events , and the observational efficiency is not included here ( see next section for more elaborate analyses ) . \n figures 1 show the contours for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for hernquist models and plummer models in the parameter space of @xmath18 and @xmath17 . \n the distance to the galactic center @xmath47 is assumed to be 7.5 kpc . \n if the iau standard @xmath47 of 8.5 kpc is assumed , the optical depth becomes slightly smaller , but the results are not significantly changed . \n figures 1 demonstrate that the macho mass can be @xmath48 or less depending on the halo parameters . in particular , the region for @xmath49 and the region for @xmath50 overlap ( shadowed region in figures 1 ) . \n this fact implies that the macho mass can be less than @xmath48 while keeping the halo macho fraction close to @xmath51% . \n therefore , a halo which consists solely of brown dwarfs ( @xmath52 ) is possible as long as these  non - standard halo models are accepted . \n figure 2 shows the rotation curves modeled with the non - standard halos plus a disk and a bulge . \n an infinitely - thin exponential disk is assumed for the disk component , and plummer model is assumed for the bulge . \n the scale lengths are fixed to be 3 kpc for the disk , and 0.4 kpc for the bulge , respectively . \n the two rotation curves in figure 2 ( full lines ) correspond to the galaxy s models with hernquist and plummer halo . for the galaxy s model with hernquist halo \n , we set @xmath53 and @xmath54 kpc for the halo , and the disk mass of @xmath55 and the bulge mass of @xmath56 ( hereafter model h ) . \n for the galaxy s model with plummer halo , we set @xmath57 and @xmath58 kpc for the halo , and the disk mass of @xmath59 and the bulge mass of @xmath60 ( hereafter model p ) . \n the halo parameters for models h and p lie in the shadowed region in figure 1 .    in figure 2 the observed rotation curve taken from honma & sofue ( 1997a ) \n is also plotted ( @xmath61 km s@xmath1 assumed ) . \n the model rotation curves in figure 2 reproduce well the general tendency of observed rotation curves , except for a local deviation in the vicinity of the sun . \n the local density of the exponential disks assumed here are 51 and 58 @xmath2 pc@xmath62 , being in agreement with the studies on the local disk density ( kuijken & gilmore 1989 ; bahcall , flynn & gould 1992 ) . \n therefore , non - standard halo models which allow 100 % brown dwarf halos does not conflict with the constraints from the rotation curve or the local disk density . this conclusion is not affected by small changes in the halo parameters . \n why does the macho mass become so small when the non - standard halos are considered ? \n the substellar macho mass is obtained mainly because of the small velocity dispersion in the non - standard halos . \n the timescale @xmath40 , which is the only observable used for the mass determination , is given by @xmath63 . \n the einstein ring diameter is proportional to @xmath44 , and hence , @xmath64 if the timescale is given observationally . \n consequently , the macho mass becomes small if the velocity dispersion in the halo is sufficiently reduced . \n in fact , the tangential dispersion in the model p halo is 82 km s@xmath1 at @xmath65 kpc , which is less than half of the tangential dispersion for the standard halo , @xmath0 km s@xmath1 . \n in this section we perform the maximum likelihood analysis and investigate more precisely the possible range of the macho mass and the halo macho fraction . \n the method applied here is basically the same as alcock _ \n et al._(1997 ) , whereas the halo models are the non - standard models described in section 2 . \n the likelihood of finding a set of @xmath66 detected events with duration times @xmath67 , is written as . without this factor \n , @xmath68 does not follow the poisson distribution correctly . ] \n @xmath69    \\prod^{n_{\\rm obs}}_{i=1}\\left[f e\\varepsilon(\\hat{t}_{i } )      \\frac{\\displaystyle d\\gamma}{\\displaystyle d\\hat{t}}(\\hat{t}_{i};m )    \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : likelihood}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the number of events expected from poisson statistics ( see eq.[8 ] in alcock _ \n 1997 ) , @xmath71 is the halo macho fraction , @xmath72 star - yr is the total exposure and @xmath73 is the observational efficiency . \n for the observational efficiency we use the photometric efficiency of the macho year-1 + 2 observation given in figure 8 of alcock _ et al . _ \n the likelihood contours for model h are shown in figure 3a , and those for model p in figure 3b . \n the estimated macho mass @xmath28 is @xmath74 for model h , and @xmath75 for model p ( the errors denote 68% confidence level ) . \n most likely masses for both models are consistent with brown dwarfs . \n for the halo macho fraction @xmath71 , the elongated contours in figure 3 make the possible range of @xmath71 wide , but most likely values are fairly close to unity ( 0.92 for model h , and 0.86 for model p ) . the results for @xmath71 as well as the macho mass @xmath28 indicate that these halos can solely consist of brown dwarfs , confirming what we have found in the previous section . \n we have seen that a brown dwarf halo is a possible candidate for the galactic halo when the non - standard halo models are considered . assuming the halo macho fraction of unity for the models h and p , we obtain the macho mass within 50 kpc of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . \n these masses are somewhat lower than the estimate of @xmath78 by alcock _ \n et al._(1997 ) , but do not contradict with each other when one considers the fact that the smaller @xmath47 adopted here tends to make @xmath27 higher for a given halo model . since the total masses of model h and p galaxies are @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81%@xmath82% of the total mass may be in the form of brown dwarfs . \n to be consistent with the star counts at high galactic latitude ( e.g. , bahcall _ et al . \n _ 1994 ) , such a brown dwarf halo should have a steep imf at the low mass end ( e.g. , kan - ya _ et al . \n _ 1996 ; graff & freese 1996 ) . unfortunately \n , any physical process for producing such a steep imf is not known yet . \n however , the star formation from primordial gas may be very different from the present star formation because of the different cooling processes ( e.g. palla _ et al . \n _ 1983 , uehara _ et al . \n _ 1996 ) , and hence such an imf may be possible if the halo brown dwarfs are different populations from disk stars .    in order to test the possibility of a brown dwarf halo , direct observations of the halo brown dwarfs are definitely important . \n unfortunately , star counts at high galactic latitude so far made were not deep enough to detect the halo brown dwarfs . \n for instance , the star counts with hst ( bahcall _ et al._1994 ) , which covers a sky area of 4.4 square arcmin with the limiting i - band magnitude of @xmath83 mag , detected no brown dwarf candidates . if the i - band absolute luminosity of @xmath84 brown dwarfs is 18 mag ( e.g. , delfosse _ et al . \n _ 1997 ) , there should be @xmath85 brown dwarfs brighter than 25 mag in the vicinity of the sun ( model h assumed ) . \n the expected number in the hst filed of 4.4 square arcmin is , therefore , only 0.3 , being consistent with the negative detection . for direct detection of the halo brown dwarfs , a deeper survey with a larger area is required . \n 10m - class telescopes with wide field of view , such as the subaru telescope with sprime - cam , will be useful for this kind of observation . \n we are grateful to y. sofue , j. jugaku , k. ohnishi , s. inutsuka and y. itoh for fruitful discussions . \n we also thank the referee for helpful suggestions in improving the manuscript . \n one of the authors ( m.h . ) \n was financially supported by the japan society for the promotion of science .", "StartTimeOffset": 1555711582218, "RequestID": "ba5ba49d6937e2bc587ff7e98f975ad900b4b061", "TotalTokens": 3822}

{"ContextTokens": 2410, "GeneratedTokens": 116, "SynthesizedBody": "nuclear force is one of the oldest problem in nuclear physics . \n however , its theoretical description is still an unsettled issue . here , we first explain a traditional , phenomenological approach to the nuclear force , and a fairly new approach based on nuclear effective field theory ( neft)@xcite . after the explanation , \n we formulate a scenario for a relation between nuclear forces based on the two approaches . the main subject in this report \n is to discuss the relation from a viewpoint of the renormalization group ( rg ) .    in the phenomenological nuclear force ( ) , \n the long - range part is described by the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) . \n the short - range part is poorly known , and therefore a phenomenological model is used ; heavy - meson exchanges or purely phenomenological parameterization . \n parameters involved in the model are fixed so as to reproduce low - energy @xmath0 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy . in this way , \n several high - precision @xmath0 potentials have been constructed , such as the cd - bonn and the nijmegen potentials . \n although these models are phenomenologically very successful , there are some problems as follows . at first , each model describes the short - range part differently , and is largely model - dependent . secondly , there is no systematic way to construct the short - range mechanism . \n thirdly , there is little connection to the underlying theory , qcd . \n in contrast , it is claimed that a nuclear force based on neft ( ) is free from the problems inherent in . \n the claim is based on the derivation procedure of , which is briefly given as follows . \n one starts with an effective chiral lagrangian , taking care of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd . \n the lagrangian consists of effective degrees of freedom for a system in question , and is the most general as long as assumed symmetries are satisfied . \n one identifies a set of irreducible diagrams from the lagrangian with . \n the importance of an irreducible diagram is assigned by a counting rule . \n however , one may find questions about : ( q1 ) in , short - distance physics is described by contact interactions , which is much simpler compared to the short - range mechanism employed in . \n is the contact interaction really appropriate to describe the short - distance physics ? ( q2 ) \n is  still one of many phase - equivalent potentials , as  is ? ( q3 ) is there any relation between model independent  and model dependent ? \n in fact , the answer to ( q3 ) naturally leads us to the answers to ( q1 ) and ( q2 ) . \n thus , we formulate a scenario for the relation between  and . \n it is noted that the model space ( the state space for the nucleon ) of  is considerably smaller than that of . with this point in mind , we can formulate the following scenario for the relation between  and . \n we may construct many  which reproduce @xmath0 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy . \n they are different in describing the short - distance physics , and therefore model dependent . starting with such , \n we reduce their model space by integrating out the high momentum states of the nucleon . reducing the model space corresponds to viewing the system in a coarse - grained manner . \n as the model space is reduced , information about details of the short - distance physics is gradually lost . \n eventually , we obtain a low - momentum effective interaction ( @xmath1 ) defined in a reduced model space . \n @xmath1 does not have the model dependence which  have . \n a parameterization of @xmath1 constitutes . \n this is the scenario for the relation between  and . \n obtained in this way is , by construction , does not have a dependence on modelling the short - distance physics . \n the short - range part of @xmath1 is expected to be accurately simulated by simple contact interactions because the detailed information has been integrated out . \n therefore , if we show that this scenario is realized , then we can answer all of the questions raised in the previous paragraph . \n the purpose of this report is to confirm the scenario , thereby proposing the relation between  and @xcite . \n furthermore , keeping the relation in mind , we can understand features of neft more deeply , which we will discuss later . \n in order to examine the scenario , stated in the previous section , for the relation between  and , an appropriate model - space reduction method is necessary . in effective \n filed theory , we use an effective lagrangian in which high - energy degrees of freedom have been integrated out using a path integral : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is high-(low- ) energy degrees of freedom , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) consists of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( only @xmath4 ) . an effective ( more fundamental ) lagrangian is @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) . \n the model - space reduction , integrating out high - momentum states of the nucleon , also should be done with the path integral . \n although it is difficult in general , in case the lagrangian is composed by only the nucleon field and two nucleons interact through contact interactions , we can perform the path integral . \n it is noted that we restrict ourselves to two - nucleon system throughout this report . in the center of mass frame , performing the path integral is equivalent to solving the following wilsonian renormalization group ( wrg ) equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is @xmath0 potential for a partial wave @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the nucleon mass . in @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the off - shell relative momentum of the two nucleons before ( after ) the interaction , @xmath14 denotes the on - shell momentum , and @xmath15 is the cutoff value specifying the model space . \n this equation controls the evolution of @xmath8 with respect to a change of @xmath15 . \n this equation was firstly derived by birse _ \n _ in a different manner@xcite . \n starting with several phenomenological @xmath0 potentials , we reduce their model spaces using the wrg equation , and examine the evolution . \n then , we simulate the obtained effective model - space interaction ( @xmath1 ) with  by adjusting parameters in it . \n if the simulation is accurate , then the relation between  and  through rg is realized .    in the simulation , for simplicity , we include only the opep in  as a mechanism explicitly including the pion . \n this is not fully consistent with weinberg s counting . \n because we consider contact interactions with zero , two , and four derivatives , we should include more irreducible graphs , such as a two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) . \n however , we employ a rather small model space where the details of the tpep play essentially no role ; the tpep is accurately simulated by contact interactions . \n therefore , our simplification does not deteriorate the accuracy of the simulation .    in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , shown are diagonal components of @xmath16 in the momentum space . \n there is the clear model dependence among , which almost disappears after the model - space reduction down to @xmath15 = 200 mev . \n the obtained @xmath1 is accurately simulated by the opep and a few contact interactions , which we do not show here . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , diagonal components of @xmath17 ( @xmath15=200mev ) obtained from the cd - bonn potential is simulated using the opep and one or two contact interactions . \n we see that the simulation is very accurate . \n obtained in this way also accurately simulates the off - diagonal components of @xmath1 . \n @xmath0-potential @xmath18 . \n the solid curve is @xmath1(@xmath15=200mev ) resulting from the cd - bonn potential . \n the dashed ( dotted ) curve is a simulation of @xmath1 using the opep plus one ( two ) contact interaction(s ) . \n the dash - dotted curve is the opep . \n , width=283 ]     @xmath0-potential @xmath18 . \n the solid curve is @xmath1(@xmath15=200mev ) resulting from the cd - bonn potential . \n the dashed ( dotted ) curve is a simulation of @xmath1 using the opep plus one ( two ) contact interaction(s ) . \n the dash - dotted curve is the opep . \n , width=283 ] \n we have seen in the previous section that the scenario for the relation between  and  is realized . although we have shown the relation employing a rather small model space , if the tpep and higher order opep are properly included in , then the relation should hold true for a larger model space as well ; probably safe up to @xmath19 400 mev . in a certain large model space where the very details of the tpep is considerable , _ \n i.e. _ , a phenomenological model can not mimic the tpep any more , the relation may not hold true . \n we have been concerned with only the strong nucleon - nucleon interaction . however , this kind of relation probably exists also in other nuclear operators , such as electroweak currents and pion production operators . \n now , based on our result , we discuss in the following some features of neft which the traditional approach does not have ; the discussion is not always restricted to the nuclear force . \n one is that nuclear operators based on neft are constructed perturbatively . \n therefore , one can systematically improve the accuracy , and can discuss theoretical uncertainty . \n we note that , for a convergent perturbation , it is necessary to define an operator in a suitably small model space . \n we also note that the convergence of the neft - based perturbative expansion is not always good for some processes . \n another is that neft - based operators are model independent , which has been often claimed . \n however , the claim is based on the procedure of deriving the nuclear operators , which is not a quantitative argument . in this work \n , we quantitatively showed that  does not have the dependence on modelling the details of short - distance physics . \n this is a consequence of viewing the system roughly , thereby ignoring the detailed structure of the short - distance physics . \n it is noted , therefore , a description of a system based on neft is not always better than those based on phenomenological models . in many cases , they give essentially the same low - energy observables because they are equivalent through the rg . \n neft may have superiority in cases where detailed information about multi - pion exchange mechanism play an important role . \n finally , with neft , one can describe a system more efficiently and simply , compared to the phenomenological models . \n the efficiency is due to the perturbative calculation , and the simplicity is due to the ignorance of the details of the short - distance physics .    to summarize , we considered the nuclear force from the viewpoint of the rg , and showed that there exists the equivalence relation between and . \n we simultaneously showed that  does not have the model dependence due to the details of the short - distance physics , and that the simple contact interactions in  accurately describe the short - distance physics in a certain small model space . \n based on the result , we discussed the new features in neft .", "StartTimeOffset": 1591386990336, "RequestID": "aafeceaf0f5cd13e74ffabd62ebf6b4ef46cd5b6", "TotalTokens": 2526}
{"ContextTokens": 3672, "GeneratedTokens": 168, "SynthesizedBody": "in a highly conductive and strongly turbulent plasma like the solar photosphere random small - scale deviations of the flow field

magnetic structures with scales much smaller than the characteristic scale of the turbulent velocity field ( which is the granular scale of @xmath2 km in the solar case ) . \n traditional zeeman magnetography is `` blind '' to these fields as the net circular polarization of the mixed polarity small - scale field cancels out in a resolution element . \n it has long been recognized that the hanle effect ( magnetic depolarization of linearly polarized radiation ) may offer a way to detect the turbulent fields ( # stenflo : hanlelimit##2##3#stenflo : hanlelimit@xcite # stenflo : hanlelimit##2##3##3@xcite ) . the observational study of turbulent fields has however been hampered by the shortage of observational data , by the lack of a reliable radiative transfer theory for polarized radiation in magnetic fields and by the fact that beside turbulent fields , the hanle effect is also due to resolved magnetic elements ( network , ephemeral active regions ) and to the overlying canopy fields ( especially for lines formed higher in the atmosphere ) . \n nevertheless , in recent years important advances have been made in all these areas ( # faurob##2##3#faurob@xcite

stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3##3@xcite ) that the degree of linear polarization @xmath3 shows large amplitude random variations over the solar disk . \n while , as mentioned above , canopy fields , network elements and ephemeral active regions may also contribute to the observed hanle depolarization , it is still likely that at least part of this observed spatial variation is due to the presence of similar fluctuations in the flux density @xmath1 of the turbulent photospheric magnetic field . \n the presence of fluctuations should not come as a surprise from a theoretical point of view . \n after all , in the turbulent solar photosphere any physical quantity should show fluctuations , and even variations of an amplitude comparable to the mean value are commonplace . what is more surprising is the _ spatial scale of the fluctuations . \n while the observations have a resolution of about @xmath4 along the slit , the dominant variations seem to occur on the much larger scale of @xmath5 km . \n variations on the granular scale are of much smaller amplitude . \n ( see e.g.  fig .  3 in # stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3#stenflo+:hanle.fluct@xcite # stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3##3@xcite . ) \n the real theoretical challenge is therefore to understand how the dominant scale of fluctations of turbulent flux density can be so much larger than the turbulence scale ? _ \n one popular explanation for the existence of large - scale photospheric structures ( such as supergranulation ) is that they are the `` imprints '' of processes going on deeper down in the convective zone where the characteristic scales ( determined by the pressure scale height @xmath6 ) are larger . \n alternatively , it is of course also possible that the large scales are due to some local photospheric process like an inverse cascade . in order to resolve this problem \n , we need a model for the generation and transport of turbulent magnetic flux that takes into account both the generation and saturation processes constituting the small - scale dynamo and the turbulent transport of @xmath1 throughout the underlying convective zone . in the following such a model \n will be presented . \n the evolution equation for the unsigned flux density @xmath1 of the turbulent field should read something like @xmath7 as the transport of the highly intermittent magnetic field in a turbulent plasma is due to advection of flux tubes irrespective of their polarity , the transport terms are expected to be identical to those for the signed field @xmath8 . for simplicity , here we consider an isotropic turbulent diffusion with diffusivity @xmath9 ( first term on the r.h.s . ) , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 being the correlation length and r.m.s . \n amplitude of the turbulent velocity field . \n the linear generation term corresponding to a small scale dynamo would lead to an exponential growth of a homogeneous @xmath1 field to infinity , were it not for a higher order term leading to the saturation of @xmath1 at a finite value @xmath12 , induced by the curvature force ( last term on r.h.s . ) . \n numerical simulations and closure calculations ( #

the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are functionals of the turbulent velocity field they are expected to show considerable fluctuations around their mean values . \n hence , the flux density @xmath1 determined by the equilibrium of generation and nonlinear saturation processes will also fluctuate around its mean value @xmath16 . \n it is plausible to assume @xmath17 furthermore , introducing the notation @xmath18 , it greatly simplifies the treatment if one assumes @xmath19 . \n ( in section 3 we will consider the problem to what extent this simplification affects the results

mean restoring effect of generation and saturation terms , tending to reduce the fluctuation @xmath20 , while the last term is the _ fluctuation generation term or _ forcing term arising owing to the turbulent fluctuations in the coefficients . _ _ \n we further introduce the ( physically plausible ) assumption that the fourier spectrum of this forcing term is dominated by those isotropic modes

paper we take the logarithmic pressure @xmath24 as independent variable in the vertical direction , the depth @xmath25 being just a shorthand notation for a function @xmath26 , determined by a convection zone model . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the horizontal coordinates . ) for the solution of equation ( 3 ) we take a similar _ ansatz _ : @xmath29}\\ ] ]    let us consider one mode only . \n ( note that in this case @xmath30 can always be considered real as by virtue of our assumption about the vertical phase of modes @xmath31 may be written as @xmath32 $ ] , and the initial phase in @xmath33 can be chosen freely by a displacement of the time axis . ) we substitute ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) into ( 3 ) , simplify , and take the real part . to simplify the notation , from this point \n onwards we omit the hats . with this \n we arrive at @xmath34 this equation determines the fourier amplitude @xmath35 of each mode of horizontal wavenumber @xmath22 in the spectrum of turbulent

. \n is the fourier amplitude of the forcing . \n @xmath36 is the fluctuation amplitude produced in time @xmath37 by the forcing if other terms were not present . \n as the forcing is due to the action of the fluctuating flow field on the existing magnetic field , it is plausible to assume @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the corresponding fourier amplitude in the spectrum of @xmath1 , and @xmath40 is the eddy turnover time . \n this spectrum may be determined from closure calculations , numerical simulations and observations . \n its simplest representation is by two power laws joining in a peak at @xmath41 . \n thus , we represent the r.h.s . by @xmath42 where @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 otherwise . \n ( note that in fact a spectrum with two breaks might be more realistic as the spectrum of @xmath37 is peaked at a lower wavenumber of @xmath46 ; our purpose here , however , is just to present a simple example calculation . ) \n on the basis of the observed properties of photospheric magnetic fields and motion , @xmath47 seems to be a realistic choice . \n the value of @xmath45 will be found to be irrelevant to the solution below . \n for the solution of equation ( 6 ) the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath37 are interpolated from a convective zone model . \n @xmath49 is evaluated by fitting a solution of equation ( 1 ) , with the diffusive term and the perturbations of the coefficients neglected , to profiles of @xmath50 resulting from the closure model of # deyoung##2##3#deyoung@xcite ( # deyoung##2##3##3@xcite ) ; this yields @xmath51 . \n the boundary conditions may be chosen as closed ( @xmath52 ) or open ( @xmath53 ) ; experimenting has shown that this does no exert a very strong influence on the resulting mode profiles . for the numerical solution of equation ( 6 ) \n we take @xmath24 as independent variable and use a relaxational method . \n the vertical profiles of some fourier modes in the spectrum of fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic field are shown in figure 1 . as expected , the modes with larger horizontal scales have their maxima in deeper layers \n .    computing a large number of modes and plotting their amplitudes near the surface against @xmath22 yields the fourier spectrum of the fluctuations in the turbulent magnetic field ( fig .  2 ) . \n experimenting with the parameters in equation ( 6 ) we find that the choice of @xmath45 is irrelevant for the spectrum , @xmath54 determines its amplitude , while @xmath55 and @xmath49 determine the shape of the spectrum . \n a striking feature of the spectra in figure 2 is that their maxima fall to significantly lower wavenumbers than @xmath56 , i.e.  the characteristic scale of the fluctuations in turbulent magnetic flux density is much larger than the typical scale of turbulent motions . \n the physical background of this phenomenon is that the high wavenumber components are more efficiently suppressed by diffusion ( @xmath57 term in eq . \n the wavenumber of the maximum increases with @xmath49 ( dashed vs.  dash - dotted curves ) , as a stronger nonlinear saturation reduces the role of the diffusive terms in the equation . on the other hand , \n the spectral amplitude at even lower wavenumbers depends strongly on the spectral index @xmath55 of the forcing ( dashed vs.  solid curves ) clearly , the shallower the forcing spectrum , the more energy is input at the larger scales . \n the results presented in the previous section were computed under the assumption that the fluctuations of @xmath1 have a small relative amplitude . \n this assumption is rather dubious in the light of the large fourier amplitudes found in the model ( fig .  1 ) . \n in order to have an idea about the extent to which nonlinear effects may modify the linear results , in this section we present an alternative model that calculates the fluctuating field without the assumption of linearity , at the cost of a strong simplification of the geometry : only @xmath58 modes are considered . \n this obviously implies that spatial spectra or correlation lengths can not be studied ; instead , we will compare the _ temporal autocorrelation of the fluctuations in the linear and nonlinear cases . _    for @xmath58 modes \n @xmath59 so we write equation ( 1 ) in the form @xmath60+b_f/\\tau\\ ] ] where the last term corresponds to fluctuation forcing by to the turbulent fluctuations of the velocity field . \n we model this term as a gaussian stationary random process with correlation time @xmath61 , vertical correlation `` length '' 1 ( in @xmath24 units ) , and a mean displacement of @xmath62 over @xmath37 \n .    equation ( 8) is then integrated numerically starting from an arbitrary perturbed initial state . \n an example solution is presented in figure 3 . \n figure 4 shows the autocorrelation of the fluctuating flux density as a function of the time shift for different cases . \n it is apparent ( dotted vs.  dashed curves ) that the correlation time is primarily determined by the value of the @xmath49 nonlinearity parameter , lower @xmath49 values corresponding to longer correlation times . this result is a close analogue to the findings of section 2 with respect to the spatial correlations . on the other hand \n , switching off the diffusive term in equation ( 8) ( dash - dotted vs.  dashed curves ) has no significant effect , showing that diffusive quenching of small spatial scales is _ not the mechanism responsable for the extended correlations here . replacing equation ( 8) with its linear equivalent ( solid vs.  dashed curves ) does not lead to great modifications in the results . \n this may reassure us to some extent of the reliability of the findings of section 2 above . _ \n the results of section 2 now enable us to answer the question posed at the end of the introduction . \n turbulent transport processes indeed result in a dominant scale for the fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic flux density that is an order of magnitude larger than the turbulence scale . \n the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is that small - scale fluctuations are more efficiently damped by diffusion , shifting the spectral peak to lower wavenumbers . \n the low value of the @xmath49 nonlinearity parameter suggested by closure calculations and simulations also favors larger dominant scales .    on the other hand , \n the possibility that deeper structures are `` imprinted '' on the photospheric pattern can apparently be discarded . \n switching off the first term ( vertical diffusion ) in equation ( 6 ) does not lead to any reduction of the dominant scales ( dotted vs.  dashed curves in fig . \n 2 ; dash - dotted vs.  dashed in fig . \n all this shows that the observations of strongly varying hanle depolarization over the solar disk may be understood from a theoretical point of view even if all the depolarization is attributed to turbulent fields . \n further advances on both the observational and theoretical side may make more detailed comparisons between the models and the observations possible , thereby offering the prospect of a direct observational diagnostics of the properties of the turbulent dynamo .", "StartTimeOffset": 1599516601686, "RequestID": "ecf9762dccc3a5ea14c7e4e663418dad62972168", "TotalTokens": 3840}
{"ContextTokens": 3176, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "the knowledge of the formation energy of solid surfaces is of obvious importance for surface physics and technology . given the difficulties of a direct measurement of the surface energy , accurate calculations @xcite of this quantity play a relevant role in surface science . \n the standard method for calculating the surface energy @xmath0 is to evaluate the total energy of a slab of the material of interest ( generally with a thickness between 5 to 15 layers ) and to subtract from that the bulk energy obtained from a separate calculation . \n this procedure singles out the total energy contribution due to the presence of the surface . \n it is based on the general and intuitively appealing expression @xmath1 with @xmath2 the total energy of a @xmath3-layer slab and @xmath4 the bulk total energy ; the limit is approximated in practice by the @xmath3th term . \n the factor of 1/2 accounts for the two surfaces of the slab . \n a central but often underestimated problem with this approach is what value should be chosen for the bulk energy . while at first sight this point might be dismissed as irrelevant , in a recent paper@xcite boettger pointed out that any difference between @xmath4 and the change in @xmath5 with slab thickness will cause the calculated surface energy to diverge linearly with @xmath3 . \n thus , increasing the slab thickness _ must _ sooner or later lead to unacceptable results , because the bulk energy from a separate calculation will never exactly equal the slope of the slab energy vs @xmath3 .    in ref . \n , severe errors incurred by this standard approach were reported . \n their unusual magnitude was presumably due to a technical matter , namely the use of two completely different methods for calculating the bulk and surface properties . \n thus , the practical importance of the divergent behavior of the surface energy remains unassessed for state - of - the - art methods , which carefully treat bulk and slab systems in the same way . \n the aim of this paper is to supply such an assessment . \n in particular , the natural objection to boettger s argument would be that , when using the same calculational method in a technically consistent way to obtain both bulk and slab quantities , this problem would simply not show up . \n we show in this paper that this is not the case : the proper choice of the bulk energy according to boettger s principle is an important issue in surface energy calculations even when the bulk and slab systems are handled consistently within accurate methods such as fp - lmto , pseudopotentials - plane waves , or such . \n further , we compare different approaches to remedy the problem , presenting what seems to be the best solution . as modern calculations advance to study more subtle surface effects and employ thicker slabs , these results will become increasingly relevant . \n in this section we present _ ab initio _ surface calculations demonstrating that the surface energy is not only formally , but also practically divergent for accurate calculations . to this end , we compare results obtained by the standard approach with those calculated using an alternative procedure suggested by boettger @xcite and with a modified approach to be described below . \n it will become clear that the latter method is the most reliable by a wide margin and should be prefered for high - accuracy applications .      for the standard methods , we first of all use eq . \n ( 1 ) whereby the bulk energy was obtained from a well - converged bulk calculation ( see below ) . \n we also considered the slightly modified version @xcite @xmath6 whereby the total energies needed are that of a slab containing @xmath3 layers ( @xmath2 ) and that of a @xmath7-atom bulk supercell consisting of the slab plus the vacuum space between the slabs filled with atoms ( @xmath8 ) . \n in other words , the weighted energy of the filled slab is taken as bulk energy . using eq . \n ( [ tre ] ) , many sources of difference between the slab and bulk energies can be eliminated since the same supercell is used for the bulk and slab systems , albeit at the cost of an increase in computational effort . for this approach \n , we used @xmath9 with n up to 11 . \n boettger@xcite suggested the following method to avoid the divergence problem . for each slab thickness @xmath3 , pick as bulk energy @xmath4 the differential increase in the slab total energy upon addition of one layer of material : @xmath10 where @xmath11 . \n this formula has the obvious merit of using only slab - related quantities , making no reference to separately - calculated bulk energies . \n consequently , the calculated surface energy should not suffer from the divergence problem of eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) . \n the price to pay is that of repeatedly calculating total energies for slabs of increasing thickness . at slight variance with ref . \n , we use @xmath12 in order to maintain inversion symmetry in our slabs .    as a fourth alternative \n , we note that as @xmath3 becomes large and convergence is approached , the definition of the surface energy in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) implies that @xmath13 this straight - line behaviour is already dominant for very thin slabs . \n this can be understood on the basis that the energy of a given atom is determined to a large extent by its nearest - neighbor environment @xcite . \n the most straightforward way to extract the quantity @xmath4 is to fit a straight line to all the slab total - energy data vs.  @xmath3 ( except for the thinnest slabs ) and to take its slope . \n this value is then used in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) . \n this procedure uses the same data needed in boettger s suggested approach . \n it is free of the divergence problem because no separately - calculated bulk energy enters . \n the only uncertainty in the procedure is the assumed onset of the straight - line behaviour ; indeed , apart from the very thinnest slabs , the error bar in @xmath4 when starting the fit at different @xmath3 s in the range from 3 to 13 is @xmath140.01 mry ( see also table i below ) .    as a test case , we report results for the surface energy of pt ( 001 ) , evaluated by the four schemes just described . \n total energies were calculated within the local density approximation to density functional theory @xcite , using the all - electron full - potential lmto method @xcite . \n slab thicknesses of up to 15 layers , and a vacuum spacing equivalent to seven bulk layers were used . \n the slabs were left unrelaxed in the ideal fcc geometry . \n the technical ingredients ( basis set , k - point summation , etc . ) are given in ref . . \n figure [ f - uno ] shows the calculated surface energies as function of slab thickness when the four described methods are used . \n the two approaches using a separately - calculated bulk energy [ eqs . \n ( [ uno ] ) and ( [ tre ] ) ] are shown by open circles and triangles , respectively . \n both evidently suffer from the divergence problem , shown by the linear decrease as the slabs are made thicker . \n boettger s approach ( taking the bulk energy as differential increase of the slab energy , filled diamonds ) does indeed give a surface energy which does not have this systematic linear behaviour . \n unfortunately , it shows large oscillations which decrease only very slowly as the slab is made thicker . \n if only these three techniques were available , the best legitimate conclusion would be that the surface energy lies somewhere between 1.21 and 1.26 ev / atom . \n this is an uncertainty of 5% even though slabs as thick as 15 layers were considered . \n the fourth technique ( fitting a straight line to the @xmath2 data to obtain @xmath4 ) is shown by filled squares . in comparison to the other approaches , very fast convergence to a stable value \n is achieved . \n we can now accurately determine the calculated surface energy to be 1.246 ev , a value which is numerically stable to within 0.5 mev . \n this reduces the uncertainty to below 0.1% . in order to suppress the weak residual oscillation , we averaged over the last three points in the curve : however , the deviations from the average are below 0.5 mev . \n ( for completeness , in table i we list the raw data for the slab total energies , where a constant offset of 36800 ry / atom was subtracted for convenience , and the bulk energies obtained by linear fittings to @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 starting at different values of the slab thickness @xmath3 . ) \n our main point here is that one should be wary of the standard technique ( which uses a separately calculated bulk energy ) even for calculations of high accuracy . \n we can compare the bulk energy as deduced from the slope of the @xmath2 data ( @xmath15  ry ) with that from the well - converged bulk crystal calculation ( @xmath16  ry ) , finding a difference of only 0.6  mry  @xmath17  ev . despite this very small discrepancy \n , the undesired linear behaviour in the calculated surface energy is already prominent for thicknesses of eight or more layers . \n the accumulated bulk error for the ( typically used ) slab thickness of around seven is already uncomfortably large , namely 4.2  mry @xmath18  ev . optimistically going to thicker slabs \n would soon lead to unacceptable values of the surface energy . \n although previously calculated surface energies using the standard technique with slab thicknesses of below ten layers can be considered reasonably reliable , it is clearly important to keep the problem addressed here in mind when doing surface calculations . \n to some extent , the severity of the problem will depend on the calculational method used . in terms of k - points and selfconsistency iterations , \n our bulk crystal energy was converged to within 0.01 mry . \n thus , the discrepancy in @xmath4 presumably comes from the k - point mesh for the slab , which consisted of 15 irreducible special points in the @xmath19 plane . \n it is highly desirable to be able to use a mesh of this typical size , independent of the exact _ ab - initio _ \n scheme used . in this context \n , our conclusions apply in exactly the same way to other methods . \n although our suggested scheme at first sight looks like a mere numerical procedure , there is a clear theoretical background to it . the squares in fig . \n 1 show small but definite oscillations of the surface energy as function of the slab thickness with a period of about six to eight layers . \n these quantum size effects are due to the finite thickness of the slab . \n the problem of boettger s scheme is that it artificially magnifies these oscillations by a large factor because the bulk energy is calculated from two slabs of similar thickness . \n a technique which exploits the overall linear behaviour of the @xmath2 data , such as ours , eliminates this problem .    finally , we point out that our tests up to now , while informative , used all the @xmath2 data up to @xmath3=15 to obtain the converged surface energy . in practice , \n the aim is to use the data from slabs up to a thickness of typically 7 to 9 layers . using the same procedure as before , \n this gives surface energies of 1.2456 and 1.2457 ev / atom , respectively . \n these values are much closer to the converged value than those of the three competing approaches . for completeness \n , we mention that analogous results have been obtained for al ( 001)@xcite , and rh and ir low - index faces @xcite , as will be presented elsewhere . \n in summary , it has been previously pointed out@xcite that the calculated surface energy will diverge with slab thickness if a bulk energy is used which is not exactly equal to the slope of the slab energy vs. slab thickness . here \n , we have investigated this phenomenon in the context of accurate state - of - the art computational methods which are careful to treat bulk and slab systems in the same way . \n the results show that the effect must be taken seriously for this type of calculation also . \n the problem can be easily solved by obtaining the bulk crystal energy directly as the slope of the @xmath2 data , but care should be taken to eliminate quantum size effects . \n this can be done by making an overall linear fit to the slab total energy as function of the thickness . \n m. methfessel , d. hennig , and m. scheffler , phys . \n rev . * b 46 * , 4816 ( 1992 ) ; v. fiorentini , m. methfessel , and m. scheffler , phys . \n lett . * 71 * , 1050 ( 1993 ) , j. c. boettger , phys . \n b * 49 * , 16798 ( 1994 ) . see _ e.g. _ r. j. needs , phys . \n lett . * 58 * , 53 ( 1987 ) . \n robertson , v. heine , and m.c . \n payne , phys . \n lett . * 70 * , 1944 ( 1993 ) . \n r. dreizler and e. k. u. gross , _ density functional theory _ , ( springer , berlin , 1990 ) . \n we use the exchange -

planar emission which is caused by galactic interactions or nuclear activity . \n the galaxy s size , i.e. the depth of the gravitational potential , is another parameter affecting the evolution of galactic halos . \n one of the main goals of this project is the determination of the energy budget in the halos ( magnetic field , thermal and radiation energy densities ) . \n ( @xcite ) x - ray observations presented here are used to detect previously unknown extended halo emission due to hot gas and/or to re - visit galaxies with known ( from earlier x - ray missions ) extra - planar x - ray emission features but now with a hitherto unreached sensitivity that can only be provided by deep   observations . \n such observations also allow us to investigate with unprecedented signal - to - noise the characteristics ( temperature , metallicity , energy density ) of the hot gas via x - ray spectroscopy . \n an earlier report on the status of our ongoing work was given by @xcite and @xcite . \n a more detailed motivation and general introduction of our multi - wavelength project can be found in the paper by m. dahlem ( this volume ) . \n this paper is based on  observations of the starburst galaxies ngc  1511 , ngc  4666 and ngc  3628 carried out as part of the guaranteed time proposal 011098 in july 2000 , june 2002 and november 2000 , respectively . \n the x - ray data have been cleaned for periods of high radiation background and images and spectra were generated with the science analysis system ( sas ) software package ( in its version 5.4.1 , except for ngc  1511 that was processed with 5.3.3 ) . \n we also made use of the epic background blank field files and tools provided by a. read @xcite . \n the starburst saa pec : h type galaxy ngc  1511 was studied as part of our project and x - ray results presented at this meeting have been published in @xcite . \n epic ( @xcite ) revealed for the first time the presence of a diffuse hot gaseous phase in ngc  1511 partly extending out of the disk plane . \n extra - planar emission due to cosmic rays and magnetic fields was earlier seen in radio continuum emission @xcite and is suggestive of a common origin for the outflow of these components of the ism . \n the x - ray spectral analysis of the integrated 0.2 - 12 kev emission ( excluding a strong point source about 30 north of the centre , which - if associated with ngc  1511 - might be an ultra - luminous @xmath0  erg s@xmath1 x - ray source ) showed a complex emission composition : one ( although not the only possible ) best - fitting model was found consisting of two thermal components and a power law contributing 12% ( 0.19 kev ) , 11% ( 0.59 kev ) and 77% ( powerl ) to the total flux , respectively . \n the finding that a spectral model with a single temperature gas component is not sufficient to describe the emission , points toward the fact that the x - ray emitting gas contains several phases . \n the best - fit model corresponding total x - ray luminosity ( @xmath2  erg s@xmath1 ) leads to a far - infrared - to - x - ray luminosity ratio for ngc  1511 which is typical for starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) . \n the optical monitor ( om , @xcite ) on board  was used to observe ngc  1511 in the uv during the x - ray observations and obtained images showing that this galaxy is heavily disturbed ( as it also can be seen in h@xmath3 ( @xcite ) and in the near infra - red ) . \n strong evidence for tidal interactions has only recently been obtained through h observations @xcite , unfortunately rendering ngc  1511 unsuitable as target galaxy to study the dependence of its gaseous halo s properties on the distribution and level of sf in the underlying disk . \n based on multi - wavelength ( optical , radio continuum and  x - ray observations ) , we ` classified ' ngc  4666 as a ` superwind ' sc galaxy @xcite harboring an extra - planar outflow cone emanating from a central sf region of @xmath4  kpc in radius , and having an opening angle of @xmath5 . \n the outflow could be traced up to @xmath6  kpc above the disk plane by optical emission line filaments . \n the  x - ray observations ( @xcite , see fig . \n [ fig_n4666_xray ] , left panel ) indicated the presence of soft extended x - ray emission outside of the disk on the north - western ( closer to us ) side of ngc  4666 . \n our  epic observation , in contrast , show for the first time that such soft x - ray emission exists on both sides of the galactic disk , originating from a huge , structured hot gas halo ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_xray ] , right panel , and fig . \n [ fig_n4666_multi ] ) . \n the diffuse emission detected by epic - pn is strong enough to allow us to perform a spectral analysis in several areas in the galactic disk and halo : the complex spectrum of the diffuse disk emission ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , top ) can be fitted by a combination of an internally absorbed mekal ( 0.54  kev ) and power law component plus another mekal model ( 0.18  kev ) all affected by galactic foreground absorption . the lower halo emission ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , middle ) shows a similar spectral behavior as the disk spectrum . \n the spectrum of the upper halo emission ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , bottom ) , however , does not need a second mekal component but is fitted reasonably well also with a single 0.23  kev thermal plasma . \n most of the total flux above 0.9  kev originates from the power - law type emission ( presumably due to unresolved point - like sources ) , whereas the thermal plasma clearly dominates in the soft 0.3 - 0.9  kev band ( contributing 72% , 69% and 92% to the ` diffuse ' disk , lower and upper halo emission , respectively ) . \n if the diffuse x - ray emission in the soft energy band is assumed to be due to hot gas , it is possible to calculate the gas density @xmath7 and its mass @xmath8 . to this end \n we used the model of thermal cooling and ionization equilibrium of @xcite where @xmath9 . \n the unknown filling factor @xmath10 allows for some clumpiness of the gas . \n if we fit all the spectra extracted from the three areas with a single - temperature mekal model , the unabsorbed flux in the 0.3 - 12  kev and corresponding luminosity ( adopting @xmath11  mpc ) are given in tab . \n [ tab_n4666 ] . for the gas temperatures of the hot gas , @xcite give a cooling coefficient @xmath12 of @xmath13 erg @xmath14 s@xmath1 . \n assuming an ellipsoid for the disk and the outflow cone geometry ( see above ) for the emitting halo volume @xmath15 , and typical volume filling factors of 0.1 - 0.8 , we derive gas densities and masses listed in tab . \n [ tab_n4666 ] . \n lcccccc & t & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 + & & & & & & + disk & @xmath21 & 7.21 & 5.97 & 1.0 -

[ tab_n4666 ] ) , and hence the magnetic field important for the dynamics of the hot gas ( ` channeling ' the outflow ) , in the lower halo the relatively high thermal energy density is supportive of the idea that in this region the gas outflow might easily take place , even against a disk - parallel magnetic field configuration .    a detailed analysis of the halo emission and a possible correlation with h@xmath3 and radio polarization filaments ( \n as started in @xcite , see also fig . \n [ fig_n4666_multi ] ) will be addressed in an upcoming paper by ehle et al . ; there we also plan to present a self - consistent dynamical and thermal spectral model @xcite which does no longer depend on the usual assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) . \n we note that the same  observations have been discussed by @xcite comparing the disk - emission with spatially unresolving _ bepposax _ data . \n the authors discuss their findings with respect to the discovery of starburst plus agn activity both contributing to the x - ray emission of ngc  4666 : the sf activity was found to be extended over most of the disk and associated with diffuse thermal emission , whereas the quite small low - luminosity type-2 agn contribution ( revealed by prominent k@xmath3 line emission from `` cold '' iron at 6.40  kev ) was detected from the nuclear region .    in ngc  4666 , @xcite failed to detect conclusive evidence for the existence of h gas in its halo . \n however , seen in their h maps are prominent tidal arms probably generated by interactions with the galaxy ngc  4668 and previously undetected dwarf companions . \n the high sf rate responsible for the superwind of ngc  4666 hence might be triggered by gravitational interaction . \n ngc  3628 is a peculiar sbc galaxy known to be an interacting member in the leo triplet ( arp 317 , assumed distance @xmath27  mpc ) . \n earlier x - ray observations with _ einstein _ @xcite and  ( @xcite , see fig . \n [ fig_n3628_rosat+xmm ] , left panel ) showed evidence for a collimated outflow along the minor axis from a starburst nucleus in ngc  3628 and led to the detection of an extended soft x - ray halo . \n our xmm - newton observations ( fig . \n [ fig_n3628_rosat+xmm ] , right panel ) are able to detect the extraplanar diffuse emission with much higher significance : the epic image clearly separates the southern collimated spur - like halo emission from nearby ( most possibly background ) point sources ( see fig . \n [ fig_n3628_xmm+opt ] , left panel ) and calls the proposed link between this x - ray filament and qsos @xcite to question .    a detailed comparison of the diffuse extraplanar x - ray emission with for example the h@xmath3 filaments ( a plume extending about 130 to the sw in position angle @xmath28 and faint more widespread filamentary extraplanar structures to the north - see h@xmath3 map from @xcite or @xcite and fig .  [ fig_n3628_xmm+opt ] , right panel ) is ongoing . \n in the framework of our multi - wavelength project to investigate gaseous halos around late - type spiral galaxies and their dependence on the level of star - formation activity in the underlying disks ( cf . \n m. dahlem ( this volume ) ) we showed in this paper x - ray results from three of our sample galaxies . \n the presented observations demonstrate that only with the advent of high sensitivity observatories ( like ) , it is becoming possible to detect and study in detail the hot halo gas component of the interstellar medium . \n our original sample selection criterion ( based on far infra - red colors , see @xcite and references therein ) , that showed to be a good tool to select candidates for the search for radio halos , is likely to also work in the x - ray regime . in all three  targets \n we find extra - planar x - ray emission which is bright enough to allow us detailed spectral investigations and also to test model assumptions ( i.e. collisional ionization equilibrium versus radiative cooling with the dynamics in full non - equilibrium ) . \n we note the co - existence of extra - planar soft x - ray emission above the most actively star forming regions in the galactic disk and the co - existence of such features with h@xmath3 filaments as well as vertical magnetic field structures ( in case of ngc  4666 ) . \n ehle , m. , dahlem , m. , jimnez bailn , e. , santos - lle , m. , & read , a. m. 2004 , in iau symp . \n 217 , recycling intergalactic and interstellar matter , eds . \n duc , j. braine , e. brinks , san francisco : astronomical society of the pacific , 154", "StartTimeOffset": 1624556699688, "RequestID": "8e69146f2283e33e0871c442b1045629bb0d5746", "TotalTokens": 3275}

[ elpl ] ) . \n below of this line the parameters of elasticity are almost constants with @xmath83 . above this limit \n the stiffness decreases as a result of open contacts , giving rise to an anisotropic elastic response .    in a previous work @xcite , the elasto - plastic quantities resulting form eq . \n ( [ plastic ] ) and eq . \n ( [ elastic ] ) have been evaluated as a function of the stress state . since the mechanical response of soils depends not only on the initial stress state but also on the way how this state is reached @xcite , these results are only valid in the case of monotonic load . in the classical theory of elasto - plasticity , \n the dependence of the strain response on the history of the deformation is described by the evolution of the so - called _ \n yield surface_. this surface encloses a hypothetical region in the stress space where only elastic deformations are possible @xcite .    we attempt to detect the yield surface by using a standard procedure proposed in experiments with sand @xcite . \n [ yield ] shows this procedure : initially the sample is subject to isotropic pressure . \n then the sample is loaded in the axial direction until it reaches a the yield - stress state with pressure @xmath39 and shear stress @xmath40 . since plastic deformation \n is found in this stress value , the point @xmath84 can be considered as a classical yield point . \n then , the classical theory assumes the existence of a yield surface containing this point . in order to explore the yield surface , \n the sample is unloaded in the axial direction until it reaches the stress point with pressure @xmath85 and shear stress @xmath86 inside the elastic regime . \n then the yield surface is constructed by taking different directions in the stress space for re - loading . in each direction , the new yield point must be detected by a sharp change in the slope in the stress - strain curve , indicating plastic deformations . \n [ de ] shows the strain response taking different load directions in the same sample . if the direction of the reload path is the same as that one of the original load ( @xmath87 ) , we observe a sharp decrease of stiffness when the load point reaches the initial yield point , which corresponds to the origin in fig . \n however , if we take a different direction of re - loading , we find that the decrease of the stiffness with the loading becomes smooth . \n since there is no straightforward way to identify those points where the yielding begins , the yield function , as it was introduced by drucker & prager @xcite in order to describe a sharp transition between the elastic and plastic regions is not consistent with our results . \n the incremental elasto - plastic response of a voronoi tessellated sample of polygons has been examined in the framework of the classical theory . \n the resulting constitutive relation leads to non - linear , anisotropic elasticity , where the classical parameters of elasticity , the young modulus and the poisson ratio , are not material constants . \n the plastic response reflects the non - associated features of realistic soils . here \n the classical analysis of drucker & prager is not applicable , because it is not possible to determine an elastic regime . \n future work will be oriented to a micro - mechanically based description of these elasto - plastic features . \n since the mechanical response of the granular sample is represented as a collective response of all the contacts , it is expected that the macro - mechanical response can be completely characterized by the inclusion of some field - variables , which contain the information about the micro - structural arrangements between the grains . \n some statistical variables like the fabric tensor have been included as internal variables @xcite . \n this description , however , does not seem to offer a complete characterization of the constitutive response . \n more salient aspects , such as the yielding of the contacts , and the fluctuations of the stress inside the granular material , might offer a more complete set of internal variables for the description of the macroscopic state . \n this is , in our point of view , an important challenge in the future . \n we thank f. darve , p. vermeer , f. kun , and j. strm for helpful discussions and acknowledge the support of the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ within the research group _ \n modellierung kohsiver reibungsmaterialen_.", "StartTimeOffset": 1629387685932, "RequestID": "bfe19540c984a8894457b3754d718ab072713e43", "TotalTokens": 3613}

know property is the existence of photonic band gaps , i.e. , regions of frequencies where electromagnetic wave propagation is prohibited . \n another equally important aspect of a phc is the existence of an unconventional ultra - strong dispersion . \n such an ultra - strong dispersion was firstly reported by lin _ \n et al . _ and demonstrated experimentally in the millimeter - wave spectrum  @xcite . \n et al . _ subsequently demonstrated the superprism effect in a highly dispersive photonic microstructure  @xcite . \n these unusual properties provide an exciting possibility for obtaining microphotonic and nanophotonic devices that can focus , disperse , switch , and steer light . \n optofluidics , the marriage of nano - photonics and micro - fluidics , refers to a class of optical systems that integrate optical and fluidic devices  @xcite . due to unique properties of fluids , \n such integration provides a new way for dynamic manipulation of optical properties and shows many potential applications  @xcite . \n in particular , phcs are interesting for optofluidics since they naturally have voids where fluids can be injected . \n optical properties of the phc can be easily reconfigured by selectively filling specific voids with liquid . \n et al . _ demonstrated an ultra compact biosensor employing a two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystal microcavity  @xcite . \n recently , we proposed simple biosensor structures based on highly dispersive phc waveguides  @xcite . in this paper \n we will propose biosensor structures based on complete phcs and the strong dispersion occuring near the brillouin zone . \n in particular , the bandgap edges of the phcs are strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the liquid which is used to tune the dispersion of the phc . \n the suggested structures show a potential for biochemical sensing applications . \n let us first consider a 2d triangular phc with air holes extending through a high index @xmath1 dielectric material , shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - tri ] . \n the holes have a radius of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the lattice constant . here \n , we will focus our study on transmission spectra of the phc with air holes being filled with different liquids . \n it was shown in our previous work that both the surface termination and surface direction of the phc are critical for high transmission ( i.e. , coupling ) at an interface between air and the phc  @xcite . \n consider the te - polarized ( magnetic field parallel to the air holes ) light normally incident into the phc . to enhance the coupling at the interface , we choose to couple light to the phc along the @xmath4 direction , i.e. \n , the surface of the phc slab is along @xmath5 direction . \n the symmetric phc slab is composed of 11 layers along the @xmath4 direction and the distance ( surface termination ) between right boundary and the centers of the first right holes is @xmath6 . \n transmission spectra for the phc are obtained using the 2d finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method  @xcite . for this case \n , we use the periodic condition in @xmath5 direction and perfectly matched layers in the @xmath4 direction @xcite as the numerical boundary treatment . \n figure  [ trans - tri ] shows transmission spectra for the phc with air holes being filled by different liquids with the refractive index increasing from @xmath7 to @xmath8 in steps of @xmath9 . \n one can see clearly that there exist band gaps for the phcs . \n transmissions outside the band gaps are quite large and close to unity for some frequencies \n . peaks in the transmissions arise from the fabry \n perot oscillations from the two boundaries and the shifts of peaks are due to the change of the effective index of the phc when filling air holes with different liquids . \n for the present application we are not interested in the details of the fabry \n perot pattern in fig . \n [ trans - tri ] , but rather the spectral position of the band - gap edge which is a highly sensitive measure for changes in the refractive index of the liquid . to see it more clearly \n , the change of the band - gap edge as a function of the refractive index of the liquid is shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - tri ] . as seen \n , the low - frequency mode - gap edges slightly change with the refractive index of the liquid . however , the high - frequency mode - gap edge is strongly dependent on the refractive index of the liquid , as shown by squares in fig . \n [ bandedge - tri ] . as an example , the high - frequency band - gap edge shifts @xmath10 when the air holes ( with index @xmath11 ) are filled by a liquid of index @xmath12 . for comparison , it is only @xmath13 for the low - frequency band - gap shift . \n now , consider a commercial silicone fluid with a calibrated refractive - index accuracy of @xmath14 , as mentioned in ref . \n @xcite , where the refractive index of the liquid varies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in increments of @xmath17 . for the working wavelength around @xmath18 ( here we choose @xmath19 ) , the high - frequency band - gap edge shifts up to 1.17  nm for @xmath14 , while 0.33  nm for the low - frequency band - gap edge . for comparison \n , we note that the shift in resonant wavelength for the high - quality - factor phc cavity is about @xmath20 nm for @xmath14  @xcite . \n the above results demonstrate that even such a simple phc has potential applications as a sensitive biosensor .    to further elucidate the physics behind the strong sensitivity \n , we next support the picture by dispersion calculations for the phc . for this purpose \n we use a block - iterative frequency - domain method  @xcite . \n the dispersion of the phc , in absence or presence of a fluid , is shown in fig . \n [ band - tri ] . \n figure  [ band - tri ] ( a)-(f ) summarize the dispersions for the phc , where the air holes are filled by a liquid with a varying refractive index . \n one can clearly see that these phcs have photonic band gaps for the te polarization , which are related to the band gaps in fig . \n [ trans - tri ] , though the band - gap regions appear slightly different with those obtained from the transmission spectra . \n note that the band gaps in fig . \n [ trans - tri ] are larger than those in fig . \n [ band - tri ] . \n this is because the band gaps in fig . \n [ band - tri ] are for all incident directions while the band gaps in fig . \n [ trans - tri ] are only for propagation along the normal direction . from figs . \n [ trans - tri ] and  [ band - tri ] , we also observe that the position of the gap in the transmission spectra , which are obtained for plane electromagnetic waves incident normally on the phc , agree very well with the position of the gaps in the frequency band structure of the corresponding infinite crystal along the @xmath4 direction ( denoted by red regions ) . \n when increasing the refractive index of the liquid [ going from panel ( a ) toward panel ( f ) ] , the high - frequency band - gap edge is significantly downward shifted , while the low - frequency band - gap edge slightly decreases . \n we emphasize that all results obtained from band structures are consistent with those from the transmission spectra . \n the sensitivity of this structure is mainly attributed to the strong dispersion of the phc mode . \n figures  [ field](a ) and  [ field](b ) show the first and second phc bloch modes at the band - gap edge ( @xmath21 point , @xmath22 ) , where air holes in the phc are filled by the liquid with a refractive index of @xmath7 , @xmath23,and @xmath24 , respectively . as seen \n , the low - frequency band - edge bloch mode hardly changes with varying refractive index of the liquid . \n however , for the high - frequency band - edge mode , the ratio of the energy in holes becomes lager as the refractive index of the liquid increases , i.e. , this mode distribution is strongly dependent on the refractive index of the liquid , which is in agreement with the results in figs . \n [ trans - tri]-[band - tri ] . \n a somewhat similar structure has been realized experimentally by okamoto _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite , but in this paper we have studied the shift for the band - gap edges in details an offered a physical explanation for the shifts . besides , compared to the device in ref . \n @xcite , our proposed device offers a better resolution . \n let us next consider a square phc with dielectric rods in air , as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - squ ] . \n the permittivity of the rods is @xmath1 , and the radius of the rods is r=0.2a . \n transmission spectra are shown in fig . \n [ trans - squ ] , where the background of the phc is filled by different liquids . \n the band - gap edge as a function of the refractive index of the liquid is shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - squ ] . \n similar to the result shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - tri ] , the low - frequency band - gap edge hardly changes as the refractive index of the liquid increases , while the high - frequency band - gap edge is strongly dependent on the liquid . \n compared with the result for the high - frequency band - gap edge shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - tri ] , the results in fig . \n [ bandedge - squ ] illustrate a higher sensitivity . \n the high - frequency band - gap edge shifts @xmath25 when the air holes are filled by a liquid of index @xmath12 . for comparison \n we have @xmath10 for the structure shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - tri ] . \n band structures are shown in fig . \n [ band - squ ] , where red regions represent the band gap for @xmath26 direction . from fig . \n [ trans - squ ] and fig . \n [ band - squ ] , we find that the position of the gap in the transmission spectra agree very well with the position of the gaps for the phc along the @xmath4 direction . when increasing the refractive index of the liquid [ going from panel ( a ) toward panel ( f ) ] , \n the high - frequency band - gap edge is significantly downward shifted , while the low - frequency band - gap edge slightly decreases . \n again we consider a commercial silicone fluid with a calibrated refractive - index accuracy of @xmath14 . for the working wavelength around @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the mode - gap edge shifts up to 1.60  nm for @xmath0 . \n the proposed biosensor relies strongly on the dispersion of the phc band - edge mode and the presence of a band gap . \n to further improve the sensitivity , we optimize the phc structure by varying the radius of the rods . by a careful design of the structure shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - squ ] , we have been able to improve the design further . for the working wavelength around @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the band - gap edge shifts about 1.8  nm for @xmath0 , when @xmath27 is tuned to @xmath28 . \n compared to the biosensor we proposed before  @xcite , this structure not only shows much better sensitivity but it also seems relatively easy to realize experimentally , since the design involves no cavities or waveguide structures . \n finally , this device , with a size of @xmath29 , is sufficiently compact for most applications . \n to conclude , we have theoretically studied optofluidic biosensors based on highly dispersive 2d photonic crystal . \n our study shows that these structures are strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the liquid , which is used to tune dispersion of photonic crystal . for the working wavelength around @xmath30 , \n we predict shifts in the band - gap edge up to 1.8  nm for @xmath0 . \n although our study is based on 2d photonic crystals , it can be extended to the case of a 2d photonic crystal slab . for a 2d photonic crystal slab \n , the field will attenuate due to out - of - plane loss , but the shift of the high - frequency mode - gap edge at x / m point ( when tuning by liquid ) is unaffected by the out - of - plane radiation . \n the high sensitivity makes such devices interesting for biochemical sensing applications . \n this work is financially supported by the _ danish council for strategic research _ through the _ strategic program for young researchers _ ( grant no : 2117 -

\n such a question is prompted by many situations , often associated to the automated collection of data . \n we are motivated to address this question by our experimental field work to record the behaviour of the strength of optical turbulence parameter , @xmath0 , over time intervals of several weeks , under different climate conditions @xcite . \n the data of interest to us are path integrated measures of @xmath0 measured across the visible to near infrared region . \n the measurement path is a 600 m stretch of free space , approximately 1.5 m altitude above sea water in the caribbean . \n the probe beam originated from an led centered on 0.9 @xmath1 m ; the instrumentation are two identical optical scientific inc . \n loa-004 systems , which employ aperture averaging to estimate the value of @xmath0 . \n the loa-004s are generally left unattended over the course of up to a few days during field operation , which mean that they are susceptible to spurious events which result in gaps in the data record . \n although for some types of data analysis techniques , data gaps of a limited size can be tolerated , this is not universal . \n moreover , there exists a new class of very powerful techniques based on empirical mode decomposition @xcite that are exceedingly sensitive to lossy datasets . \n it is for this reason we are exploring different methodologies to synthetically fill the data holes ; we describe the results from our studies using principal component analysis in this paper . \n the principal components of any ensemble can be used to identify the members of that ensemble . \n this idea forms the foundation of face recognition and tracking through _ eigenfaces _ ( see , for example , turk and pentland 1991 @xcite ) . we may extend this method to reconstruct the missing data for any data record under given restrictions . \n the key point is that the gappy data record must have the same , or similar , salient features as all the members of the ensemble . \n the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data and represent the features of the dataset . provided that a reference library can be created \n , each member of the library will contribute to each eigenvector , more or less . \n as such , each member can be exactly represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors . \n any similar data record external to the library will also be represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors , within a margin of error . \n the first step for the filling procedure must therefore be to define the reference library . \n we may do so by collecting a family of turbulence data series that share certain specific characteristics ; a difficult task since the definition of such is an open question . \n moreover , since the mean value of the family of reference data plays a key part , all the members of the library would require normalisation . again how to do this is an open question . \n alternatively we may use the neighbouring record around a data hole , sectioning this information to provide the ensemble members . \n we opt for the latter technique since the record pre and post the data hole ( within a certain time interval ) ought to be similar in nature to the missing data . \n the mean value of this type of library would probably not differ greatly from the mean of the missing data , so normalisation would not be so crucial . \n how does one determine the principal components of a reference library ? \n following sirovich and kirby @xcite , let the @xmath2 members ( each of length @xmath3 ) of the reference ensemble be @xmath4 . \n thus , the average data record of this ensemble will be @xmath5 it is very reasonable to assume that departures from the mean record will provide an efficient procedure for extracting the primary features of the data . \n therefore , we define @xmath6 now , if we consider the dyadic matrix @xmath7 where each term of the sum signifies a second rank tensor product , we can recognize this as the ensemble average of the two point correlation of the deviations from the mean . here , @xmath8 is the transpose of @xmath9 . \n we require eigenvectors @xmath10 of the matrix @xmath11 . for ensembles \n whose members have a large number of points @xmath12 , matrix @xmath11 issingular and its order can not exceed @xmath2 . \n to find those eigenvectors of @xmath11 corresponding to nonzero eigen values , turk and pentland used a standard singular value decomposition technique , as described below . \n @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the eigenvalues . \n this deduction can be equated to @xmath15 where @xmath16 . \n thus @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the same eigenvalues and their eigenvectors are related through @xmath16 , provided that @xmath19 . \n the treatment described is recognizable as the karhunen \n love ( kl ) method @xcite . \n the implication is that a dataset @xmath20 can be obtained from a limited summation @xmath21 where the coefficients @xmath22 are obtained through the inner product @xmath23 we emphasise that @xmath20 is not considered to be part of the @xmath24 , although it is similar in features . \n to demonstrate the validity of the assertion of the previous section , we take a perfect data record of @xmath0 measurements over a 7 hour period starting from midnight , smoothed by a forward moving rolling average of 5 minutes interval ( 60 data points ) . \n the data contain 2492 points in total . \n the test data , split into 21 sections . \n the data are padded before division with a set of points taken from the tail of the time series and mirrored outward . ] \n we split up the test data into 21 sections , where all but 1 are members of the reference library , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : cn2data ] . \n the exclusive section is set to zero , and the algorithm described in sec . [ \n sect : pca ] is employed on the 20 library elements . \n the reconstructions are created from the kl coeffiecients of the eigenvectors equivalent to the sections adjacent to the missing data . \n hence we will talk of a prior and posterior reconstruction meaning e.g. for omitted section 5 , we use for the prior the kl coefficient equivalent to section 4 and for the posterior reconstruction we use the coefficient equivalent to section 6 of the test data set . \n note that this does not reconstruct those sections , since the eigenvectors are generated from the entire reference library . \n the reconstructions shown in the left hand set of fig . \n [ fig : klresult ] represent the best level of error , while the right hand set shows the worst . \n it is clear that the greater the difference between the ( masked off ) original data section and its neighbours , the poorer the reconstruction will be . \n nevertheless , the reconstruction errors for the full set of test data are all 1 order of magnitude less than the mean value of the reconstruction and the original data segment . \n evidently the end points have not been synthesised to be continuous with the adjacent segments of the reference library signal , as can be seen from the error . \n a continuity condition in terms of the both the function and its derivative has to be imposed on both ends of the reconstructed segment in order to achieve smoothness . \n the most effective way to do so is currently being investigated . \n \\(a )   best and worst reconstruction result using pca for ( a ) section 5 and ( b ) section 13 respectively . \n the layout in each set is : ( top left ) segment prior to the selection . \n ( top middle ) the original selected data . \n ( top right ) segment after selection . \n ( centre left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient of eigenvector related to the prior segment and the original . \n the value shown is the mean absolute difference per pixel . \n ( centre right ) the ( prior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient related to the posterior segment and the original . \n ( bottom middle ) the ( posterior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom right ) the eigenvalue spectrum.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( b )   best and worst reconstruction result using pca for ( a ) section 5 and ( b ) section 13 respectively . \n the layout in each set is : ( top left ) segment prior to the selection . \n ( top middle ) the original selected data . \n ( top right ) segment after selection . \n ( centre left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient of eigenvector related to the prior segment and the original . \n the value shown is the mean absolute difference per pixel . \n ( centre right ) the ( prior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient related to the posterior segment and the original . \n ( bottom middle ) the ( posterior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom right ) the eigenvalue spectrum.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the eigenvalues determined through this method show a similar distribution in both cases , with minor variations only at the upper end of the spectrum , implying that the kl differences between best and worst section for reconstruction is not very large .      in the absence of a workable continuity condition \n , we present here the effects of crudely patching the data hole with reconstructions determined from the prior and posterior terms with respect to the gap . \n we apply the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) algorithm @xcite to the reconstructions . \n emd is a novel adaptive method for separating a nonlinear time series into components based on instantaneous frequency . \n basically it acts as a dyadic filter bank @xcite ; the set for the best reconstruction case are illustrated in figs . \n [ fig : emd ] . \n we refer to these sets as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n the original data s intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) and residuals ( set @xmath27 ) are also shown and for comparison , we present the effect of a simple minded linear interpolation between the endpoints of the known data on the imfs .    upon visual inspection , we see that the original data generates 9 components : 8 intrinsic modes and 1 residual ( the stopping criterion for our emd implementation is the same as in huang _ \n et al _ @xcite ) . \n on the other hand , the interpolated data have only 8 components . numbering the imfs from highest instantaneous frequency to lowest , \n starting from imf 1 , we can see by inspection that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are strongly similar to @xmath27 in imfs 4,5,6 and 7 . \n the differences appear in the higher frequency components , due to the discontinuity between the inserted segment and the unadulterated data . \n the endpoint discontinuities evidently modify the variances of imfs 1,2 and 3 , although it seems that they are only affected in the area local to the discontinuity , per imf .    by way of comparison , \n a linear interpolant between the edges of the known data show that there is contamination all through the imfs . \n it is so strong that imf 7 , which in the other sets clearly distinguishes the baseline rise and fall of the turbulence over the interval under study , is unable to pick out a clean pedestal .    [ \n cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we applied an arima(0,@xmath28,0 ) model to predict the behaviour of the final section of the split test data . \n the length of each section is 119 points long ; by basing the data behaviour on the previous 2373 points and by setting the difference operator to be @xmath29 we generated the imf results shown in fig . \n [ fig : emdarima ] .    as can be seen \n , the effect of the arima(@xmath30 ) extrapolation is to fill in the higher order imfs in a smooth fashion ( apparently , by visual inspection , imfs 5 to 8 are smoothly filled at the tail ) . \n it is only untrustworthy when considering the higher frequency components , because arima considers only the conditional first moment . \n note that the number of imfs and residual are the same as the unadulterated signal @xmath27 . \n we have discussed a data hole filling method for stochastic data , a necessary step to be able to use the new technique of empirical mode decomposition upon a time series record . \n the karhunen \n love eigenvectors from an ensemble of neighbouring sections of complete data around a data hole can be used to reconstruct the missing segment to a reasonable degree of accuracy , at least for the purposes of applying emd . \n we have shown that the edge continuity is important , although the effect of discontinuities is not universal through all the intrinsic modes of the data . \n the quality of the reconstruction is much better using pca than a simplistic linear interpolant ( or merely ignoring the data gap ) . \n we compared this to a simplified arima(0,@xmath28,0 ) model , which performed better than the linear interpolant but less effectively than the kl algorithm , disregarding edge effects .    in summary , \n when a data hole is present , merely ignoring the data hole or filling it with a linear interpolant is a poor technique from the point of view of emd . \n the result of doing so leads to leakage of spurious effects both laterally in time ( per imf ) and longitudinally across all the imfs . by reconstructing the datagap with arima(@xmath31 ) \n one can limit the leakage laterally and longitudinally , although the lowest imfs remain strongly contaminated with artificial structure . \n kl reconstruction limits the leakage best , and even without considering the continuity between the adjacent sections and the reconstructed datagap , it promises to provide the best reconstruction of the three methods described in this paper . \n f.  santiago , m.  p.  j.  l. chang , c.  o. font , e.  a. roura , c.  wilcox , and s.  r. restaino , `` low altitude horizontal scintillation measurements of atmospheric turbulence over the sea : experimental results , '' _ proc . \n spie _ * 6014 * , 2005 . \n c.  o. font , m.  p. j.  l. chang , e.  oh , and g.  c. gilbreath , `` humidity contribution to the refractive index structure function @xmath0 , '' in _ atmospheric propagation iii _ , c.  y. young and g.  c. gilbreath , eds . \n spie _ * 6215 * , 2006 . \n m.  p. j.  l. chang , c.  o. font , g.  c. gilbreath , and e.  oh , `` humidity s influence on visible region refractive index structure parameter @xmath0 , '' _ applied optics ( accepted ) , arxiv physics e - prints _ * physics/0606075 * , june 2006 . \n n.  e. huang , z.  shen , s.  r. long , m.  c. wu , h.  h. shih , q.  zheng , n .- c . \n yen , c.  c. tung , and h.  h. liu , `` the empirical mode decomposition and the hilbert spectrum for nonlinear and non - stationary time series analysis , '' _ proc . \n ser . a _ * 454 * , pp . \n 903995 , 1998 . \n h.  e. stanley , l.  a.  n. amaral , a.  l. goldberger , s.  havlin , p.  c. ivanov , and c .- k . \n peng , `` statistical physics and physiology : monofractal and multifractal approaches , '' _ physica a _ * 270 * , pp .  309324 , 1999 . \n m.  p. j.  l. chang , e.  a. roura , c.  o. font , e.  oh , and c.  gilbreath , `` applying the hilbert - huang decomposition to horizontal light propagation @xmath0 data , '' in _ advances in stellar interferometry , _ these proceedings _ _ , _ proc . \n spie _ * 6268 * , 2006 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1638896666922, "RequestID": "e417b14b6d1726a15070fb44ee2fb0e81bd340aa", "TotalTokens": 3611}

linear effects . non - linear gravitational structure formation and redshift distortions move galaxies away from their original locations , blurring out the peak at 150 mpc separation , or , equivalently , erasing the higher harmonics in the power spectrum that represent smaller scales @xcite . even though the baryon bump remains _ \n measurable _ in the correlation function , these nonlinear effects reduce the _ precision _ of the distance scale that can be measured from a given volume of space , by roughly a factor of three at the present day . this loss is significant because survey volume is precious : larger surveys are more expensive and the amount of volume that we _ can _ survey in the low - redshift universe is limited . \n we argue in this paper that this loss of precision is avoidable . \n the blurring of the acoustic peak is largely due to bulk flows and super - cluster formation , effects that are generated by gravitational forces on large scales . the same map of galaxies intended to measure the acoustic scale is an accurate map of the large - scale gravitational source terms . \n one can essentially run the gravitational flow backwards to restore the acoustic peak nearly to its linear regime shape . \n numerical simulations show that the advancing scale of non - linear gravitational collapse erases the higher harmonics of the acoustic oscillations @xcite . \n @xcite note that the harmonic sequence in the power spectrum correspond to a single peak in the correlation function and that the damping envelope corresponds to the broadening of this peak . in the configuration - space view , the source of the late - time broadening is clear : matter is being moved by roughly 10 mpc from its initial position . \n @xcite build a model for the non - linearity in terms of the differential motion of pairs initially separated by 150 mpc . \n the final large - scale correlation function is simply the convolution of the linear correlation function with the distribution of differential motions . \n one can ask what scales are responsible for the differential motion . using the zeldovich approximation @xcite , the second moment of the distribution of the differential motion can be written as an integral over the power spectrum @xcite . \n the cumulant of the integrand is plotted in figure [ fig : zel ] . here \n we see that most of the motion is generated at @xmath3 . \n wavenumbers smaller than @xmath4 contribute little , because these perturbations affect both points equally . \n wavenumbers larger than @xmath5 contribute less because the cdm power spectrum is fairly red on these scales . \n the large - scale velocity field is responsible for most of the nonlinear effects that appear to  erase \" the high order acoustic peaks in the power spectrum . \n the motions are dominantly due to bulk flows and the formation of superclusters \n . small - scale formation of halos is subdominant ; even big halos only pull material from an average of @xmath6 away , about half the bulk flow motions . \n our major point is that because the scales of interest are large , the motions of galaxies can be well modeled by perturbation theory and in principle can be measured and removed . in the simplest terms , the bulk flows are generated by exactly the density perturbations that are being surveyed to measure the acoustic oscillations . \n the connection between the density and velocity field on these large scales is nearly that of linear theory , so one can predict the velocity field and undo the motion of the galaxies .    in more detail , reconstruction of the velocity field or the linear density field is a subject with considerable history . \n @xcite pioneered the subject by reconstructing the trajectories of local group galaxies using the principle of least action , with the goal of constraining the local value of @xmath7 . \n the simple `` gaussianization '' method of @xcite approached the problem from a cosmological perspective . @xcite and \n @xcite reconstructed primordial density fields with a technique based on the success of the zeldovich approximation in the quasilinear regime , similar to our technique described below . \n @xcite developed these techniques further ( and offered a comparison of several different methods ) . \n @xcite investigated a self - consistent , but more complicated , iterative scheme in which the initial densities source the lagrangian map , rather than the final densities . \n pursuit of this reconstruction method further may warrant using higher order relationships between peculiar velocities and densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the techniques of @xcite and @xcite are based on the principle of least action again , with the approximation that particles move on straight trajectories . \n as far as we know no one has attempted a full cosmologically relevant proper least action integration backwards in time , as the computational resources would be prohibitively expensive . \n reversing the sign of gravity and running an evolved simulation backwards would not work , at least in the realistic case in which there are errors or unconstrained dimensions in the galaxies phase space , because the decaying modes would overpower the growing modes as one went back in time . \n restoring in full the acoustic signature at @xmath8 is an undemanding application of these reconstruction techniques . to demonstrate that reconstruction can help , we here show a simple method . \n we take the @xmath0 outputs from the @xmath9 box n - body simulations from @xcite ( @xmath10 particles ) , compute the density field , fourier transform and filter with a gaussian of @xmath11 or @xmath12 width . from this , we predict the linear theory motion using @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lagrangian displacement field and @xmath15 is the fractional overdensity . \n we then move the particles by @xmath16 . \n we do the same for a reference grid of smoothly distributed particles . in redshift space \n , we account for the linear redshift distortions @xcite by boosting the displacements along the line of sight by an additional factor of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the linear growth function , and @xmath20 is the scale factor of the universe , a new density field is defined by the difference of the density field of the real particles and that of the reference particles . \n note that , in contrast to the work of @xcite , the point is not to move all of the particles back to their initial location , but rather to move the measured densities back to their initial location . \n the power spectrum of this field is shown in figure [ fig : recon ] . \n this figure is the average of power spectra from 30 simulations at @xmath0 . \n one can see the degradation of the higher harmonics at @xmath0 in the uncorrected density field , compared to the initial spectrum at @xmath21 , and see that the reconstruction has partially restored them . \n figures [ fig : xireal ] and [ fig : xired ] show the correlation functions in real and redshift space . \n the acoustic peak is nearly fully restored in real space . in redshift space , \n the peak is considerably improved but not fully fixed . \n when one predicts the large - scale displacement field , one is also predicting the large - scale velocity field and hence the correction for large - scale peculiar velocities in redshift space . \n this is important because @xcite find that redshift space distortions degrade the radial measurement of the acoustic peak . on large scales , \n the real - space displacements of particles are in the same direction as their peculiar velocity distortion , so the degradation of the acoustic peak is worse in redshift space than in real space . \n reconstruction can fix this . \n however , there are also redshift - space distortions from small - scale peculiar velocities , i.e. , fingers of god . clusters of galaxies appear as long cigars along the line of sight in redshift space . for the purposes of determining bulk flows \n , one should simply compress these fingers of god back to some approximation of their real - space location . without this step , \n the fingers of god get stretched out further by the reconstruction , degrading the acoustic signature . to show that finger - of - god compression can help the reconstruction \n , we have identified clusters in redshift space with an anisotropic friends - of - friends algorithm and moved all cluster particles to the center of mass of the cluster . \n the correlation function that results from running our reconstruction on the compressed density field is shown in figure [ fig : xired ] . \n one sees a modest but useful improvement . \n the simple reconstruction described above has not fully restored the linear acoustic scale , particularly when beginning from redshift space . \n we expect that more sophisticated reconstruction methods will produce further improvements . \n the small end of the range of the scales of interest are in the quasi - linear regime , and our assumption of linear theory for both the continuity equation and the redshift distortions is only a first approximation here . \n we use a fisher matrix calculation to estimate how much the reconstruction has improved the recovery of the acoustic scale . our calculation is based on the methods in @xcite but with the derivatives multiplied by a gaussian filtering that is tuned to match the pair - wise lagrangian displacement @xcite and that visually reproduces the smearing of the acoustic peak . \n we focus here on the spherically - averaged acoustic scale ; we will present anisotropic results ( i.e. , separate estimates for the angular diameter distance and the hubble parameter ) in a future paper . \n we find that at @xmath0 , in the absence of reconstruction , a survey of @xmath22 should produce a distance measurement of 1.4% from real space and 1.9% from redshift space . \n the real - space value is in good agreement from the jack - knife estimates from the simulated real - space power spectra in @xcite . \n the simple reconstruction presented in this section improves these measurements to 0.75% and 0.95% in real and redshift space , respectively . \n this is a factor of two improvement . \n we find that if the reconstruction were perfect , one could achieve 0.5% distances ( although shot noise from reasonable galaxy samples would degrade this to 0.550.60% ) . \n hence , the raw precision at @xmath0 is roughly a factor of 3.5 worse than the true cosmic variance , and the simplest reconstruction returns the first factor of two . at higher redshifts , \n the cosmic variance per unit volume wo nt change , but the data sets with or without reconstruction will be closer to that ideal . \n we have demonstrated that density - field reconstruction can restore the linear - regime contrast of the baryon acoustic signature . \n physically , the galaxy map locates the superclusters and voids and permits one to predict the large - scale flows resulting from these objects . by moving objects back to their initial location , one can correct the effect that these flows have on the characteristic separation of galaxies produced by the acoustic waves in the early universe . by restoring the linear - regime clustering \n , one can improve the precision of the measurement of the acoustic scale from galaxy redshift surveys and hence the available constraints on the cosmic distance scale and dark energy .    the opportunity for density reconstruction \n alters the optimization of surveys for baryon acoustic oscillations . \n low - redshift surveys were thought to suffer in performance per unit volume ; with reconstruction , this is not the case . given that dark energy is more important ( and hence easier to measure ) at lower redshift , this will tend to push the optimal redshift range lower . on the other hand , \n lower redshift surveys were generally designed at lower target densities , because the suppression of the higher harmonics meant that it was not necessary to measure @xmath23 well . \n now the opportunity exists to get acoustic oscillation information from the higher harmonics , so that one might want to reduce shot noise and measure @xmath23 well . in practice , with multiobject spectrographs , the number density at the highest redshifts will drop due to the flux limits imposed by a given exposure time , but at lower redshifts one can use the extra galaxies available to that flux limit , if one has sufficient number of fibers or slits .    do the redshift surveys aimed at acoustic oscillations have enough information to do density - field reconstruction ? \n acoustic oscillation surveys are designed to balance shot noise and sample variance at the wavenumbers where the acoustic oscillations are found , namely @xmath24 . \n if a survey is measuring at @xmath25 with shot noise below sample variance , then it is producing a reasonable fidelity map at exactly the wavenumbers required to do the reconstruction , as shown in figure [ fig : zel ] . turning this around , \n if the map is insufficient for reconstruction , it will also be too noisy to measure the power spectrum well ( i.e. , approaching the sample variance limit ) at the higher harmonics that one was hoping to improve . \n indeed , within the approximation of the linear - theory density - displacement relation , the desired weighting of each fourier mode to be used in reconstruction is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the comoving number density and @xmath28 is the power spectrum at that wavenumber . \n this is the same familiar factor that determines the measurement of modes in the power spectrum @xcite . \n hence , surveys designed to measure the acoustic oscillations with moderate signal - to - noise ratio maps will be well suited to reconstruction . \n one must remember that the reconstruction need not be perfect . \n the propagation of sound waves at the epoch of recombination has mild dispersion that gives the linear regime acoustic peak a width of about @xmath29 fwhm or @xmath30 rms width , comparable to the pairwise displacments of galaxies even at low redshifts @xcite . \n once we reduce the errors below this characteristic width , there is little improvement in the acoustic oscillations measurements . \n thus , reconstruction is easier at higher redshifts : the raw displacements are smaller , so one can accomplish sufficient reconstruction using only larger scales . \n even at @xmath31 , it is likely that reconstruction will benefit the recovery of the line - of - sight acoustic peak ( and hence @xmath2 ) , because @xcite shows that the redshift - space displacements are nearly double the real - space ones at @xmath32 and hence are not quite negligible even at @xmath31 . \n reconstruction places a premium on surveys with contiguous area . \n surveys with lots of gaps on 10 - 100 mpc scales will not measure the density field well enough to do these non - linear corrections : the source of bulk flows could be hidden in the gaps . \n some gaps , e.g. , due to bright stars , are inevitable and will degrade the reconstruction . \n holes of 1 mpc and smaller are less important ; these are not biasing the density field at @xmath33 much . \n of course , the reconstruction techniques themselves must be able to deal with this mildly gappy data . \n gaps are less of an issue at @xmath34 where reconstruction is not a large advantage . \n photometric redshift surveys for acoustic oscillations will not measure the 3-dimensional density field on the scales required to do density - field reconstruction . this is not a problem at @xmath35 , where the real - space density field is not degraded by non - linearities much anyways , but is a disadvantage relative to spectroscopic surveys at @xmath36 . \n much of the work on reconstruction has been focused on constructing the velocity field from the density field , or vice versa @xcite . \n we are actually interested in constructing the displacement field from the density field . in linear theory , the velocity and displacement fields are the same , but differences enter at higher order in perturbation theory . \n we expect that much of the work on velocity - field reconstruction will be applicable to the displacement - field problem , and we note that in detail the displacement field may be somewhat easier to infer , as virialization affects the velocity field substantially but the displacement field very little . \n the galaxies used in large - volume baryon acoustic oscillation surveys are typically biased , and it will be important to build reconstruction techniques that can handle this bias . \n again , one must remember that only modest performance is required of the reconstruction ; if one can fix half of the displacements , one will have achieved most of the gains . \n all that is required is that light trace mass reasonably well on large scales . \n this is well established by the simple behavior of bias ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , the detection of large - scale redshift distortions ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , and the galaxy - mass cross - correlation measured from weak lensing @xcite . the errors that enter from imperfect knowledge of the underlying cosmology or exact level of bias ( e.g. , the value of the redshift distortion factor @xmath37 ) are much smaller than the required reconstruction precision .    finally , \n while reconstruction can improve the precision of the acoustic scale measurement , one must also verify that the measurement remains unbiased . \n this will require further work , as one must also decide in detail how one is measuring the distance information from the observed clustering , particularly in the case of an anisotropic clustering analysis . \n one would expect reconstruction to at least partially fix any bias that enters from non - linear gravity , but this has not yet been studied at the sub - percent level . \n we thank martin white for useful conversations . \n dje and hs are supported by grant ast-0407200 from the national science foundation . \n dje is further supported by an alfred p.  sloan research fellowship . \n dns and es are partially supported by nasa atp grant nng04gk55 g . \n es is also supported as a picasso fellow through the nsf igert program .", "StartTimeOffset": 1663295003958, "RequestID": "a4f1aeda86fe8f20e0c83b3686c86075ade2d976", "TotalTokens": 4176}

ray sources . \n the crab nebula was imaged by both the high resolution imager ( hri ) and the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) aboard the einstein observatory . \n a quantitative display of the hri data is presented in figure 1a . \n this is the azimuthally summed , radially binned sbp . \n the binning neglects the ellipticity of the nebula , and is centered roughly 16 arcseconds northwest of the pulsar at the centroid of the light in the phase - averaged image . \n three things are readily apparent : ( 1 ) the surface brightness drops off dramatically beyond about 50 arcseconds , ( 2 ) a bump in this trend kicks in at about @xmath1 arcseconds , and ( 3 ) we run out of the hri s field of view just when things are getting interesting . \n this brings us to the ipc data . \n we gain with the ipc in two ways : with its wide field of view ( @xmath2 arcminutes ) , and with its lower background . \n both of these features allow us to track the sbp of the crab to very large radii . in exactly the same way as the hri sbp , this data is presented in figure 1b . \n again , three things are apparent : ( 1 ) due to this instrument s broad spatial resolution , the structure of the nebula is entirely lost , ( 2 ) the flair in the sbp is real , extending in roughly power - law form beyond @xmath3 arcseconds , and ( 3 ) there is no hint of a shell , which would appear as a shelf - like extension of the sbp . \n obviously , we could hide a shell under this profile if it were dim and/or small enough that it did nt disturb the power - law tail on the measured sbp . \n in this way , we could place an upper limit on the luminosity of a shell from a shock wave surrounding the crab . \n we will return to this later . \n in order to address the shapes observed for the sbps , we need to consider carefully the contributions of the point response function ( prf ) , which is due to the point response of the mirror and the spatial resolution of each detector . \n since the hri has extremely fine ( 0.5 arcsecond ) spatial resolution , its prf is the point response of the mirrors . \n the prf of the ipc ( fig . \n 2 ) is much more complicated due to its broad spatial resolution . \n conceptually , however , we expect the ipc s prf to be the convolution of the mirror response ( which is measured by the hri ) , and its own intrinsic spatial resolution . \n the prf for both the hri and the ipc were determined during calibration testing prior to the observatory s launch . \n an analysis of this data reveals that the prf for each instrument contains an appreciable amount of power at large radii due to the scattering of x - rays from surface imperfections in the mirror elements . \n this effect produces nearly power - law prfs for the hri , and adds similar wings onto the ipc s prfs , which are themselves dominated by the broad , nearly gaussian , spatial resolution of this instrument . \n this explains to zeroth order the observed sbps for the crab nebula ( fig .  1 ) . \n the excess surface brightness beyond @xmath4 arcseconds in the hri profile is due to scattering by the mirror elements of x - rays from the pulsar and nebula . \n similarly , the power - law wing on the ipc s sbp is attributable to x - rays scattered by the mirror , while the width of the core is due as much to the spatial resolution of the detector as to the extent of the nebula . \n upon closer examination , the sbp of the crab , as measured by the ipc , has too much power at large radii : typically , 10% of the power of the prfs falls beyond 3 arcminutes , whereas this fraction is 15% for the crab s sbp . \n note that the @xmath5 arcsecond extent of the nebula , being the order of , or smaller than , the spatial resolution of the detector , and in turn being so much smaller than the scale of the effect we are discussing here , insignificantly impacts this comparison . \n the difference of 5% between the measured sbp and the prf is of the order of the halo intensity reported by others for the crab . \n a more detailed investigation involves the construction of a model profile for the response of the ipc to the intrinsic sbp of the crab . \n this is handled in the following way . to first order \n , the hri measures the intrinsic sbp of the crab \n the differences between these being the effect of mirror scattering and the hri s 0.5 arcsecond spatial resolution . \n a second order approximation to the crab s intrinsic sbp would result if we could deconvolve the hri sbp with the hri s prf . \n we settle with truncating the hri profile at @xmath1 arcseconds : this removes the power - law wing obviously associated with mirror scattering , while neglecting the broadening of the profile due to scattering interior to this radius . \n this approximation to the true profile suffices if we are not interested in , nor sensitive to , the small - scale structure of the nebula when observed with the ipc . \n we construct a model ipc sbp for the crab by convolving the ipc s prf with the crab s intrinsic sbp , which is approximated in the manner just described as the truncated hri sbp . \n the prf we use is a linear combination of nine monoenergetic calibration prfs , weighted is such a way as to approximate the response of the ipc to the crab s continuous spectrum \n careful account being made of the gain of the detector and the modification of the crab s intrinsic spectrum by the effective area of the mirror / detector combination . \n this prf is convolved with the crab s ` true ' sbp to produce a model ipc sbp . \n this is compared to the measured profile in figure 3a : a significant difference is seen to exist between these two profiles beyond @xmath6 arcseconds . \n the difference between the measured and model profiles reveals the size , shape , and intensity of the excess emission beyond the borders of the nebula . the magnitude of this excess , defined as the fractional difference between these two profiles is @xmath7 . \n while this figure agrees with the magnitude of the excess emission reported by other observers , we are able for the first time to choose unambiguously between the two theories advanced to explain it . in particular , this emission has the character of a halo produced by the scattering of x - rays from interstellar grains and not that of a shock . a theoretical explanation as to why the former interpretation is correct would take us too far afield ; \n the interested reader is left to pursue this topic in the literature ( overbeck 1965 ; hayakawa 1970 ; mauche , et al . \n we simply assert two things : ( 1 ) the halo around the crab nebula has ` exactly ' the same shape as the halo around the compact galactic x - ray source gx13 + 1 , shown in figure 3b , and ( 2 ) the halo around gx13 + 1 is due to scattering from dust . \n gx13 + 1 is but one of the compact sources for which we have detected halos . \n the strength of these have been found to correlate well with two quantities which measure the column density of grains to a given source : ( 1 ) the amount of visual extinction , and ( 2 ) the distance through the galaxy s dust layer . \n the data points for the crab are shown plotted amongst the points for the compact sources in figure 4 : the crab s relatively weak halo is consistent with its extinction as well as with its location with respect to the galactic plane . \n these two observations  the similarity between figures 3a and 3b , and the correlation in figure 4  unmistakably identifies the mechanism for the crab s halo as scattering from dust \n . however , we need to return to what the halo is not : emission from a shell associated with a shock wave . \n an upper limit on the luminosity of such a shell is dependent on its angular size , due to the obscuring effects of mirror and dust scattering on the ipc sbp , in such a way that the upper limit is smaller ( larger ) for a shell of larger ( smaller ) size . \n we choose to calculate the upper limit for a size of 9 arcminutes , consistent with the prediction of a sedov solution with nominal parameters , as well as with the ( age and distance ) scaled size of cas a. our estimate of the maximum surface brightness for a shell of this size is shown in figure 3a . \n the associated 0.54 kev luminosity is about 1% of the crab s , or about @xmath0 . \n significantly , this upper limit is a factor of @xmath8 larger than the luminosity ( though only a factor of three in central surface brightness ) of the sn 1006 remnant , which is of approximately the same age as the crab . \n consequently , we can not place a strong upper limit on the shell s luminosity \n . the important result of this paper is however that at ` soft ' x - ray energies the crab s dust - scattering halo completely obscures its putative shell . due to the @xmath9 dependence in the size of the halo , and the @xmath10 dependence in the halo intensity \n , the prospects for detecting the shell would be much better at higher energies .", "StartTimeOffset": 1672469306112, "RequestID": "7557ef7c27584ff76058e82cf5e680bbf0f083b6", "TotalTokens": 2579}
{"ContextTokens": 4008, "GeneratedTokens": 217, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of earth - related systems has become even more important with the growing concerns about environmental changes and the awareness of sustainable development . as a paradigm of complex systems , \n this research topic relies on multidisciplinary efforts and has also been addressed by physicists via methods of statistical physics . \n earthquakes  @xcite , geomagnetic activities  @xcite , climate  @xcite and weather - related systems  @xcite are just a few examples of systems that researchers have tackled in these pages . in particular , as pointed out by dove and kammen  @xcite , one of the foremost global environmental challenges is the climate change . in a broader sense , \n the complexity of climate systems is related to the complex interactions between atmosphere , biosphere , cryosphere , lithosphere and hydrosphere . \n the latter one is the part of the climate system that comprises oceans , lakes and rivers , that is , the liquid water at the earth s surface and underground  @xcite and it is well known the extremely important role of water in global environmental change  @xcite .    in this context , \n important systems are the rivers and their discharges , which have a large impact on human activities , and that may also suffer huge influence from these activities . \n a river flow results from complicated interactions between the weather - related systems ( such as rainfall , temperature and evaporation ) , the landscape ( such as basin area and land relief ) and human activity ( such as pollution and power generation ) . \n these many features make river flow rates ( river discharges ) a complex process that has attracted the attention of scholars over the last six decades . \n for instance , the seminal work of hurst about the long - range dependence of runoff records from several rivers  @xcite has fostered several discussions on the fractal / multifractal and scaling properties of the temporal evolution of river flows  @xcite . \n the correlations between river flows and other systems have been also studied , for instance , climate systems such as rain fall  @xcite and sunspots  @xcite ; and economic systems such as the growth of companies  @xcite . \n moreover , chaos theory  @xcite , stochastic models  @xcite and permutation entropy  @xcite are examples of approaches used to probe the complexity of runoff time series .    despite the considerable attention towards the investigation of river flows , \n several works are still based on small datasets and a large - scale characterization of time series related to river flows is rarely reported . \n furthermore , previous efforts have been mainly focused on well established / traditional methods of times series analysis ( such as fractal / multifractal analysis ) and , for instance , the interesting advances in mapping time series into networks have just recently attracted the attention of researchers working on this topic  @xcite . here \n , we further fill this gap by studying the flows in 141 different measuring stations that cover 53 brazilian rivers via daily time series obtained from the period of 1931 to 2012 . \n specifically , we have employed the network framework of the horizontal visibility graph  @xcite for mapping these river flow series into networks . by tracking the evolution of topological properties of these networks \n , the horizontal visibility approach reveals that the flow in several stations are becoming more or less correlated ( and displaying more or less complex internal network structures ) over the years , a behavior that could be related to changes in the climate system and other man - made phenomena . \n this work is organized as follows . \n we first describe our database and review some properties of the horizontal visibility approach . \n we next employ the horizontal visibility graph to our time series . \n then , we characterize these networks by investigating the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient as well as evolutive features of these two measures . \n we also find that these measures display a kind of coupling . \n finally , we present a summary of our findings and some concluding remarks . \n the data we have accessed consist of time series of the natural river flow rates ( river discharges ) with daily resolution measured in 141 different stations . these time series cover 53 brazilian rivers , span the period from 1931 to 2012 [ as described in fig . \n [ fig:0](a ) and ( b ) ] and are made freely available by the operador nacional do sistema eltrico  ons  ( a federal institution that controls the power system in brazil )  @xcite . \n let s denote the flow rates by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a discrete time variable indexing the days of the year and @xmath2 stands for the year associated with the flow ; thus , @xmath3 represents the flow rate in jan . 10 1986 in a given station . for the matter of convenience \n , we have removed the datapoint associated to feb . \n 29 from all time series of leap years . \n we have focused our analysis on a normalized version of the flow rates defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 ^ 2\\ ] ] are respectively the average and the variance flow profile along the days of the year for a given station ( @xmath6 is the number of years available for that station ) . \n the upper panel of fig . \n [ fig:1](a ) illustrates the definition of the normalized flow rates @xmath7 by showing a concrete example of its construction . by doing this procedure \n , we ensure that ( at least ) the main seasonal trend is removed from the original flow rates .    once having the normalized flow @xmath7 , we have applied the horizontal visibility graph approach for mapping each year of the time series in a corresponding complex network . \n this procedure was proposed by luque et al . \n @xcite as a more restrictive version of the visibility graph approach  @xcite with the advantage of providing analytical expressions for fully random time series  @xcite . \n the visibility approach has been applied to several contexts  @xcite , enabling researchers from time series analysis to employ tools from network science . \n several properties of the horizontal visibility graph can be found in refs . \n @xcite ; here , we briefly present its algorithm and some results related to the degree distribution . \n the horizontal visibility algorithm is a map that assigns each datapoint of a time series to a node / vertex in a complex network . \n two nodes , and , will be connected whenever one can draw a horizontal line in the time series space that join the datapoints @xmath7 and @xmath8 without intersecting any intermediate datapoint height , that is , @xmath9 \n > f_t(l)~\\forall\\,l\\ , | ( i < l < j)\\,.\\ ] ] notice that , in our case , the horizontal visibility algorithm will produce one network per year of the time series of a given station . \n the bottom panel of fig . \n [ fig:1](a ) shows an example of a network constructed from the previous procedure by considering data from the paran river collected at the itaipu station in the year @xmath10 . \n also , fig . \n [ fig:1](b ) illustrate the horizontal visibility approach applied to a simple time series . \n thus , our approach enables the investigation of possible evolutive features of the river flow rates by tracking the evolution of network measures . \n we first evaluated the degree distribution of the networks @xmath11 , where @xmath12 stands for the node degree or its number of connections ( notice that the networks are undirected ) . from the works of luque  @xcite and lacasa  @xcite , we know that the degree distribution takes the form @xmath13 for fully random time series , regardless the probability distribution underlying the values of the time series . \n furthermore , time series arising from more complex dynamics are also usually described by asymptotic exponential distributions . however , the value of @xmath14 is usually different from @xmath15 . \n actually , @xmath16 is associated with chaotic processes ( the smaller the @xmath14 , the smaller the system dimensionality ) and @xmath17 is associated with stochastic processes ( the larger the @xmath14 , the longer the system correlations )  @xcite . in our case , fig . \n [ fig:2](a ) shows the cumulative degree distributions for all the 82 networks ( one for each year ) constructed with data from the paran river at the itaipu station . \n we observe that all distributions are asymptotically well described by exponential decays , which on log  lin scale are represented by straight lines whose slopes match the values of @xmath14 . \n when comparing the asymptotic behavior of these distributions to the one expected for a random time series [ @xmath18 , we note that the empirical distributions display a faster decay . in order to numerically estimate the empirical value of @xmath14 for each distribution , \n we have fitted a linear model to each cumulative distribution ( on log  lin scale ) after removing the initial non - exponential behavior ( @xmath19 ) . \n we have further obtained the average value of @xmath14 after shuffling the times series over 100 realizations . \n figure  [ fig:2](b ) shows the values of @xmath14 for each year of the original series as well as the average ( and confidence intervals ) of @xmath14 for the shuffled versions of these series . \n we observe that the empirical values of @xmath14 ( for this particular station ) are always larger than @xmath15 and that they are outside the confidence bounds related to random versions of these series . \n figures  [ fig:2](c ) and  ( d ) provide another representative example ( for the tocantins river at the tucuru station ) of this analysis , where again we have found values of @xmath14 larger than @xmath15 .    in order to fully characterize the degree distributions of our entire dataset , we have proceeded as in the two previous - discussed examples for estimating the values of @xmath14 for every time series . \n after , we calculate the probability distribution for the values of @xmath14 obtained from the original time series as well as for one shuffled version of each time series . \n figure  [ fig:2](e ) shows both distributions , where it is evident that the values of @xmath14 for the original series are larger than @xmath15 for practically all time series in our dataset , only @xmath20 of the time series display slightly smaller values ( but close to @xmath15 ) . \n it is worth noting that the average value of @xmath14 is 0.65 , a value that can be related to long - range correlations in the river flows . \n in particular , if consider that our time series are described by a power - law correlation function @xmath21 , an average @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 ( see figure 3 of ref . \n @xcite ) and consequently to a hurst exponent around 0.75 , a result that is compatible with the existence of long - range persistent correlations in the river flows . \n another question that our data pose is regarding possible evolutive features in the river flow dynamics . to address this question , \n we have investigated whether the values of @xmath14 of a given station display a time dependence over the years @xmath2 . \n specifically , we have tested the hypothesis of the relationship @xmath14 versus @xmath2 showing a linear trend by fitting the linear model ( via the ordinary least squares method ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the linear coefficients . \n thus , the value of @xmath26 and its statistical significance provide clues of whether @xmath14 is changing over the years @xmath2 or not . figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the value of @xmath26 for each station . in order to check the statistical significance of @xmath26 , \n we have employed the @xmath2-test for examining the null hypothesis of @xmath26 being different from zero via the two - tail @xmath27-value . for a confidence level of 95% ( that is , @xmath27-value smaller than 0.05 ) \n , we find that the null hypothesis can not be rejected in 46 among 141 measuring stations ( fig . \n [ fig:3 ] ) . also , among the stations where @xmath26 is statistically significant , we find that the majority ( @xmath28% ) displays an increasing trend . \n this result thus indicates that some stations are presenting a more correlated dynamics over the years . \n it is important to mention that the @xmath2-test assumes that the residual distributions are normal and it can be considered not ideal in this context  @xcite . however , we have further applied the bootstrap regression approach  @xcite and the results obtained are quite similar , that is , the linear trends considered significant by the @xmath2-test , were also considered statistically significant by the bootstrap regression . \n in addition to the degree distribution , another common - studied network property is the clustering coefficient  @xcite . \n this quantity measures the likelihood of nodes to create tight - knit groups with a relatively high density of ties . \n specifically , we have employed the global clustering coefficient @xmath29 , which is the number of closed paths of length two in the network over the number of all paths of length two . similarly to the analysis of the degree distribution , we have compared the values of @xmath29 obtained from the networks emerging from the original time series with the networks obtained from shuffled versions of these series ( average over 100 realizations ) . \n figures  [ fig:4](a ) and  [ fig:4](b ) show representative cases for the values of @xmath29 evaluated from two measuring stations . \n for both stations , we note that the values of @xmath29 evaluated for the original time series ( black lines ) are considerably larger than the values obtained from the randomized series ( red lines ) . \n similar behaviors are observed for almost all time series . \n in fact , we note from fig .  [ \n fig:4](c ) that the values of @xmath29 from the original series are distributed around @xmath30 , whereas the values of @xmath29 related to the shuffled series present a more acute distribution around @xmath31 . \n this result thus indicates that the underlying fluctuations of the river flows produce networks with more complex internal structures , which are visually observed in fig . \n [ fig:1 ] by noticing the formation of cliques among closer days . \n we have also investigated the evolutive features in the values of @xmath29 over the years @xmath2 for all stations . as we did previously for the degree distribution \n , we have verified the hypothesis of @xmath29 versus @xmath2 displaying a linear trend by least squares fitting the model @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are now the model parameters . \n again , the value of @xmath34 and its significance provide clues of whether @xmath29 is changing over the years @xmath2 or not . \n figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the values of @xmath34 for each station , where the asterisk markers indicate the values that are statistically significant ( confidence level of 95% ) . among the 141 measuring stations , we find out that 68 stations exhibit a statistically significant linear trend and that the majority of these stations ( @xmath28% ) present an increasing trend in @xmath29 ( \n similar results are obtained with the bootstrap regression approach ) . \n we further show in fig . \n [ fig:5 ] some representative cases of these evolutive trends .        another intriguing aspect of the fig . \n [ fig:5 ] is that most of the stations displaying evolutive features in @xmath29 have also presented a similar dynamics in @xmath14 . \n this behavior suggests that the values of @xmath29 and @xmath14 may be somehow coupled . in order to check this possibility , \n we have plotted the values of @xmath29 against the values of @xmath14 evaluated for each station and year of the time series . \n figure  [ fig:6 ] shows this relationship where ( despite the scatter ) we note that the increasing of @xmath14 is ( on average ) followed by an increasing of @xmath29 . \n in order to overcome the noise and to focus on the main tendency of these data , we have calculated the window average values of this relationship . \n our results suggest that an exponential function describes quite well the average relationship , which confirms a coupling ( on average ) between the values of @xmath29 and @xmath14 . \n we have studied the river discharges from a relatively large dataset composed of almost one hundred and fifty stations covering more than fifty brazilian rivers in time periods of more than eighty years . in our investigations , we have proposed to employ the network framework of the horizontal visibility method for characterizing river flow fluctuations . our approach has pointed some intriguing evolutive features of the river discharges . \n we have shown that river discharges in certain measuring stations are becoming more or less correlated as well as displaying more or less complex internal network structures . despite the difficult in testing this hypothesis from our data , we believe that these evolutive features may be related to changes in the climate system , in particular regarding the rainfall system . other man - made phenomena such as the large - scale use of water in agricultural activities may also have contributed to these evolutive features . perhaps , other investigations at more local level could help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the evolutive aspects of the river discharges presented here . finally , we believe that our work sheds new light on river flow dynamics and open the possibility for other direct investigations based on the horizontal visibility approach . \n this work has been supported by the cnpq , capes and fundao araucria ( brazilian agencies ) . \n hvr thanks the financial support of the cnpq under grant no .  440650/2014 -

{"ContextTokens": 2193, "GeneratedTokens": 63, "SynthesizedBody": "in the era of the lhc and in preparation for the ilc there is need for multi - loop calculations to match the precision of these experiments from the theory side . \n the classes of problems currently accessible reach from multi - leg multi - scale problems at one - loop up to no - scale propagator , and tadpole diagrams at four - loop level . \n many problems fall into these categories directly while others can be cast into the required form by appropriate expansions in small parameters . \n a typical multi - loop calculation proceeds as follows : the needed diagrams are generated and if necessary expanded to decrease the difficulty of the problem . \n the resulting feynman integrals are then reduced to a small set of simpler integrals , which have to be calculated in a further step . while the reduction of the integrals can be automatized completely and \n is mostly independent of the problem at hand , the calculation of the remaining integrals must still be done manually for every calculation . in the following we give a brief review of the current status of the reduction to master integrals which with recent developments is now in a good shape such that the calculation of the master integrals now again poses the most difficulties in multi - loop calculations . \n one of the main ingredients of many multi - loop calculations are the so - called integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities @xcite @xmath0 which hold in dimensional regularization . here \n we consider typical feynman integrals , where @xmath1 are loop and @xmath2 are external momenta . \n these identities can be used to relate different integrals . using these relations the full set of needed integrals , which can be of the order of @xmath3 integrals , \n can be reduced to a small set of so - called master integrals . in a typical calculation there \n appear @xmath4 master integrals , which remain to be calculated directly . \n another main advantage of the reduction to master integrals is that many properties like gauge invariance can be checked on the level of master integrals , since these are linearly independent .    to make use of the ibp identities the laporta algorithm @xcite , a gauss - elimination - like algorithm , is frequently used . in order to use the laporta algorithm \n , one has to choose an ordering to ensure that more difficult integrals are expressed through simpler ones . \n once this ordering has been chosen the algorithm proceeds as follows : choose a set of integrals , which you like to solve ; pick an integral from the set and generate an ibp ; solve for the most difficult integral in the equation and continue with the next ibp or integral . \n the system of equations will become overdetermined if one chooses a sufficiently large set of integrals , since there are @xmath5 ibp identities generated by a given integral , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number of loops and legs , respectively . \n although this method has been successfully applied in many calculations it has some drawbacks . \n the complexity of the laporta algorithm is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of equations . in combination with the combinatorial properties of the problem \n this leads to fast growth of the size of the problem to be solved . furthermore in typical applications \n the system of equations is overdetermined by a factor 3 - 5 , so quite some time is spent just checking that the system of equations is consistent . \n a different approach for solving the set of ibp identities is provided by groebner bases . \n groebner bases arose in the context of ideals of rings over multivariate polynomials . \n more precisely , they were introduced while trying to solve the problem , how to decide if a certain polynomial belongs to an ideal of a ring of polynomials . \n an ideal @xmath10 is a subset of the ring @xmath11 such that for every @xmath12 , the product is an element of @xmath10 , @xmath13 . \n an ideal can be generated by a set of polynomials @xmath14 using @xmath15 . given these generating polynomials , \n the question whether a given polynomial @xmath16 is an element of the ideal , can easily be answered in the case of univariate polynomials , where the operation of polynomial division is unambiguous . \n if the polynomial division by the generating polynomials leaves no remainder , @xmath17 is an element of the ideal . \n this statement does no longer hold , when dealing with multivariate polynomials . here \n the remainder of multivariate divisions by multiple polynomials depends on the chosen ordering of the polynomials . \n therefore if the remainder of such divisions is not zero one may not conclude that the polynomial is not an element of the ideal .    at this point \n groebner bases prove very useful since a multivariate division with respect to elements of a groebner basis is again unambiguous . \n this leads to one of the definitions of a groebner basis : a set @xmath18 is a groebner basis if the reduction , i.e. multivariate division , of any @xmath19 with respect to the elements of @xmath20 yields the same remainder independent of the chosen order . using the buchberger algorithm a groebner basis \n can be constructed from any set of polynomials generating the ideal . \n this knowledge can be used for the solution of the ibp - identities . for this purpose \n the ibp identities have to be written in terms of shift operators @xcite or differential operators @xcite . \n the ibp relations then form a left - ideal in the now non - commutative ring of shift operators for which a groebner basis has to be constructed . \n every integral can be obtained by applying shift operators to a basis integral , i.e. , @xmath21 . since every element @xmath17 of the ring can be expressed in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 the integral can be reduced via @xmath24 , since @xmath25 and therefore @xmath26 . \n although this procedure does , in principle , generate a reduction of any integral there are still some problems . the buchberger algorithm is guaranteed to generate a basis but it might need a very long time and a lot of resources . in practice \n there is no implementation of the buchberger algorithm which succeeds in constructing a basis for non - trivial problems . \n furthermore , as can be checked in simple cases , the application of groebner bases to the reduction problem does not yield the minimal number of master integrals that can be reached using a laporta - like kind of reduction method .    to circumvent the problematic issues of the groebner basis approach , \n a modification of the buchberger algorithm has been introduced to construct so - called s - bases . unfortunately in this approach \n the construction of a basis is no longer guaranteed to succeed and is highly dependent on the chosen ordering . \n for certain topologies a basis can not be found and therefore the method can not be applied . in this cases a conventional laporta approach still has to be used in the sectors where no basis can be found . \n as an example for the power of the methods outlined in the previous section we present the calculation of the second moment of the vector correlator at @xmath27 and its application to the determination of the charm and bottom quark masses from experimental data .    the charm and bottom masses can be extracted from the @xmath11-ratio @xmath28 @xcite . \n the extraction of the quark masses can be done by considering the moments @xmath29 of the ratio defined by @xmath30 these moments are related to the taylor coefficients @xmath31 of the low energy expansion of the heavy quark current correlator @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vacuum polarization function of the photon @xmath34 with the heavy quark current @xmath35 . \n these theoretical moments can be calculated in an expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath36 in perturbative qcd @xmath37 to perform the calculation the initially present propagator - type diagrams are expanded in @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the external photon momentum and @xmath40 the mass of the heavy quark . \n this expansion leads to tadpole diagrams to which the techniques presented in the previous section can be applied . \n the taylor coefficients have been calculated at @xmath41 , i.e. three - loop order , in @xcite . at four loops the first moment has been calculated in @xcite and the second moment in @xcite , see @xcite for higher moments for purely fermionic contributions . using the second moment the analysis presented in @xcite , see also @xcite , can be upgraded to include the now complete knowledge of the second moment . using this newly available information the error of the bottom quark mass can be reduced to obtain @xmath42 which has to be compared with old value of @xmath43 in the case of the charm quark one finds @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 even though the shift in the absolute value is quite small the error gets reduced by around 25% .    since the different moment weights the experimental input differently precise knowledge of the second moment allows for a consistency check of the method used for the extraction of the quark masses . especially in the case of the bottom quark the second moment \n is favored over the first one since it is more sensitive to the threshold region and the narrow resonances . \n we presented a short review of the current status of an integral part of multi - loop calculations , namely the reduction to master integrals . using recent groebner basis inspired methods in combination with laporta - like approaches \n most reduction problems can be solved in an efficient way and the most problematic part is again the calculation of the master integrals . as an example we presented the calculation of the second moment of the heavy quark current correlator at four - loop order and its application to the extraction of the charm- and bottom - quark masses from experimental data . \n a.  v.  smirnov , arxiv:0807.3243 [ hep - ph ] . \n o.  v.  tarasov , acta phys . \n b * 29 * ( 1998 ) 2655 [ arxiv : hep -

mcdermid et al . \n 2004 ) ifus at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope . \n early results of the survey have revealed a variety of structures much richer than usually recognised in early - type galaxies ( de zeeuw et al . \n 2002 ; mcdermid et al . \n 2004 ; emsellem et al . 2004 \n ; see also r. mcdermid s contribution in this workshop ) .    here \n we focus on the distribution and kinematics of the ionised gas of a subset of galaxies to illustrate the diversity of structures and ionisation processes present in the ` sauron `  representative sample of 48 elliptical and lenticular galaxies . \n the sample contains an equal fraction of elliptical and lenticular galaxies , with equal number of field and cluster galaxies in each morphological group . \n we will make use of the two - dimensional information delivered by ` sauron `  to compare the distribution and kinematics of the stars and gas and to study the nature and origin of the ionised gas in these systems . \n a more extended analysis of the properties of the ionised gas for the entire sample is presented in sarzi et al . \n furthermore , the study of the stellar and gas properties of the 24 sa bulges in the ` sauron `  sample is addressed in falcn - barroso et al . \n early - type galaxies were traditionally thought to be uniform stellar systems with little or no gas and dust . however , a considerable number of imaging and spectroscopy studies have changed this view ( sadler & gerhard 1985 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ; goudfrooij 1999 ; tran et al 2001 ) . in the spectral range delivered by ` sauron `  there are three potential emission lines that can be measured ( i.e. , @xmath04959 , 5007 , @xmath05198,5200 ) . \n given that the stellar contribution to the overall spectrum in our sample of galaxies remains significant , it is important to perform an accurate continuum subtraction in order to determine reliably the fluxes and kinematics of the emission lines . \n we investigated several methods to perform this task and settled on a procedure that _ simultaneously _ fits both the stellar and gaseous contributions to derive the fluxes , velocities and velocity dispersions of the emission lines.-1    traditional methods to separate the stars and gas consisted of the subtraction of the best matching stellar template , in the regions free of emission , to the full spectrum of the galaxy . \n as described in sarzi et al . \n ( 2005 ) , this methodology can significantly overestimate the flux and velocity dispersion of the measured emission lines . \n extensive simulations show that the new procedure is much more accurate and appears to be superior to previous ones , allowing us to detect emission down to an equivalent width of 0.1  . \n the distribution of the ionised gas in our sample shows diverse morphologies . in general \n the distribution follows that of the stars , although there are several cases where the situation is much more complex ( i.e. filaments , rings , spiral arms , lanes ) . \n the incidence of ionised - gas emission in our sample is 75% . \n seven galaxies show only weak traces of emission , and there are five cases with no detection . by morphological type \n , lenticular galaxies display a slightly higher content of ionised gas than elliptical galaxies ( 83% versus 66% ) . \n similar percentages were found when the sample was divided according to environment ( 83% field , 66% cluster ) . \n one important remark is that the fraction of galaxies with clearly detected emission in the virgo cluster drops to only 55% ( 10/18 ) , with just 3/9 ellipticals showing the presence of gas . \n the incidence of ionised - gas shows no correlation with either luminosity or the presence of a bar in the galaxy . \n the detection rates found for our sample are in good agreement with those of macchetto et al . \n ( 1996 ) , who found emission in 85% of the lenticular and 68% of the ellipticals in their sample .    in figure  [ fig2 ] \n , we present maps of the stellar and ionised - gas distribution and kinematics for four of the 48 galaxies in our sample . \n ngc2974 reveals a fast rotating gas disk co - rotating with respect to the stars . despite the regular appearance of the ionised - gas distribution , the equivalent width ( ew ) map of the  line \n ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) highlights the presence of an inner ring and two spiral arms that extend all the way out to the limits of our field - of - view ( see krajnovi ' c et al . \n 2005a for a detailed analysis of this galaxy using ` sauron `  data ) . \n a similarly regular case is that of ngc4526 , although in this case the ionised gas is confined to a well defined , fast rotating disk in the central kpc of the galaxy . \n ngc2768 is a well - known galaxy where the distribution of the ionised - gas appears to be perpendicular to that of its stellar counterpart ( i.e. polar - ring , fried & illingworth 1994 ; bertola et al . \n the ` sauron `  ew map shows that the gas distribution has a filamentary morphology along the galaxy minor axis . \n the gas distribution in ngc4278 displays a peculiar integral - sign pattern that is closely followed by the gas velocity field . \n the stellar and gas kinematics appear to be misaligned by increasingly wider angles , as they twist in opposite directions towards the outer parts of the field - of - view . \n diagnostic diagrams of /  vs /  ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; kauffmann et al . \n 2003 ) have been used extensively in the past to investigate the trigger of the ionisation of the gas ( i.e. agn , star - formation ) . \n many scenarios have been invoked to explain the presence of ionised gas in early - type galaxies : central agn , hot ( @xmath1k ) gas ( sparks et al . \n 1989 ; de jong et al . 1990 ) , young stars ( shields 1992 ) , post - agb stars ( binette et al . 1994 ) , or shocks ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) . within the wavelength range delivered by ` sauron `  only the  and  lines can be used for this purpose . despite this limitation \n , the /  ratio serves as a good indicator to locate regions where emission is due to young stars and also to trace variations of the ionisation mechanisms within a single galaxy . \n regions displaying low /  ratios ( i.e. @xmath21 ) are usually interpreted as indicative of star - formation ( ho et al . 1997 ) . \n however , higher ratios ( i.e. @xmath31 ) could still indicate star - formation if the metallicity of the gas is sufficiently high ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . additionally other mechanisms can lead to high ratios . since it is unlikely that the metallicity of the ionised gas varies abruptly within galaxies ( unless there has been some recent accretion of material ) , large variations across maps of the /  ratio are more likely to be produced by changes in the ionisation mechanism rather than changes in the metallicity . \n figure  [ fig2 ] shows the /  ratios for the galaxies discussed in section  [ sec : distrib ] . \n the /  ratio maps clearly reveal the presence of radial gradients and substructures in the ionisation properties of the gas in the four galaxies . \n the ratio is moderately high in ngc2768 , ngc2974 , and ngc4278 , while it is very low in ngc4526 . in this last galaxy \n , the location of the low /  values corresponds to the location of a prominent dust disk ( as shown in the unsharp - masked image ) , and suggests ongoing star formation . in this respect , there seems to be a clear link between the ionised structures found in the /  maps with those seen in the  equivalent width and kinematic maps ( i.e. ring in ngc2974 , or integral - sign pattern in ngc4278 ) . \n the remaining sample of 44 galaxies also displays a great diversity of /  ratios within galaxies , but also across the sample . \n this suggests that either there are many mechanisms at play in the ionisation of the gas , that the metallicity of the ionised gas is very heterogeneous in those galaxies , or both . \n in order to study the dust distribution and compare it with that of the ionised gas we have generated unsharp - masked images using archival _ hubble space telescope \n we found that , consistent with previous results , dust generally follows the ionised - gas distribution ( goudfrooij et al . \n 1994 ; tomita et el . \n 2000 ; tran et al . 2001 ) . \n the opposite situation is not always true , as we have found galaxies with clear presence of emission with no traces of dust in the unsharp - masked images . as found by previous authors ( ho et al . \n 2002 ) , regular dust distributions generally are associated with smooth velocity fields , however the lack of regular dust lanes does not imply the presence of irregular kinematics .    the four cases presented in figure  [ fig2 ] display a wide range of dust morphologies that correlate in different degrees with the structures seen in the distribution of the ionised gas . \n the prominent dust disk in ngc4526 traces closely the distribution of the gas . the ring - like structure and spiral arms in ngc2974 \n are also followed by dusty structures at the same locations . \n the dust morphology is less defined in ngc2768 and ngc4278 , but still suggests an orientation for the dust that is similar to that of the gas distribution . \n the measurement of misalignments between the kinematics of the gaseous and stellar components in early - type galaxies has often been used to determine the relative importance of accretion events and the internal production of gas through stellar mass - loss ( e.g. bertola et al . 1992 ) . \n the orientation of the dust relative to that of the stars has also served this purpose ( e.g. van dokkum & franx 1995 ) . in order to quantify the presence of decoupled gaseous components in our sample and to investigate their dependence on environment , \n we have measured the mean misalignment between the stellar and ionised gas using _ kinemetry _ , a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher - order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution of galaxies ( krajnovi ' c et al . \n 2005b ) .    in figure  [ fig2 ] ( solid line ) \n we show the distribution of the average misalignments for the galaxies in our sample of 48 galaxies with sufficiently extended emission . \n the distribution of values appears to be skewed towards small misalignments . \n however , the fact that there is still a significant fraction of galaxies showing mild to strong misalignments suggests that the ionised gas has not a purely internal origin ( in which only small misalignments are expected ) . \n the overall shape of the distribution remains unchanged when the sample is divided into elliptical and lenticular galaxies . \n no dependency is found on neither environment nor galaxy luminosity . \n we do , however , find a strong dependence on apparent flattening of the galaxy ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) . \n it appears that the distribution of misalignments of the most flattened objects accounts for the observed excess of co - rotating over counter - rotating gas and stellar systems in the whole sample . \n the roundest objects ( @xmath40.2 ) display a more uniform distribution . \n this result suggests that rotational support might be important to explain the observed dependence . \n we have presented some examples of the morphological and kinematical state of the ionised gas in a representative sample of early - type galaxies using data from the ` sauron `  spectrograph at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope . \n the results of our analysis reveal a wide range of morphological , but also kinematical structures . \n it also shows that there must be several mechanisms responsible for the ionisation of the gas , not only across galaxies , but also within galaxies . \n the presence of dust is common in our sample and is usually accompanied by gas emission . \n finally , we studied the distribution of misalignments between the stars and gas in our sample , and conclude that the origin of the ionised gas can not be purely internal or external . \n jfb acknowledges support from the euro3d research training network , funded by the ec under contract hprn - ct-2002 - 00305 . \n this work is based on observations obtained at the wht on the island of la palma , operated by the isaac newton group at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .", "StartTimeOffset": 1730067770850, "RequestID": "0e2cdec3b8064d3760e1377b221ae6c2424e7d21", "TotalTokens": 3305}

magnetic phase ) . \n however , near the critical point , the elementary magnets still keep order on certain range of distances and over certain time intervals , which decrease with growth of the temperature . \n thus , at the critical point , areas of coherence and areas of thermal fluctuations coexist . \n areas of fluctuations in the magnetic phase or areas of coherence in the non - magnetic phase may be distingueshed only within a certain range of scales . for \n large enough scales the system looks completely ordered ( as at zero temperature ) or chaotic ( as at infinite temperature ) . \n if one considers the same system at a definite temperature but within various scales , it looks as the system at different temperatures . \n the transformation of scales corresponds to the temperature renormalization . \n let we have a cubic lattice of @xmath0 atoms with interatomic distance @xmath1 at temperature @xmath2 . \n if one considers this system at rough enough scale , at which the elementary cell has the characteristic size @xmath3 and contains @xmath4 atoms , the system looks as a lattice of @xmath5 atoms at the renormalized temperature @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is a function of renormalization ) . at the moment of the phase transition \n , one can observe the thermal fluctuations within any scales . \n these fluctuations are self - similar . \n the idea of self - similarity has been offered by kadanoff  @xcite and further advanced by wilson to the renormalization method  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . \n concepts of universality and scaling near the critical point and a renormalization group ( rg ) method have been transferred to nonlinear dynamics by feigenbaum  @xcite . \n the analogy between transition to chaos and phase transitions consist in increase of temporal scales with approach to a critical point , self - similarity , an opportunity of application of rg analysis , and in existence of universal critical indexes and scaling factors , which are determined by the most general requirements to the type of system  @xcite .    in 1952 \n lee and yang advanced an approach in the phase transition theory based on consideration of analytical properties of some thermodynamic values , such as partition function and free energy , depending on the temperature considered formally as a complex variable  @xcite . \n the partition function is defined as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a total energy of a configuration of the system , @xmath10 is an external magnetic field , @xmath2 is a temperature , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 - is the spin variable , taking place at @xmath13-th cell of the lattice . \n spins interact via magnetic field with the nearest neighbours ( @xmath14 corresponds to ferromagnetic interaction , @xmath15  antiferromagnetic ) . \n partition function can be transformed to @xmath16 by the variable change @xmath17 . \n it is known , that at the phase transition the divergence of the thermodynamic potential ( free energy ) @xmath18 takes place . \n obviously , zeros of the partition function ( roots of the algebraic equation @xmath19 ) are the candidates for the phase transition points \n . however , these roots should be positive and real , which is impossible as all factors @xmath20 . in yang - lee theory , \n the temperature and the magnetic field are considered as complex variables  @xcite . \n complex zeros of the partition function ( called the yang - lee zeros ) , gather near the real axis . \n it becomes possible only in the thermodynamic limit , the asymptotics of infinite number of atoms . \n when the number of atoms is finite , there is a finite number of zeros in the complex plane . with increase of number of atoms , \n the set of zeros becomes dense and nestles to the real axis more and more . in the thermodynamic limit \n the yang - lee zeroes form a fractal set , that cross the real temperature axis at the point of the phase transition . to find the yang - lee zeros it is appropriate to apply the wilson renormalization method , which corresponds to a consecutive decrease of the number of degrees of freedom of the partition function . \n it is necessary to find the transformation of the @xmath21-particle partition function to the @xmath0-particle one ( @xmath22 ) . \n this transformation is not reversible . \n thus , to get zeros of @xmath23 it is necessary to have zeros of @xmath24 , and then to construct their backward images using the rg transformation . \n having repeated this procedure many times one comes finally to the trivial two - atom partition function . \n if zeros of @xmath25 belong to a basin of attraction of a fixed point of the rg transformation , then zeros of @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit will coincide to the boundary of the basin of attraction in the complex plane . as shown by derrida \n @xcite , this boundary , which is the julia set of the rg transformation , is identical to the set of yang - lee zeros . \n unfortunately , the renormalization transformation may be performed analytically only for simple class of models  the hierarchical lattices ( for example , one and two - dimensional model with ising spins  @xcite , hierarchical lattices with potts spins  @xcite ) . \n yang - lee theory appears to be fruitful for understanding the phase transitions . \n it seems that a similar approach to the analysis of transition to chaos in dynamical systems would be useful for deeper understanding of the analogy with the phase transitions , and for development of the new criteria describing complexity of behavior of nonlinear systems . in the present paper \n we develop such approach basing on the approximate rg analysis of transition to chaos through the period multiplication bifurcations . \n in 1978 feigenbaum discovered universality of cascade of the period - doubling bifurcations and described it on a basis of the rg method . \n the simplest example representing the feigenbaum universality class is quadratic map @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a real dynamical variable , and @xmath28 is a real parameter . \n this map has fixed points , which can be found as roots of the equation @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , a cycle of period @xmath31 ( that is the fixed point ) loses its stability . \n this @xmath32 is the parameter , at which the first period - doubling bifurcation occurs ( the multiplier of the fixed point is @xmath33 ) . \n values of @xmath28 for sequent bifurcations can be found by means of approximate rg method  @xcite . \n let s apply the map ( 4 ) two times : @xmath34 and neglect the last term , the fourth power of @xmath35 . \n then , by the scale transformation @xmath36 this map can be rewritten in the form @xmath37 , which differs from ( 4 ) only by renormalization of @xmath28 @xmath38 thus , the operator of evolution for the double interval of discrete time can be reduced to the original operator by the renormalization transformation  ( 7 ) . \n repeating this procedure with scale factors @xmath39 , one can obtain a sequence of the same form @xmath40    fixed points of these maps correspond to the @xmath41-cycles of the original map ( @xmath42 ) . \n it is easy to see , that all these cycles , as well as the fixed point of the map  ( 4 ) , become unstable at @xmath43 . \n solving a chain of the equations @xmath44 we get the corresponding sequence of bifurcation values of parameter @xmath28 ( with @xmath45 the @xmath41-cycle of  ( 4 ) arises ) . from iteration diagram of fig.1 \n it is evident , that this sequence converges with @xmath46 to a definite limit @xmath47 , the fixed point of the rg transformation . \n it satisfies the equation @xmath48 , thus @xmath49 . \n the scaling factors also converge to the limit : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . \n the multipliers ( floquet eigenvalues of the @xmath41-cycles ) converge to the universal value @xmath52 .    from transformation ( 8) it is possible to obtain the law of convergence of the bifurcation sequence : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant , characterizing the convergence to the critical point .    in table  1 \n we summarize the values of critical indexes ( critical point , scale factor , parameter scaling constant and universal multiplier ) obtained by means of the exact and approximate rg analysis . \n the correspondence between them is well enough . \n .rigorous and approximate values of feigenbaum critical indexes [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us generalize the approximate rg analysis to the period @xmath0-tupling bifurcations cascades for an arbitrary @xmath0 . by induction , the expression for the scaling factor and the parameter renormalization transformation look as follows : @xmath55 @xmath56 obviously , the critical julia sets of the rg transformations  ( [ 24 ] ) with increasing @xmath0 approximate the fractal properties of the mandelbrot set more and more precisely . \n for example , one of the fixed points of the rg transformation of period - quadrupling takes place on the real axes at @xmath57 . \n this point corresponds to the feigenbaum critical point @xmath58 and is approximated in this renormalization scheme more precisely than previous estimate @xmath59 . \n it is worth noting that for the better approximation of the mandelbrot set by julia sets of the rg transformation , for a large period multiplication the factor @xmath0 ( increasing to infinity ) must be a composite number , that is @xmath60 then the considered rg transformation will describe a number of different bifurcations cascades ( see figure  8) . \n let us construct a map , which allows an rg transformation of order @xmath61 using rg transformations of low orders . \n it yields @xmath62 dynamics of such a map with @xmath63 includes description of all period @xmath0-tuplings cascades . \n figure  10 shows the plane of initial values of @xmath64 . \n one can see that it precisely corresponds to the mandelbrot set . \n in the present paper the complex variable version of approximate rg method for period - doubling bifurcation cascade is considered . \n it is shown , that the julia set of renormalization transformation of parameter of complex logistic map is the approximate version of mandelbrot set of this map . \n this similarity is explained by the fact , that julia set is a set of every possible unstable cycles of rg transformation , and elements of these cycles correspond to accumulation points of various bifurcations of period @xmath65 multiplication ( @xmath66 ) , located on the boundary of mandelbrot set dense everywhere . \n approximate rg analysis is generalized to the case of different cascades of period - multiplication bifurcations ( for example period - tripling , period - quadrupling etc . ) , which is peculiar for the complex analytic maps . \n it is shown that with increase of order of the bifurcation cascade the similarity between mandelbrot set and julia set of renormalization transformation becomes more clear . \n the obtained outcomes are interpreted in a view of analogy with theory of phase transitions , namely the yang - lee theory , based on investigation of properties of thermodynamic values depending on complex temperature . \n it is necessary to note , that the elements of considered unstable cycles of rg transformation which is equivalent to points of julia set of this transformation , in thermodynamic analogy corresponds to so - called yang - lee zeros , defining in a thermodynamic limit the borderline of phase transition . \n it is shown , that at the points of transition to chaos the jump of an electrostatic field of a critical julia set is observed . within the framework of considered analogy , \n the jump of a derivative of a free energy at phase transition points takes place . \n thus , it is possible to define a new criterion of transition to chaos . \n the electrostatic potential can be regarded as order parameter for the transition . \n we conclude that complex generalization of approximate rg method appears to be useful to advance understanding of the critical phenomena at threshold of chaos and for development of analogy with the theory of phase transition , which can give new approaches to investigation of these phenomena . \n the authors acknowledge support from research educational center of nonlinear dynamics and biophysics at saratov state university ( rec-006 ) and rfbr ( grant no . \n 03 -

{"ContextTokens": 3476, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum information processing relies on the capacity of sustaining coherence as well as the entanglement among different parties . however , many systems proposed for implementing such protocols are naturally subjected to local and unavoidable dissipation such as ion traps @xcite , cavity qed systems @xcite , and atomic ensembles  @xcite . needless to say , \n this usually works against their quantum efficiency through the mechanism of decoherence . \n different strategies have been designed to partially protect or restore this coherence , such as entanglement distillation  @xcite , quantum repeaters  @xcite or feedback  @xcite , even though all these proposals present combinations of different costs like the increase of the amount of resources to create the necessary redundancy or the need to perform multi - qubit , _ i.e. _ non - local , operations .    in this paper \n we show a fully deterministic and _ local _ scheme that counteracts the unavoidable action of dissipation . \n it relies on three basic elements : the capacity to monitor local environments detecting whether one or none excitation has leaked into each local reservoir ; the possibility to rapidly feedback the excitation into the lossy qubit ; and the use of three - level systems to encode qubits . \n note that even though the used encoding implies some sort of redundancy , the scheme is much less demanding than the usual quantum error correction codes for dissipative systems  @xcite because it adds only one local extra level to each part and does not require any extra entanglement or global operation . \n we discuss applications of this idea to improve the efficiency of quantum repeater protocols and to produce longer lasting coherence and/or entanglement for quantum information storage , teleportation or swapping . \n we also show that it can represent a physical implementation of the optimum singlet conversion protocol  @xcite . \n let us consider a global system composed of internal subsystems that are weakly coupled to their own local reservoirs . \n these couplings should respect typical markov and born approximations and one should be able to read information from each environment regarding the emission of single excitations from the respective subsystem in a time scale much shorter than the subsystem decay rate and still much larger than the correlation times of its respective reservoir . \n we then show that , within the framework of the well known quantum trajectories technique  @xcite , the monitoring of the local environments plus the classical communication of the obtained results ( hence , the first element of the scheme ) is already enough to enhance the quantum communication efficiency . \n however , in the common case of qubits encoded in two - level systems , only the so - called no - jump trajectory , obtained when no environment is disturbed , is of use . \n in fact , the scheme starts to fail as soon as any single qubit decays , since its particular state is projected to the low energy level and factored out of the rest of the system . in order to solve this problem \n , we introduce the two remaining elements to show that encoding the qubits in three - level systems , combined with feedback on individual systems powers up the scheme to the limiting point of completely suppressing the action of the local environments only through local operations . \n to start with , let us take a look at how environment - monitoring can enhance a simple quantum teleportation scheme for which alice and bob need to share a pair of maximally entangled qubits . \n consider a initial bell state given by @xmath0 where we have considered @xmath1 as the local decay rates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lowering operators for the qubits of alice and bob respectively , and the interaction picture is implied . \n as time goes by , entanglement is lost , which can be evidenced by the entanglement of formation @xmath4 of state @xmath5  @xcite as shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . due to this process , \n the further alice and bob take to perform the teleportation , the largest the amount of resources needed , since they would need more and more copies in order to distill a maximally entangled pair . \n let us now assume that alice and bob can monitor the environments of their respective qubits , _ \n i.e.  _ they can continuously detect if their qubits have lost one excitation . \n it can involve a direct measurement of the reservoir , for example , by detecting an emitted photon , or an indirect probing of the loss of excitation through an auxiliary system  @xcite . under these conditions , \n the time evolution of the system is no longer described by the master equation itself but rather by its so - called quantum - jump unraveling , in which the no - jump operator ( corresponding to no detection in the monitored environment ) is given by @xmath6 $ ] and the one - jump operator is given by @xmath7  @xcite . the same holds for bob . \n first , since a detection in the environment immediately kills the entanglement , only the no - jump trajectory is useful . furthermore , given that @xmath8 , the initial state is preserved under this same evolution , _ \n @xmath9 for any @xmath10 , keeping its original entanglement . \n the effect of the reservoir is to make the no - jump trajectory less and less probable with time , its probability given by @xmath11 . \n provided that alice and bob can classically communicate the absence of jumps in their environments , this method is an alternative to the usual distillation protocol since at any time the two parts share a maximally entangled state . \n the idea of locally monitoring the reservoir can also be used in the problem of converting a partially entangled state @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) into a maximally entangled one ( singlet conversion ) @xcite . following a similar reasoning to the 2-qubit protocol presented before , \n when the subsystems undergo spontaneous decay and no jump is detected in both local reservoirs the initial state @xmath14 evolves into @xmath15 , with probability @xmath16 . \n when @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a maximally entangled state  @xcite . \n this happens with probability @xmath19 , which is exactly the optimal singlet conversion probability found in @xcite . \n this shows that indeed coupling the qubits with independent reservoirs and monitoring their environments provides a physical implementation of the optimal singlet conversion protocol . a setup that implements this conversion \n has recently been done with twin photons @xcite . \n we now proceed to show that using qutrits ( @xmath20 ) instead of qubits in each side improves the previous strategies . \n alice and bob will always share an initial state in the subspace spanned by @xmath21 , which will represent our particular encoding . \n we will also consider , from now on , only cascade decay channels , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of respective rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 and frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath27 . \n this condition is naturally found in many systems such as harmonic oscillators undergoing dissipation , spontaneous emission of spin-1 systems or some three - level atoms . \n we begin by analyzing the most favorable situation : the complete degeneracy between the decaying channels in each qutrit ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , _ i.e. _ if qutrit @xmath30 emits an excitation to its reservoir , by detecting this emission there is no fundamental way to identify the corresponding decay channel ( both are equally probable and generate indistinguishable excitations ) . \n first of all , note that in this case the no - jump evolution does not affect the entire subspace initially used by alice and bob , which mimics a decoherence free subspace for this particular trajectory . \n furthermore , contrary to the previous case , the detection of one jump does not mean entanglement loss . \n for example , if alice and bob share the initial state @xmath31 , and alice detects an excitation in her environment , the state of the system must still be given by @xmath32 . \n but now , the jump operator must include the essential fact that the excitation does not distinguish its _ donor _ , therefore , it is given by @xmath33 . \n this state is still maximally entangled , when interpreted as the state of two logical qubits . \n note that the information that the system has decayed not only allows alice to keep an entangled state with bob but actually gives her the opportunity to locally and deterministically restore @xmath34 through the unitary feedback of her qutrit with one excitation ( @xmath35-party multi - qutrit system in which each part is subjected to dissipation but is also able to monitor the loss of excitations and to locally feedback them . once again , as long as no part loses two excitations in a row ( before the feedback mechanism comes in place ) , an entire subspace spanned by @xmath36 can be protected against local dissipation . \n another possible configuration features emitted excitations that still do not identify the possible decay channel but are more likely the higher the number of excitations in @xmath34 ( @xmath28 and @xmath37 ) . \n for example , in the specific case of dissipative harmonic oscillators , the operators in the studied subspace ( @xmath38 ) are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this case , both possible evolutions would affect the entanglement between alice s and bob s qutrits , since they redistribute population among the levels of each subsystem .    in fig . \n [ fig1]a we plot the time evolution of the entanglement of the non - monitored system , @xmath4 , as well as the average entanglement over different trajectories  @xcite as a function of time for the cases analyzed above , both with and without feedback . \n note that in all situations , even for the usual qubit encoding , monitoring the environments preserves entanglement for a longer time than ignoring it , as should be the case since some information on the system is always recovered . \n when the detection and feedback mechanisms are ideal ( @xmath41 ) , entanglement can be preserved indefinitely . in fig . \n [ fig1]b we plot the entanglement obtained either when there is an @xmath42 delay in the feedback mechanism or when there is an @xmath42 inefficiency in the measurement of the environment . \n since we now deal with mixed states of two qutrits , we use negativity  @xcite to obtain the entanglement in each case . \n we should stress the fact that the use of qutrits is advantageous even in these non - ideal cases when compared to two qubits , as it is clear in fig . \n also note that , as expected , inefficient detection of the environment has a greater effect on entanglement loss than delay in the feedback mechanism . \n let us now describe a cavity qed setup where our ideas can be applied . \n suppose alice and bob want to establish a ( ideally ) perfect quantum channel . \n in the proposal of ref . \n @xcite , alice first prepares an empty cavity ( state @xmath43 ) and then interacts it with a very stable two - level atom ( @xmath44 ) in the exited state @xmath45 , in such a way to get the entangled state @xmath46 . \n afterwards she sends the atom to bob . assuming that the atomic decay rate is much smaller than the cavity field one , _ \n i.e.  _ @xmath47 , the decoherence time of the second would limit the distance achievable by the first . \n in fact , the distance between alice and bob would have to be much smaller than @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the atomic velocity .    as discussed before \n , this strategy can be improved if alice uses three levels of her cavity field . \n the idea is that , instead of being empty , the cavity initially contains a photon ( state @xmath50 ) . \n then , after the atom - cavity interaction the final state will be @xmath51 . \n if no jump happens in the interval @xmath52 then this state evolves to @xmath53 , with probability @xmath54 . \n however , if one jump happens in the cavity field at time @xmath55 , then the new state of the system at time @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 , where the no - jump operator is used for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n note that because @xmath60 , the final state @xmath61 is always the same irrespective of the particular time at which the jump happened . \n we can then treat all one - jump trajectories as the same and compute their joint probability as @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 gives the probability density for the trajectory where a jump happens at @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) . \n the trajectory - averaged entanglement is then given by @xmath66 . \n furthermore , we can choose @xmath56 to maximize the one - jump trajectory and @xmath67 to maximize the entanglement of the state when the atom reaches bob , hence , creating an even longer lasting entanglement . \n [ superficie2 ] compares the protocols as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath67 showing the optimum range in which each strategy is better and also that for all times and initial states , encoding qubits in qutrits is more efficient in the presence of decay and environmental monitoring . \n [ superficie2]d shows entanglement for different temperatures of the reservoir . \n typical microwave cavity qed experiments correspond to the intermediate curve  @xcite . \n note that at such low temperatures , thermal excitations play a minor role in the proposed scheme .     for @xmath68 ; \n b. ( upper right ) one - jump contribution @xmath69 for @xmath70 ; c. @xmath71 ; d. @xmath72 with @xmath73 for different temperatures with the mean environment excitation number given by @xmath74 . decay time @xmath75 as in the experimental setup in  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] + \n the schemes proposed before can be readily incorporated in some previously known communication protocols . \n one of the main ideas of transmitting quantum information in 1-d networks relies on quantum repeaters @xcite . in this case , one wants to transmit entanglement through large distances and uses intermediate stations to recover it from time to time through entanglement distillation . \n once some degree of entanglement is recovered in an intermediate station , this entanglement is teleported to the next station . \n naturally , since using qutrits allows to keep entanglement for longer times between each station , there is a reduction in the total amount of necessary resources .    in higher dimensional networks \n , it was recently shown that the geometry of the graph defining the quantum network plays an important role in the problem of long - distance communication . \n entanglement percolation ideas @xcite were first presented for pure - state based networks . \n the main building block for these strategies is the possibility of performing the optimal singlet conversion . as we discussed before , \n this task can be achieved by reservoir monitoring . \n this fact in turn shows a strategy of realizing classical entanglement percolation in noisy lattices @xcite . \n to conclude , we have shown that for systems undergoing dissipation , encoding qubits in qutrits preserves coherence and entanglement for much longer times if the excitations given to the local reservoirs can be detected by external observers . \n thus , systems with their environments under continuous measurement are not only suitable but advantageous for some quantum information protocols . \n moreover , the monitoring scheme is further improved if the parties are able to locally feedback the recovered information into the system . \n this leads naturally to a reduction in resources for protocols such as quantum repeaters , teleportation , swapping and error correction , as well as an improvement in the coherence time of quantum memories . \n we have also shown a way of using the information leakage to the environment to perform the optimal singlet conversion , the central task in classical entanglement percolation . \n finally , note that experiments already observe quantum jumps in different systems , e.g , harmonic oscillators ( microwave cavity fields )  @xcite , and in single ions  @xcite , which means that the scheme here proposed is clearly within nowadays technology . \n the authors thank a.  acn and a.r.r . \n carvalho for enlightening discussions . \n support from brazilian agencies cnpq and fapemig and the european project qap is warmly acknowledged . \n this work is part of brazilian national institute of science and technology on quantum information .", "StartTimeOffset": 1756861501206, "RequestID": "e16e5584afdfaed037d6eb70e214437b1355d94d", "TotalTokens": 3593}

section , defined by the divertor action , are enlarged from a partial central profile to an almost complete profile \n . observed at a fixed position at the plasma edge , we would have the impression that the rotation velocity has been speeded up . \n the corresponding mass density contours of eq.(17b ) for l and h modes are shown in fig.4 and fig.5 respectively . \n the profiles along @xmath58 horizontal cut are shown in fig.6 . \n although the two modes are presented in one same figure showing approximately the same dimensionless amplitudes , the physical amplitude and dimension is given by @xmath17 defined in eq . \n [ eqno10 ] . as a result \n , the mass density of the h mode could be much larger than that of the l mode . \n the essence of fig.6 is to show the relative shape of the mass density profiles for the two modes . \n we have suggested the identification of l mode to the @xmath88 solution in the @xmath112 domain , and h mode to the @xmath92 solution in the @xmath113 domain . to map these @xmath114 domains to the same @xmath33 domain of machine vessel , \n we have used two different normalizing parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the source function @xmath31 of eq . \n [ eqno17a ] . since @xmath115 \n , this would require a substantial increase of toroidal magnetic field according to eq . \n [ eqno23c ] . to avoid this substantial toroidal field enhancement , the h mode \n could be generated by superimposing the @xmath92 solution to the @xmath88 solution , without displacing significantly the @xmath114 domain . \n as an example , with @xmath116 , the profile of @xmath117 is shown in fig.7 indicating @xmath118 and @xmath119 with a maximum at @xmath120 . \n experimentally , due to the divertor action on the edge plasma , there is an electrostatic field normal to the magnetic surfaces . \n this field is particularly large in the h mode configuration because of the steep edge gradient . \n since the poloidal field lines are described by the @xmath11 contours , this field can be written as @xmath121 , which warrants @xmath122 for equilibrium . interacting with magnetic islands on a rational surface , this electric field drives zonal flows that establish transport barriers for better plasma density and energy confinements . with the rotational toroidal equilibrium approach , \n the l / h transition amounts to a bifurcation of the l equilibrium to the h equilibrium , under the actions of external pumping through pellet injection and strong auxiliary heating for density and temperature profile shaping . the normal electric field , zonal flows , and transport barriers , come as consequences , not cuases , of the steep edge gradient of the h mode . \n we have solved toroidal plasma equilibria with axisymmetric toroidal and poloidal rotations , that are self - similar to the corresponding magnetic fields . \n the rotational grad - shafranov equation in spherical coordinates is solved for toroidal solutions , under the assumption that the scalar rotational pressure is much less than the plasma pressure . with a specific set of source functions \n , there are two independent homogeneous radial modes given by @xmath88 and @xmath92 . the @xmath88 mode in the region @xmath91 and the @xmath92 mode in the region @xmath94 \n could be applied to current large scale tokamaks . \n the @xmath88 mode has a diffuse edge profile over a larger @xmath114 domain , and the @xmath92 mode has a steep edge profile over a smaller @xmath114 domain . \n we associate them to the l and h modes respectively . \n the l / h transition amounts to a bifurcation of one equilibrium configuration to another , following a change of the normalizing parameter from @xmath109 to @xmath110 . \n experimentally , this change of parameter could be achived by pellet injection and large external heating .", "StartTimeOffset": 1762465350672, "RequestID": "900c8c65736d2b2187f7cc389a1c88c13649f92d", "TotalTokens": 4167}

ion beams with comparison with that of pristine samples @xcite have shown the decrease of both the penetration field and the irreversible magnetization after irradiation . \n as in accordance with previous studies @xcite the magnetic properties in whiskers are dominated by surface effects , the penetration field decrease was attributed to the suppression of surface barriers by cd . \n but after irradiation the bulk pinning becomes remarkable and contribute to a sample magnetization , which was measured in the work @xcite . \n it is impossible to separate contributions of surface barrier and bulk pinning in such type of measurements .    in our study \n we use another technique , namely , a registration of the hysteresis loop of microwave absorption ( mwa ) . \n this method allows one to separate contributions of bulk pinning ( bp ) and of surface pinning ( sp ) by the shape of loop . \n the present study of the irreversibility line in the thin films irradiated with heavy ions confirms the suggestion of ref.@xcite and the theoretical estimates @xcite of suppression of surface barrier by columnar defects . \n the results of measurements of hysteretic microwave absorption have shown that in the films irradiated with -ions the high temperature part of irreversibility line , which is due to surface barrier , shifts towards low temperature and magnetic field . \n the films were prepared on a substrate with sputtering technique as described in ref.@xcite . \n they are of 200  nm thickness and have the superconducting transition temperature near 85  k. they were irradiated with  ions in the accelerator facility of the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung in darmstadt . \n the irradiation doses , expressed in the dose - equivalent matching field , were varied from 0.3 to 3  t. the superconducting transition shifts towards low temperature and broadens after irradiation of the films . \n the shift increases with the irradiation dose . \n the transition temperature of the film irradiated with dose @xmath3 t equals 78k . \n we studied irreversible properties of films by measuring the hysteresis of nonresonant microwave absorption . the detailed description of this method one can find in refs.@xcite . \n this method is sufficiently sensitive to enable the investigation of magnetic irreversibility of very thin superconducting films . \n moreover it allows one to separate contributions of bulk pinning and of surface pinning by the shape of the hysteresis loop . \n the measurements were performed in the high - temperature area , close to , where the surface pinning contribution became remarkable . \n the esr - spectrometer ber-418s ( bruker ) with the working frequency of 9.4ghz ( x - band ) was used to measure the microwave absorption of superconducting thin films . \n a sample was placed into the spectrometer cavity inside the helium gas - flow cryostat . \n its orientation was as follows : the applied dc field was perpendicular to the film plate ( parallel to c - axis ) , and the microwave field was in the film plane . \n a dc field was modulated with a frequency of 100khz and an amplitude from 0.1 to 10oe . to record \n the mwa hysteresis loop was swept with a velocity of @xmath4oe / s from cooling field @xmath5  to @xmath6 and back ( @xmath7oe ) . to avoid the instrumental error of detected hysteresis the signal of electron spin resonance ( esr ) of paramagnetic substance dpph ( diphenylpicrylhydrazyl ) is recorded along with the mwa hysteresis loop . \n the points of the irreversibility line were obtained by registration of the field at which the mwa hysteresis collapsed . \n previously we had found that both the shape of the mwa hysteresis loop and its dependence on modulation amplitude were governed by the vortex matter state and by the type of pinning : bulk or surface @xcite . \n one can exploit these properties of the mwa loop to locate the phase diagram areas with predominance of bulk pinning or surface barrier . in fig.[filoops ] \n the mwa hysteresis loops obtained on the pristine film at different temperatures are shown . at low temperatures ( @xmath8  k ) \n the loop shape corresponds to bulk pinning only @xcite . at high temperatures , close to , \n ( fig.[filoops]d ) the loop has the shape , which is due to surface barrier @xcite . here \n the point of irreversibility line ( @xmath9  oe ) is determined by surface pinning . at intermediate temperatures \n the mixture of these two types of the hysteresis is observed ( fig.[filoops]b ) . at @xmath10 \n k the small addition of `` surface loop '' to the main loop , which is due to bulk pinning , occurs in low field . \n the hysteresis disappears at @xmath11  oe , and the boundary of irreversibility is determined by the bulk pinning . at @xmath12 \n k ( fig.[filoops]c ) the contributions of bulk pinning and surface one are approximately equal to each other .    when both types of pinning contribute to a hysteresis we use the difference of their dependence on the field modulation amplitude in order to separate one contribution from another . \n in fig.[fimix]a it is shown the change of a loop shape with increasing the modulation amplitude from 0.4 to 8  oe . at small \n sp contributes remarkably in the low field range ( @xmath13  oe ) , and bp predominates in higher fields . at @xmath14 \n oe the bp contribution is fully eliminated . \n a shape of hysteresis loop is of `` pure surface type '' over whole field range from 0 to @xmath15  oe . \n so this field corresponds to the boundary of existing the surface barrier , and the irreversibility field has to be denoted as @xmath16 , that is due to surface pinning . \n the lower part of fig.[fimix ] shows the dependence of the hysteresis magnitude @xmath17  on the modulation amplitude for two values of applied field : a low field @xmath18  oe , where the sp contribution is considerable at any , and a higher field @xmath19  oe , where the bp prevails at small . \n it is seen that at @xmath20  oe the surface contribution increases almost linearly . in order to emphasize this fact the straight line \n is drawn along the points of @xmath18  oe \n . however , the bulk pinning contribution drastically reduces with increasing modulation amplitude . \n the curve of exponential decay is added for comparison . thus if one applies the modulation amplitude @xmath21  oe , it is possible to exclude the bulk pinning contribution and to investigate the dependence of @xmath16  on temperature and the irradiation dose . \n the points of irreversibility line @xmath22  are shown in fig.[il]a for three films , one is pristine and two films ion - irradiated with various doses , 0.3  t and 2  t. it is clearly seen that il shifts toward lower magnetic fields after irradiation . \n the effect is more pronounced in the film with large irradiation dose .    to take into account the shift of the superconducting transition temperature after the ion irradiation the il points of two samples are plotted versus reduced temperature @xmath23  in fig.[il]b . \n the shift of the il of irradiated film looks not so considerable with this axis as in fig.[il]a , but it is unambiguous .    the shift of the `` surface '' irreversibility line towards the area of low temperatures and magnetic fields indicates that the surface barrier is weakened upon the creation of columnar defects under the heavy - ion irradiation . \n this fact is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite . \n unfortunately , it is impossible to make quantitative comparison of our experimental data with the theoretical calculation since only the changes of the penetration field were estimated in paper @xcite , but not the irreversibility field . to estimate the decrease of the surface potential barrier under the cd generation quantitatively the comparison of the theoretically calculated il shift with the experimental results is needed . \n this might be a subject of future publication . \n thus , using the method of hysteretic microwave absorption measurements and its dependence on the applied magnetic field modulation we could isolate the contribution of surface pinning and watch the changes of the irreversibility line with increasing the dose of irradiation of the thin films with uranium ions . in agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite the suppression of surface barrier by columnar defects has been found . \n it manifests itself as the shift of irreversibility line towards low temperature and magnetic field . \n the effect is most significant for the films irradiated with large doses , @xmath24 t . \n this work was performed in the frame of joint program for scientific collaboration between russian academy of science and deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft . \n the work was partially supported by the russian ministry of industry and science under state contract no . 40.012.1.1.1356 , russian foundation for basic research ( grant no . \n 03 -

defined multiplet structures as well as many consecutive radial orders of the same @xmath2 . \n this allows us immediately to estimate the rotational frequency , @xmath3 , and the mean period spacing , @xmath4 , with the latter quantity putting strong constraints on the mass of the best - fitting model . \n furthermore , the variations from equidistant period spacing , i.e. , `` mode trapping '' , give us information ( at least in the case of gd  358 ) about the radial structure of the star , such as the thickness of its surface he layer .    in a detailed analysis of the frequency distribution in gd  358 \n , @xcite found evidence of a chemical transition zone located at a mass depth of @xmath5 , which they interpreted as the c / he boundary . \n a he layer thickness of @xmath610@xmath7 is thinner than expected on naive evolutionary grounds , as well as thinner than suggested for the da white dwarfs by the asteroseismological work of @xcite . while the fit of bradley & winget explained the trapping features in the neighborhood of 700 sec reasonably well , it did not do as well for periods near 500 sec . \n they found evidence that these periods near 500 sec might be better fit if an additional chemical transition zone at a depth of @xmath610@xmath8 is assumed . \n independent of the above considerations , if the theory of diffusion of chemical species in stars is correct , then at least a partial separation of different isotopes of the same element must occur in white dwarfs , as was pointed out to one of us by clayton ( 1988 , private communication ) . at the time \n , there were no known observational consequences ; this has since changed with the advent of white dwarf asteroseismology . \n while the galactic number ratio of to has been measured to be of order @xmath9 in many astrophysical environments @xcite , this does not necessarily hold for the stellar cores which are presumably the white dwarf progenitors . \n in fact , standard evolutionary theory would suggest quite low levels of in these objects @xcite . \n our view is that given the theoretical uncertainties in the late stages of stellar evolution , we should not rule out any possibilities , and indeed should seek to make as many independent measurements as possible . \n these considerations led to two independent motivations for considering diffusion @xcite . \n first , it is a process which may be a generic feature of white dwarf cooling , and , as such , should be considered as part of our asteroseismological analyses . \n second , it might allow us to place the mode trapping data for gd  358 in a different context : this star could have a c/ transition zone at @xmath10 and a thinner / transition zone at @xmath11 . \n if this is the case , then the dbv s and the dav s would again have the same order of magnitude he layer thicknesses . to determine the plausibility of these hypotheses , we first examine the relevant diffusion timescales , and then the effect which such a layering structure has on our fits of gd  358 . \n the process of diffusion is of major importance , since we are aware of no other effect which could lead to the spatial separation of and . \n we therefore examine the relevant timescales for such diffusive processes , to see if it is plausible for a significant fraction of the to have separated from in the elapsed evolutionary times for these objects . \n fortunately for us , @xcite have already examined the related problem of c diffusion in a background of normal he , i.e. , . in their analysis , they treated c as a trace element . \n this is an excellent approximation for our case as well , since we naively expect that the is only about one part in @xmath12 of the . \n applying their equations for this case for a 0.612 @xmath13 model , we obtain the result shown in figure  [ diffuse ] . \n we see that if we assume a @xmath14 of 25,000  k for a typical dbv , then diffusive equilibrium between and should prevail down to approximately the @xmath15 mass point . \n thus , if the layer is as thick or thicker than this , and the abundance is @xmath16 that of the abundance , we would expect a layer of thickness @xmath17 . \n one clear prediction of this is that the spectra of db s in this temperature range should show more or less pure , at least for layers which are thicker than @xmath18 . \n this is currently in the process of being tested using high - resolution spectroscopic observations ( koester , private communication ) . \n we mention as an aside that the case of may be unique in that it is a trace isotope which is _ lighter _ than the dominant species , so that it can diffuse upwards and produce a thin , but not asteroseismologically negligible layer . for trace isotopes which sink \n , there should be no such signature .      in this preliminary exploration \n , we will only consider / zones with equilibrium profiles , although the profiles could in fact be less sharp than this . \n the treatment of the chemical profiles in the transition zones in our present and previous work is based on the work of @xcite . \n essentially , we use equation ( a6 ) of @xcite , which assumes that an equilibrium distribution has been reached and that one of the elements may be treated as a trace element . \n this is certainly a valid assumption for the initial stages of diffusion , given the expected abundance ratio of to . \n to include the effects of a layer we have made a relatively simple modification to the envelope routines in our evolutionary code . \n since we are interested in modeling a db , we are free to use the array space normally reserved for the h profile and use it for the profile . to this end , we have replaced the h equation of state ( eos ) and opacities with those appropriate for . in doing this , \n we have taken the eos and opacities to be equal to those of at 3/4 the density ( to correct for the isotopic mass ratio ) . \n this approximation should be more than sufficient for our purposes . \n a comparison of the region of period formation for the cases of a /h and a / envelope is given in @xcite . \n we now wish to examine the effect which a layer could have on the pulsation frequencies . \n first , in the top panel of figure  [ fit0.61 ] , we show one of the best - fit models for the star gd  358 from @xcite . \n the filled circles connected by solid lines show the observed mode trapping structure , and the open circles connected by dotted lines show the results from the best - fit model . \n this model has @xmath19 , @xmath20 24,044 k , and @xmath21 . \n the lower 3 panels show the effect a thin layer of has on the mode trapping structure . \n if the layer is as thick as @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 , then we see that the mode trapping structure in the vicinity of 700 sec is significantly altered . \n fits_emu.tab unfortunately , this is the region in which the fit was already quite good , whereas in the region around 500 sec , where the fit was poor , there is very little change . \n however , this analysis clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of a layer can have a measurable effect on the calculated mode trapping structure . \n in an effort to test asteroseismologically the viability of the hypothesis of a layer , we performed an extensive set of calculations . using a genetic algorithm @xcite , \n the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath14 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 were varied to produce pulsational models whose @xmath27 , @xmath28 periods were compared with those inferred from the observations . \n the region of parameter space explored is given by : @xmath29 the best - fit models from these runs are listed in table  [ results ] . the column labeled \n @xmath30 gives the residuals ( standard deviation ) of the calculated and observed periods , and the column labeled @xmath31 gives the residuals of the calculated and observed period _ \n spacings_. for the upper four models we have taken the fitness criterion to be @xmath32 , whereas for the lower two models we took it to be @xmath33 $ ] ; thus , for these last two entries , we are fitting not just the periods but the spacings between consecutive periods . \n we have chosen this criterion for the models with a more realistic core composition based on our suspicion that the period _ spacings _ will be a more sensitive diagnostic of the layer than the periods themselves will be .    as a reference to previous fits , \n the fit of @xcite for a c core model has @xmath34  sec . \n thus , the present best fits , both with and without a layer , having period residuals of @xmath35 and @xmath36  sec , respectively , represent a significant improvement over previous fits . \n we see from table  [ results ] that the fits with o / c cores are significantly better than those with pure carbon cores , independent of whether a layer is present or not , a result previously found by @xcite . in figure \n [ fit ] , we display the mode trapping diagrams for these two fits . \n both fits reproduce the periods quite well , with the model reproducing the period _ spacings _ much better ( @xmath37 sec compared to @xmath38 sec ) . \n this indicates that the period spacing may be a better diagnostic for the fine structure produced by the / transition zone than just the periods themselves . \n we now seek to understand the relative importance of the o / c and / transition zones . in the asymptotic limit of high radial overtones and large periods , \n the frequency of a given mode is given by a simple radial integral of the brunt - visl frequency . \n using a `` period formation '' diagram , we can show the relative weight which a given region has in determining a mode s period .    in figure  [ pform2 ] \n , we show such a diagram for the case of our best - fit model . \n the three peaks which are labeled correspond to the o / c , c/ , and / transition zones . using the equilibrium diffusion coefficients for the / transition zone \n , we see that it is of relatively minor importance in determining the mode frequencies . \n in contrast , the o / c and c/ transition zones are both quite pronounced and should significantly affect the periods of the modes calculated in the models ; this is borne out by the major improvement in the standard deviation of the periods , @xmath30 , with the inclusion of an o / c chemical profile . \n the period _ spacings _ , on the other hand , are a differential quantity , and therefore sensitive to even small deviations in the background structure . \n it is therefore not surprising that the inclusion of a layer results in a major reduction in the resduals of the period spacings . \n we now attempt to quantify the statistical significance of the improvement of the fit when the parameter corresponding to the layer thickness is added . \n following @xcite , we apply the bayes information criterion ( bic ) for @xmath39 data points . \n we find that the addition of a parameter should be accompanied by a decrease in the residuals of at least @xmath610% in order to be considered statistically significant . \n we note that this is a necessary but certainly not sufficient condition for the validity of adding a parameter .    examining the best - fit o / c core models \n , we see that the standard deviation of the fit to the period spacings improved from 1.92  sec to 1.32  sec with the addition of . \n this is a decrease of 30% and should therefore be considered statistically significant . \n finally , we again note that the models with o / c cores yield markedly lower residuals , regardless of which criterion is used ( periods or period _ spacings _ ) . \n this result has recently been obtained by @xcite , who report the results of such fits in an extensive parameter space of white dwarf models . \n from this preliminary analysis , we have shown that diffusion theory applied to white dwarfs predicts that any initially present in the dbv s down to a depth of @xmath610@xmath40 should have diffused upward to produce a surface layer of . \n in addition to being detectable spectroscopically ( koester , private communication ) , such a layer can significantly affect the asteroseismological fits , and therefore needs to be included in such analyses . \n we find that although the inclusion of a layer results in only a marginal improvement to the fits to the periods , the fit to the period _ spacings _ is significantly improved . \n this is because the period spacings are more sensitive to the fine structure which a / transition zone produces than the periods themselves are .    finally , we find that an o / c core ( essentially , the transition in the core from an o / c mixture to pure c ) fits the observed pulsational spectrum of gd  358 _ much _ better than a pure c core , in agreement with @xcite , who first obtained this result . \n this gives us the hope of someday being able to constrain the prior nuclear burning history of gd  358 and other pulsating white dwarfs . \n we would like to thank jim truran , don clayton , and hugh van horn for useful discussions on this topic . \n this work was supported in part by the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenshaftlichen forschung , project number s7304 , by the national science foundation under grant ast-9876730 , and by the national aeronautics and space administration under grant nag5 -

[ ) ] .    in view of the above \n , i propose that the source of this discrepancy may lie in neglect of many - body interactions . \n previous molecular dynamics simulations of systems consisting of 108 particles interacting via _ ab initio _ pair potential and axilrod - teller - muto ( atm ) interaction indicated that a triple - dipole interaction does not affect the bulk viscosity of liquid xenon near its triple point @xcite and dense gaseous krypton @xcite . \n however , the error in the values of bulk viscosity obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of the systems with such a small number of particles can be quite large . \n for example , the values of the reduced bulk viscosity of the lennard - jones systems consisting of 128 and 256 particles at the reduced temperature @xmath4 and the reduced density @xmath5 , reported in refs  , range from 0.89 to 1.47 , with the ratio of the latter to the former of 1.65 . \n this paper presents the results of more accurate molecular dynamics simulations of a liquid consisting of 1372 argon atoms with _ ab initio_+atm interaction , which demonstrate that bulk viscosity , determined from green -

{"ContextTokens": 3008, "GeneratedTokens": 164, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years there has been a growing interest for the vertical structure of the hi disks of spiral galaxies and for the disk - halo connection . \n evidence for hi gas flows between disk and halo comes from the detection of large vertical motions in several galaxies viewed close to face - on ( dickey et al . \n 1990 ; kamphuis 1993 ; schulman & bregman 1994 ) and the connection of this high velocity gas with hi holes and star formation activity in the disk ( kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) . \n more evidence comes from the study of edge - on galaxies like ngc  891 in which the hi has been found to extend up to at least 5 kpc into the halo , where it seems to rotate about 25 km @xmath1 more slowly than in the plane ( swaters et al . \n 1997 ) . the combination of the results from face - on and edge - on galaxies leads to the picture of effervescent galaxies ( sancisi et al . \n 1996 ) , consistent with galactic fountains models ( bregman 1980 ; spitzer 1990 ) .    the galaxy studied here , ngc  2403 , has an intermediate inclination ( i=@xmath2 ) . \n the consequence is that the measured line - of - sight velocities are a combination of rotational , radial and vertical motions and the column densities are integrated along an oblique line - of - sight . \n therefore , the interpretation is less straightforward than in face - on or edge - on galaxies . \n however , there is the advantage that information is obtained on both the vertical density structure and the vertical kinematics of the hi for the same object .    for this study \n we have used the hi observations obtained by sicking ( 1997 ) with the westerbork radio telescope , which have about a factor of 2 better sensitivity and a higher velocity resolution than those of wevers et al . \n 1 shows the optical image , the total hi density distribution , the velocity field and the hi position - velocity map along the major axis . \n the latter shows that the hi line profiles at any position along the major axis are not symmetrical with respect to the rotation velocities , as they would be if they were determined by random motions only . \n instead , they are systematically more extended towards the systemic velocity . \n this striking asymmetry is particularly obvious in the lowest contour and extends systematically over almost the whole major axis . \n it was already noticeable in the maps produced by wevers et al . \n ( 1986 ) and by begeman ( 1987 ) and the puzzle presented by those early observations has motivated this study . \n the presence of such a ` beard ' is remarkable considering the size of the beam ( see lower left in fig . \n 1 ) with respect to the size of the galaxy . usually such an asymmetry is seen in edge - on galaxies or in galaxies which are not well resolved . in such cases \n the telescope beam ` sees ' not only the emission from a small area on the major axis but also larger areas away from it which have lower line - of - sight velocities and therefore cause the observed asymmetry . \n ngc  2403 is neither highly inclined nor poorly resolved .    what is the origin of the ` beard ' ? \n it is clear that it can not simply be explained by gas moving perpendicularly away from or towards the disk , because that would produce extensions symmetric with respect to the rotation velocity . \n neither can it be the result of deviations from axial symmetry or circular motion . \n these would affect the kinematics of the disk and produce visible effects in the velocity field , but not a low density asymmetry as observed . \n a likely explanation for the observed asymmetry is that not all of the hi is concentrated in a thin disk , but that part of it is in a vertically extended component . in this case , \n given the inclination of 61 degrees , a line - of - sight to a point on the major axis will also intercept the hi located above and below the plane which has line - of - sight velocities lower than those in the plane . \n this will produce a systematic broadening of the hi profiles towards the systemic velocity of the kind seen in fig . \n 1 . it is this effect that we study here with 3-d models of the density distribution and kinematics of the hi in ngc  2403 . \n [ f : lvmodels ] \n we consider the possibilities of both a thick hi disk ( as opposed to the usually assumed thin layer ) , and of a two - component structure , with a thin layer and a thicker but less dense one . \n this thick layer may be corotating with the thin one or may be rotating more slowly . \n both cases are examined . \n the reason for considering the slower rotation is that a non - corotating disk and halo have been proposed by swaters et al . \n ( 1997 ) as the most likely interpretation for the hi observations of the edge - on galaxy ngc  891 . \n axial symmetry and circular motions are assumed throughout . \n this assumption is supported by the results of schoenmakers et al . \n ( 1997 ) who found from their harmonic analysis of the hi velocity field of ngc  2403 that non - circular motions are not important in this galaxy . \n therefore , we have modelled ngc  2403 with a set of concentric rings , each ring characterized by a radius , a circular velocity , a velocity dispersion and a column density . \n centre , systemic velocity , inclination and position angle , scaleheight and vertical density profile were chosen to be the same for all rings . \n the values adopted here are , unless specified otherwise , those derived by sicking ( 1997 ) . \n the thin component always has a fwhm thickness of 0.5 kpc , the thickness of the thick layer is a free parameter . for the vertical density profile \n we have assumed a gaussian distribution . \n we have also tried an exponential distribution , but the results do not seem to change significantly . in the case of non - corotation \n the circular velocity of the thicker component has been lowered by a fixed amount , for example 25 km @xmath1 , in the flat part of the curve and a proportionally smaller one in the inner parts . for the velocity dispersion \n we have used a value of 7 km @xmath1 as derived for the profile widths in the regions of the flat part of the rotation curve . \n we have also constructed models with higher velocity dispersions for the thick components , up to 30 km @xmath1 , but the results do not differ significantly . \n the two - component models have been constructed by adding two one - component models . \n this is obviously an oversimplification as it is more likely that any vertical decrease of density and velocity would be gradual . \n the model data cubes have been inspected and analyzed in the same way as the observed cubes . for the comparison of the models and the observations we have used the channel maps and the position - velocity maps along the major and minor axes . here \n we present only the position - velocity maps along the major axis and only a small number of models , but we have explored the whole relevant parameter space .    initially , we tried a model with a one - component gas layer . \n cuts along the major axis for various thicknesses are shown in the first column of fig .  2 . \n the observations are in the top right panel . \n it is immediately clear that a thin disk model does not reproduce the observed asymmetry . \n a thickness of about 5 kpc ( fwhm ) would be needed to explain it . \n it is obvious that such a layer would be unrealistically thick , much thicker than that of our galaxy , which according to dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) has a fwhm of only 220 pc , or that of ngc  891 , for which most of the hi is in an unresolved layer with a fwhm thickness of less than 1 kpc ( swaters et al . \n 1997 ) .    therefore , we explored the possibility of having , instead of one very thick gaussian disk , a relatively thin disk of high density and in addition a vertically more extended but lower density layer . for this \n we have built a model with two components , one thin and one thick , both rotating at the same velocity . \n the fwhm of the thick component and the column density ratio between the two components are free parameters . \n we found , however , that there is little freedom in the choice of this ratio and we fixed it tentatively at 1:1 . with a lower density for \n the thick component only a weak asymmetry would appear . \n the best model seems the one with a thick component of fwhm close to 5 kpc ( see fig .  2 ) \n . hence this model is not significantly different from the one - component model and is equally unrealistic as it requires unreasonable amounts of hi at large distances from the plane . \n finally , we released the condition of corotation and explored the effects of a decrease of the rotational velocity with distance to the plane . \n for this we have constructed models with a slowly rotating thick component . \n again , the fwhm of the thick component and the column density ratio are free parameters . but \n here as an additional parameter we have the velocity decrease \n . a thin - to - thick disk density ratio of 4:1 was found to give the best comparison with the data . with a higher ratio \n the asymmetry would tend to disappear , whereas a lower ratio would not reproduce the observed density contrast between the profile peak and its wings . \n for the thick component a fwhm of 1 kpc was adopted . for this thickness the best agreement with the observations is obtained with the 25 km @xmath1 decrease ( see fig .  2 ) . \n models with a thick component of larger fwhm than 1 kpc were also tried . \n for example , in the lower right of fig .  2 , we show a model that also reproduces the observed asymmetry well , and in which the thick component , still with a 25 km @xmath1 decrease in rotation velocity , has a thickness of 3.5 kpc . for this thickness \n the optimal column density ratio of the thin and thick disk is 6:1 . \n this illustrates that it is difficult to distinguish between an extended , low density and a less extended , higher density vertical distribution . \n from section 3 it is clear that all three types of models can explain the observed asymmetry to some extent . \n however , the first two models require unrealistic amounts of hi above the plane . \n the third model has a much more realistic vertical distribution , with less than 20% of the gas in the thick component , and it requires that the gas above the plane rotates more slowly than the gas in the disk , by about 25 km @xmath1 . \n this model also appears to reproduce the observed position - velocity diagram better than the other models , in particular near the center , where the hi has a narrow and peaked distribution , and at large radii , where low level wings are visible . \n note that in the observed position - velocity diagram ( fig . \n 1 ) the wings near the center extend almost to the systemic velocity . \n clearly , such features can not be reproduced in models with corotation , and not even in those with a velocity decrease as high as 35 km @xmath1 . \n to explain these extended wings a much larger velocity decrease is needed , probably at least 50 km @xmath1 . \n what produces such a thick hi layer and what causes its slower rotation ? \n galactic fountain models ( bregman 1980 ; spitzer 1990 ) may provide the framework for an answer . the fountain is formed by hot gas rising from the disk , its energy derived from stellar winds and supernova explosions . in the halo region \n the gas cools and condenses into clouds that fall back onto the disk . as the gas moves up , \n the centrally directed gravitational force decreases , and the gas moves outwards . due to conservation of angular momentum the azimuthal velocity decreases . \n this decrease will be most pronounced in the central parts of the galaxy , where a fixed radial displacement will result in a larger velocity decrease than in the outer regions . \n using thermohydrodynamic models , struck & smith ( 1999 ) have recently shown that a reduced circular velocity above and below the plane is expected to be present in turbulent disks as a result of radial motions driven by star formation activity . \n ngc  2403 appears to have sufficient star formation activity to drive a galactic fountain . \n this is for instance indicated by its large number of hii regions ( sivan et al . \n four of these are exceptionally bright , comparable to the most massive starburst region in the local group , the 30 doradus complex ( drissen et al . \n furthermore , thilker et al . \n ( 1998 ) have found that the surface of ngc  2403 is covered by shells and fragmentary structures which are likely to have formed as a result of star formation activity . \n they have also found that these structures are part of a diffuse component of neutral hydrogen extending at least 400 pc from the plane . \n the overall picture of ngc  2403 , as suggested by the modelling , is reminiscent of that of ngc  891 . for this galaxy \n it was found ( swaters et al . \n 1997 ) that the thick component has a fwhm of about 4 kpc , and this gas appears to rotate more slowly than the gas in the disk by about 25 km @xmath1 . in the central parts \n the velocity decrease was found to be much larger , perhaps up to 100 km @xmath1 .    in conclusion , we have presented evidence that the thin hydrogen disk of ngc  2403 is surrounded by a vertically extended layer of hi , which rotates more slowly than the disk . \n the observational picture is very similar to that found for ngc  891 . \n these results suggest that a vertically extended , slowly rotating hi layer may be common among spiral galaxies , at least among those with high levels of star formation . \n such extended hi layers have , however , very low surface densities and therefore very sensitive observations are needed to detect them . \n we thank f.j .  sicking for kindly making available the data and u.j . \n schwarz for helpful discussions .", "StartTimeOffset": 1791201201018, "RequestID": "8e97b139ba16a5b5501410cfa1b258c78762e603", "TotalTokens": 3172}

body simulations predict a number of halos which is a factor @xmath3 10 larger than the observed number at the level of local group [ @xcite ] . \n furthermore , cdm models yield dispersion velocities in the hubble flow within a sphere of @xmath4mpc between @xmath5kms@xmath6 for @xmath7 and between @xmath8kms@xmath6 for @xmath0 . \n the observed value is about @xmath9kms@xmath6 . \n neither model can produce a single local group candidate with the observed velocity dispersion in a simulation box of comoving volume @xmath10 [ @xcite ] . \n a related issue is that astrophysical systems which are dm dominated like dwarf galaxies [ @xcite ] , low surface brightness galaxies [ @xcite ] and galaxy clusters without a central cd galaxy [ @xcite ] show shallow matter \n density profiles which can be modeled by isothermal spheres with finite central densities . \n this is in contrast with galactic and galaxy cluster halos in high resolution n - body simulations [ @xcite ] which have singular cores , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the range between 1 and 2 . indeed \n , cold collisionless dm particles do not have any associated length scale leading , due to hierarchical gravitational collapse , to dense dark matter halos with negligible core radius [ @xcite ] .    a possible solution , coming from particle physics \n , would be to allow dm particles to self - interact so that they have a large scattering cross section and negligible annihilation or dissipation . \n self - interaction induces a characteristic length scale via the mean free path of the particle in the halo . \n this idea has been originally proposed to suppress small scale power in the standard cdm model [ @xcite ] and has been recently revived in order to address the issues discussed above [ @xcite ] . \n the main feature of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) is that large self - interacting cross sections lead to a short mean free path , so that dark matter particles with mean free path of the order of the scale length of halos allows for the transfer of conductive heat to the halo cores , a quite desirable feature [ @xcite ] . \n recently performed numerical simulations indicate that strongly self - interacting dark matter does indeed lead to better predictions concerning satellite galaxies [ @xcite ] . however , only in presence of weak self - interaction [ @xcite ] the core problem might be solved . \n the two - body cross section is estimated to be in the range of @xmath13 @xmath14/gev , from a variety of arguments , such as the requirement of a mean free path between 1 and 1000 kpc [ @xcite ] , the core expansion time scale to be smaller than the halo age [ @xcite ] and analysis of cluster ellipticity [ @xcite ] . \n larger value of @xmath15 @xmath14/gev corresponds to the best fit to the rotation curve of a low surface brightness in simulations [ @xcite ] . in our work , we assume for definiteness that the the cross section is fixed via the requirement that the mean free path of the particle in the halo is in the range @xmath16 kpc . \n many models of physics beyond the standard model suggest the existence of new scalar gauge singlets , _ \n e.g. _ , in the so - called next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model [ @xcite ] . in this section , \n we provide a simple example for the realization of the idea proposed in [ @xcite ] of a self - interacting , non - dissipative cold dark matter candidate that is based on an extra gauge singlet , @xmath17 , coupled to the standard model higgs boson , @xmath18 , with a lagrangian density given by :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the field @xmath17 self - coupling constant , @xmath21 is its mass , @xmath22 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value and @xmath23 is the coupling between the singlet @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n we assume that the @xmath17 mass does not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking since tight constraints from non - newtonian forces eliminates this possibility due to the fact that , in this case , there is a relation among coupling constant , mass and vacuum expectation value that leads to a tiny scalar self - coupling constant . in its essential \n features our self - interacting dark matter model can be regarded as a concrete realization of the generic massive scalar field with quartic potential discussed in [ @xcite ] . \n we mention that a model with features similar to ours has been discussed long ago in [ @xcite ] . \n we shall assume that @xmath17 interacts only with @xmath18 and with itself . \n it is completely decoupled for @xmath24 . for reasonable values of @xmath23 , this new scalar would introduce a new , invisible decay mode for the higgs boson . \n this could be an important loophole in the current attemps to find the higgs boson at accelerators [ @xcite ] . this coupling could , in principle , be relevant for @xmath25 scattering but we shall be conservative and assume that it is small and neglect its contribution . \n these particles are non - relativistic , with typical velocities of @xmath26 km @xmath27 . \n therefore , there is no dissipation of energy by , for instance , creating more particles in reactions like @xmath28 . \n only the elastic channel is kinetically accessible and the scattering matrix element near threshold ( @xmath29 ) is given by : @xmath30 near threshold the cross section is given roughly by : @xmath31    we shall derive limits on @xmath21 and @xmath20 by demanding that the mean free path of the particle @xmath17 , @xmath32 , should be in the interval @xmath33mpc . \n this comes about because , if the mean free path were much greater than about @xmath34mpc , dark matter particles would not experience any interaction as they fly through a halo . on the other hand , \n if the dark matter mean free path were much smaller than @xmath34kpc , dark matter particles would behave as a collisional gas altering substantially the halo structure and evolution . \n hence , we have : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the number and mass density in the halo of the @xmath17 particle , respectively . using @xmath38 gev/@xmath39 , \n corresponding to the halo density , one finds : @xmath40 equating eqs . \n ( [ cross1 ] ) and ( [ cross2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath41    demanding the mean free path of the @xmath17 particle to be of order of 1 mpc implies in the _ model independent _ result : @xmath42    recently , it has been argued , on the basis of gravitational lensing analysis , that the shape of the ms2137 - 23 system is elliptical while self - interacting non - dissipative cdm implies that halos are spherical [ @xcite ] . furthermore , the limit    @xmath43    arises from that analysis , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than ( [ sstein ] ) . \n indeed , gravitational lensing arguments are acknowledged to be crucial in validating sidm ; however , estimates made in [ @xcite ] were criticized as they rely on a single system and because their intrinsic uncertainties actually allow for consistency with sidm [ @xcite ] .    in order to estimate the amount of @xmath17 particles that were produced in the early universe and survived until present , we assume that @xmath17 particles were mainly produced during reheating after the end of inflation . a natural setting to consider this issue is within the framework of @xmath44 supergravity inspired inflationary models , where the inflaton sector couples with the gauge sector only through the gravitational interaction . hence , the number of @xmath17 particles expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the photonic entropy density , is related with the inflaton ( @xmath47 ) abundance after its decay by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the number of degrees of freedom . notice that @xmath50 is a conserved quantity since @xmath17 does not couple to fermions . in the context of @xmath44 supergravity inflationary models , the upper bound on the reheating temperature in order to avoid the gravitino problem ( see [ @xcite ] and references therein ) , @xmath51 is given by the ratio of the reheating temperature and the inflaton mass and , for typical models    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is an order one constant . \n this estimate allows us to compute the energy density contribution of @xmath17 particles in terms of the baryonic density parameter :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the baryon asymmetry of the universe .    using eq . \n ( [ mass ] ) and taking @xmath56 , we obtain :    @xmath57    which allows identifying @xmath17 as the cosmological dark matter candidate , i.e. @xmath58 [ @xcite ] , for @xmath59 , @xmath20 of order one and @xmath60 of about @xmath34mpc . \n we have also found that the @xmath17 particle do not generate dangerous non - newtonian forces [ @xcite ] . \n in this work [ @xcite ] , we suggest that a scalar gauge singlet coupled with the higgs field in such a way as to give origin to an invisible higgs is a suitable candidate for self - interacting dark matter . \n this proposal has some quite distinct features . \n firstly , since gauge invariance prevents the scalar singlet to couple to fermions , hence strategies for directly searching this dark matter candidate must necessarily concentrate on the hunt of the higgs field itself in accelerators . \n furthermore , in what concerns its astrophysical and cosmological implications , the main aspects of our proposal are quite unambiguously expressed by eqs . \n ( [ cross2 ] ) , ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ finaldensity ] ) . \n confronting the result of simulations with our candidate for different values of the relevant parameters with observations may turn out to be crucial for validating our proposal . \n we would like to add that a recent detailed study of our simple model [ @xcite ] has shown that our abundance computation is valid only if the higgs field is very weakly coupled to the scalar gauge singlet ( @xmath61 ) , since otherwise the scalar field will reach thermal equilibrium [ @xcite ] . \n the study of phion annihilation processes via exchange of virtual higgs particles indicates that in order to achieve @xmath62 requires @xmath63 [ @xcite ] which leads to a higgs decay width that is distinctly different than the standard model one . \n r.r . would like to thank pronex ( cnpq ) for providing travel funds and grupo de detectores avanados of centro de fsica nuclear da universidade de lisboa under project praxis / p / fis/10033/98 for support during his stay in portugal . \n l.t . would like to acknowledge the financial support from fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia ( portugal ) under the grant praxis xxi /bpd/16354/98 and the project praxis / c / fis/13196/98 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1800605117772, "RequestID": "139634e4c8cf8e1167a2b780a33d0112becb86b5", "TotalTokens": 2821}

{"ContextTokens": 4041, "GeneratedTokens": 156, "SynthesizedBody": "over the past 50 years , many different techniques have been devised and employed to study strongly correlated electron systems . \n unfortunately , advantages of the successful attempts were usually outweight by their limitations . recently , because of the progress in computer technology , complex diagramatic approaches have received increased attention . \n although baym and kadanoff s @xmath1 derivability @xcite does not guarantee the physical validity of a theory , their framework enables the generation of conserving approximations which are guaranteed to satisfy a variety of ward identities . for these reasons , the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite has been intensively studied over the years . \n its major disadvantage however is that it represents a conserving approximation at the single - particle level only . \n thus , the physical validity of the approximation appears to be questionable as the vertices are either overestimated or underestimated and the pauli exclusion principle is not respected properly @xcite . in contrast , the parquet formalism @xcite introduced by de dominicis et al .  in 1964 \n is a conserving approximation which is self - consistent also at the two - particle level and one may hope that it resolves at least some of the limitations flex has . \n unfortunately , it has extremely complicated structure and was , apart from applications to the anderson impurity model and the 1-d hubbard model with small system size @xcite , hitherto also computationally out of reach . to circumvent this limitation , bickers et al.introduced the so - called pseudo - parquet approximation @xcite which attempts to improve on the flex without introducing the complexity of the full parquet equations . \n but this approach fails to properly address the full frequency and momentum dependence of the scattering processes . only very recently , \n due to the great advance of the parallel computing and the tremendous increase in computer memory , has it become possible to fully solve this approximation for the first time . \n the paper is organised as follows . in part \n i we present the formalism and the resulting equations . in part ii , we discuss the algorithm and the numerical difficulties that arising . \n in part iii , we present first results obtained from the parquet approximation ( pa ) for the 2-dimensional hubbard model and their comparison to other conserving approximaton methods such as flex and self - consistent second - order approximation ( sc2nd ) . \n as a benchmark , we compare these results against the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) which provides a numerically exact result . \n standard perturbative expansions attempt to describe all the scattering processes as single- or two - particle feynman diagrams . in the single - particle formalism \n the self - energy describes the many - body processes that renormalize the motion of a particle in the interacting background of all the other particles . in the two - particle context , with the aid of the parquet formalism , \n one is able to probe the interactions between particles in greater detail using the so - called vertex functions , which are matrices describing the two particle scattering processes . \n for example , the reducible two - particle vertex @xmath2 describes the amplitude of a particle - hole pair scattered from its initial state @xmath3 into the final state @xmath4 . here \n , @xmath5 represents a set of indices which combines the momentum @xmath6 , the matsubara frequency @xmath7 and , if needed , the spin @xmath8 and band index @xmath9 .    in general , depending on how particles or holes are involved in the scattering processes , one can define three different two - particle scattering channels . \n these are the particle - hole ( p - h ) horizontal channel , the p - h vertical channel and the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel . for the hubbard model , the spin degree of freedom \n further divides the particle - particle channel into triplet and singlet channels while the particle - hole is divided into density and magnetic channels . \n one can further discriminate the vertices according to their topology . \n starting from the reducible vertex @xmath10 introduced above , we may define the irreducible vertex @xmath11 corresponding to the subclass of diagrams in @xmath10 that can not be separated into two parts by cutting two horizontal green s function lines . \n similarly , the fully irreducible vertex @xmath12 corresponds to the subclass of diagrams in @xmath11 that can not be split into two parts by cutting two green s function lines in any channel . \n an illustration of these different types of vertices is provided in fig . \n [ fig : dia ] . \n the pauli exclusion principle produces the so - called crossing symmetries which in turn yield relationships between these vertices in the different channels . \n this enables us to reduce the independent channels defined for the theory to the particle - particle and the particle - hole horizontal channels . \n the parquet formalism assumes the complete knowledge of the fully irreducible vertices and provides a set of equations which are self - consistent at both the single- and two - particle levels . \n the connection between the single- and two - particle quantities is through the schwinger - dyson equation which connects the reducible vertex @xmath10 to the self - energy @xmath13 . \n it is an exact equation derived from the equation of motion and has the following form :    @xmath14    where g is the single - particle green s function , which itself can be calculated from the self - energy using the dyson s equation : @xmath15 here , the indices @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 combine momentum @xmath19 and matsubara frequency @xmath20 , i.e.  @xmath21 . \n the reducible and the irreducible vertices in a given channel are related by the bethe - salpeter equation . \n it has the following form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 for the density and magnetic channels respectively and @xmath24 for the singlet and triplet channels , and we are using the vertex ladders which are defined as : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the direct product of two single - particle green s functions and is defined according to the particle - particle or the particle - hole channel .    in a similar manner , \n the irreducible vertex and the fully irreducible vertex are related by the parquet equation . \n this set of equations expresses the fact that the irreducible vertex in a given channel is still reducible in the other two channels . \n the parquet equation has the following form in the different channels :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    the bethe - salpeter and parquet equations are also exact and derived from the categorization of the feynman diagrams . \n the above discussion of the structure of the parquet formalism is far from being exhaustive and is merely intended to make the paper reasonably self - contained . for a more detailed description of the parquet formalism , \n we refer the reader to bickers et al . \n our actual goal is to numerically solve these equations self - consistently for the hubbard model on a two dimensional cluster . \n the algorithm for this solution is described in the next section . \n the set of equations dicussed above are solved self - consistently as illustrated in the self - consistency loop in fig . \n [ fig : al ] . \n one starts with a guess of the single - particle green s function or self - energy . \n this can , for example , be taken from the second - order approximation . \n the reducible and the irreducible vertices are also initialized with the bare interaction . \n the self - consistency loop can then be described as follows :    1 . \n first we calculte the bare susceptibility @xmath31 which is given by the product of two green s functions 2 .   next this bare susceptibility \n is used to calculate @xmath10 through the bethe - salpeter equation 3 . \n we then proceed with updating the irreducible vertices @xmath32 by solving the parquet equation.this step requires the input of the fully irreducible vertex @xmath33 . in the context of the parquet approximation which we study here it is taken to be the bare interaction . \n it however can also be extracted from some more sophisticated methods . \n it is followed by a calculation of the new @xmath10 through the bethe - salpeter equation 5 . \n this value of @xmath10 is then used to update the self - energy through the schwinger - dyson equation 6 . \n the dyson s equation is solved for the green s function @xmath34 . \n this loop is repeated until convergence of the self - energy @xmath35 is achieved within a reasonable criterion . \n unfortunately , this loop becomes unstable when the strength of the coulomb interaction is increased or the temperature is lowered . as we believe that this instability is purely numerical in origin and related to the iterative nature of the algorithm , we have to extend the above scheme to account for this problem . \n for example , one possibility is to start with an overestimated self - energy and to damp it along with the irreducible vertex between two iterations according to : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are some damping parameters . \n another possibility is to rewrite the coupled bethe - salpeter and parquet equations in the form @xmath39 and apply a variant of a newton s root searching method . \n then we can take advantage of the existing linear solvers such as bicgs @xcite , gmres @xcite or the broyden algorithm @xcite . \n one major advantage that the parquet formalism has over exact diagonalization ( ed ) or quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is that it scales algebraically with the volume of the system in space - time for any choice of parameters including those that lead to a sign problem in qmc . \n the most time - consuming part of the formalism is the solution of the bethe - salpeter and the parquet equations , where the computational time scales as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the number of sites on the cluster and @xmath43 the number of matsubara frequencies . \n although the scaling is better than that of ed or qmc when the sign problem is severe , one can see that the complexity quickly grows beyond the capacity of usual desktop computers with incrasing system size , and large - scale supercomputer systems have to be employed . \n our parallel scheme and our data distribution are based on the realization that the bethe salpeter equation is the most time - consuming part of our calculation . \n one can easily see that it decouples nicely with respect to the bosonic momentum - frequency index @xmath18 . \n this enables us to distribute the vertices across processors with respect to this third index and to solve the bethe - salpeter equation with a local matrix inversion . \n however , this storage scheme puts a limit on the size of the problem that we can address . for a node with 2  gbytes of memory , the maximum value of @xmath44 that we can use if our variables are complex double precision is about @xmath45 .    unlike the bethe - salpeter equation \n , one can readily observe that the parquet equation does not decouple in terms of the third index . \n solving this equation requires a rearrangement of the matrix elements across processors and this is the communication bottleneck in the algorithm . \n the rearrangement is necessary to obtain the form of the vertex ladder @xmath46 or @xmath47 that is required in the parquet equation . for instance , in the @xmath48 channel , we need @xmath49 . \n this form of the vertex ladder is obtained by employing the three - step process described in the following equations : @xmath50    the first step in this transformation only moves data locally in memory . \n this does not require much time . \n the second step is actually just a 2d matrix transpose but with matrix elements spreading on many nodes . \n this is where communication across nodes is required . \n it is achieved by using the standard message passing interface ( mpi ) collective directives @xcite . \n the final step is also local and can equally be done very fast . \n in the following section , we will show the pa results for a @xmath51 hubbard cluster at half - filling . \n the calculations are done for @xmath52 and different temperatures . \n the calculations are performed for a finite number of matsubara frequencies @xcite . however , for the observables we calculated , such as the local moment and magnetic susceptibility in fig . \n [ fig : mu ] and fig . \n [ fig : chi ] , we performed an extrapolation to an infinite number of frequencies so that the cutoff error in frequency is minimized . to see how good pa works for the lattice model , we use the dqmc result as the benchmark . in the dqmc calculation , @xmath53 is used and the combined statistical and systematic errors are smaller than the symbols used . to further compare pa to other approximations , \n flex and self - consistent second - order results are also included .       for the three diagrammatic approaches and the dqmc . for this temperature , the pa result ( solid line ) looks very close to the dqmc one ( symbol solid line ) as compared to sc second - order ( dashed line ) or flex ( dash - dotted line ) . ] \n first , one can get a rough idea of how pa improves the accuracy of physical observables by comparing the single - particle green s function from different levels of approximation . \n shown in fig . \n [ fig : gtau ] are @xmath55 with @xmath56 calculated from the self - consistent second - order approximation , flex , pa and dqmc . \n the parquet result is significantly closer to the dqmc result than the second - order approximation and flex results as can readily seen from the figure . \n this confirms the intuition that one would get better results if the approximation is made on the vertex which is most irreducible . \n next we present results for the local magnetic moment defined as @xmath57where @xmath58 denotes the number operator for electrons of spin @xmath59 . in the context of a conserving approximation \n , it can be re - expressed in terms of the self - energy and the single - particle green s function as @xmath60where the trace sums over both the momentum and the frequency degrees of freedom . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : mu ] . among the three diagrammatic approaches , \n the pa result comes closest to the dqmc one . \n if we look more carefully at the dqmc curve , we can find the existence of two humps . \n the hump at @xmath61 , which is well reproduced by the pa , designates the energy scale for the charge fluctuation , and is directly related to the suppression of charge double occupancy . \n the other hump beginning at @xmath62 is related to the virtual exchange interaction , @xmath63 between nearby spins . \n it is believed to be related to the synergism between the development of the long - range antiferromagnetic correlation and enhancement of the local moment . as a result , \n a pseudogap is opened which increases the entropy of the system @xcite . \n the magnitude of @xmath64 can be estimated by noticing @xmath65 for the strong coupling limit and @xmath66 in the weak coupling limit @xcite . \n therefore it basically interpolates between these two limits for that @xmath52 is in the intermediate coupling regime . \n this hump is not well captured by pa . \n the increasing importance of envelop - shape diagram contribution @xcite not included in pa is responsible for this deviation in the low temperature region . \n finally , we look at the uniform magnetic susceptibility which is defined as @xmath67 with magnetic moment defined as @xmath68    the @xmath69 from different approaches are presented in fig . \n fig : chi . \n the uniform magnetic susceptibility calculated from dqmc follows a nearly linear dependence on @xmath70 this mimics closely the curie - weiss law of weakly interacting moments and implies that the dominant effect in the system is the short range magnetic fluctuation . \n this is consistent with the @xmath71 dependence of the local moment presented in fig . \n [ fig : mu ] . \n as the temperature still dominates over the spin energy scale of the system , it suppresses the long range fluctuation .    from this figure , the improvement of pa over the other two approximations is also easy to see . \n similar to the local moment , the difference between results from pa and dqmc at the low temperature region can be explained by the omission of envelop - shape diagrams in pa . \n we have presented the parquet formalism , pa method and in particular the implementation we use to solve large - sized problem . \n the preliminary application of pa on the @xmath51 hubbard cluster shows that it can yield better results than the self - consistent second - order or flex calculations . \n this is the first step in our work , next we are going to use the parquet formalism in the so - called multi - scale many - body ( msmb ) approach @xcite . within msmb , \n correlations at different length scales are treated with different methods . \n the short length scales are treated explicitly with qmc methods , intermediate length scales treated diagrammatically using fully irreducible vertices obtained from qmc and long length scales treated at the mean field level . \n note that in this approach the fully irreducible vertex is approximated by a qmc calculation on a small cluster , while in pa it is approximated by the bare interaction . \n therefor this approach should provide superior results to the pa . \n another advantage is that it can also avoid the exponential increase of the computational cost as the system size increases , and thus can take full advantage of the most up - to - date computer resources available \n . we will combine it with the local density approximation ( lda ) to gain some predictive power from the first principle electronic structure calculation . \n we would like to acknowledge the very useful discussion with gene bickers and john deisz . \n sy also acknowlegdes the hospitality and support of the insitute for theoretical physics at the universit of gttingen , where part of this work has been performed . \n this work is supported by doe scidac project de -

{"ContextTokens": 3436, "GeneratedTokens": 104, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of spiral galaxies indicate that the presence of a central structure called a _ bar _ is a common feature@xcite . \n the instability of isolated stellar disks in galactic models leads to bar formation and is characterized by toomre s stability parameter @xmath2@xcite . \n the models with @xmath3 are subject to bar formation . \n however , we are interested in dynamical effects of non  isolated systems which are found in clusters of galaxies . in this regard \n , it has been suggested that the observed bar in many spirals is the result of the gravitational interaction between two or more nearby galaxies . \n for instance , nogushi@xcite has found that , during the collision of two galaxies and between the first and the second closest approaches , the disk takes on transient bar shape . \n the gravitational interaction between the two galaxies gives rise to perturbations in the orbits of the stars that results in the formation of the bar . \n bar formation in the simulations of stellar disks depends upon various simultaneous effects . in the case of collisions , \n these factors are@xcite : rotation curve shape , disk - halo mass ratio , perturbation force and geometry . \n however , simulations can suffer from numerical effects such as low spatial and temporal resolution , too few particles representing the system and an approximate force model . \n these effects can be drastic : for example , observations show that bars have typically a length scale close to the exponential length of the disk@xcite , while the bar s semi - major axis obtained from numerical models is two to four times longer@xcite . \n recent observational data measured in the cosmic microwave background at various angular scales , in supernovae ia , in the 2df galactic survey , and baryon acoustic oscilations , suggest @xcite that the universe is composed of about @xmath4 baryons in the form of gas and stars , @xmath5 dark matter ( dm ) and @xmath6 dark energy , which is a kind of cosmological constant and is responsible for the today accelerated expansion of the universe . in this way \n , galaxies are expected to possess these dark components and , in accordance with rotation curves of stars and gas around the centers of spirals , this might be in the form of halos , and must contribute to at least 3 to 10 times the mass of the visible matter of spirals .    regarding to the nature of dm , we know that dm has to be non  baryonic . \n this is because nucleosynthesis abundances of light elements are only consistent with the above  mentioned baryonic fraction , and this is not sufficient at all to account for rotational velocities of spirals . \n this fact opens up new possibilities for explaining the nature of dm . in this sense , in papers @xcite a model was proposed in which a scalar field ( sf ) couples non - minimally to gravity to produce locally a modified newtonian theory of gravity . \n it turns out that the dynamics is now determined by the poisson equation coupled to a klein  gordon equation for the assumed scalar field in the galaxy . \n thus , the boson mass of the scalar field modifies the newtonian law of attraction , and the dynamics of dm is different from its newtonian counterpart . in this scalar \n tensor theory potential \n density pairs for various halo density profiles were computed@xcite .    in the present work we use the above - mentioned results to study the collision process of two spirals , each of which possess a disk , bulge and dark halo , in order to estimate the effects of the modified gravity theory on the bar s length and the orbital decay of galaxies . \n a numerical treecode was developed by one of us ( marm ) in order to compute the evolution of an @xmath7-body system interacting with the standard gravity plus the interaction of the scalar field@xcite . \n we first study dynamical effects on isolated galaxy models for three different interaction scales ( @xmath1 ) . \n we found no significant changes in the morphology of models , but we did in the total potential energy . \n then , we analyze the formation of a bar during a parabolic collision of two identical galaxies and compare the results obtained in the sf model with three scales of @xmath1 and with a pure newtonian interaction . \n a typical scalar  tensor theory is given by the following lagrangian @xmath8 + { \\cal l}_m(g_{\\mu\\nu } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] from which we get the gravity and sf equations . here \n @xmath9 is the metric , @xmath10 is the lagrangian matter and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arbitrary functions of the sf . \n according to the newtonian approximation , gravity and sf are weak , and the velocities of the stars are non  relativistic . \n then , we expect to have small deviations of the sf around the background defined here as @xmath13 . \n if we define the perturbation @xmath14 , then the newtonian approximation gives the equations @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 . \n here we define @xmath17 , the compton wavelength of the effective mass @xmath18 of some elementary particle ( boson ) given through @xmath11 and the potential @xmath12 , and @xmath19 is the amplitude of the perturbed sf , @xmath20 . \n the above formalism is valid for any potential that can be expanded in taylor series around @xmath21 . \n in what follows we will use @xmath1 instead of @xmath22 . \n this mass can have a range of values depending on particular particle physics models . \n general solutions of eqs . \n ( [ rio_eq_psiphibar ] ) can be found in terms of the corresponding green s functions and the new newtonian potential is @xmath23    solutions of these equations for point masses are @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 being a source mass . \n the total gravitational force on a particle of mass @xmath27 is @xmath28 the potential @xmath29 is the newtonian part and @xmath30 is the sf modification which is of yukawa type . \n we use the monte - carlo procedure to construct a galaxy model with a newtonian potential . \n a fully self  consistent model in the context of the sf is in preparation . \n the initial conditions of the galaxies are constructed following the model described by barnes@xcite . in this model , both the bulge and halo are non - rotating , spherically symmetric and with an isotropic gaussian distribution of velocities characterized by the velocity dispersions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . \n the units are such that the local ( @xmath33 ) gravitational constant is @xmath34 , and the units of mass , longitude and time are @xmath35 m@xmath36 , @xmath37 kpc and @xmath38 myrs , respectively . \n the bulge density profile is@xcite @xmath39 and the halo density profile is a dehnen s family member with @xmath40 @xcite @xmath41 the disk density profile is exponential @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the total mass of the bulge , disk , and halo , respectively . \n the scale lengths of the bulge , halo , and disk are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively , and @xmath49 is the scale height of the disk . \n the mass distributions were truncated at a radius containing @xmath50 of the total mass , since they extend to infinity . \n the compound galaxy was sampled with @xmath51 equal mass particles . \n the velocity distribution of the disk is given by the schwarzschild distribution function with the velocity dispersions @xmath52 , and @xmath53 given by the equilibrium condition of an infinite gravitating sheet ; @xmath54 is calculated from the epicyclic approximation . \n the toomre s parameter of initial disk is @xmath55 , so we have the disk which is marginally stable for axisymmetric perturbations , but not , however , against strong non - axisymmetric ones . \n observations suggest that the majority of the interacting galaxies are located on nearly parabolic orbits . \n for all the collisions , disks were located in the plane of parabolic orbits , calculated from parameterized equations of the two - body problem , with a pericentric separation @xmath56 , and the time to pericenter @xmath57 . \n the direction of rotation of one of the disks ( disk 1 ) was in the same direction as the corresponding orbital - angular - momentum , i.e. , direct motion . \n the other disk ( disk 2 ) was in retrograde motion . \n the two colliding galaxies are initially identical . \n for the time evolution we use a barnes tree code type@xcite modified to include the newtonian contribution of the scalar fields as given by eqs . \n ( 4)-(8 ) @xcite . \n the forces were computed with a tolerance parameter @xmath58 , and including the monopole term only . for the gravitational potential we used the standard plummer model @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the softening parameter taken in our simulations to be @xmath61 . \n the equations of motion were integrated using the second order leap  frog algorithm with a fixed time step @xmath62 . with these parameters \n we obtain a good energy conservation ( @xmath63 ) and , also , good angular momentum conservation ( @xmath64 ) for all runs presented here .    to characterize quantitatively the bar amplitude , we consider the distortion parameter defined as@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 \n the particles that are outside of the spatial region of the original disk can affect the parameter under study . \n for instance , if we calculate the distortion parameter using all the particles in the disk , we have in both cases similar evolution curves . \n therefore , to avoid the noise , we exclude particles that are outside of the original radius of the disk . \n we first study isolated galaxy models with different values of @xmath1 . \n we consider four set of simulations followed up to time @xmath68 . \n the parameters and results of runs are presented in the table , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the initial and mean total energies , and @xmath71 is the relative change of the total energy during the evolution with respect to its initial value . \n though the scale of interaction @xmath1 and magnitude of @xmath0 are unknown , we choose their values arbitrarily , such that @xmath1 is equal to the cutoff radius of the disk , bulge and halo for models a1 , a2 and a3 , respectively , and a fixed amplitude of the sf , @xmath72 . \n the larger @xmath1 makes weaker the contribution of sf for a fixed galactic size . for @xmath73 \n one obtains the newtonian case , model a4 . \n previous studies of protogalactic interactions under influence of this sf@xcite were made for scales less than those considered here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + all models show a good energy conservation ( see table ) . \n the presence of the sf decreases the total potential energy due to shallower potential well at distances @xmath74 . \n the initial models reaccommodate rapidly due to potential modification , i.e. , shifts to a new equilibrium state . at the end of evolution , \n the components of galaxy models with the sf became slightly more extended . \n the velocity profiles of the components match the newtonian ones up to @xmath75 . \n for @xmath74 there is a slow decay in velocities , since the effective gravitational constant decreases . \n the distortion parameter shows a nearly equal noise level of surface density of the disks . \n the evolution of the toomre s local stability parameter @xmath2 shows a slow decay from @xmath55 to @xmath76 with mean values presented in the table for each run . \n then , we proceed to study the interaction of two equal galaxy models . during the orbital decay \n we analyze the bar s strength for different values of @xmath1 . \n because the equilibrium galaxy models were constructed with newtonian potential , we relax them up to time @xmath77 with modified sf potential in order to reach a new equilibrium state for a given @xmath1 . \n then we place relaxed galaxies on parabolic orbits and let them interact . \n the results are as follows . \n the first encounter occurs at time @xmath78 . \n this is the time of major transfer of orbital angular momentum , and then disk 1 forms a strong bar , while disk 2 is in retrograde motion and develops a very weak bar . \n figure 1 ( left ) presents the separation between the centers of mass , @xmath79 , of two galaxies as a function of time . \n all runs , except a1 , after several close approaches merge and form a remnant . in the run with model a1 , after the first approach the galaxies separate such a large distance that they will never encounter again . \n this is because the weaker gravity is , the more lessable the galaxies are to become bound : at distances larger than @xmath1 the potential diminishes in comparison with the pure newtonian . in the runs a2 and a3 \n the sf causes just a retardation of the subsequent interactions . \n the simulation with model a3 is practically identical to newtonian one .    in order to analyze the bar formation , we consider following only the disk 1 . in figure 1 ( right ) \n we plot the distortion parameters @xmath80 as a function of time for runs with galaxy models a2 and a4 only . as a consequence of gravity modification \n , the galaxies do not approach each other too closely as happens in the newtonian run . \n thus , weaker perturbations make the bar shorter . \n the run with galaxy model a3 is very similar to the newtonian case . \n the bar s phases are displaced due to orbit modification .     for two collision \n runs with models a1 and a3.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]   for two collision runs with models a1 and a3.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ] \n from simulations of isolated galaxy models with different @xmath1 , we can see that the addition of a non  minimally coupled sf slightly modifies the equilibrium of newtonian model , acting as a small perturbation , and it diminishes the total potential energy for @xmath74 , since the effective gravitational constant decreases in this range . \n our results show that the interaction of galaxies with the sf is weaker in comparison with the newtonian case . \n we have found that the inclusion of the sf changes the dynamical properties such as the collision time , bar morphology , and in general the remnant properties . \n all these changes depend on the pair ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , which on the other hand , can be constrained from observations . \n for instance , the duration of interaction can not be larger than the age of the universe , implying constraints on values of @xmath81 , which depends on @xmath82 and @xmath0 . \n these constraints can be provided from statistical data on the fraction of observed interacting galaxies . \n a wide range of parameters should be investigated and higher resolution have to be used in simulations in order to make predictions for particular interacting models . \n further investigations with more particles and self - consistent initial models are under way . \n this work was partly supported by sre and conacyt of mxico under contracts u43534-r , sep-2003-c02 - 44917 . \n m.  a.  rodriguez - meza , et al . , in _ exact solutions and scalar fields in gravity : recent developments _ , edited by a. macias , et al . \n ( kluwer academic / plenum publishers , new york , 2001 ) , p. 213 . \n arxiv:0907.2466 [ astro-ph.co ] . m.a . \n rodrguez - meza and j.l . \n cervantes - cota , _ rev . \n ( serie de conferencias ) _ * 17 * ( 2003 ) 43 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1840952819868, "RequestID": "8152ea9cd90a616f3a1d86d79f6e680b33da4eb8", "TotalTokens": 3540}

trivial weak phases in the ckm - matrix are those of @xmath74  and @xmath75 . \n the relative weak phase between  and  for @xmath57  transitions is thus the phase of @xmath74 . \n the ratio of @xmath76   may therefore provide constraints on the poorly known phase of @xmath74  as was pointed out in ref . \n @xcite . \n the ratio of flavor singlet to flavor octet gluonic penguin diagrams @xmath77  is rather difficult to estimate theoretically . neglecting  and \n , we find that our current upper limit on @xmath78  is consistent with the naive expectation of @xmath79 . \n this may provide a more stringent limit on @xmath80  as we increase our data set . similarly , a significant discrepancy between the ratio of branching fractions for @xmath81  and @xmath82  may in the future provide a lower limit on @xmath83@xmath83 . \n construction of an amplitude quadrangle for these modes may in certain cases even provide information on the relative phases of these amplitudes . \n while we do see some excess of events above background in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the respective statistical significance of @xmath87  and @xmath88  is quite marginal . \n both of these decay modes are expected to be dominated by simple external w - emission ( ) diagrams . \n factorization may therefore be less questionable here than in the @xmath60  transitions discussed above .    using the cleo measurement @xmath89  @xcite   we can use the factorization hypothesis , isgw ii , and the qcd factor @xmath90  @xcite  to predict the branching fractions @xmath91  and @xmath92   respectively  @xcite . \n uncertainties in the formfactor and factorization hypothesis are not reflected in the errors quoted here . \n furthermore , contributions from anything other than the diagram are neglected in this kind of comparison . keeping this in mind , \n we conclude that the central value from the fit to the experimental data as shown in table  [ tab : results ] compares well with these predictions . \n we do not see any evidence for @xmath93  or @xmath94 . \n the dominant contributions to these decays are due to ( @xmath95 ) , and  respectively . \n the penguin diagrams in both cases are @xmath19  penguins . \n theoretical predictions for these modes range from less than @xmath96  to few times @xmath25@xcite . \n finally , we see no evidence for @xmath97 . \n this is not surprising as this decay can only proceed via  or  diagrams . \n theoretical predictions for this process are at the level of at most a few times @xmath98@xcite . \n we can therefore conclude that an overall consistent picture of charmless hadronic @xmath5  decays to two pseudoscalar mesons is starting to emerge . \n cleo has measured the dominant @xmath99  transitions at levels consistent with theoretical predictions . \n no signals are found in any of the decay modes that are expected to be suppressed . \n many thanks to all the other people involved in the search for @xmath5  decays to two charmless pseudoscalar mesons at cleo : peter gaidarev , jim alexander , peter kim , andrei gritsan , jean roy , and jim smith . \n further thanks go to lawrence gibbons for information concerning the factorization test , and to robert fleischer , karl berkelman and jim smith for many useful discussions . \n 99 m. gronau , o.f . \n hernndez , d. london , and j.l . \n rosner , ; m. gronau , o.f . \n hernndez , d. london , and j.l . \n y.kubota a.deandrea _ et al . \n _ , , ; l .- l.chau , , n.g.deshpande and j.trampetic ; m.bauer , b.stech , m.wirbel , . \n d. zeppenfeld , ; m.j.savage , m.b.wise , , erratum : ; m.gronau and d.london , ; m. gronau , o.f . \n hernndez , d. london , and j.l . \n rosner , ; r.fleischer , _ \n int.j.mod.phys._*a12 * , 2459 ( 1997 ) . \n f.wrthwein , ph.d . , cornell jan . \n 1995 ; p.gaidarev , ph.d . , cornell 1997 . \n dighe , m. gronau , and j.l . \n rosner , ; erratum : * b377 * 325 ( 1996 ) . \n f.j . gilman , r. kaufman , ; * 37 * 3348(e ) ( 1988 ) . \n i.halperin , a.zhitnitsky , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 2460, "GeneratedTokens": 96, "SynthesizedBody": "nanoparticles ( nps ) with sizes from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers are artificial materials which exhibit extraordinary optical and electrical properties due to its ultra - small sizes and in particular to quantum confined nature of their energy levels .    the extraordinary properties of size - tunable nps has given rise to their wide spread applications in nanophotonics , plasmonics , biomedicine , lasing , photovoltaic etc @xcite . \n semiconductor nps or quantum dots ( qds ) are found a number of applications in the biomedical imaging due to the size- dependent flexibility of its luminescent properties . \n the nps with the sizes 2 - 10 nm , which is about of the size of small biomolecules , have the great potential for various applications in the modern biomedicine . in difference from organic biological labels , \n the luminescent qds have several advantages . \n at first they have a wide absorption band and can be used with a variety of laser sources having different output wavelengths . on the other side , \n the luminescence band of qds can be tuned from uv to ir by changing their sizes and this property allows combining several types of qds at the one excitation wavelength . \n it is also important to notice that qds are more photostable under the long time of laser irradiation . \n the existence of the mentioned properties of qds could dramatically improve the use of fluorescent markers in the biological imaging .    during the last decade \n various methods have been investigated for the synthesis of nps . recently , a simple and flexible method of the pulsed laser ablation in liquid media ( plal ) has been demonstrated for the laser synthesis of metal nanoparticles @xcite . \n this method also has been applied for synthesis of colloidal solutions of semiconductor qds 7,8,9 . \n laser ablation in liquids media is especially good - looking for biomedical applications , since nps could be formed directly in specially prepared bio - conjugated media and such nps colloidal solution can be exactly tuned for the specific biological target \n .    the formation of semiconductor nanoparticles via plal has been investigated in different experimental conditions , and photoluminescence properties of nanoparticles produced by the plal have been found to be strongly dependent as on the physical and chemical properties of liquid environment , as well as on the parameters of the laser irradiation . \n laser ablation syntheses of nanoparticles could be explained in terms of the dynamic formation mechanism of the particle growth @xcite . according this mechanism , a material of target evaporated in the laser plume very quickly aggregate into small embryonic particles , \n therefore such laser pulse parameters as pulse energy and duration could be highly critical in this process . in the paper \n @xcite the influence of a laser beam transverse electromagnetic mode structure on the luminescence properties of laser synthesized gaas nanoparticles has been studied . in the present work we studied luminescence properties of the si \n ni hybrid colloidal nanoparticles system fabricated in pure water by the laser ablation method using a nanosecond nd : yag laser . \n the pulsed passive q - switched nd : yag laser with wavelength of 1064 nm , pulse duration of 8ns and repetition rate of 10hz was used to synthesize nanoparticles in pure water . \n the laser beam was focused on the surface of a bulk target ( the plate of bulk si or ni ) allocated in the glass cuvette with distilled water ( see figure ( 1 ) ) . \n exposition of the laser irradiation was two hours . to produce hybrid metal - semiconductor system , \n at first we irradiated a ni bulk target , then in the same cuvette with water solution of ni nanoparticles was located the si bulk target to produce si nanoparticles . \n hybrid nanoparticles system was produced also in similar scheme when ni and si nanoparticles were produced separately in different cuvettes and after that mixed in one solution . \n note that luminescence spectra of the obtained hybrid nanoparticles were the same in these two experimental approaches . \n note also that a luminescence of separately prepared si nanoparticles was not observed . \n [ fig1 ]    for luminescence measurements the water solution of nanoparticles was relocated into quartz cuvette with the transparent walls in the uv spectral range . \n the luminescence of the colloidal qds was excited by the irradiation at 400 nm wavelength of the continuous wave diode laser with the power of 10mw . \n the luminescence spectra were analyzed by spectrometer constructed on the base of monochromator lomo mdr- 23-pmt . \n electrical signal amplifier was used to enhance output of the pmt . \n luminescence spectrum of colloidal si - ni qds is presented in the figure ( 2 ) . \n [ fig2 ]    the considerable blue shift of the photoluminescence has been registered with the location of the maximum at the wavelength of 455 nm which is connected with the size - effect and significant difference from the well known luminescence of a bulk si material located in the near infrared region . \n the peak on the 400 nm is the excitation laser wavelength . \n the bandwidth of the luminescence spectra on the halfheight was about 40 nm that demonstrates the narrow size distribution of laser generated qds , which is achieved without application of any size selection schemes . \n [ fig3 ]    possible contributions to the luminescence from a quartz material of the cuvette and water has been eliminated by a comparison with the photoluminescence from the same cuvette filled with the clean water or with the solution of coumarin 120 organic dye ( see figure ( 3 ) ) . \n the long - term stability of the luminescence properties of the produced qds was observed during the one year . \n here we give some interpretation of the results of our experiment by estimations based on the known properties of silicon nanoparticles and quantum confinement effect , as well as the effect of the charged nickel nanoparticles on luminescence spectra of the colloidal si quantum dots . \n as is known @xcite , metalic nanoparticles generated in diverse media by the method of a laser ablation carry a positive or negative electrical charge . in our case , \n the charged ni nanoparticles within the si \n ni hybrid system induce a static electrical field which causes stark shift of the electron - hole energy levels in the silicon qd . in the following , \n we consider a point charge at a certain distance from the surface of the silicon qd ( see figure ( 4 ) ) . \n the assessment of the si nanoparticles luminescence spectrum shifting under the influence of a static electric field of an external charge allows us to explain experimental results by the stark effect in the inhomogeneous ( coulomb ) field . \n the external point charge @xmath0 on the distance @xmath1  from the center of the silicon quantum dot creates a screened electrostatic field at the point @xmath2 inside the qd , potential of which can be given in the following form @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the legendre polynomial , \n @xmath5 -screening dielectric constant of si qds , @xmath6 -angle between the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the shift of the energy levels of an exciton caused by an external electrostatic field can be evaluated using the wavefunction @xmath9 of the electron - hole system :    @xmath10 \\left\\vert \\psi_{0}\\left ( \\mathbf{r}_{e},\\mathbf{r}_{h}\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}. \\label{2}\\ ] ]    taking into account the form of the potential of the external field ( [ 1 ] ) , the energy shift ( [ 2 ] ) can be represented in the form of the sum    @xmath11    where    @xmath12@xmath13    the first term in the sum ( [ 3 ] ) : @xmath14 . \n we will estimate only the term corresponding to @xmath15 taking into account the smallness of the other terms . \n thus ,    @xmath16    which can be written in the following form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the size of an exciton , @xmath19 are the mean values of the charge distribution density of the hole and the electron , respectively . to calculate the energy spectral shifting in accordance with the conditions of the above described experiment , \n let us estimate @xmath20 .    as is shown in @xcite , the emitted photon energy depends on silicone nanocrystallite size . with the decreasing of the size of nanoparticles the quantum confinement affects on the band gap of the exciton thereby increasing emission energy . \n during the experiment with the solely silicon nanoparticles the luminescence had not been observed in the visible spectrum at the irradiation by the wavelength of 400 nm . \n this fact evidences that bandgap energy of the si qds is more than 3 ev , which is agreed with the results of the work @xcite . \n according to the work @xcite , such energies corresponds to silicon nanoparticles with diameter less than 1.4 nm . to determine the other parameters we will take for screening dielectric constant @xmath21 , which corresponds to the diameter @xmath22 nm of si quantum dots at the passivation with the hydrogen atoms , according to the paper @xcite . \n as we consider si nanoparticles generated in a liquid medium ( pure water in our case ) , dangling bonds of the silicon atoms on the dot surface should be saturated mostly by the hydrogen atoms . \n note that in the process of the laser ablation hydrogen molecules are produced due to water molecules dissociation in the surroundings of the laser plume . as is shown in the work @xcite , \n in the case of the hydrogen passivated si nanoparticles the size of the exciton is approximately equal to the diameter of the qd . \n [ fig4 ]    since we consider the nickel nanoparticles in close proximity from the silicone qds , then @xmath23 , and coulomb potential is strong enough to pull the hole away from the electron . in this case \n , the quantity @xmath24 can reach as large as @xmath25 @xcite . \n then , we have @xmath26 ev . \n this shift of bandgap energy corresponds to a red shift of si quantum dot luminescence spectrum by about @xmath27 nm ( it is clear that depending on the distance of the point charge from the surface of silicon qd this shift will be changed ) . \n this shift can explain the observation of blue luminescense in the case of hybrid si - ni nanoparticles system in opposite to the case of the solely si nanoparticles in the colloidal solution . \n summarizing , by the luminescense picture of the mixed metallic - semiconductor nanoparticles in the colloidal solution one can define the sizes of quantum dots . \n the si colloidal qds in liquids can be used in a number of optical applications , in particular , as luminescent markers in the biomedical imaging in vivo and in vitro . \n the knowledge of peculiarities of their luminescent properties is very important for such kinds of biomedical applications . \n more complex assemblies of nanocrystals can be easily constructed by the presented technique of laser synthesis of colloidal qds including complexes of nanoparticles of different materials . \n these complex artificial structures will exhibit new physical and chemical properties that require further investigation and could be applied in the optical nanotechnologies . \n the results of this study may have far -

{"ContextTokens": 3696, "GeneratedTokens": 374, "SynthesizedBody": "the bulk of the x  ray emission in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is produced via comptonization of uv photons in the inner parts of the accretion flow close to the central supermassive black hole . \n the resulting power law spectrum is modified by a number absorption and emission spectral features due to the reprocessing of this primary continuum ( mushotzky , done & pounds 1993 ) . \n they are clear signatures of the presence of large amounts of gas characterized by different physical properties in the circumnuclear region . \n one of the most common spectral features is the so  called _ warm _ ( i.e. partially ionized ) _ absorber _ ( halpern 1984 ; pan et al . 1990 , \n turner et al . 1993 ) . \n such a component has been found to contribute significantly to the opacity of the x  ray primary emission in @xmath1 50% of the seyfert 1 galaxies with column densities up to  10@xmath2 2 ( reynolds 1997 ) . in particular , \n ovii ( 0.739 kev ) and oviii ( 0.871 kev ) absorption edges resulted to be the most prominent absorption signatures of the ionized gas in low \n _ asca _ observations . \n the advent of grating spectrometers on  board  and  has dramatically enriched our knowledge in this field . high \n resolution soft x \n ray spectra of bright type 1 agns present a wealth of absorption lines ( e.g. collinge et al . \n 2001 ; kaspi et al . \n 2001 ; kaastra et al . \n 2002 ) , which allow to infer a few remarkable conclusions : ( @xmath7 ) warm absorbers usually show a very complex structure , with multiple regions characterized by different ionization states , column densities and velocities ; ( @xmath8 ) the strongest features are due to he and h  like states of o , ne , mg and si ; in addition a blend of m  shell iron inner shell transition ( unresolved transition array or uta ) has been often detected in the range @xmath1 0.700.80 kev ; ( @xmath9 ) the observed blueshift of the absorption lines imply they are originated in an outflow with mean velocities in the range @xmath1 1002500 km / s . \n however , two important issues regarding the warm absorbers still remain open , i.e. : the exact location of the absorbing medium and the physical connection between the absorbing materials in the uv and x  ray band . a likely range of distances of the ionized absorbing medium from the central source is @xmath10 @xmath1 0.0110 pc ( krolik 2002 ; behar et al . 2003 ) . \n by correlating _ \n hst _ and _ asca _ data crenshaw et al . \n ( 1999 ) found that all seyfert galaxies with evidence of uv absorption also exhibit x  ray ionized absorption features . \n furthermore , some sources in which uv and x  ray absorbing components share the same outflow velocity space have been observed ( blustin et al . 2003 ; collinge et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al . 2002 ) . \n however , no clearcut identification of an x  ray warm absorber with an uv counterpart has been reported yet ( see crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 for a review ) .    unfortunately , the sensitivity of current grating spectrometers allows us to analyze just a handful of very bright x  ray sources . \n therefore ccd cameras spectroscopy still represents the best available tool to deduce information about the physical properties of the gas in the immediate surroundings of the central x  ray emitting region for most agns ( i.e. those with a  1 mcrab 2 @xmath11 10@xmath12 . ] ) . \n we present here the analysis of an  observation of markarian 304 (  @xmath1 0.1 mcrab ) . + markarian 304 ( mkn  304 , pg2214@xmath13139 ) is a seyfert galaxy at @xmath0 = 0.066 . due to the presence of broad emission lines in its optical spectrum , \n mkn  304 has been classified as a type 1 object ( osterbrock 1977 ) . \n @xmath14 spectroscopy of this source revealed the presence of strong bump in the uv ( clavel & joly 1984 ) , without absorption lines . on the contrary , a recent @xmath15 observation of mkn  304 ( kriss 2002 ) disclosed broad absorbing features ( with a velocity spread of 1500 km / s ) due to multiple ovi absorption components blended together . \n mkn  304 was discovered as x  ray emitting source by _ uhuru _ ( tananbaum et al . \n later x  ray observations of this source were performed by _ einstein _ \n ( kriss , canizares & ricker 1980 ) and _ rosat _ ( rachen et al . \n 1996 ) : both reported evidences of heavy obscuration , with a very flat slope ( @xmath16 0.07 ) in the soft x  ray band . \n surprisingly , mkn  304 was not targeted by _ \n asca _ and _ bepposax _ and , therefore , no further study of its unusual flat continuum was performed .    throughout this paper \n we assume a flat _ @xmath17cdm _ cosmology with ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) = ( 0.3,0.7 ) and a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 ( bennett et al . 2003 ) . \n mkn  304 was observed by the european photon imaging camera ( _ epic _ ) on board the  space observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) between 2002 may 12 15:46:29 ( ut ) and 2002 may 13 00:56:34 ( ut ) . the observation was performed with the  camera ( struder et al . \n 2001 ) operating in full window extended mode and with the  cameras ( turner et al . 2001 ) operating in full window mode . \n all the three  cameras were equipped with the `` thin '' blocking optical filters . \n the data files were reduced and analyzed using the standard science analysis system ( @xmath21 ) v.5.4.1 . \n we used the epchain and emchain tasks for processing of the raw  and  data files , respectively , in order to generate the relative linearized event files . \n x  ray events corresponding to patterns 012 ( i.e. single , double , triple , and quadruple  pixel events ) for the  cameras were selected ; for the , patterns 04 events ( i.e. single and double  pixel events ) were used . \n the subsequent event selection was carried out taking into account the most updated calibration files at the time the reduction was performed ( september 2003 ) . \n all known flickering and bad pixels were removed . \n the event lists were furthermore filtered to ignore periods of high background flaring ( see appendix a ) . \n after this screening process ( and taking into account satellite dead times ) the effective net exposure times for the _ mos1 _ , _ \n mos2 _ and  detectors are 33.4 , 35.5 and 29 ks , respectively . \n no exposure is affected by pile  up . \n the peak of the x  ray emission is located at @xmath22 = 22@xmath2317@xmath2412.1@xmath25 and @xmath26 = @xmath1314@xmath2714@xmath2821.7@xmath29 , i.e. at a distance of 1.5 arcsecs from the coordinates of the optical nucleus of mkn  304 ( clements 1981 ) . \n this is consistent with typical attitude reconstruction uncertainties . \n since the cleaned _ rgs _ data did not yield enough photons for a meaningful spectral analysis , they are not discussed in the following . \n the source spectra were extracted from the final filtered event lists using a circular region of 24 and 21.5 arcsecs radius for  and , respectively , centered on the observed position of mkn  304 . \n backgrounds were estimated from source  free similar regions close to the source on the same ccd . \n response matrices and ancillary response files were generated using the rmfgen and arfgen tools in the @xmath21 software . since difference between the _ mos1 _ and _ mos2 \n _ response matrices are a few percent , we created a combined  spectrum and response matrix . \n the  and  spectra were then fitted simultaneously . \n both spectra were grouped to give a minimum of 40 counts per bin in order to apply @xmath30 statistics . given the current calibration uncertainties and the detector sensitivities , events outside the 0.312 kev range were ignored in the  spectrum , while , for the , we retained the 0.610 kev band . \n spectral analysis was performed using xspec v.11.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) . \n all the models presented in this section and in the following one include absorption due to the line  of  sight galactic column of  = 4.96 @xmath11 10@xmath31 2  ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) . \n the photoelectric absorption cross sections were taken from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) . \n the quoted errors refer to the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. @xmath32 = 2.71 ; avni 1976 ) . \n we first fitted the  spectra with a power law model in the 212 kev band . \n this simple model yielded a very poor fit (= 469(256 ) ) and an extremely flat photon index of @xmath5 0.95 . indeed the convex shape of the data  to  model residuals suggests the presence of heavy obscuration . \n [ fig : ext2soft ] displays the results of this fit extrapolated over the 0.312 kev bandpass . \n the large deficit in the 0.52 kev band clearly indicates the presence of a strong absorption , while the systematic positive residuals at  0.6 kev may reveal an emission component in excess of the underlying absorbed continuum . \n fitting the data over the 0.312 kev band with a power law yielded a  = 2483(367 ) ( see model a in table  [ tab : results ] ) . \n we thus accounted for this ionized absorber component with the multiplicative * absori * model in xspec ( done et al . 1992 ) . in this model \n the state of the warm absorber is a function of the ionization parameter @xmath33 defined as @xmath33 = @xmath34/@xmath35@xmath36 , where @xmath34 is the isotropic luminosity of the ionizing source in the interval 5 ev to 300 kev , @xmath35 is the number density of the warm plasma and @xmath10 is the distance between this latter and the central source . in the fit solar elemental abundances were assumed and @xmath33 was left as a free parameter . on the contrary , we fixed the temperature of the absorber to t = 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath37 k since the statistics did not allow to simultaneously and effectively constrain @xmath38 and @xmath33 . \n such a value of @xmath38 falls in the typical range observed for a warm absorber ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ; krolik 2002 and reference therein ) . \n we also performed a further set of fits assuming values of temperature in the range 5 @xmath11 10@xmath39 10@xmath40 k , from which turned out that the ionization parameter remains almost constant ( i.e. @xmath3 90100 ) to the variations of temperature . \n this fit ( indicated as model b in table  [ tab : results ] ) resulted in a dramatic statistical improvement i.e. at @xmath41 99.99% confidence level according to an @xmath42test once compared to model a , with a  = 617(365 ) . \n nevertheless , the value of @xmath43/@xmath44 @xmath1 1.7 remains unacceptable and a large absorption feature is evident in the soft portion of the spectrum ( see fig . \n the breadth and depth of this feature suggest the existence of another ionized absorption component with a different value of @xmath33 . \n furthermore the derived slope @xmath45 = 1.40@xmath460.04 is significantly flatter than usually observed in unabsorbed seyfert galaxies ( malizia et al . \n 2003 ) and quasars ( piconcelli et al . \n 2003 ) , i.e. @xmath47 @xmath1 1.9 . \n we then added another * absori * component in the spectral model . \n first we fitted the spectrum fixing the temperature of this new component to the same value of the previous one , i.e. t = 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath37 k. the fit gave a minimum  = 477(363 ) , with a statistical improvement significant at @xmath41 99.99 confidence level . \n however , an even better @xmath43 value ( @xmath43 = 441 ) was obtained fixing the temperature of the second ionized component to a lower value , in particular with t = 3 @xmath11 10@xmath48 k. the resulting spectral parameters of this fit ( model c ) are also listed in table  [ tab : results ] . \n the @xmath43 value was reduced by @xmath32 = 176 respect to model b , thus the addition of the low - temperature ionized absorption term is significant at a level larger then 99.99% confidence level ( @xmath42test value = 72 ) . \n however the reported value of @xmath43/@xmath44 = 1.22 ( null hypothesis probability 0.003 ) is not yet very satisfactory and positive systematic residuals are still present in the data  to  model ratio below 1 kev .         in the reduction of the mkn  304 data , \n we thus apply the following alternative procedure ( `` maxsnr '' hereafter ) to reject the high background level periods . \n the underlying idea basically consists of filtering out just those time intervals for which the count rate of the background reach values so high that the snr of the source does not significantly improve ( or even worses ) by including such time intervals in the analysis . to this aim , \n lightcurves of the source and background region , i.e. a proper annulus around the source large enough to provide a good estimation of the background ( with a 120 arcsec radius in the case of mkn  304 ) , are extracted in the energy band for which the snr should to be maximized . in the analysis of mkn  304 data , we have taken into account the 0.51.3  kev ( 0.61.3 kev ) band for ( ) in order to optimize the snr in the band where most of the prominent warm absorber features are located . \n lightcurve datapoints for the source and background are sorted for increasing values of the cr of the background region . the cumulative signal  to  noise ( snr@xmath50 ) distribution function is then calculated .    the snr@xmath50 as a function of the increasing background cr builds a curve which monothonically rises up to a peak . after this maximum value , \n the snr@xmath50 distribution indeed flattens or even decreases . \n this value is the threshold used to reject the high background periods . \n in fact , if included , these periods would not provide any significant improvements to the final snr of the spectrum of the source , but it would increase the background contribution to the raw source spectrum . \n this method to filter out high background periods optimizes the duration of the observation useful for a meaningful scientific analysis on the basis of the ratio between the count rates of source and background . \n it appears particularly appealing in the case of bright source for which an even `` flaring '' background can represent just a negligible fraction of their cr . \n it also has the advantage that the filtering is performed in a particular energy band ( chosen _ a priori _ ) where the snr need be maximized for the accurate study of peculiar spectral features . \n table  [ tab:2 ] lists the final values of exposure , total counts in the 0.312 kev band , countrate and snr for the @xmath51 camera obtained using the `` maxsnr '' method compared to those derived from the application of the `` standard '' method . \n in particular , the method presented here yields a number of counts which is about 5.5 times larger than that resulted from the `` standard '' method . \n [ fig : snr ] shows the comparison between the spectra obtained using the two filtering procedures : the higher quality of the  spectrum provided by the `` maxsnr '' method is clearly evident .", "StartTimeOffset": 1877040719880, "RequestID": "8ccf39b02ad07116d37a55f60b4aa7a62ae73b23",

{"ContextTokens": 3763, "GeneratedTokens": 276, "SynthesizedBody": "intracluster stars , stars between the galaxies in a galaxy cluster , are an excellent probe of galaxy and galaxy cluster evolution . \n they preserve a record of a galaxy cluster s dynamical history , and are a sensitive measure of the poorly understood processes of galactic mergers , cluster accretion , and tidal - stripping that occur in galaxy clusters ( cf . \n dressler 1984 ) . \n the original concept of intracluster stars was first proposed over fifty years ago ( zwicky 1951 ) , but actually observing intracluster starlight has been extremely difficult . typically , the surface brightness of intracluster starlight is less than 1% that of the brightness of the sky background , and measurements of this luminosity must contend with the problems presented by scattered light from bright objects and the contribution of discrete sources below the detection limit . \n these difficulties have made research into intracluster starlight slow and uncertain , though solid detections have been made ( for reviews , see vlchez - gmez 1999 ; feldmeier 2000 ) .    an alternative way to study \n intracluster light is to search for it in nearby galaxy clusters . here , it is possible to search for luminous individual intracluster stars , and gain more detailed information on the distribution , metallicity and velocities of intracluster stars than is possible from surface brightness measurements . planetary nebulae ( pn ) are one such tracer of the intracluster starlight . \n the history of intracluster planetary nebulae ( ipn ) research begins a decade ago with the first pn survey of the virgo cluster ( jacoby , ciardullo , & ford 1990 ; hereafter jcf ) . in this survey of elliptical galaxies , \n jcf found 11 pn that were much brighter than the expected [ o  iii ] @xmath4 5007 planetary nebulae luminosity function ( pnlf ) cut - off magnitude . \n jcf attempted to explain these `` overluminous '' pn with a number of hypotheses , but none was entirely satisfactory . \n the next step involved spectroscopic follow - up of objects from the jcf survey . during a radial velocity survey of pn in the virgo elliptical galaxy m  86 , arnaboldi ( 1996 ) found that 16 of the 19 detected pn velocities were consistent with the galaxy s mean velocity ( v@xmath5 = -227 ) . \n the other three planetaries had mean velocities of @xmath6 , more consistent with the virgo cluster s mean velocity . \n arnaboldi ( 1996 ) argued convincingly that these objects were intracluster planetary nebulae , and it is here that the term first enters the literature . almost simultaneously , the first search for ipn candidates in the fornax cluster was published ( theuns & warren 1997 ) , and more detections of ipn candidates in virgo quickly followed ( mndez 1997 ; ciardullo 1998 ; feldmeier , ciardullo , & jacoby 1998 ) . \n additionally , ferguson , tanvir and von hippel ( 1998 ) detected intracluster red giant stars ( irgs ) in the virgo cluster using _ \n hst_. this provided independent confirmation of the ipn results , and allowed for a potential comparison between the two detection methods .    with the help of large ccd mosaics \n , samples of hundreds of ipn have now been gathered in the virgo and fornax clusters ( fig 1 . \n , feldmeier 2000 ; arnaboldi 2002 ) . \n ipn candidates are easily identified as stellar sources that appear in a deep [ o  iii ] @xmath4 5007 image , but completely disappear in an image through a filter that does not contain the [ o  iii ] line . \n originally , searching for such objects was done manually , but now is done through automated methods ( feldmeier 2000 ; arnaboldi 2002 ) \n ipn are a useful tracer of intracluster stars for a number of reasons . \n first , since pn are a normal end - phase of stellar evolution , the distribution of pn in a stellar population should closely follow the spatial distribution of normal stars . \n second , because a large portion ( @xmath7 ) of the total light of a bright pn is emitted in a single emission line at 5007  , radial velocities of the ipn can be obtained , and dynamical information gained . \n the utility of planetary nebulae as dynamical probes will be covered by others ( see arnaboldi , freeman , mathieu , this conference ) , but it s important to stress that the only way to obtain dynamical information about intracluster starlight is through ipn observations . finally , since pn follow a well - determined luminosity function , it is possible to obtain some information on the three - dimensional structure of intracluster stars .    for the remainder of this paper , we will focus on obtaining the amount of intracluster luminosity using the ipn as a tracer . \n this aspect directly compares to models of intracluster starlight , and is the area where the greatest progress has been made thus far . \n in principle , determining the amount of intracluster luminosity from the observed numbers of ipn is straightforward . \n theories of simple stellar populations ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) has shown that the bolometric luminosity - specific stellar evolutionary flux of non - star - forming stellar populations should be @xmath8  stars - yr@xmath9-@xmath10 , nearly independent of population age or initial mass function . if the lifetime of the planetary nebula stage is @xmath11  yr , then every stellar system should have @xmath12  pn-@xmath10 . \n if we also assume that the [ o  iii ] @xmath4 5007 pnlf follows the well studied form : @xmath13 $ ] ( ciardullo 1989 ) , we can determine the total expected number of ipn in a region , and therefore , the luminosity , from observations . due to observational constraints , we calibrate our ipn observations using the quantity @xmath14 , the number of pn up to 2.5 magnitudes below the luminosity function cutoff , per stellar bolometric luminosity . \n the @xmath14 parameter is approximately one - tenth of @xmath1 , or @xmath15 \n pn-@xmath10    in practice , the process is more complicated . \n there are several effects that must be accounted for before the best estimate of intracluster luminosity can be obtained . \n fortunately , each of these effects also gives us an opportunity to learn more about the properties of the underlying intracluster stellar population . \n we now discuss each of these effects . \n in a distant galaxy , theory and observations show that pn follow a well - defined [ o  iii ] luminosity function ( ciardullo , this conference ) . \n however , in the galaxy cluster environment ipn are not found at the same distance : they are spread out substantially along our line - of - sight . \n this distorts the observed luminosity function and introduces a significant uncertainty in the derived amount of intracluster luminosity . from modeling ( feldmeier , ciardullo , & jacoby 1998 ) \n , we have found that the amount of intracluster luminosity found for a particular region can vary by a factor of three between a model where all ipn lie at the same distance , and a model where they are distributed uniformly in a spherical configuration . \n therefore , to determine the true amount of intracluster starlight , we must also learn the line - of - sight density of the ipn . \n fortunately , the line - of - sight density of ipn is of considerable scientific interest . \n figure 2 shows the distance to each ipn observed field in virgo compared to that found from the galaxies , assuming that the brightest ipn candidate in each field is near the pnlf cutoff magnitude , m@xmath16 = -4.48 . \n the most obvious feature of the ipn upper limit distances is that there is a noticeable systematic offset in distances between ipn fields in subclumps a & b in virgo . \n this is most likely due to the structure of the virgo cluster . \n observations by yasuda , fukugita , & okamura ( 1997 ) and others find that the galaxies of subclump  b have a mean distance modulus @xmath17  mag more distant than those of subclump a , in agreement with the upper limit distances shown here . \n the next most obvious feature is the relatively small distance to all of the fields in subclump  a. the median distance of these fields is approximately 12 mpc , much smaller than the mean distance to virgo found through pnlf observations of ellipticals and _ hst _ observations of cepheids . \n the reason for this discrepancy is that all virgo ipn surveys have a selection effect : objects on the near side of the cluster are much more likely to be found than those on the far side . \n therefore , the 12 mpc distance is representative of the front edge of the cluster , and not of the cluster core . \n this result naturally explains the `` overluminous '' pn found by jcf . \n these pn were not overluminous at all , but instead were significantly closer than the other pn . \n when we compare the cluster depth found to the angular size of virgo , we find that virgo is elongated along our line of sight , perhaps by a factor of two . this result has been found before ( yasuda , fukugita , & okamura 1997 ) , but to independently confirm it through the ipn data is encouraging . \n although theory predicts a constant rate between the number of planetaries and bolometric stellar luminosity , observations tell a different story . ciardullo ( 1995 ) found that in a sample of elliptical galaxies the observed @xmath14 rate never exceeded @xmath18  pn-@xmath10 but was often less , up to an order of magnitude , with higher luminosity galaxies having smaller values of @xmath14 . \n why this occurs is not entirely clear : it is believed that as a stellar population ages or becomes metal - rich , not all stars undergo the pn phase ( ciardullo , jacoby & feldmeier 1994 ) since the total amount of intracluster luminosity found is inversely proportional to @xmath14 , a large systematic error in the luminosity can be introduced if this effect is not accounted for .    to correct for this effect \n , we have made additional irg observations of virgo s core using _ hst _ ( durrell 2002 ) . \n the numbers of red giant stars are another determinant of the total luminosity of a stellar population , and therefore we can directly measure @xmath14 from the virgo cluster environment . by comparing the numbers of ipn in a field surrounding the _ hst _  field , we find a preliminary value of @xmath19  pn-@xmath10 ( durrell 2002 ) . \n this value has an additional systematic uncertainty : there is evidence for a non - random spatial distribution in the ipn ( feldmeier 2000 ) , and the angular sizes of the _ hst _ field and the ipn field differ greatly . \n however , the value for @xmath14 strongly implies that the bulk of the ipn came from lower - luminosity galaxies , and not giant ellipticals ( m@xmath20 ; ciardullo 1995 ) . \n this is consistent with the `` galaxy harassment '' models of moore ( 1996 ) , who predicted that most intracluster light would originate from lower luminosity galaxies . \n finally , not all ipn candidates that are detected photometrically are bona - fide ipn . \n although spectroscopic follow - up observations clearly shows that many ipn candidates are genuine , there are also a significant number of contaminating sources ( kudritzki 2000 ; freeman 2000 ) . \n these contaminants must be removed before we can derive a luminosity for the intracluster stars . \n ultimately , the only definitive way to separate the two classes of objects is to perform follow - up spectroscopy : true ipn must also have the other emission lines found for planetary nebulae , the brightest being the [ o  iii ] @xmath4 4959 line and the balmer lines . \n so far , only a small fraction ( @xmath21 ) of the hundreds of ipn candidates have any follow - up spectroscopy at all , and of those , only a handful have enough signal - to - noise to see multiple emission lines in a single spectrum . \n however , we can statistically account for the contribution of the contaminants to ipn surveys by using control field techniques . from a survey of 0.13 square degrees of blank regions \n far away from any galaxy cluster , and using identical procedures as our ipn surveys , we have found a total of nine ipn - like objects down to a limiting 5007 magnitude of 27.0 ( ciardullo 2002 ) . \n when we compare this density to the density of our virgo and fornax surveys , we find a contamination rate of @xmath2 20% for virgo and @xmath2 50% for fornax . \n the difference in contamination rate is primarily due to distance : fornax is more distant than virgo , and hence further down the contaminating source luminosity function . \n what are the contaminating objects ? in order for an object to masquerade as an ipn , it must have a very high observed equivalent width ( @xmath0  ) , because we require ipn candidates to be completely absent in our off - band exposures . from the equivalent widths , and spectroscopy ( kudritzki 2000 ) , the most likely source for the majority of the ipn contamination are lyman-@xmath1 galaxies at redshifts near 3.1 , where the lyman-@xmath1 @xmath4 1215 line is doppler - shifted into our [ o  iii ] filter . \n other possibilities include type ii quasars at high redshift ( norman 2002 ) , and very rare high equivalent width [ o  ii ] emitters at @xmath22 ( stern 2000 ) . \n these contaminants are also now being found in normal pn galaxy surveys ( m ' endez 2001 ) . \n after correcting for the three effects above , we can now derive the fraction of intracluster luminosity found from the ipn . \n after averaging the results from all of our fields , assuming a single distance for the ipn , a @xmath14 value of @xmath23  pn-@xmath10 , and contamination rates of 20% for virgo and 50% for fornax , we find that at least 20% of all stars lie between the galaxies of virgo and fornax . \n the above assumptions are all conservative , in order to minimize the amount of intracluster starlight necessary to explain the data . \n the fractional results from the irg observations are smaller than the ipn results ( 1020% ; ferguson , tanvir , & von hippel 1998 ; durrell 2002 ) , but are consistent within the errors . \n other intracluster light observations of more distant clusters ( bernstein 1995 ) find larger fractions for the amount of intracluster light , up to 50% . \n this could be due to systematic errors between the various methods , or due to differing galaxy cluster properties such as richness . \n more data will be needed to resolve this issue . \n for most of this paper , we have focused on what the properties of pn imply about intracluster starlight . \n what effects , if any , does the intracluster environment impose on the nebulae themselves ? \n one possibility is that due to the large velocities ( @xmath24 ) between the ipn and the intracluster medium , the expanding nebulae might fragment due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( soker , borkowksi , & sarazin 1991 ) \n . the nebulae would therefore be highly aspherical ( villaver , manchado , & garc ' ia - segura 2000 ) . \n unfortunately , it is unlikely that this effect could be observable . \n there may be additional effects on the ipn , due to the hot intracluster medium , but detailed nebular modeling of the ipn is sorely needed . \n in the near future , there will be large samples of ipn candidates in the nearby clusters of virgo , fornax , and ursa major , and completed surveys in the much poorer m81 and leo  i groups of galaxies . continued comparisons between ipn and irg data sets will be very useful . \n as we have already shown , ipn and irg observations strongly complement each other : ipn surveys can map out the distribution and kinematics of the intracluster stars , while _ hst _ irg measurements at specific locations in clusters can provide strong constraints on the age and metallicity of the intracluster stars . \n as the surveys continue , spectroscopic follow - up observations will become critical to obtain velocities of the ipn , and to separate them from the contaminating sources . with deep observations using 8-m class telescopes \n , we can obtain nebular abundances of the ipn , and compare them to pn of the milky way . \n i would like to thank the organizing committee for inviting me to give this presentation . \n this work has been done in collaboration with robin ciardullo , george jacoby , patrick durrell , kara krelove , and steinn sigurdsson . \n i would also like to thank magda arnaboldi , ken freeman , rolf kudritzki , & roberto mndez for their assistance and many useful discussions . \n travel support was given through the american astronomical society international travel grant .", "StartTimeOffset": 1887010721310, "RequestID": "ec785253547596b52027697476c43d4e7a784003", "TotalTokens": 4039}
{"ContextTokens": 3659, "GeneratedTokens": 115, "SynthesizedBody": "most stars in the universe are binaries . among them \n , symbiotic stars are interacting binaries in which an evolved giant transfers material to a hot and compact companion . in a typical configuration , a symbiotic binary contains an miii giant and a white dwarf accreting material lost in the cool giant wind . \n the wind is ionised by the hotter of the binary components giving rise to symbiotic nebula ( cf . \n mikoajewska 1997 ) .    based on the near - ir colours \n two distinct classes of symbiotic stars were defined ( allen 1983 ) : the s - type ( stellar ) with normal red giants , and the d - type ( dusty ) with mira primaries surrounded by a warm dust shell . the distinction between s and d types seems to be one of orbital separation : the binary must have enough space for the red giant , and yet allow it to transfer sufficient mass to its companion . \n in fact , all symbiotic systems with known orbital periods  of the order of a few years  belong to the s - type , while the orbital periods for d - type systems are generally not known probably because they are longer than periods covered by existing observations ( cf . \n belczyski et al . \n 2000 ) . \n symbiotic stars are thus interacting binaries with the longest orbital periods and the largest component separations , and their study is essential to understand the evolution and interactions of detached and semi - detached binary stars . \n they are also among the brightest ( intrinsically ) stars , which makes them excellent observational targets both in our galaxy as well as in nearby galaxies even for relatively small telescopes .    in the following , \n i will present results of optical and infrared monitoring of symbiotic stars as well as future prospects for such studies . \n the composition of a typical symbiotic binary , specifically the presence of an evolved giant and its accreting companion , places symbiotic stars among the most variable stars . \n they can fluctuate in several different ways , which can be revealed and studied by patient monitoring of their light curves and radial velocity changes . \n namely , binary motion can be manifested by eclipses of the hot component by the giant , modulation of the giant s light due to reflection effect ( with orbital period ) and due to tidal distortion ( with @xmath0 ) , as well as radial velocity changes . \n the cool giant can also show intrinsic variability , in particular , radial pulsations ( all d - type and some s - type systems ) and semi - regular variations ( s - type ) with timescales of order of months and years as well as long - term light variations due to variable obscuration by circumstellar dust ( most d - type systems ) , solar - type cycles , spots , etc . \n the effects of mass accretion onto the hot component also involve different variable phenomena . \n the hot component in the vast majority of symbiotic systems seems in fact to be a luminous ( @xmath1 ) and hot ( @xmath2 ) white dwarf powered by thermonuclear burning of the material accreted from its companion s wind . \n depending on the accretion rate , these systems can be either in a steady burning configuration or undergo a hydrogen shell flashes . \n in many cases such flashes can last for decades due to low mass of the white dwarf ( mikoajewska 1997 ) . \n in addition , the hot components in many systems show activity with timescales of a few years which can not be simply accounted for by the thermonuclear models . \n a possible and promising explanation involves fluctuations in mass transfer and/or accretion instabilities . \n below , i present examples of light curves for well - studied , though not yet completely understood , symbiotic binaries : rx pup , ci cyg and ch cyg , which are representative for the wealth of variable phenomena observed in these systems . \n rx pup is a symbiotic binary composed of a long - period mira variable pulsating with @xmath3 days , surrounded by a thick dust shell , and a hot @xmath4 , white dwarf companion \n . the binary separation could be as large as @xmath5 a.u . \n ( corresponding to @xmath6 yr ) as suggested by the permanent presence of a dust shell around the mira component ( mikoajewska et al . \n in particular , the mira is never stripped of its dust envelope , and even during relatively unobscured phases the star resembles the high - mass loss galactic miras with thick dust shells . in general , the binary component separations in d - type systems must be larger than the dust formation radius . assuming a typical dust formation radius of @xmath7 , and a mira radius @xmath8 ( e.g. haniff , scholz & tuthill 1995 ) , the minimum binary separation is @xmath9 , and the corresponding binary period is @xmath10yr , for _ any _ d - type system . \n recent analysis of multifrequency observations shows that most , if not all , photometric and spectroscopic activity of rx  pup in the uv , optical and radio range is due to activity of the hot component , while the mira variable and its circumstellar environment is responsible for practically all changes in the infrared range ( mikoajewska et al . 1999 , and fig . \n 1 ) . in particular , rx  pup underwent a nova - like eruption during the last three decades . the hot component contracted in radius at nearly constant luminosity from 1975 to 1986 , and was the source of strong stellar wind , which prevented it from accreting material lost in the mira wind . around 1988/9 , \n the hot component turned over the hr diagram and by 1991 its luminosity had faded by a factor of @xmath11 with respect the maximum plateau value ( see the very deep minimum in the visual light curve in fig.1 ) and the hot wind had practically ceased . by 1995 \n the nova remnant started to accrete material from the wind , as indicated by a general increase of the optical flux . \n the earliest observational records from the 1890s suggest that another nova - like eruption of rx  pup occurred around 1894 . \n the near - ir light curves show significant long - term variations in addition to the mira pulsation ( fig . \n 1 ) . the long - term changes are best visible in the @xmath12 light curve after removal of the mira pulsation ( middle panel in fig . \n 1 ) . mikoajewska et al . \n ( 1999 ) have found large changes in the reddening towards the mira accompanied by fading of the near ir flux . however , the reddening towards the hot component and emission line regions remained practically constant and was generally less than that towards the mira . \n these changes do not seem related to the orbital configuration nor to the hot component activity . \n similar dust obscuration events seem to occur in many well covered symbiotic miras ( e.g. whitelock 1998 ) , as well as in single miras ( e.g. mattei 1997 , whitelock 1998 ) , and they are best explained as intrinsic changes in the circumstellar environment of the mira variable , possibly due to intensive and variable mass loss . the last increase in extinction towards the mira in rx pup has been accompanied by large changes in the degree of polarization in the optical and red spectral ranges . \n this confirms that these long - term variations are driven by changes in the properties of the dust grains , such as variable quantity of dust and variable particle size distribution , due to dust grain formation and growth ( mikoajewska 2001 ) . \n although most symbiotic binaries seem to interact by wind - driven mass loss , a few of them may contain a roche - lobe filling giant . \n they also show activity with time scales of order of years that can be related to the presence of accretion discs . among them , ci  cyg is one of the best studied . \n kenyon et al . \n ( 1991 ) demonstrated that it consists of an m5 ii asymptotic branch giant , @xmath13 , and a @xmath14 hot companion separated by 2.2 au . \n they also argued that the hot companion is a disc - accreting main sequence star . \n however , quiescent iue data from early 1990s can be also accounted by a hot and luminous stellar source powered by thermonuclear burning which makes the case for ci  cyg as an accreting ms star less clear . \n the outburst light curve of ci  cyg ( fig . \n 2 ) in addition to deep eclipses of the hot component by the red giant shows a @xmath15 oscillations with a period @xmath16 . \n some other s - type systems show similar secondary periodicities best visible in their outburst light curves , in all cases @xmath17 shorter than the orbital periods . \n the nature of this secondary periodicity is unknown . \n recently , galis et al . \n ( 1999 ) suggested that in the case of ag dra , it is due to radial pulsations of the giant , and the outbursts are driven by resonances between the pulsations and binary motion . on the other hand , the secondary periodicities are best visible in the optical light where the contribution from the giant , especially during the outburst , is very low or negligible . \n there is also a striking similarity between these variations and the superhumps of the su uma class of cvs which may indicate that they are rather related to the presence of accretion discs ( mikoajewska & kenyon 1992 ) .    during \n the outburst and its decline , eclipses in the @xmath18 continuum and optical h ii , hei and heii emission lines were narrow with well -

ir light curves also show long - term variations similar to the dust obscuration phenomena found in symbiotic miras ( cf . \n munari et al . \n 1996 ) . \n the hot component also shows very spectacular activity . \n in particular , we deal with irregular outbursts accompanied by fast , massive outflows and jets , rapid brightness variations with a time scale of the order of minutes , and other peculiarities which can not be explained in the frame of the classical models proposed for symbiotic stars . \n mikoajewski et al . ( \n 1990 ) proposed that this peculiar activity is powered by unstable accretion onto a magnetic white dwarf secondary . \n recently published catalogue of symbiotic stars includes 188 symbiotic stars as well as 30 objects suspected of being symbiotic ( belczyski et al . 2000 ) , among them , 173 are in our galaxy , 14 in magellanic clouds and 1 in draco-1 . \n they are excellent targets for small telescopes , especially for long - term monitoring of their complex photometric and spectroscopic variability . \n although we have @xmath26 s - type symbiotic systems with @xmath27 , photometric orbital periods have been measured for only 30 objects ( 18 of then are eclipsing ) . \n 21 systems have also known spectroscopic orbits and for 8 of them mass ratios have been also estimated . \n the ellipsoidal light variations , characteristic of tidally distorted stars , have been rarely observed . \n thus far , only four systems , t crb , ci cyg , bd@xmath28 , and possibly eg and , seem to show such changes \n . the general absence of the tidally distorted giant in symbiotic binaries may be however due to the lack of systematic searches for the ellipsoidal variations in the red and near - ir range , where the cool giants dominate the continuum light . \n on the other hand , tidal interactions are certainly important in symbiotic systems as suggested by practically circular orbits of most ( @xmath29 % ) systems with known orbital solutions , and specifically of all those showing the multiple ci  cyg - type outburst activity . \n we do not know the orbital period for any of the extragalactic symbiotic stars , although 8 of them belong to the s - type , and with @xmath30 mag , are bright enough for optical monitoring even with a relatively small telescope .    similarly , among 33 galactic d - type systems ( @xmath31 ) , pulsation periods have been observed  and thus the mira presence confirmed  for only 12 systems . \n pulsation periods are also unknown for the few extragalactic d - type systems ( @xmath32 ) . \n optical and near - ir monitoring of symbiotic stars is essential not only to understand variable phenomena in symbiotic stars and more generally long - period interacting binaries , but also to study such phenomena in several other astrophysical environments ( giant stars , planetary nebulae , novae , supernovae , supersoft x - ray sources , hot stars and even agns ) . \n studies of the symbiotic miras are important for understanding evolution and interaction of detached low - mass binaries . \n for example , there is ample observational evidence for systematic differences between the symbiotic miras and average single galactic miras . in particular , \n their average pulsation periods are longer , the colours redder and the mass - loss rates higher than typical periods , colours , and mass - loss rates for single miras ( cf . \n mikoajewska 1999 ) . \n it is interesting which and how these differences are related to the binary nature of symbiotic miras . \n the symbiotic mira are often associated with extended radio and/or optically resolved nebulae . \n these nebulae have usually very complex structure , often with bipolar lobes and jet - like features . \n there are also many important questions posed by the active s - type systems . \n what powers the multiple outburst activity in ci  cyg and other similar systems ? \n how many of these contain tidally distorted giants ? what is the nature of the secondary periodicity , @xmath33 , visible at outburst in some of them ? can the secondary periodicities be considered as an evidence for the presence of an accretion disc ? \n such periodicities have not been found in any symbiotic nova during both optical maximum and constant luminosity phase ( the plateau portion of white dwarf cooling tracks ) , including the best studied case  ag  peg ( kenyon et al . \n 1993 ) , and their presence indicates that the outbursts in ci  cyg and other similar systems are not powered by thermonuclear reactions . \n the timescales and relative amplitudes for these eruptions are very similar to the timescales and amplitudes of the hot component luminosity variations ( high and low states ) in symbiotic recurrent novae ( e.g. t crb , rs oph , rx pup ) between their nova eruptions ( anupama & mikoajewska 1999 ; mikoajewska et al . \n 1999 ) and in other accretion - powered systems ( ch cyg , mira a+b ) . \n it is possible that the main difference between ci cyg , z and , ax per , and other related symbiotic systems with multiple eruption activity and the activity of accretion - powered systems ( symbiotic recurrent novae and ch cyg ) is that the hot component in the former burns more or less stably the accreted hydrogen whereas not in the latter . \n systematic optical and near infrared monitoring with small telescopes can provide an answer to these and many other questions . \n i gratefully acknowledge maciej mikoajewski and toma tomov for providing figure 3 . \n i would also like to thank the loc for their support . \n this research was partly founded by kbn research grant no . 5p03d01920 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1894681591818, "RequestID": "a63434d5757178a13b4a9260b8252a7efd826345", "TotalTokens": 3774}

related literature ) . thus , fas is a transient process in a waveguide . \n it can negligibly small very far from the source , however at moderate distances it can be an important phenomenon . \n the most known applications of fas are related to medical acoustics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n a long bone can be considered as a tubular waveguide constituted of three media : a thin outer layer of dense ( cortical ) bone , a sponge bone underneath , and a liquid marrow core in the center . \n the fastest wave that can theoretically propagate in such media ( taken separately as infinite spaces ) is the longitudinal wave in the cortical bone . \n the sponge bone and the marrow bear much slower waves . \n however , when a standard analysis of a waveguide is performed ( say , by the finite element method ) the dispersion diagram contains no branch having group velocity close to the longitudinal cortical velocity . \n there exist different approaches to describe fas . \n the most comprehensive approach has been proposed by miklowitz and randles in @xcite . \n this approach considers an analytical continuation of the dispersion diagram . after passing some branch points , it is possible to find a single branch of the dispersion diagram whose group velocity and decay correspond to fas . \n another analytical approach is an application of the classical cagniard \n dehoop technique to invert the fourier transform in the time domain @xcite \n . an approximate approach to fas is described in @xcite , where this type of waves is treated as a head wave . \n also fas can be approximately described as a leaky mode . for this , the slow media composing the waveguide are declared as elastic half - spaces , while the fastest medium remains to be a layer . \n such an approach enables one to compute ( at least in the simplest cases ) the velocity and the decay of fas with an acceptable accuracy . \n the aim of the current paper is to present a model of fas based on an elementary analysis of real dispersion diagrams of a layered waveguide \n . it is known @xcite that a wave process in a layered waveguide can be treated as an interaction between the modes of different types and velocities . \n thus , the dispersion diagram has a `` terrace - like '' structure formed by overlapping of different sets of branches . \n since typically no crossing of the branches can happen ( except the branches corresponding to non - interacting waves ) , there occur quasi - crossings at which the type of the mode is changing . a typical fragment of a dispersion diagram is shown in fig . \n [ fig01 ] ( this is a dispersion diagram of a model two - media acoustic waveguide studied in the paper ) . the visible line of the smallest slope ( although this line can be composed of segments corresponding to different branches ) is a _ pseudo -

free condition [ ff ] + * j*=0 . \n surprisingly , it turns out that this simple equations allows a full calculation of the pulsar magnetosphere ( scharlemant & wagoner 1973 , contopoulos , kazanas & fendt 1999 , gruzinov 2005 , spitkovsky 2006 ) .    for the stationary axisymmetric case , \n the calculation is as follows . using axisymmetry and stationarity , in cylindrical coordinates \n @xmath1 , we represent the fields by the three scalars @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , which depend on @xmath5 and @xmath6 but not on @xmath7 : [ stat ] * e * = - ,   * b*=1r(-_z , a,_r ) , where the subscripts denote the partial derivatives . \n we plug ( [ stat ] ) into ( [ ff ] ) and use @xmath8 and @xmath9 . \n we also use the boundary conditions at the surface of the star  the continuity of the normal component of the magnetic field and the tangential component of the electric field . \n we use the pulsar units = = c=1 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic dipole moment of the star . \n it is assumed that the magnetic field is a pure dipole near the surface inside the star . \n the star is assumed to be a perfect conductor . \n @xmath11 is the angular velocity of the star . \n we get = ,   a = a ( ) , where @xmath4 is an arbitrary function of @xmath3 , and we also get the `` grad - shafranov - like '' pulsar magnetosphere equation for @xmath3 [ pme ] ( 1-r^2)-2r_r+f()=0 . here \n @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where the prime denotes the @xmath3-derivative . the pulsar magnetosphere equation ( [ pme ] ) \n is solved outside the star r^2+z^2>r_s^2 , with the boundary condition at the surface of the star = r^2r_s^3 ,   r^2+z^2=r_s^2 . \n the pulsar magnetosphere equation ( [ pme ] ) contains @xmath14  an arbitrary function of @xmath3 , and it is not clear how one should solve it . \n this was explained and done by contopoulos , kazanas & fendt ( 1999 ) ( ckf ) . \n the pulsar magnetosphere equation is elliptical both inside and outside the light cylinder , and can therefore be solved if some conditions are given at all boundaries and if @xmath14 is known . \n we first pick a trial @xmath14 .    then inside the light cylinder \n , we have all the boundary conditions : ( i ) we know @xmath3 at the surface of the star , ( ii ) @xmath15 at @xmath16 , ( iii ) at @xmath17 the boundary condition is given by the pulsar magnetosphere equation itself , @xmath18 . \n so we can find @xmath3 inside the light cylinder , say by the relaxation method using the variation principle .    outside the light cylinder , \n ckf postulate the boundary condition at the equator , ( r,0)=(1,0 ) ,  r>1 . then , with some boundary conditions at infinity ( we use @xmath15 at @xmath16 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 ) , and with the same boundary condition at the light cylinder , @xmath18 at @xmath17 , one can solve the pulsar magnetosphere equation outside the light cylinder too .    for a generic @xmath14 , this procedure gives a solution with @xmath21 . \n but one might hope that there is a ( unique ? ) \n @xmath14 which gives a smooth solution . \n ckf use a feedback procedure  numerical adjustment of @xmath14 leading to a smooth light cylinder crossing .    in our case , \n the boundary condition at the equator outside the light cylinder is ( r^2 - 1)()^2=a^2 ,  z=0 ,  r>1 . at the light cylinder , @xmath17 \n , this gives a(_0)=0 ,  _ \n 0(1,0 ) , meaning that there is no singular return current on the field line @xmath22 . \n the only singularity is the equatorial current layer . \n in summary , we solve the following pulsar magnetosphere equation [ pme1 ] ( 1-r^2)-2r_r+aa=0 , [ pme2 ] = r^2r_s^3 ,   r^2+z^2=r_s^2 , [ pme3 ] ( r^2 - 1)()^2=a^2 ,  z=0 ,  r>1 . \n the function @xmath23 is ( uniquely ? ) determined by the continuity at the light cylinder . \n the poynting power is @xmath24 . \n our numerical procedure is as follows . \n we pick a trial function g(r)>0 ,   g(r)<0 ,  r>1 ,  g(1)=1 . instead of the boundary condition ( [ pme3 ] ) , we impose ( r,0)=_0g(r ) ,   r>1 ,   _ 0(1,0 ) . \n we apply the ckf relaxation method to calculate @xmath25 ( ignoring the singular return current ) . \n then we calculate the field invariant at the equator outside the light cylinder i(r)=1r^2(a^2+()^2)-()^2 ,  z=0 ,  r>1 . \n we then _ manually _ chose @xmath26 , so as to make @xmath27 as close to zero as we can at all @xmath28 . \n it turns out , that g(r)=0.52 + 0.48r , nullifies @xmath27 to about the numerical accuracy . \n has been read off the sfe time - dependent simulation ( we then confirm that various other profiles @xmath26 do nt nullify @xmath27 to the accuracy shown in fig.1 . ) . what one really wants is a ckf - type feedback loop , which would adjust @xmath26 so as to nullify @xmath27 . or \n , maybe , one can enforce the correct boundary condition ( [ pme3 ] ) throughout the @xmath14 relaxation . \n we were unable to develop a numerical scheme which would solve the problem ( [ pme1 ] - [ pme3 ] ) all by itself . ] \n one gets the spin - down power ( the poynting flux at the stellar surface = the poynting flux through the light cylinder ) : l_sd 0.9 ^ 2 ^4c^3 . the ohmic power ( the poynting flux on the field lines that cross the equatorial current layer ) is l_ohm 0.5l_sd . the ohmic power between 1 and 1.5 light cylinder radii is l_ohm 1.5 0.1l_sd .", "StartTimeOffset": 1923874757052, "RequestID": "a58d3646176a98b8897a610ca6401f0c1e0bbcaa", "TotalTokens": 2102}

allowed and narrow spin - forbidden electric - dipole ( e1 ) transitions enables stacking laser cooling on both types of transitions , with the spin - allowed transitions used for the initial rapid cooling and spin - forbidden transitions - for reaching much lower doppler - limit temperatures . \n moreover , the narrow inter - combination transitions , such as the @xmath12 transition , can be used as an optical frequency reference   @xcite . \n the highly - forbidden @xmath13 transition can be potentially used for an optical lattice clock scheme  @xcite . however , due to peculiarities of its electronic structure , ca , unlike other alkaline - earth atoms , has a relatively short lifetime in conventional magneto - optical traps ( mot ) . to improve the mot efficiency , \n several re - pumping schemes were proposed and demonstrated  @xcite . that work required reliable electric - dipole transition data for many transitions between the 75 lowest energy states of neutral ca . here \n , we compile the results of our computational work that served as a basis of the mot performance analysis  @xcite . \n we anticipate that the tabulated data will be useful in multiple other contexts , such as estimating various systematic effects in optical clocks and computing static or dynamic polarizabilities and long - range inter - atomic interaction coefficients . \n there have been a number of atomic - structure calculations for neutral calcium . \n the earlier work includes multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) calculation @xcite and semi - empirical model - potential calculations@xcite . \n these computations provide oscillator strengths for spin - allowed transitions for levels up to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n most of them are non - relativistic with very limited numbers of low - lying levels treated with _ \n ab initio _ relativistic methods . \n in particular , fisher and tachiev  @xcite reported energies and e1 transition rates for levels below @xmath17 . \n porsev et al . \n @xcite and savukov and johnson  @xcite computed the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 transition rates using a combination of configuration - interaction ( ci ) and many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) ( referred to as the ci+mbpt method ) . \n the ci+mbpt method results were in excellent agreement with high - precision experimental values . \n this fact partially motivated our use of the relativistic ci+mbpt method for the present work . \n the ci+mbpt method employs a systematic formalism that combines advantages of both configuration interaction ( ci ) method and many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt )  @xcite . \n this method has been used extensively for evaluation of atomic properties ( see , e.g. , review  @xcite for optical lattice clock applications and references therein ) . \n relativistic effects are included exactly as the formalism starts from the dirac equation and employs relativistic bi - spinor wave functions throughout the entire calculation . in our treatment , \n the ci model space is limited to excitations of the two valence electrons . \n contributions involving virtual excitations of core orbitals are treated within the mbpt . in this approach , \n we first solve for the valence electron orbitals and energies in the field of core electrons . \n the one - electron effective potential includes both the frozen - cored dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf @xmath21 ) and self - energy ( core - polarization ) potentials . \n the self - energy correction is computed using second - order mbpt diagrams involving virtual core excitations . at the next step , \n the computed one - electron valence orbitals are used to diagonalize the atomic hamiltonian in the model space of two valence electrons within the ci method . \n the ci model - space hamiltonian includes the residual ( beyond dhf ) coulomb interaction between the valence electrons and also their core - polarization - mediated interaction . \n the latter was computed in the second - order mbpt . \n this step yields two - electron wave - functions and energies . finally , with the obtained wave - functions we calculated the required electric - dipole matrix elements . in calculations of transition rates we used experimental energy intervals and the computed ci+mbpt matrix elements . \n we used two independent ci+mbpt implementations : ( i ) by the reno group ( see the decription of the earlier version in ref . \n @xcite ) and ( ii ) the recently published package  @xcite . \n the practical goal of the calculations was not reaching the best possible accuracy , but rather the generation of massive amounts of reliable data for the transition array involving 75 lowest - energy levels . \n the reno code was run on a large basis set but without including core - polarization - mediated interaction in the ci hamiltonian due to considerable computational costs . \n the production runs with package  @xcite employed a smaller basis set ( due to code limitations ) but treated the correlation problem more fully . \n while using the package  @xcite we employed the one - electron basis set that included the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 orbitals , where the core and @xmath27 orbitals are dhf ones , while the remaining orbitals were represented by a b - spline basis set . \n the reno code used the dual - kinetic - balance basis set generated in the dhf @xmath21 potential using spherical cavity of 75 bohr radius @xcite . \n the basis included orbitals with orbital angular momentum @xmath28 up to 6 . \n the total number of positive - energy ( in the dirac sense ) orbitals per partial wave was 40 with the 35 lowest - energy orbitals used in the calculations .    for most states , the values of transition rates obtained with package  @xcite were in closer agreement with the nist recommended values due to more complete treatment of the correlation problem . \n the level of agreement was degraded for states with the @xmath29 electron configuration which was traced to our use of small basis set due to package  @xcite limitations . for these @xmath29 states , the values of transition rates obtained with the reno code displayed a better agreement with the nist data because of the larger basis set . \n in addition , due to the restriction on the number of eigenvalues in the package  @xcite , we were not able to compute the states arising from the @xmath30 configuration . \n our final values combine the outputs of the two codes . \n while the bulk of the results comes from the package  @xcite , rates for states involving the @xmath29 and @xmath30 configurations are taken from the reno code output in our tabulation . \n the spontaneous emission rate @xmath31 from the upper ( initial ) state @xmath32 to the lower ( final ) state @xmath33 was calculated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced matrix element of the electric - dipole operator in atomic units , the transition wavelength @xmath36 is expressed in @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the total angular momentum of the upper ( initial ) state . \n the emission rate can be converted into the weighted oscillator strength using  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is weighted oscillator strength , @xmath41 is the emission oscillator strength ( usually taken to be negative ) , @xmath42 is the adsorption oscillator strength , and @xmath43 is the total angular momentum of the lower ( final ) state . \n we determined @xmath36 from the nist recommended energy values  @xcite . \n finally , the total transition rate @xmath44 from a given initial state is a sum of @xmath31 over all e1-allowed final states , with the resulting initial state lifetime @xmath45 . \n we summarize the lifetime of the 75 states in table 1 and compare with the available theoretical and experimental values . \n our data show better agreement with the experimental values , as compared with the other theoretical data . \n the computed spontaneous emission rates are compiled in tables 2 - 6 . for completeness , we list values obtained with the electric dipole operator in both the length and velocity forms ( gauges ) in columns marked @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . generally , the length and velocity gauges agree at a few percent level , except for some occasional large discrepancies for weak transitions . \n the length form values are in better overall agreement with the available literature data and therefore we recommend using the length - form values . \n we further assessed the quality of our calculation by comparing our values with other theoretical data @xcite and with the nist recommended values  @xcite in table 7 . \n the other theoretical data are taken primarily from three sources . \n the first source is the non - relativistic semi - empirical calculation by hansen et al . \n they used the model potential and ci ( mpci ) method to determine rates for the ls allowed e1 transitions for levels up to @xmath14 . from a comparison with other semi - empirical work  @xcite , hansen et al .  concluded that their data are more accurate because they have used larger basis size , larger cut - off radius , and more accurate model potential . in table 7 \n we compare 80 transition rates with hansen s results @xcite . for comparison , \n their weighted oscillator strength @xmath40 values are converted to @xmath31 ( in 1/s ) as @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath36 is in  . \n the difference between our and the hansen s results is better than 1% for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 transitions and better than 50% for majority of other transitions . \n there are a few cases where the discrepancy between our and hansen s data is worse than 50% for some specific transitions decaying from highly excited states like @xmath0 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath16 , and @xmath53 . \n the second source is the _ ab initio _ \n relativistic mchf calculations by fischer , et al . \n they report the transition rates between levels below @xmath17 , both allowed and spin forbidden . in table 7 , we compared 13 spin forbidden singlet - triplet transition rates with their results . \n our values are in better agreement with the nist data than the mchf results , for example , for the @xmath50 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 transitions . \n the third source is the ci+mbpt calculation  @xcite . \n these authors reported rates for the spin - allowed @xmath18 , @xmath19 transitions , and for the spin - forbidden @xmath56 and @xmath57 transitions . \n we find excellent agreement with their ci+mbpt results @xcite . \n finally , we compared 99 transition rates with the nist atomic spectra database  @xcite in table 7 . in most cases , \n the discrepancy is better than 50% . \n there are some instances when the discrepancy is worse than 50% . \n in particular , for the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 transitions , our data show good agreement with the mpci theoretical data , but display large differences with the nist recommended values . \n we would like to thank eric hudson for motivating this work and mikhail kozlov for a valuable assistance with the code  @xcite . \n thanks the university of nevada , reno for hospitality during her visit . \n y.y . was supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . \n 91536106 , the nkrd program of china ( 2016yfa0302104 ) and the cas xdb21030300 . \n a.d . was supported in part by the us national science foundation grant phy-1607396 . \n 99    c. w. oates , e. a. curtis , and l. hollberg , opt . \n 25 ( 2000 ) 1603 .    c. degenhardt , h. stoehr , c. lisdat , g. wilpers , h. schnatz , b. lipphardt , t. nazarova , p .- e . \n pottie , u. sterr , j. helmcke , and f. riehle , phys . \n a 72 ( 2005 ) 062111 . \n a. derevianko and h. katori , rev . mod . \n 83 ( 2011 ) 331 . \n m. mills , p. puri , y .- m . \n yu , a. derevianko , c. schneider , and e. r. hudson , arxiv:1701.04948 ( 2017 ) . \n n.  vaeck , m.  godefroidtn , and j.  e.  hansent , j. phys . \n b 24 ( 1991 ) 361 . \n j.  mitroy , j. phys . \n b 26 ( 1993 ) 3703 . \n t. brage , c. f. fischer , phys . \n a 50 ( 1994 ) 2937 .    c.  laughlin , j. e. hansen , j. phys b 29 ( 1996 ) l441 . \n j.  e. hansen , c. laughlin , h. w van der hart , g. verbockhaven , j. phys b 32 ( 1999 ) 2099 .    c. f. fischer and g. tachiev , phys . \n a 68 ( 2003 ) 012507 . \n s. g. porsev , m. g. kozlov , yu . g. rakhlina , and a. derevianko , phys . \n a 64 ( 2001 ) 012508 . \n i. m. savukov and w. r. johnson , phys . \n a 65 ( 2002 ) 042503 . \n v. a. dzuba , v. v. flambaum , and m. g. kozlov , phys . \n a 54 ( 1996 ) 3948 . \n a. derevianko and s. g. porsev , in advances in atomic , molecular , and optical physics , vol . \n 60 , edited by e. arimondo , p. r. berman , and c. c. lin ( academic press , 2011 ) pp . 415 . \n a. derevianko , phys . \n 87 ( 2001 ) 023002 . \n m. g. kozlov , s. g. porsev , m. s. safronova , and i. i. tupitsyn , comp . \n 195 ( 2015 ) 199 . \n k beloy and a derevianko , comp . \n . comm . 179 \n ( 2008 ) 310 . \n r. d. cowan , the theory of atomic structure and spectra ( university of california press , berkeley , 1981 ) , eqs . \n ( 14.33 ) , ( 14.37 ) and ( 14.38 ) . \n y. ralchenko , a. e. kramida , j. reader , and nist asd team , `` nist atomic spectra database ( version 5.4 ) '' ( 2016 ) . \n g. zinner , t. binnewies , f. riehle , and e. tiemann , phys . \n 85 ( 2000 ) 2292 . \n r. drozdowski , m. ignaciuk , j. kwela , j. heldt , z. phys . \n d 41 ( 1997 ) 125 . \n g. jnsson , c. levinson c and s. svanberg , phys . \n 30 ( 1984 ) 65 . \n w. hansen , j. phys . \n b 16 ( 1983 ) 2309 . \n l. pasternack , d. m. silver , d. r. yarkony , p. j. dagdigian , j. phys . \n b 13 ( 1980 ) 2231 . \n d. husain , g. roberts , j. chem . \n faraday trans . \n ii 82 ( 1986 ) 1921 .    in table \n i , we compile radiative e1 lifetimes of the 74 lowest -

collisions and grazing impacts which often lead to complex chaotic motions . \n the poincar map , describing evolution from an impact to the next impact , is a natural tool to study vibro - impacting systems . \n the main difficulty with investigating impacting systems is in finding instant of the next impact what typically involves solving a nonlinear equation . \n however , the problem can be simplified in the case of a bouncing ball dynamics assuming a special motion of the limiter . in the present paper \n we investigate motion of a material point in a gravitational field colliding with a limiter moving with piecewise constant velocity . \n this class of models has been extensively studied , see @xcite  and references therein . as a motivation that inspired this work , \n we mention study of physics and transport of granular matter @xcite . \n a similar model has been also used to describe the motion of railway bogies @xcite . \n therefore it can be expected that some of the present results may cast light on the dynamics in such systems . on the other hand , simple motion of the limiter \n makes analytical explorations possible , cf . our preliminary report okninski2009 . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a one dimensional dynamics of a ball moving in a gravitational field and colliding with a table is considered and poincar map is described for piecewise linear motion of the table . in section 3 \n transition to chaotic dynamics from periodic motion is described . \n the nature of mixing leading to chaotic dynamics is described in section 4 . in sections 5 and 6 homoclinic structures responsible for mixing are determined and computed . \n finally , we discuss our results in the last section . \n we consider a motion of a small ball moving vertically in a gravitational field and colliding with a moving table , representing unilateral constraints . \n the ball is treated as a material point while the limiter s mass is assumed so large that its motion is not affected at impacts . \n a motion of the ball between impacts is described by the newton s law of motion:@xmath0where @xmath1 and motion of the limiter is:@xmath2with a known function @xmath3 . \n we shall also assume that @xmath3 is a continuous function of time . \n impacts are modeled as follows : @xmath4where duration of an impact is neglected with respect to time of motion between impacts . in eqs . \n ( [ position ] ) , ( [ velocity ] ) @xmath5 stands for time of the @xmath6-th impact while @xmath7 , @xmath8are left -

{"ContextTokens": 3710, "GeneratedTokens": 126, "SynthesizedBody": "bright coronal loops are often observed to sway back and forth ( e.g , aschwanden et al . \n 1999 ) . usually , the oscillations begin suddenly in response to a nearby flare or filament eruption ( wills - davey & thompson 1999 ) . after initiation the amplitude of the motion attenuates , disappearing below the noise threshold after a few wave periods ( nakariakov et al . \n 1999 ; white & verwichte 2012 ; nistico et al . \n these oscillations have been studied intensely because of the diagnostic potential they offer for measuring the magnetic properties of the loops upon which they reside ( roberts 2000 ; andries et al . \n however , before such diagnostics can be fully exploited , a detailed understanding of the nature of the waves and the waveguide is required ( jain & hindman 2011 ) . \n for instance , all of the seismic inferences that have made to date about loop properties have implicitly assumed that the observed oscillations are standing waves . \n unfortunately , verifying that the observed oscillations are not the response to a transient travelling wave is difficult and only a few studies have successfully done so ( aschwanden & schrijver 2011 ; verwichte et al . \n further , recent work by hindman & jain ( 2014 ) has even called into question the 1-d nature of the loop waveguide that has been the theoretical paradigm . \n they suggest that the waveguide may be comprised of the entire magnetic arcade in which the visible loop is embedded .    the exact mechanism by which a flare induces oscillations in nearby loops is not fully understood at present ; \n however , hudson & warmuth ( 2004 ) have suggested that the magnetic blast wave that is expelled from the flare site may be important . \n observations connecting loop oscillations with such expanding disturbances have been reported in the past ( e.g. , wang et al . \n the fact that some loop oscillations appear to grow in amplitude initially before reaching maximum strength before a possible decay , indicates that the excitation event may be temporally extended and that not all loop oscillations are excited in the same manner . \n furthermore , the polarisation could also depend on the loop oscillation plane ( see wang and solanki , 2004 ) . \n the swaying motions transverse to the loop plane are referred to as _ horizontal oscillations _ whereas the motions polarised in the loop plane can either conserve the loop shape ( _ vertical oscillations _ ) or length ( _ distortion oscillations _ ) .    here \n we report on observations of two distinct coronal loops that were both part of the same magnetic arcade . \n both loops began oscillating after the passage of an expanding wavefront that spread from the site of a nearby flare . in section 2 \n , we describe the data employed , depict the geometry of the loops , and discuss the timing of the wavefront and the commencement of the oscillations . in section 3 , \n we present a time - series analysis of the loop oscillations , power spectra and cross - correlations . in so doing , we provide clear evidence that the oscillations were standing waves in the fundamental mode . \n finally , in section 4 we discuss the implications and importance of our findings . \n we considered euv images of noaa ar1283 with pixel resolution of 0.6@xmath0 taken by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) in the 171  passband ( lemen 2012 ) on 6 september 2011 . \n the dataset was chosen for studying coronal - loop oscillations which were observed immediately after the passage of a wavefront launched from the flare site . \n a few distinct loops within a magnetic arcade were visible and were seen to oscillate . \n figure 1a displays ar1283 and the area indicated by dotted lines is featured in a zoom - in view in figure 1b . \n figure 1c presents an overlay of the same region for three different aia passbands : 171  , 193  , and 221  . \n the flare occurring in ar1283 was an x2.1 class flare located close to the disk centre at latitude 14@xmath1 north and longitude 18@xmath1 west . \n it initiated at 22:12 ut , peaked at 22:20 ut , and ended at about 22:30 ut . \n figure 1d shows the fluxes in goes 4  and 8  as well as the aia 171  passband . \n the flare was also associated with a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) ( see for example , the soho / lasco cme catalogue ) . \n the metric type burst ii was not obvious in one band for this event but was reported to be present in full range ( see , gbsrbs ) . \n note that euv dimming in aia 171  , shown in figure 1d is also an indication of a launched cme . \n the wavefront ejected from the flare was clearly seen in the aia 221  passband ( see figure 2a ) . by tracking the position of this wavefront \n , we estimate a propagation speed of 870 km s@xmath2 . \n careful investigation suggests that the propagating wavefront was visible just before the maximum in the release of flare energy as measured by goes . \n the oscillations were initiated at the same time that the wavefront struck the loops . \n figure 2b illustrates this point , showing an aia 171  image with the location of the wavefront indicated for two different times . \n the footpoints of the loops ( located near the left end of the wavefront arcs ) are impacted around the time 22:18 ut , which , as we will see later , is the time at which the loops began to oscillate .    from the aia imagery \n it appears that the oscillating loops were part of a low - lying magnetic sheet which was arched over by a higher set of upper loops with a slightly different orientation . \n when the wavefront hit the entire structure , the upper loops lifted and as they did so , their rightmost portions disappeared and may have detached . \n this is most easily seen by examining the supplemental online movie . since the passage of wavefront , the readjustment of the geometry of the upper loops , and the start of oscillations on the lower loops all occurred simultaneously , it is impossible to know the direct cause of the oscillations . \n the wavefront could have shaken the oscillating loops directly or the sudden lifting of the upper field lines may have induced a pressure fluctuation that set the lower loops oscillating . \n but since the lifting of the upper loops seems to have been instigated by the passage of the wavefront , the wavefront probably played at least an indirect role . \n figure 3 shows snapshots of the magnetic arcade at two different times spanning the event . \n the top panels , ( a ) and ( c ) , show the location of two loops that we will study in detail . \n these loops are labelled a and b. since only a fraction of each loop is seen by stereo - a , we reconstructed the loop orientation by modelling the shape of the loops with an inclined semi - circle , as suggested in aschwanden et al . \n ( 2002 ) . with this procedure we obtained loop lengths of 158 mm and 164 mm . \n diagrams of the loop geometry and their projections on the plane of the sky are presented in the right panels of figure 3 . \n to study the oscillations we extracted the temporal variation of the aia 171   intensity along the eight slits whose positions are indicated in figure 3b . the intensity for each slit \n is illustrated as a time - distance image in figure 4 . \n the slit numbers are marked in the top left corner . \n the oscillation of both identified loops are particularly evident in slit 7 . \n the oscillations begin around 22:18 ut , which corresponds with the passage of the wavefront launched from the flare . \n figure 5a shows the intensity for a segment of slit 7 centered on the oscillating loops . by fitting a parabola locally to the intensity of each loop separately \n , we find the position of peak brightness as a function of time and generate a time series for the position of each loop in the slit . \n these time series are shown with the red and blue crosses in figure 5b . \n each time series has the appearance of a decaying sinusoid . \n therefore , we fit each with a function of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an amplitude , @xmath5 is a damping time , @xmath6 is a wave period , and @xmath7 is a phase . \n these resulting fits are indicated in figure 5b with the dotted curves . \n the phase difference between the two time series is 31@xmath1 and both have a period of roughly @xmath8 min and a decay time of @xmath9 min . \n we note that oddly the phase of loop a lags that of b , despite the fact that loop a is closer to the flare . \n the power spectra for all the time series ( data and fits ) are shown in figure 5c . \n the dataset has a nyquist frequency of approximately 21 mhz and a frequency spacing of 1.4 mhz . \n the oscillations of both loops have a single dominant frequency of roughly 8 mhz and are consistent with a lifetime of 5 min ( i.e. , a half - width of 0.5 mhz ) \n . however , both of the spectral profiles for the unfitted data are asymmetric with enhanced power in the high - frequency wing . \n such a result is expected when modelling the loop oscillations as the response of a magnetic arcade to fast mhd waves . \n the waveguide is 2d and the waves are standing oscillations in the direction parallel to the field lines and may be travelling disturbances perpendicular to the field down the axis of the arcade . \n the power peak in this 2-d arcade model is due to those waves that propagate parallel to the field lines , while the enhanced power in the high - frequency wing is the contribution from waves that propagate both parallel and transverse to the field lines . since only one power peak is observed , we believe that the oscillations correspond to the fundamental resonance of the waveguide with the wavefunction lacking internal nodes between the fixed footpoints . \n we verify that the oscillation is indeed the fundamental waveguide mode by performing a careful analysis of the phase of the oscillation along the loop . for loops \n a and b , we generate time series for the oscillations for each slit by repeating the previous analysis . \n subsequently , we cross - correlate the time series for two different slits and find the time lag that corresponds to the centroid of the correlation peak . \n the results are illustrated in figure 6 , which shows the cross - correlation as a function of time lag between the time series for slit 7 and the series for every other slit . \n the resulting time lag between the signals is uniformly small @xmath10 5 s , consistent with zero lag to within the observational errors ( the temporal cadence of the interpolated time series is 12 s ) . \n thus the entire loop oscillates in phase , indicating that the wave is a standing wave and further , the loop is oscillating in the fundamental mode . \n we performed a time - series analysis of the oscillations of two coronal loops that were embedded within a single magnetic arcade . both loops had a similar length of @xmath11160 mm , but slightly different orientations ( see figure 3 ) . \n the observed oscillations were triggered by a nearby x2.1 flare and the initiation time of the oscillations is well - correlated with the passage of a wavefront launched from the flare site . \n although the event was associated with a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) , there was only a partial opening of field lines in the arcade . \n there was no significant restructuring of the oscillating coronal loops themselves . \n the power spectra for the oscillation of both loops clearly show a single _ asymmetric _ peak as a function of frequency with a high ratio of signal to noise of roughly 10 . \n the power peaks at a frequency of 8 mhz corresponding to a period of 2 min . \n the oscillations have an amplitude that attenuates with an e - folding time of 5 min . \n this time scale is well - matched by the half - width of the power peak when measured on the low - frequency side of the peak . \n we analyzed the time series of oscillations at eight different slit positions along the loops . through cross - correlation of the signal from one \n slit with that of another , we found that the full length of the loop oscillates in phase . \n the single power peak and the phase measurements unambiguously demonstrate that the observed wave was a standing wave parallel to the field lines and that only the fundamental mode of the wave cavity was excited . from the frequency of the oscillations and the loop lengths , we can estimate that the mean wave speed along the loops . using @xmath12 with loop - length , @xmath13 160 mm and the time period , @xmath14 130 s , the wave speed @xmath15 is @xmath11 2500 km s@xmath2 . \n both loops reveal the unusual feature that the high - frequency wing of the spectral power profile was enhanced compared to the low - frequency wing ( see figure 5c ) . \n such behavior was previously predicted by hindman & jain ( 2014 ) . \n they argued that some coronal - loop oscillations are the response of the entire magnetic arcade to an mhd fast wave disturbance . \n the arcade acts as a 2-d waveguide , for which the wavemodes are standing waves in the direction parallel to the field lines and are trapped between the footpoints . \n simultaneously , these wavemodes are free to propagate perpendicular to the field lines in the direction parallel to the axis of the arcade . \n this model predicts that each mode of the waveguide should add its own individual asymmetric power peak to the spectrum . \n the core of the power peak is formed by those waves that propagate almost parallel to the field lines and the high - frequency enhancement of the power wing is caused by the existence of waves that propagate obliquely and bounce back and forth between the footpoints as the wave travels down the arcade . while our observed spectrum is well - matched by such a model , our evidence is incomplete . \n clear proof would have been a specific phase relation between different loops within the arcade . this phase relation is not reproduced and in fact an examination of figure 5 reveals that the loop farthest from the flare precedes the closer loop in phase . \n however , these phase arguments were predicated on the assumption that wave excitation occurs suddenly at a single location within the waveguide ; thus , the phase difference between loops depends only on the travel time between loops . \n the situation observed here is far more complex . \n the wave source is not necessarily sudden and it certainly is nt spatially compact . \n we suggest two possible excitation mechanisms : direct shaking of the oscillating loops by the wavefront that expands from the flare site and the sudden reduction in pressure caused by the rise of the upper field lines .    while the wavefront is a spatially narrow feature , it still should cause temporally and spatially distributed driving . \n the wavefront takes a finite time to cross an individual loop , roughly 100 s given the speed of the wavefront , the orientation of the loops , and the distance between footpoints ( roughly 95 mm ) . \n further , the wavefront crosses the entire arcade potentially exciting waves all along its length . in this case , the absolute phase of the oscillations are not an indication of a single excitation time , but instead they depend on the complicated details of the wavefront s passage . \n another possibility is that the upward lifting of the overlying field lines caused a pressure fluctuation that induced waves on the lower loops . in this case \n , the driving would be fairly uniform along the length of each loop ; thus , preferentially exciting the fundamental mode of oscillation as observed . \n further , since the upper loops cross over the lower loops and they appear to have detached from their right footpoints , the lower loops most distant from the flare may have been excited first as the disturbance travelled from the right footpoints to the left along the upper loops . \n while conjecture , this might be the simplest explanation for the puzzling fact that the most distant loop was observed to have the most advanced phase . \n considering the separation between the two loops ( roughly 3.5 mm ) and the measured time lag of 10 s between the two loops ( 31 degree phase difference with a period of 2 min ) , the wavespeed in the upper loops would need to be on the order of 350 km s@xmath2 . \n we have studied oscillations of two distinct coronal loops that were part of the same magnetic arcade . \n these loops started to oscillate after the passage of an expanding wavefront that spread from the site of a nearby flare . \n a time - series and phase analysis of the loop oscillations suggest that the oscillatory motions are fundamental modes of oscillations with 2-minute periods and 5-minute decay times . \n the power spectra is found to be asymmetric with enhanced power in the high - frequency wing suggesting some contribution from waves that propagate both parallel and transverse to the field lines . +   + acknowledgements : we are grateful for the use of sdo / aia , stereo and goes data . \n we also thank msrc , university of sheffield ( uk ) for financial support to r.a.m for his visit to sheffield . \n bwh acknowledges nasa grants nnx14ag05 g and nnx14ac05 g .", "StartTimeOffset": 1969703365884, "RequestID": "ec9323131f3e67bf65eba9ccf6ea662c687ec69e", "TotalTokens": 3836}

studied , see e.g.  @xcite , and the combination of @xmath74 and @xmath72 yield the four important cases , namely the global excitation , the global inhibition , the local excitation - lateral inhibition and the local inhibition - lateral excitation . \n further the choice @xmath76 yields local inhibitory interactions or local inhibitory - lateral excitatory interactions  @xcite . \n the present work focus on the case @xmath77 which yields the local excitation or the local excitation - lateral inhibition \n . please see fig . \n [ fig_kernels ] for the corresponding illustration of the cases @xmath77 and @xmath76 .     and @xmath72 . \n panel ( a ) shows the kernel function for @xmath78 that yields global excitations while panel ( b ) reveals local excitation - lateral inhibition for @xmath79 . in panel \n ( c ) the kernel function has been illustrated for @xmath80 , which represents global inhibition , while panel ( d ) shows local inhibition - lateral excitation for @xmath81 . \n it is @xmath82[fig_kernels],width=302 ]    in order to gain the critical wavenumber of the wave instability , the kernel fourier moment in eq . \n ( [ eqn_k ] ) is computed to @xmath83 since @xmath84 for @xmath85 , there is a maximum of @xmath86 at some @xmath87 with @xmath88 if @xmath89 and @xmath90 . \n these sufficient conditions read @xmath91 with the new parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .     and @xmath73 . \n the dashed and thin solid line represent the function @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , taken from eq . \n ( [ eqn_suffi ] ) . here \n it is @xmath96  .[fig_xip],width=302 ]    figure  [ fig_xip ] illustrates the different parameter regimes of the conditions . at first \n it turns out that there is large parameter regime which allows for non - stationary instabilities . in order to gain further insight to the nature of spatial interactions for @xmath77 , fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] shows the parameter regimes and the different number of roots of the kernel function @xmath97 . \n we find a parameter regime of single roots , which reflects local excitation - lateral inhibition interaction , and a parameter regime of no roots , i.e. global excitation . \n moreover , there is a parameter regime of multiple roots which , for instance , reflects local excitation - mid - range inhibition - lateral excitation and allows for wave instabilities . +     and the corresponding nature of spatial interactions subject to the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath73 . \n the dashed and thin solid line are taken from fig . \n [ fig_xip ] . \n the red lines delimits the novel parameter regime of multiple roots . \n in addition to the parameters from fig . \n [ fig_xip ] , it is @xmath99 and @xmath100 . \n [ fig_xipmultiple],width=302 ]    to illustrate the relation of the spatial interaction type and the resulting non - stationary instability , figure  [ fig_kernel+kernelfourier ] plots the kernel functions @xmath97 and the corresponding negative first kernel fourier moments @xmath86 for four different cases of spatial interactions . \n these specific cases are denoted by filled dots in fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] . \n we find local excitation - lateral inhibition for @xmath101 ( top row , left panel in fig .  [ fig_xipmultiple ] ) . \n since the global maximum of @xmath86 gives the critical wavenumber @xmath62 , this case yields global oscillations with @xmath65 ( top row , right panel in fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] ) . \n for @xmath102 , now the kernel function exhibits two roots which still leads to global oscillations . in case of @xmath103 the sufficient condition for wave instabilities \n are fulfilled , as @xmath86 reveals a critical wavenumber @xmath64 , see fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] . moreover , the spatial interaction function reveals local excitation , mid - range inhibition and lateral excitation , which has not been found yet in previous studies . at last for @xmath104 \n there is also a wave instability showing local excitation , mid - range inhibition and lateral excitation .     and the negative first kernel fourier moment @xmath56 for the four different cases taken from fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] . \n the insets in the left coloumn represent foci of the corresponding plot to illustrate the additional lateral excitation . \n the parameters are taken from fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] and the different values of @xmath98 correspond to the different dots in fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] . \n [ fig_kernel+kernelfourier],width=321 ]    in addition to this study , fig . \n [ fig_kernel+kernelfourier2 ] compares the spatial interaction function , the fourier transform @xmath105 and @xmath86 for two values of @xmath98 . \n this comparison is necessary as the stationary instability may occur first before the wave instability while increasing the control parameter from small values . \n for both parameter values of @xmath98 the global maximum of @xmath86 exceeds the global maximum of @xmath105 and thus a wave instability and not a stationary instability may occur . \n thus fig . \n [ fig_kernel+kernelfourier2 ] supports the previous findings . \n +     ( left coloumn ) , the fourier transform @xmath55 ( dashed line in right coloumn ) and @xmath86 ( solid line in right coloumn ) for two values of @xmath98 . \n additional parameters are taken from fig . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] . \n [ fig_kernel+kernelfourier2],width=321 ]    to visualize and confirm the analytical findings , finally we integrate the integral - differential equation  ( [ eqn_start ] ) numerically . \n the euler integration scheme is applied for the time evolution integration and the monte - carlo method vegas  @xcite computed the spatial integration . \n this specific monte - carlo integration method combines stratified and importance sampling , which is important to gain good estimates of the divergent excitatory kernel function \n . moreover boundary conditions are set periodic with the period @xmath106 while the initial conditions have to be defined in the time interval @xmath107 $ ] . \n we have chosen @xmath108 . \n shows the wave instability for local excitation - lateral inhibition interactions . \n additional parameters are @xmath109 and @xmath71=0,~s[v]=1/(1+\\exp(-1.84(v-3.0)))$ ] . these parameters yields @xmath110 . \n [ fig_wave],width=340 ]    figure  [ fig_wave ] shows the wave instability for @xmath111 discussed above , cf . \n [ fig_xipmultiple ] , and confirms the analytical finding . \n the present work describes the nonlocal spatial interaction of single elements in a continuous field . \n the application to damped oscillators , which are coupled by both nonlocal excitation and inhibition , reveals a new mechanism of wave instabilities . \n in contrast to previous findings in pattern forming systems , we find wave instabilities for local excitation and lateral inhibition . to obtain more information on the corresponding spatial interaction , we investigated additionally the spatial interaction function . \n it turns out that various spatial interaction types exhibit wave instabilities , as local excitation - lateral inhibition and local excitation - midrange inhibition - lateral excitation . \n hence the sign of the spatial interaction function does not carry the full information of the expected instability patterns in spatial systems with finite propagation delay . \n we have observed that the comparison of the global maximum of the fourier component and global maximum of the negative first kernel fourier moment allows for a reliable estimation of the instability type . + future work shall study the classifiers in vectorial models , as the nonlocal version of the bruesselator , and the classification scheme in two- and three - dimensional systems . \n the n - th kernel fourier moment of the specific kernels ( [ eqn_kernels ] ) can be computed from @xmath112 then we find for the excitatory kernel @xmath113 in addition , we find @xmath114 since the inhibitory kernel is a specific case of the excitatory kernel with @xmath75 and @xmath115 , we obtain eqs . \n ( [ eqn_k1e ] ) , ( [ eqn_k1i ] ) from the previous expressions .", "StartTimeOffset": 1974329877414, "RequestID": "0f62699348ea82a95e061aecf98a793dbd6209c1", "TotalTokens": 4009}
{"ContextTokens": 3062, "GeneratedTokens": 165, "SynthesizedBody": "open questions in stellar physics led to the idea that a dynamo operates in the radiative cores of early - type stars ( spruit 2002 ) . \n even the helioseismologic observation of rigid rotation of the solar interior shows in this direction . \n the angular momentum transport by the large - scale magnetic field pattern ( fossil field plus toroidal field induced by differential rotation ) does _ not _ lead to a solid - body rotation unless the viscosity of the plasma exceeds the molecular value by a few orders of magnitude ( rdiger & kitchatinov 1996 , eggenberger et al . \n other examples are given by the evolution of the fast rotating early - type stars which can only be understood if i ) there is a basic transport of angular momentum outwards and ii ) the radial mixing of chemicals remains weak ( yoon et al . \n 2006 , brott et al . \n 2008 ) . hence , \n if a ( magnetic - induced ) instability existed in the radiative stellar cores then the corresponding schmidt number @xmath3 must be rather large . \n we have shown that the kink - type instability ( or tayler instability , ti ) of toroidal magnetic fields forms a much - promising candidate for the instability . a schmidt number larger than ten results as the ratio of the effective viscosity and the diffusion coefficient ( rdiger et al . \n 2009 ) . \n the unstable modes of the ti are basically nonaxisymmetric driven by the energy of the electrical current which produces the toroidal field . \n interestingly enough , there exists even an instability of a toroidal magnetic field which in the fluid is current - free . in this case \n the energy comes from a differential rotation which itself is stable but which is unstable under the influence of the ( current - free ) toroidal field . \n we have called this instability as azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) as  like for the standard mri ( with axial fields )  the field itself is current - free and does not exert forces . in opposition to the standard mri \n the amri is always nonaxisymmetric and it is , therefore , much more interesting for the dynamo theory . for complicated radial profiles of the toroidal field we shall always have a mixture of ti and amri . \n generally , the latter is more important for fast rotation ( @xmath4 ) and v.v . here \n the alfvn frequency @xmath5 for the toroidal field is used which derives from the alfvn velocity @xmath6 as the related frequency . between two cylinders with different radii \n the toroidal field profile with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 radius ) is free of dissipation . \n the ` perfect ' amri appears for @xmath9 while the ` perfect ' ti results for @xmath10 . \n one can compute the necessary electrical currents to excite both sorts of instabilities in a columnar taylor - couette experiment with gallium as fluid conductor . \n as we have shown the critical hartmann numbers for self - excitation of axi- and nonaxisymmetric perturbation modes do not depend on the magnetic prandtl number of the fluid which is as small as @xmath11 for stellar plasma and @xmath12 for liquid sodium ( rdiger & schultz 2010 ) . \n it is typical for the nonaxisymmetric ti and amri that always the two modes with @xmath13 are excited for the same critical hartmann number and also  if supercritical  with the same growth rates ( fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) . despite their simultaneous existence \n they can be excited as singles with different initial conditions . however , if the initial conditions are as neutral as possible with respect to a preferred helicity , in the majority of the cases one of the modes dominates after our experiences . \n this behavior may have dramatic consequences with respect to the dynamo theory . \n both the modes with @xmath13 have opposite helicity with the same total amount . \n the mode with @xmath14 is identical to the mode with @xmath15 but in a left - hand system . \n the helicity of @xmath15 in the right - hand system equals the helicity of @xmath14 in the left - hand system . \n so it is obvious that in one and the same coordinate system the sum of the helicity of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is zero . as a consequence \n the instability of a toroidal field can only develop helicity if by some reasons one of the modes with @xmath13 dominates the other . \n there are the two possibilities that i ) one mode dominates the other by chance ( so as the matter dominates the antimatter ) or ii ) the existence of a poloidal field prefers one of the modes . \n we have shown that indeed in stellar radiation zones  if the background field has a positive current helicity @xmath16  the resulting kinetic helicity @xmath17 of the fluctuations is always negative ( gellert et al . \n a positive current helicity of the background field results if an axial field and an axial electrical current are parallel . a negative current helicity of the background field results if an axial field and an axial electric current are antiparallel . \n hence , the resulting kinetic helicities on the basis of current - driven instabilities have , therefore , opposite signs in opposite hemispheres of the model . \n we are interested in the stability of a background field @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and the flow @xmath20 in a dissipative conducting fluid rotating between two rigid cylinders . \n @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath22 is the magnetic diffusivity , their ratio is the magnetic prandtl number @xmath23 . \n the stationary background rotation law is @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 as constants . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the rotation rates of the cylinders and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the azimuthal magnetic fields there . \n one finds for the current helicity of the background field @xmath31 which may be either positive or negative ( and of course vanishes for the current - free case @xmath9 ) . \n the inner value @xmath32 may be normalized with the uniform vertical field , i.e. @xmath33 for a profile with @xmath34 we have @xmath35 for the normalized current helicity of the background field . \n the sign of @xmath36 determines the sign of the current helicity . as usual , the toroidal field amplitude is measured by the hartmann number @xmath37 and the global rotation by the reynolds number @xmath38 with @xmath39 . \n the alfvn frequency is @xmath40 . \n the boundary conditions associated with the perturbation equations are no - slip for the flows and perfectly conducting for the fields . for all computations \n it is @xmath41 .    for purely toroidal fields \n the expected net helicities vanish as two nonaxisymmetric modes with @xmath13 exist with identical excitation conditions and the same amount of helicity but of opposite sign ( fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) .     the normalized negative kinetic helicity and the negative current helicity for the nonaxisymmetric perturbations as functions of @xmath36 . \n @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45.,width=302 ]    we now compute both the helicities for helical fields with various pitch values @xmath36 which is inverse to the current helicity of the large - scale field . the astrophysically relevant case is @xmath46 ( which is not the classical realization of the tayler instability ) . \n the instability only exists for nonrigid rotation so that we always work with a rotation law @xmath47 . \n the radial profile of the toroidal field has been modelled by the above mentioned most simple profile with almost uniform toroidal field . \n figure [ fig2 ] gives the results ( in units of @xmath48 ) . \n both the kinetic helicity @xmath17 as well as the current helicity @xmath49 are negative . \n they are decreasing functions of @xmath36 . \n we have also calculated the @xmath0-effect via the determination of the electromotive force @xmath50 by the fluctuations . according to the rule that the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is anti - correlated with the ( kinetic ) helicity we expect the azimuthal @xmath0-effect as positive for @xmath51 . \n this is indeed the case ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] , left ) . \n one finds positive and negative signs in the container but the positive values dominate so that in the average the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is indeed positive . \n on the other hand , for negative @xmath36 we expect positive small - scale kinetic helicity and negative @xmath0-effect . \n the example presented in fig . \n [ fig3 ] refers to the pitch @xmath52 . for higher values , i.e. smaller helicity of the background field , \n the resulting @xmath0-effect becomes smaller and smaller . \n figure [ fig3 ] ( right ) shows that the dynamo number @xmath53 runs as @xmath54 with @xmath55 of order 10@xmath56 . \n it is easy to show that this value is too small by two orders of magnitudes to allow the operation of a classical @xmath57-dynamo ( gellert et al . \n we start with the amplification of fossil magnetic fields by shear and the magnetic - field back - reaction . \n the two - dimensional , non - linear simulations thus start with an initial differential rotation and a purely poloidal magnetic field in a radiative stellar zone . \n the early phase of the simulation shows a generation and steep amplification of toroidal magnetic field through differential rotation . \n the generated lorentz force redistributes the angular momentum . \n this is why at the same time of field amplification , the differential rotation starts to decrease , and the toroidal - field growth is thus limited . \n figure  [ fig4 ] shows the maximum magnetic field amplitude in the spherical shell as a function of time . \n the reynolds number is @xmath58 and the magnetic prandtl number is @xmath45 .     the stability limits of each snapshot of the axisymmetric evolution of a sufficiently strong initial field . \n the solid line gives the evolution of the toroidal field . \n the stability limit is given for the nonaxisymmetric perturbation patterns s1 and a1 ( from arlt & rdiger 2011).,width=257 ]    the dotted and dot - dashed lines in fig . \n [ fig4 ] are the results of a linear stability analysis of only the toroidal field . by s1 \n we refer to a velocity perturbation which is symmetric with respect to the equator and has @xmath15 , a1 is the corresponding antisymmetric perturbation . if at any given time both stability lines are above the solid line , the corresponding snapshot is stable against @xmath15 perturbations . \n the stability lines cross the solid one at about @xmath59 ( see arlt & rdiger 2011 ) . \n the system is now perturbed in a 3d , nonlinear simulation at a somewhat later time ( @xmath60 ) . \n the perturbation is applied to the magnetic field and has an azimuthal wave number of @xmath15 ( and is symmetric with respect to the equator ) . \n the resulting flow is thus antisymmetric and can be compared with the a1-mode in the linear stability diagram in fig . \n [ fig4 ] .    the spatial distribution of the resulting helicity is shown in fig . \n note the concentration of both the helicities near the inner boundary where the tangent cylinder touches the inner sphere . \n we conclude that a considerable part of the kinetic helicity in the system is due to the presence of an inner sphere . \n this is slightly different for the current helicity . a considerable amount of _ positive _ current helicity is measured in the bulk of the northern hemisphere . \n the situation is unchanged in runs with perfect conductor boundary conditions at the inner radius . interestingly , \n reshetnyak ( 2006 ) with convection simulations also finds negative kinetic helicity along the tangent cylinder . \n we assume that the negative helicity near the tangent cylinder of the northern hemisphere is an inner - boundary effect , neither related to convective nor tayler instability turbulence .    . \n middle : kinetic helicity @xmath61 . \n right : the azimuthal component of the @xmath0-effect . \n , width=408,height=264 ]    figure [ fig6 ] summarizes the consequences of a numerical experiment . in the unstable domain of fig . \n [ fig4 ] the instability pattern is calculated without global rotation , i.e. for @xmath63 . in this case \n the only existing pseudo - scalar is @xmath1 like in the above theory in cylindric geometry . \n the question is whether we can find the same relations between large - scale current helicity ( left ) , kinetic helicity ( middle ) and @xmath0-effect ( right ) . \n note first that indeed the dominant role of the tangent cylinder for the kinetic helicity and the @xmath0-effect vanishes so that it is obvious that it is a rotation - induced boundary layer effect . in the southern hemisphere \n the pseudo - scalar @xmath1 is positive while the kinetic helicity is negative ( but concentrated to the pole ) . \n the corresponding @xmath0-effect given in the right panel ( and computed also by means of the test - field method ) proves to be positive ( see arlt & rdiger 2011 ) . as it must \n , at the northern hemisphere all signs are opposite . \n hence , the model fulfills the same sign rules as in the above - discussed cylindric setup . \n unstable toroidal fields alone are not able to produce helicity and @xmath0-effect . \n it has been shown , however , that helicity and @xmath0-effect are produced by unstable magnetic large - scale field patterns which themselves possess current helicity @xmath1 . \n this is insofar understandable as helicity and @xmath0-effect are both pseudo - scalars which can only be nonvanishing if in the global setup a nonvanishing large -

{"ContextTokens": 2166, "GeneratedTokens": 231, "SynthesizedBody": "the rayleigh - bnard convection problem is one of the fundamental problems in the physics of fluids . \n the basic phenomena of the rayleigh - bnard convection in horizontally extended systems are widely known . \n the influence of the side walls , although not studied as throughly as the horizontally extended case , is of practical importance for engineering applications .    in this paper \n we study the rayleigh - bnard convection in a 2-d rectangular domain with no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity . \n this problem is also closely related to the problem of infinite channel with rectangular cross - section which has been studied by davies - jones @xcite , luijkx \n platten @xcite and kato \n fujimura @xcite among others . \n the linear aspects of the problem we consider in this paper have been studied by lee \n boyd @xcite , mizushima @xcite and gelfgat @xcite . in these papers , the critical rayleigh number and the structure of the critical eigenmodes \n have been studied for small aspect ratio containers .    from dynamical transition and pattern formation point of view , ma and wang @xcite proved that under some general boundary conditions , the problem always undergoes a dynamic transition to an attractor @xmath4 as the rayleigh number @xmath5 crosses the first critical rayleigh number @xmath0 . \n they also proved that the bifurcated attractor , homological to @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the number of critical eigenmodes .    in the 2-d setting that we consider , \n @xmath2 is either 1 or 2 and the latter case can only happen at the critical length scales where two modes with wave numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 become critical simultaneously . \n when @xmath9 , the structure of @xmath4 is trivial which is merely a disjoint union of two attracting steady states . \n thus our task in this paper is to classify the structure of the attractor when @xmath3 . \n this has been studied recently in @xcite for the 3d rayleigh - bnard problem where the boundaries were assumed to be free - slip for the velocity and the wave numbers of the critical modes were assumed to be equal . \n the main mathematical challenge in this paper is due to the no - slip boundary conditions since the separation of variables for the linear eigenvalue problem which works in the free - slip case is not possible anymore . to overcome this difficulty , \n the main approach for our study is to combine rigorous analysis and numerical computation using spectral method . \n as we know , spectral methods have long been used to address the hydrodynamic instability problems . \n in fact , in his seminal work @xcite , orszag studied the classical orr - sommerfeld linear instability problem using a chebyshev - tau method . in this paper , to treat the linear eigenvalue problem , we employ a legendre - galerkin method where compact combinations of legendre polynomials , called generalized jacobi polynomials , satisfying all the boundary conditions are used as trial functions . \n the main advantage of our legendre - galerkin method is that the resulting matrices are sparse which allows a very efficient and accurate solution of the linearized problem ; see also hill \n straughan @xcite and gheorghiu  dragomirescu @xcite . \n once the eigenpairs of the linear problem are identified , the transition analysis is carried out by reducing the infinite dimensional system to the center manifold in the first two critical eigendirections . \n the coefficients of this reduced system are calculated numerically . \n our main results are described below . \n we first classify the eigenmodes into four classes according to their parities using the symmetry of the problem . \n then we numerically show that the first two unstable modes are always parity class one or two \n . then we study the transition near the critical length scales where two eigenvalues become positive simultaneously . \n next , we rigorously prove that the local attractor at small supercritical rayleigh numbers is in fact homeomorphic to the circle which has four or eight steady states with half of them as stable points and the rest as saddle points \n . the critical eigenmodes are always bifurcated steady states on the attractor and when the attractor has eight steady states , the mixed modes which are superpositions of the critical eigenmodes are also bifurcated . \n second , let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the two largest eigenvalues of the linearized problem . we find that a small neighborhood of @xmath10 = @xmath12 in the @xmath10@xmath11 plane can be separated into several sectors with different asymptotical structures . in particular , we find that there is a critical prandtl number @xmath13 for the first two critical length scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that for @xmath16 , there is a sector in this plane for which mixed modes are stable fixed points of the attractor . for @xmath17 , \n the mixed modes are never stable and instead there is a sector in this plane in which both of the critical eigenmodes coexist as stable steady states . in this case , the initial conditions determine which one of these eigenmodes will be realized . \n the critical prandtl number is around @xmath18 for the first critical length scale @xmath14 and around @xmath19 for the second critical length scale @xmath15 . for higher critical length scales we found that mixed modes are never stable points of the attractor . \n third , recently ma \n wang has developed the dynamic transition theory to study transition and bifurcation problems in nonlinear sciences ; see @xcite . \n this paper is a first attempt to combine this theory with the numerical tools of the spectral methods to study the detailed structure of the transition and pattern formation . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the governing equations and the functional setting of the problem is discussed . in section 3 , \n linear eigenvalue problem is studied . \n section 4 states the main theorem . \n section 5 is devoted to the proof of the main theorem . in section 6 , \n we demonstrate a method to compute the coefficients of the reduced system . \n and the last section discusses the results obtained by our analysis . \n two dimensional thermal convection with no - slip , perfectly conducting boundaries can be modeled by the boussinesq equations . the governing equations on the rectangular domain @xmath20 read as @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the velocity field , @xmath23 is the temperature field and @xmath24 is the pressure field . \n these fields represent a perturbation around the motionless state with a linear temperature profile . \n the dimensionless numbers are the prandtl number pr and the rayleigh number r which is also the control parameter . \n @xmath25 represents the unit vector in the z - direction . \n the equations are supplemented with no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity and perfectly conducting boundary conditions for the temperature . \n @xmath26    for the functional setting , \n we define the relevant function spaces : @xmath27 for @xmath28 , let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be defined by @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting the leray projection onto the divergence - free vectors . \n the equations  supplemented with initial conditions can be put into the following abstract ordinary differential equation : @xmath33    for results concerning the existence and uniqueness of solutions of , we refer to foias , manley , and temam @xcite .    finally for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 \n we define the following trilinear forms . @xmath37 \n we first study the eigenvalue problem @xmath38 which reads as @xmath39 below we list some of the properties of this eigenvalue problem .    * \n the linear operator @xmath40 is symmetric . \n hence the eigenvalues @xmath41 are real and the eigenfunctions @xmath42 are orthogonal with respect to @xmath43inner product . \n moreover there is a sequence @xmath44 such that @xmath45 . \n @xmath46 is found by setting @xmath47 in . in this case \n the problem becomes an eigenvalue problem with @xmath48 as the eigenvalue . \n * we have @xmath49 which can be seen by computing the derivative of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath5 at @xmath50 . \n @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ith eigenfunction . also at @xmath50 , by the third equation in @xmath53 as @xmath54 . plugging these into and integrating by parts \n , we see that @xmath55 * we denote the critical rayleigh number @xmath56 . \n that is @xmath57 @xmath2 in does not depend on the prandtl number pr but only on @xmath58 . to see this , \n one makes the change of variable @xmath59 so that the solution of for the eigenvalue of @xmath47 is independent of pr . by simplicity of the first eigenvalue ( see theorem 3.7 in ma  wang @xcite ) , for almost every value of @xmath58 except a discrete set of values , @xmath2 in is 1 . \n the linear equations satisfy several discrete symmetries which may be found from the known non - trivial groups of continuous lie symmetries of the field equations ; see ( hydon@xcite , marques  lopez \n blackburn @xcite ) \n . however , for the problem we consider , it can be easily verified that the linear equations have reflection symmetries about the horizontal and vertical mid - planes of the domain . \n thus we can classify the solutions of the linear problem into four classes with different parities which are as defined in table  [ tab : parity ] where , for example , @xmath63 means that @xmath64 is odd in the @xmath65-direction and even in the @xmath66-direction .                      y.  kato and k.  fujimura , _ prediction of pattern selection due to an interaction between longitudinal rolls and transverse modes in a flow through a rectangular channel heated from below _ \n , physical review e * 62 * ( 2000 ) , no .  1 , 601 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1987196974278, "RequestID": "e7093d3598ac05d1c08b90ffb92b0727769b2be6", "TotalTokens": 2397}

vectors and dirac spinors in terms of massless two - component weyl - spinors . \n their use divides the task into smaller , more manageable pieces . also a decomposition inspired by supersymmetry proved to be useful , where the particles running around the loop are reexpressed in terms of supermultiplets . in a second step \n the cut technique and factorization in collinear limits are used to constrain the analytic form of the partial amplitudes .    as an example \n we explain in more detail the cut technique @xcite , which is based on unitarity . to obtain the coefficients of the basic box , triangle or bubble integrals \n one considers the cuts in all possible channels . \n each phase -

trivial contributions to the spatial axial torsion component and to the time component of the torsion vector . \n hence , the spin angular momentum tensor induced by this matter source satisfies homogeneity and isotropy . \n the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath43 for the dark spinor matter is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 . \n this completes the formulation of the cosmological field equations . \n next , we investigate the qualitative behavior of the equations of motion .    the geometrical part of the cosmological field equations  ( [ gtt])([gxx ] ) can , for example , be read off from  @xcite ( cf their action @xmath70 ) which we verified . in ref . \n @xcite , where @xmath71 was assumed , the geometry parameter @xmath72 was redefined to include the remaining torsion by @xmath73 , see also  @xcite . \n the complete set of field equations can be reduced to a single first order differential equation in the following manner . \n first of all , all torsion functions in the field equations are written in terms of the spin tensor  ( [ eq : hf ] ) , thereby eliminating torsion @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the matter field @xmath74 . \n next , we can use eq . \n ( [ gtt ] ) and the derivative of that equation to find expressions for @xmath75 and @xmath76 which are expressed entirely in terms of the matter field @xmath74 . \n we analyze these equations qualitatively and solve them numerically .    for the hubble parameter @xmath77 from eq . \n ( [ gtt ] ) we find @xmath78 next , the terms with @xmath76 , @xmath75 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are eliminated for @xmath74 in the spatial component of the field equation which results in @xmath79    positivity of the square root requires @xmath80 . \n this implies that the sign of the first derivative of the field can not change its sign and hence the field value is a decreasing function of time and in fact quickly approaches zero . \n when this happens , the hubble parameter asymptotes to a constant value and the universe expands according to @xmath81 .    to see this behavior of the solutions qualitatively , \n let us expand eqs . \n ( [ eq : dy1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) about @xmath82 which leads to @xmath83 and therefore we find that a period of accelerated expansion is an attractor solution of this system of equations . \n taking into account eq . \n ( [ eq : hf ] ) , we also find that the torsion of spacetime is quickly decreasing and approaching zero as the universe expands . \n such a behavior of the torsion is not unexpected , see e.g.  @xcite . \n spinors and inflation in the context of torsion theories have received much attention in the past  @xcite . \n it should be pointed out , however , that matter sources considered previously violate the cosmological principle . \n we numerically solve the first order differential equation  ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) and use this solution to find the evolution of the hubble parameter , we plot the hubble parameter in fig . \n [ fig1]a , which approaches to a constant for different initial conditions of the field . in fig . \n [ fig1]b the torsion function @xmath65 is plotted for the same numerical solutions .     for @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n initial conditions of the matter field are @xmath86 , @xmath87blue ( short dashed ) , red ( dashed ) , ( medium dashed ) yellow and green ( long dashed ) @xmath88,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] for @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n initial conditions of the matter field are @xmath86 , @xmath87blue ( short dashed ) , red ( dashed ) , ( medium dashed ) yellow and green ( long dashed ) @xmath88,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    . \n [ fig1 ]    in order to give a qualitative statement about the decay rate of the torsion , in fig . \n [ fig3 ] we plot the torsion function @xmath65 as a function of the number of @xmath89-foldings . \n we assume the total number of @xmath89-foldings to be sixty .     for @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n initial condition is @xmath90.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    therefore , the torsion contribution of the spacetime becomes negligible after approximately four @xmath89-foldings . \n we identified a matter source whose spin - angular momentum tensor is compatible with the cosmological principle . \n we then solved the resulting field equations of einstein - cartan theory . \n this matter source consists of the eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator , which we refer to as a dark spinor field . \n it couples to all irreducible parts of torsion and therefore leads to an interesting coupling of matter and geometry . \n this matter source is also naturally dark in that it can only interact via the higgs mechanism or gravity . \n our solutions of the field equations show that torsion does vanish quickly ( approximately after a few e - foldings ) and that the hubble parameter has a constant value as an attractor . \n both features of the model fit very well into the standard model of inflationary cosmology in that a period of accelerated expansion is an attractor solution . \n it is worth noting that in einstein - cartan theory the spins of elementary particles are thought to be the primary sources of torsion , and it is therefore expected that on large sales and over time torsion should average out or decay , respectively . \n we speculate that some non - zero cosmological torsion has already been observed in the large scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) where torsion leaves its imprint only on the largest scales .", "StartTimeOffset": 2011568328552, "RequestID": "da16d18276595ac28d587d9016b4f062d8431394", "TotalTokens": 4111}
{"ContextTokens": 3422, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "landau s theory of fermi liquids has proven tremendously successful at describing a wide range of systems of interacting fermions . \n in particular , the theory legitimizes the free electron model by casting fermionic systems in terms of weakly - interacting quasiparticles . \n systems of electrons in 1d provide an intriguing example of departure from the landau fermi liquid paradigm , exhibiting non - fermi - liquid behavior for any finite strength of the electron - electron interaction.@xcite perhaps the simplest model of electrons in one dimension is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) , which comprises electrons on a uniform positively - charged background.@xcite    the strong correlation occurring in 1d ensures that the excitations are not electron - like quasiparticles , but are instead collective in nature . \n an appropriate description of the low - energy spectrum of the 1d heg comes from the theory of tomonaga and luttinger.@xcite there are several experimental signatures of the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid which distinguish it from the normal fermi liquid ; these are largely accessible to transport and tunneling experiments . for example , the conductivity of a 1d channel as a function of the temperature is expected to vary logarithmically in the presence of weak disorder for the fermi liquid , and as a power law for the tl liquid.@xcite analogous relations hold for the differential conductivity and the optical conductivity . \n also associated with the lack of quasiparticles in the tl liquid is spin - charge separation , whereby spin and charge excitations propagate at different characteristic velocities.@xcite    one - dimensional models are easy to envisage , but experimental observation of 1d behavior is potentially problematic . \n low - dimensional systems are never entirely independent of their 3d environment , leading to effects which have the potential to obscure the 1d behavior . \n furthermore , the presence of impurities has been shown to alter drastically the behavior of a tl liquid.@xcite however , even in manifestly 3d systems , behavior unambiguously characteristic of electrons in 1d arises surprisingly frequently . \n features associated with the luttinger model have been observed in organic conductors ( e.g. , tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane and the bechgaard salts),@xcite transition metal oxides,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite edge states in quantum hall liquids,@xcite semiconductor heterostructures,@xcite confined atomic gases,@xcite and atomic nanowires.@xcite theoretical work on electrons in 1d thus has a large region of potential applicability . \n the exactly - solvable luttinger model describes electrons moving in one dimension with short - range interactions and linear dispersion . \n studies with long - range interactions have found that the exponents and excitation velocities are nontrivially altered.@xcite one thus expects to be able to describe the 1d heg within the luttinger model framework , but the exact behavior of the parameters of the model is largely unclear . \n the interactions that we study here are long - ranged , possessing a @xmath1 coulombic tail . \n this is most applicable to systems where screening is a small effect , such as isolated metallic carbon nanotubes and semiconductor structures where there is negligible coupling to the substrate . \n the 1d heg has been studied with a variety of theoretical and computational approaches . \n the principal distinction between various studies is the choice of electron - electron interaction . \n the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath1 , which describes an infinitely - thin wire , is perhaps conceptually the simplest choice , although it is largely avoided in the literature@xcite in its original form due to the divergence at @xmath2 . instead \n , many previous authors have removed the singularity while retaining the long - range behavior by investigating interaction potentials of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a parameter related to the width of the wire . \n this interaction has been studied analytically@xcite and numerically.@xcite    otherwise , one can derive an effective 1d interaction by factorizing the wave function into longitudinal and transverse parts and assuming that the transverse component is the ( 2d ) single - particle ground state of the confining potential . \n the 1d interaction is then the matrix element of the 3d coulomb interaction with respect to the transverse eigenfunctions.@xcite an example of this is the harmonic wire , in which the transverse confinement is provided by a parabolic potential , leading to a gaussian density profile in the transverse plane . \n the harmonic wire has been studied with quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite variants of the singwi - tosi - land - sjlander approach,@xcite and the fermi hypernetted - chain approximation.@xcite    we have studied both the infinitely - thin wire and the harmonic wire using qmc . in this article \n we report qmc calculations of the momentum density ( md ) , energy , pair - correlation function ( pcf ) , and static structure factor ( ssf ) of the infinitely - thin wire at a variety of densities and system sizes . \n the md results in particular show the non - fermi - liquid character of the system and allow us to recover one of the tl parameters . \n the total energy data that we provide are exact and may be regarded as a benchmark for future work . \n we also present calculations of the md for the harmonic wire , again extracting one of the tl parameters . \n the rest of this paper is structured as follows : the models for which we perform our calculations are described in sec . \n [ sec : models ] . in sec.[qmc_details ] we outline qmc methods and provide the details of our approach . \n we report the ground state energies of both models in sec.[sec : energies ] and describe the pcfs in sec .  [ \n sec : pcf ] . in sec.[sec : ssf ] we give the ssfs that we find for the infinitely - thin wire and in sec . \n [ sec : md ] we give the mds for both models . \n we describe the procedure for estimating a parameter of the tl model in sec.[sec : ll_params ] . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec.[sec : conclusions ] . \n we use hartree atomic units ( @xmath5 ) throughout this article . \n the hamiltonians for both of the models we have studied may be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the madelung energy ( the interaction of a particle with its own background and periodic images ) , @xmath8 is the distance between electron @xmath9 and electron @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the ewald interaction ; this is the interaction of an electron at @xmath12 with another electron at @xmath13 , all of electron @xmath10 s periodic images , and @xmath14-th of the uniform positive background . \n the two models that we have studied differ in the @xmath11 and @xmath7 terms . \n the ewald interaction for the infinitely - thin wire may be written @xmath15 which is calculated in practice using an accurate approximation based on the euler - maclaurin summation formula ; see eq . \n ( 4.8 ) of ref . for details . \n the interaction of eq .  ( [ eq : inf_thin_int ] ) diverges as @xmath16 when @xmath17 . in higher dimensions , \n the divergence in the interaction energy is canceled by an equal and opposite divergence in the kinetic energy , so that nodes do not necessarily occur where two antiparallel spins occupy the same position.@xcite in the infinitely - thin 1d system , the curvature of the wave function is unable to compensate for the divergence in the interaction potential , so the trial wave function has nodes at all of the coalescence points for both parallel and antiparallel spin pairs . \n the result is that the ground state energy is independent of the spin - polarization and depends only on the density . in other words \n , the lieb - mattis theorem@xcite does not apply and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states are degenerate for the interaction of eq.([eq : inf_thin_int ] ) . \n we have examined only the fully spin - polarized case for the infinitely - thin wire . \n the second model we have studied describes electrons in a 2d confinement potential given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the width parameter and @xmath20 is the magnitude of the projection of the electron position onto the plane perpendicular to the axis of the wire . \n the ewald - like interaction for this model may be written as@xcite @xmath21\\cos(gnx_{ij } ) \\ ;

we optimized the free parameters in our wave function by unreweighted variance minimization@xcite and linear - least - squares energy minimization.@xcite dmc is a stochastic projector technique for solving the many - body schrdinger equation and generates configurations distributed according to the product of the trial wave function and its ground state component.@xcite dmc calculations of expectation values of operators that commute with the hamiltonian are in principle exact for systems in which the wave function nodes are known ; this is the case for both the infinitely - thin and harmonic wires . \n we used a slater - jastrow wave function for both systems , where the jastrow factor comprised two - body terms consisting of smoothly truncated polynomials and a sum of cosines with periodicity commensurate with that of the simulation cell.@xcite the orbitals in the slater determinant were plane waves with wave vectors up to @xmath25 for the paramagnetic systems and @xmath26 for the ferromagnetic systems . \n the orbitals were evaluated at quasiparticle coordinates related to the actual coordinates by a backflow transformation.@xcite backflow provides an efficient way of describing three - body correlations in the 1d heg , but leaves the exact nodal surface unchanged . \n one method for assessing the wave function quality is to examine the fraction of the correlation energy retrieved , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the hartree - fock energy , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dmc and vmc energies , respectively . \n we tested several types of wave function for the infinitely - thin wire with @xmath31 a.u . \n , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ; our vmc calculations retrieved @xmath34 of the correlation energy when we used a two - body jastrow factor and backflow transformations [ the error bars were @xmath35 a.u . ] , which is the type of wave function we use throughout this paper . while it is indeed the case that dmc is formally exact for the 1d heg , the quality of the trial wave function is important for the statistical efficiency of the dmc method and the accuracy with which expectation values of operators that do not commute with the hamiltonian may be computed \n .      the dmc energy did not change beyond statistical error upon varying the number of walkers between 640 and 2000 , so we used @xmath37 walkers in our calculations and assumed that population control bias is negligible . \n the dependence of the energy upon the dmc timestep @xmath38 was also investigated ; fig . \n [ fig : dtdmc ] shows that for small @xmath38 the energy is constant . \n we performed our calculations at a single timestep given by @xmath39 . \n this fairly conservative choice was made to ensure that time step bias is entirely negligible . \n the rms distance diffused by each electron in a single step was thus slightly less than @xmath40 . \n for the infinitely - thin wire , we used simulation cells containing 37 , 55 , 73 , and 99 particles subject to periodic boundary conditions for our calculations of the energy , pcf , and ssf . \n our md calculations for the infinitely - thin wire also used a much larger cell with @xmath41 . for the harmonic wire , we used cells with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and occasionally @xmath44 for the @xmath33 systems and cells with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath47 systems . \n previous work encountered difficulties in sampling different spin configurations of the harmonic wire for @xmath48 due to the presence of `` pseudonodes '' at the antiparallel coalescence points,@xcite although these problems were largely overcome by the use of lattice - regularized diffusion monte carlo ( lrdmc ) in ref .. the problem occurred because for strong , repulsive interactions the wave function can become small when two antiparallel spins approach one another . combined with a small time step this can lead to simulations where opposite spins exchange positions infrequently and the space of spin configurations is explored very inefficiently . \n use of a small time step is a necessary part of the algorithm of projector methods like dmc . \n we have avoided ergodicity problems by using vmc to study the harmonic wire ; in the vmc method there is no restriction other than ergodicity on the transition probability density and one may propose moves however one wishes provided that the acceptance probability is modified accordingly . \n we use electron - by - electron sampling with the transition probability density given by a gaussian centered on the initial electron position . \n the vmc `` time step '' in fact bears no relation to real time and is simply the variance of the transition probability density . in practice , \n the unmodified time steps ( chosen to achieve a @xmath49 acceptance ratio ) used in vmc are usually large enough to eliminate ergodicity problems , although we found some cases where it was necessary to enforce a lower limit on the width of the transition probability density . \n table [ table : spinexchange ] shows the frequency with which electrons changed positions in our simulations for both high and low density systems with strong and weak confinement . \n .frequency with which electrons paths cross in our vmc simulations of the harmonic wire . \n the quantity @xmath50 is the proportion of proposed single - electron moves that result in a change in the ordering of the particles . \n a typical calculation comprises between @xmath51 and @xmath52 proposed single - electron moves . \n the data shown are for @xmath45 . \n [ table : spinexchange ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]                                        z.  yao , c.  dekker , and p.  avouris , _ electrical transport through single - wall carbon nanotubes _ \n , in m. s.  dresselhaus , g.  dresselhaus , and p.  avouris , eds . , _ \n carbon nanotubes :  synthesis , structure , properties and applications _ \n ( springer , 2001 ) . \n nanotubes at low temperatures h.  ishii , h.  kataura , h.  shiozawa , h.  yoshioka , h. otsubo , y.  takayama , t.  miyahara , s.  suzuki , y.  achiba , m.  nakatake , t.  narimura , m.  higashiguchi , k.  shimada , h.  namatame , and m. taniguchi , nature * 426 * , 540 ( 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2022054945774, "RequestID": "9bdc0abc1d0f1055141d2ddbd635e6be71d94a8f", "TotalTokens": 3599}

{"ContextTokens": 3397, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "a usual josephson tunnel junction , the current @xmath3 passing through the junction is related to the phase difference @xmath4 between the two superconductors by @xcite @xmath5 the equilibrium phase difference is zero in the absence of current ( current is also zero when @xmath6 , but this corresponds to the maximum of the josephson energy rather than a minimum ) . the simple relation ( [ i1 ] ) should be replaced with a more complicated one @xcite , @xcite in the case of constriction junctions , but the equilibrium phase difference will still be at @xmath7 .    a conventional dc - squid consists of a superconducting ring with two ordinary josephson junctions on its opposite arms . \n the total current passing through the squid is the sum of the currents crossing each of the josephson junctions . as a result of interference between the two currents , the total current - phase relation depends on the flux @xmath8 threading the ring . \n in particular , the critical current ( the maximum current allowed before going to non - stationary state with finite voltage drop across the junction ) is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is related to the external flux @xmath8 threading the loop through @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the flux quantum , @xmath13 the planck constant , and @xmath14 the charge of electron . here \n we neglect the self - inductance of the loop . \n notice that @xmath10 in eq . \n ( [ ic0 ] ) has period @xmath15 which corresponds to one flux quantum . at small @xmath10 , the relation ( [ ic0 ] ) \n is almost flat ( @xmath16 ) ; consequently , the sensitivity of the measurement of small fluxes is low . \n moreover , the critical current does not depend on the direction of the magnetic field . to avoid this problem \n , one can apply a biasing flux to move the working point of the squid away from the flat region . \n however , this biasing flux increases the noise as well as the complexity of the device and sometimes can have unwanted influence on the measured system . \n therefore , it is desirable to shift the working point of the squid away from the flat region without applying an external magnetic field . \n this is possible by replacing one of the josephson junctions with a junction with non - zero equilibrium phase difference . a dc - squid with a @xmath2-phase difference between the equilibrium phases of the two josephson junctions \n has already been studied @xcite . here \n we propose another type of squid ( we call it a @xmath1-squid ) with the equilibrium phase difference of @xmath1 between the junctions . \n the frustration caused by the two junctions produces the desired shift of the working point . in the next section \n we introduce such a device using high @xmath0 superconducting grain boundary junctions . in section \n iii we study the @xmath1-squid using a simple model . \n section iv is devoted to the quasiclassical calculation of the current in the @xmath17-wave structure and demonstrating agreement with the simple model of section ii . \n finally , we summarize our results in section v. \n in high @xmath0 superconductors , because of the @xmath17-wave symmetry of the order parameter , the current - phase relations are nontrivial and generally depend on the orientations of the order parameters on both sides of the junction @xcite , @xcite . \n if we keep only the first two harmonics , we can write the current - phase relation as @xmath18 when @xmath19 the equilibrium phase will occur at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is neither 0 nor @xmath2 . \n in particular , when the first harmonic vanishes , the equilibrium phase difference happens at @xmath22 . \n these types of junctions , known as @xmath1-junctions , can be realized at the grain boundary junction between two @xmath17-wave superconductors with crystalline orientations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with respect to the grain boundary . \n at such a junction ( known as an asymmetric junction ) , there is an exact cancellation of the first harmonic and the second harmonic dominates the current @xcite , @xcite . \n these junctions have been realized and tested experimentally @xcite . \n a symmetric junction can also be made with @xmath24 misorientation angle by choosing -22.5@xmath25 and @xmath26 crystalline orientations at the two sides . \n this junction is very different from the asymmetric one ; specifically , the exact cancellation of the first harmonic does not occur in this case @xcite . in a realistic junction with non - ideal transparency and roughness at the boundary , the second harmonic gets suppressed by the boundary imperfections more strongly than the first harmonic and , as a result , the latter dominates the current . \n this leads to a conventional junction ( 0-junction ) with the usual current - phase relation of eq . \n ( [ i1 ] ) . \n these junctions have also been studied experimentally @xcite .    by combining symmetric and asymmetric junctions \n , we can have a squid with @xmath1 equilibrium phase difference between the junctions . \n 1 illustrates such an structure . \n first we study this system using a simple model . \n the more realistic numerical simulation of the system using a quasiclassical model will come after that . \n consider a dc - squid , consisting of a conventional and a @xmath1 josephson junction , with current - phase relations @xmath27 respectively . to simplify the calculations \n , we will assume @xmath28 . \n the more general case of arbitrary @xmath29 can also be treated as the solutions are similar . \n we also neglect the self inductance of the ring in our calculations . when there is a flux @xmath8 threading the squid ring , the phases at two junctions are related by @xmath30 . \n the total current passing through the squid is then given by @xmath31 . \n \\label{cpr}\\ ] ] the critical current is the maximum current in this current - phase relation . to find the critical current , one has to find the solutions to the equation @xmath32 . \n these solutions are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being an integer number . substituting into eq . \n ( [ cpr ] ) we find the maximum current to be    @xmath36    here `` max '' means the maximum of the three cases with @xmath37 . \n 2 shows the flux dependence of the critical current using eq . \n ( [ ic ] ) . \n notice that the periodicity of the function is @xmath2 ( half a flux quantum ) although the period of the argument of the sine - functions in eq . \n ( [ ic ] ) is actually @xmath38 . \n the @xmath2-periodicity of eq . \n ( [ ic ] ) is a result of the symmetry @xmath39 in eq.([cpr ] ) . in other words , changing the applied flux by half a flux quantum shifts the current - phase relation by @xmath2 and therefore does not change the critical current . \n this is evidently different from the ordinary squid for which the period is @xmath15 ( one flux quantum ) . \n the important feature here is that the @xmath40 does not coincide with the maximum of the function as it does in usual the dc - squids . \n therefore , an increase in sensitivity for measuring small fluxes is gained . \n moreover , the direction of the flux is also detectable by measuring the critical current . \n as was mentioned , the current - phase relations in @xmath17-wave grain boundary junctions does not usually have the simple forms of eq.([cp ] ) . \n one has to find the realistic current - phase relation using a microscopic theory , taking into account the imperfections of the boundary . \n here we use a quasiclassical model to study this system . \n the equations we solve are the eilenberger equations @xcite    @xmath41=0 ,   \\label{eqa1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the superconducting order parameter and @xmath44 is the matrix green s function , which depends on the electron velocity on the fermi surface @xmath45 , the coordinate @xmath46 , and the matsubara frequency @xmath47 , with @xmath35 being an integer number and @xmath48 the temperature . \n we also need to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath49 in general , @xmath43 depends on the direction of @xmath50 and is determined by the self - consistency equation    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the interaction potential . \n solution of matrix equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) together with ( [ gapeq ] ) determines the current density @xmath53 in the system    @xmath54    in two dimensions , @xmath55 is the 2d density of states and @xmath56 is the averaging over directions of the 2d vector @xmath57 . \n the transparency of the boundary is described by the parameter @xmath58 @xcite , @xcite . to incorporate the roughness , we assume a narrow scattering region of width @xmath17 between the two superconductors @xcite , @xcite . the roughness is therefore parameterized by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mean free path of the quasiparticles in this scattering region . in our calculations \n , we use @xmath61 which are reasonable values for a realistic system . \n different widths , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are chosen for the two arms and the ratio of the widths is denoted by @xmath64 . \n the details of our numerical method for solving these equations is given in @xcite . \n 3 displays the current - phase relation at different values of the external flux @xmath10 for a squid structure with @xmath65 . at @xmath40 , \n the graph has two local maxima , which is the signature of having a mixture of first and second harmonics . \n as @xmath10 is increased , the two maxima become closer and at some value of @xmath10 , they will be equal . at this point , \n the global maximum jumps from one local maximum to another . \n this actually explains the sharp kinks at the minimum positions in fig .  2 ( and also in fig .  4 ) \n 4 shows the critical current as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath66 . \n one can immediately see the similarities between these graphs and the one obtained from our simple model in fig .  2 . \n specifically , the maxima again occur with period of @xmath2 , although the @xmath2-periodicity is not exact here ( the real period is @xmath15 ) . \n the maximum of the critical current is shifted from @xmath40 , as was desired . \n one can also see from fig .  4 that the maximum range of variation of @xmath67 is obtained at @xmath65 . \n this is actually the optimal ratio of the widths for squid design . \n we proposed and studied a dc - squid which has @xmath1 difference between the equilibrium phases at its two junctions . the @xmath1 phase difference is easily obtained using the properties of high @xmath0 grain boundary symmetric and asymmetric junctions . \n the frustration caused by this phase difference moves the working point of the squid to a point at which the maximum critical current is obtained at a non - zero external flux . \n this will increase the sensitivity of the squid at small magnetic field , with a dependence on the direction of the flux , without any external biasing coil . \n we introduced a simple model and compared its results with the ones obtained from a microscopic quasiclassical model . \n the agreement between the two models is acceptable . \n we found that the @xmath1-squid exhibits other new features , different from a conventional squid or a @xmath2-squid , among those is the @xmath68 ( instead of @xmath69 ) periodicity of the critical current . \n we find the optimal ratio between the widths of the two arms to be @xmath65 . \n the authors are grateful to a.m. zagoskin , e. ilichev , and j.p . \n hilton for stimulating discussions \n .    1 m. tinkham , _ introduction to superconductivity _ , 2nd ed . \n new york : mcgraw -

{"ContextTokens": 3846, "GeneratedTokens": 61, "SynthesizedBody": "it is a well known fact  @xcite that a point charge in a static gravitational field experiences an electrostatic force due to the deformation of its electric field lines produced by the geometry of space -

theory in eleven dimensions ) , but also the more phenomenological recent developments of `` braneworld '' scenarios  @xcite have motivated the study of other gravitational theories in four - dimensions . \n in fact , the origin of the ( gravitational ) scalar field can be many : the scalar field arising from the size of the compactified internal space in the kaluza - klein theory ; the zero mode ( dilaton field ) described by a symmetric second - rank tensor behaving as space - time metric at low energy level in the closed string theory ; the scalar field in a brane world scenario ; and more  @xcite . in any case \n , clearly , if gravity is essentially scalar -

scale effects and to show these modifications to the case of a scalar - tensor cosmic string . in this work \n we find the self - energy and self - force on a line source in the presence of a scalar - tensor cosmic string . \n we look both at the case of the source being a line with uniform charge density or a constant current and , in doing this , we get information of both the electric and magnetic self -

newtonian parameter which expresses the coupling between matter and the dilaton field and @xmath8 is the value of the dilaton field evaluated by solar systems experiments  @xcite . \n since our problem is effectively two -

dimensional . \n so , the electrostatic energy per unit length is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the two - dimensional green function in the space described by metric ( [ 3 ] ) .    by substituting ( [ 5 ] ) in ( [ 7 ] ) and taking the limit @xmath20 the electrostatic energy per unit length is obtained as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the regularized green function @xmath23.\\ ] ] here , @xmath24 is the euclidean green function , solution of the two -

energy survives in the absence of the cosmic string . \n it has been shown by grats and garcia  @xcite that , since any two - dimensional metric can be put in the form given by eq . \n ( [ 3 ] ) , the laplacian green function in the corresponding space can be expanded in terms of the geodesic distance @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 + \\omega(\\vec{r } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( 2\\sigma)\\frac{t^{a}t^{b}\\theta_{ab}}{24}+o(\\sigma^{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the squared geodesic distance between the points @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the tangent vector to the geodesic at point @xmath30 , and the tensor @xmath33 has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the covariant derivative and @xmath36 is the metric tensor . \n since the euclidean green function can be written as @xmath37,\\ ] ] it turns out that  @xcite @xmath38 this equation shows explicitly that the self -

forces approaches that of the corresponding general relativity ( gr ) results @xcite : @xmath54 this behavior is seen in figure 1 for @xmath55 . \n note in figure 1 that the force changes its sign at some @xmath56 which can be obtained from eq . \n ( [ frmin ] ) with the condition @xmath57 , @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    differently from the gr result which is always repulsive , the scalar - tensor ( st ) electric force is attractive in the range @xmath59 . \n ( [ prop ] ) implies a similar analysis to @xmath60 , with inverted behavior : the magnetic force is attractive for @xmath61 and repulsive for @xmath59 . \n @xcite , one of us investigated the internal nature of ordinary cosmic vortices in some scalar - tensor extensions of gravity . \n solutions were found for which the dilaton field condenses inside the vortex core . \n these solutions could be interpreted as raising the degeneracy between the eigenvalues of the effective stress - energy tensor , namely the energy per unit length @xmath62 and the tension @xmath63 , by picking a privileged spacelike or timelike coordinate direction ; in the latter case , a _ phase frequency threshold _ occured that is similar to what is found in ordinary neutral current - carrying cosmic strings . \n it has been found that the dilaton contribution for the equation of state , once averaged along the string worldsheet , vanishes , leading to an effective nambu - goto behavior of such a string network in cosmology , _ \n i.e. _ on very large scales . \n it has been shown also that , on small scales , the energy per unit length and tension depend on the string internal coordinates in such a way as to permit the existence of centrifugally supported equilibrium configuration , also known as _ vortons _ , whose stability , depending on the very short distance ( unknown ) physics , can lead to catastrophic consequences on the evolution of the universe . \n this statement is in a remarkable agreement with our present result . \n indeed , in this work we determined the electric and magnetic self - interaction of line sources in the presence of a scalar - tensor cosmic string . when the source is placed away from the defect ( long scales ) , the self - interaction is quite similar to the result obtained in the general relativity framework . on the other hand , near the defect , the dilaton field introduces interesting new phenomena : a forbidden region @xmath64 and an inversion of the electric ( magnetic ) self - force behavior , going from repulsive ( attractive ) in the far region to attractive ( repulsive ) in the near region . \n our main conclusion is that the coupling between a cosmic string and a scalar - tensor gravity is shown to induce effects along the string comparable to a current flow in the sense that the resulting effective stress - energy tensor eigenvalues , the energy per unit length @xmath62 and tension @xmath63 , were no longer degenerate , due to the presence of the dilaton . \n our model reproduces an abrikosov flux tube coupled to a disclination in a condensed matter system @xcite . \n we plan to continue our future works in this direction . \n 99 c. m. de witt and b. s. de witt , physics 1 ( 1964 ) 3 ; w. g. unruh , proc . \n london a 348 ( 1976 ) 447 . \n a. vilenkin , phys . \n d 20 ( 1979 ) 373 . \n b. linet , phys . \n d 33 ( 1986 ) 1833 . \n a. g. smith , in proceedings of symposium on the formation and evolution of cosmic string , edited by g. w. gibbons , s. w. hawking , and t. vachaspati ( cambridge university press , cambridge , england , 1990 ) . \n e. r. bezerra de mello , v. b. bezerra , c. furtado and f. moraes , phys . \n d 51 ( 1995 ) 7140 . \n m. b. green , j. h. schwarz and e. witten , superstring theory ( cambridge university press , cambridge , england , 1987 ) . \n n.  arkani -

{"ContextTokens": 1853, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "presently , few testable theoretical predictions or observational diagnostics exist to robustly constrain whether grb outflows are initially dominated by particles or poynting flux , and what fraction of the particles are baryons vs. pair plasma @xcite . \n whatever the case close to the engine , at large distances observations imply that particles are accelerated to highly relativistic velocities and dominate the energy budget . \n magnetic reconnection is a plausible mechanism of particle acceleration in grb jet plasma if the free energy is carried by magnetic fields . \n reconnection has mainly been studied in the lab , the solar corona , and particularly the earth magnetosphere , which produced the ` geospace environmental modeling ( gem ) reconnection challenge ' : here a simplified reconnection problem was studied and compared using several mhd , hybrid and pic codes @xcite . \n much less attention has been paid either analytical or numerical to the fundamental reconnection mechanisms in either the relativistic regime or for a pair plasma . \n reconnection in a ( relativistic ) pair plasma is very different from an electron - ion plasma . for the latter , the difference in skin depth between the electrons and ions and the corresponding scale lengths of the current sheet and reconnection region play an important role ; \n reconnection is facilitated by whistler modes , which can be related to the hall current in the non - ideal generalized ohm s law . in a pair plasma , however , the contributions from the electron and positron equations of motion to the hall current cancel and whistler waves do nt exist @xcite . \n the non - ideal term in ohm s law that allows field lines to reconnect is an effective enhanced resistivity related to the electron and positron pressure tensors and the tearing mode is the dominant instability .    to improve our understanding of magnetic reconnection for conditions applicable to grb outflows we are performing simulations with a fully explicit and highly parallelized relativistic pic code , _ osiris _ @xcite . by tuning the plasma parameters from non to highly relativistic values and comparing results for a pure pair plasma and a plasma with an increasing proton fraction , \n we can obtain different particle acceleration spectra to be used to construct observational diagnostics of the jet s nature . \n this complements the existing pic simulation work in the grb outflow context which has focused on shock acceleration via the weibel instability in ion - electron plasmas @xcite , or magnetic pulse acceleration without magnetic reconnection @xcite . \n spectra from each of these classes of simulation should ultimately be compared . \n a simple geometry for studying reconnection is the harris current sheet , where two regions of nearly uniform magnetic field of opposite sign are driven into a thin current sheet by their own magnetic pressure . \n if the plasma can deviate from ideal mhd , the field lines can slip and reconnect at one or more @xmath0-points , after which the reconnected field lines are strongly bent . \n when those field lines straigten to minimise their tension , particles in the outflow region are accelerated . \n free magnetic energy is thus converted to particle energy in the process . using the harris configuration \n , we can compare to the results in the gem reconnection challenge @xcite and its extension to pair plasma@xcite . \n the simulations presented here are for a pair plasma and have two current sheets to facilitate use of periodic boundary conditions on all walls . in each half - plane \n we have an initial magnetic field normalized as : @xmath1 \\tanh(x_{2}/a)\\hat{x}_{1}$ ] , where @xmath2 is the thickness of the current sheet and @xmath3 is the skin depth in terms of the plasma frequency @xmath4 and we choose a non - relativistic ) alfvn velocity @xmath5 . in a steady state \n ( @xmath6 ) we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 with thermal velocity spread @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 . a small uniform particle density @xmath11 is added to replenish the accelerated particles leaving the reconnection region and the total number of particles is @xmath12 \n . the spatial and time resolutions are @xmath13 and @xmath14 with typical runs exceeding @xmath15 . \n most simulations use a @xmath16 grid of dimension @xmath17 , but for some we double the length along the current - sheet to reduce the effect of periodic boundaries . to quickly force the system into the non - linear regime , sometimes we impose an initial perturbation , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . \n figure  [ f1 ] ( left ) shows the magnetic field at @xmath20 when the reconnection has reached a quasi steady state , and the reconnection electric field is well developed . \n this simulation was started from a perturbed equilibrium magnetic field . \n the electric field at the @xmath0-points is @xmath21 , which is slightly lower than in @xcite and @xcite . \n when we start from numerical noise , the secondary tearing mode quickly develops , and the magnetic field fragments into a series of small @xmath0- and @xmath22-points that move under the magnetic pressure and finally merge into one dominant @xmath0-point on each current - sheet . the right panel shows the in- and outflow velocities ( @xmath23-@xmath24 ) around the @xmath0-points . \n one can see the particles flowing in with inflow velocity from @xmath25 and being accelerated along the @xmath26 axis . in this figure \n the effect of the periodic boundary conditions is already becoming visible with accelerated particles re - entering the box , but they re not yet influencing the reconnection region . \n in all simulations of non - relativistic reconnection we ve seen in the literature , the fluctuating electric field is either neglected by not evolving the displacement current ( common in mhd codes ) , or artificially eliminated at each time - step @xcite . \n _ osiris _ does neither and evolves the full fields , including all electromagnetic wave modes . \n doing so reveals weak plane - wave like fluctuations in @xmath27 ( due partly to numerical noise , and partly to particles being allowed to cross the current sheet that do nt cancel out exactly ) . \n when this oscillating component has the ` wrong ' sign , the flow of plasma into the current sheet is impeded , and initially this component is strong enough to reverse the bulk plasma motion away from the current sheet . only during the wave - phase where @xmath27 has the proper sign do the particles flow into the current sheet . \n eventually , the @xmath0-points and a mean steady reconnection electric field develop and fast non - linear reconnection is achieved . \n the final in- and outflow velocities reached in our simulations are somewhat slower than in previous work , and the evolution to a steady - state takes a bit longer . \n currently , we are analysing larger runs on the nersc clusters using more particles , higher resolution , and larger aspect ratio along the sheet . furthermore , the implemented distribution functions in _ osiris _ are only valid in the mildly relativistic regime , so we re implementing the proper relativistic jttner - synge distribution \n . then we can proceed to vary the alfvn velocity arbitrarily , adding a small fraction of baryons , and 3d generalizations where possible . \n finally , we will calculate the radiation spectra . if the synchrotron cooling time is long compared to the reconnection rate , this can be done post - procees . \n if the cooling time is fast , but the plasma is optically thin to the produced radiation , we must calculate the radiation self - consistently at each time - step . \n differences in the spectra produced by reconnection in a magnetically dominated wind ( ac model @xcite ) , a magnetic pulse model , or shock - acceleration in a matter dominated model , will provide a useful observational diagnostic to distinguish between the three .    999 g.  drenkhahn and h.c . \n spruit , a&a , * 391 * ( 2002 ) 1141 e.  liang , ap&ss * 298 * ( 2005 ) 211 m.v \n .   medvedev , ap&ss * 307 * ( 2007 ) 245 h.b.j . \n koers and d. giannios , a&a accepted ( 2007 ) j.  birn et al . , _ j. geophys . \n _ * 106 * ( 2001 ) 3715 e.g.  blackman and g.b . \n field , _ phys . \n _ * 71 * ( 1993 ) 3481 r.  fonseca et al . \n notes in comp . \n springer , heidelberg , * 2331 * ( 2002 ) 342 n.  bessho and a.  bhattacharjee , _ phys . \n * 95 * ( 2005 ) 245001", "StartTimeOffset": 2051722449660, "RequestID": "23d049f2e7e2f493e2a44bc6d850479282f9c701", "TotalTokens": 1978}
{"ContextTokens": 1389, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "in quantum mechanics the decay of two fragments is well determined by energy and momentum conservation laws . \n but the decay of three particles is a much more complicated issue . \n the energies of the decaying fragments are not fixed . \n the energy distribution of the three - body final state after the decay is an observable , and can be used to understand the structure of the initial state and the decay mechanism itself . on the other hand , \n the intermediate path connecting the initial and final states is not an observable . \n the only way to extract information about the decay mechanism is to try to understand the measurable final state by means of theoretical models . \n the decay is usually interpreted as either sequential via an intermediate configuration or direct to the continuum . \n the interpretations are often used to derive reaction rates for the inverse process in astrophysical environments . \n it is therefore important to have a reliable interpretation of the data . \n we have focused our attention on three - body decaying nuclei involved in stellar nucleosynthesis reactions , @xmath0c , @xmath1be and @xmath2be . \n for all three there are experimental data available that help us to test the validity of our theoretical model . \n the three -

body scattering data . \n on top of these interactions we include a structureless three - body potential of the form @xmath9 , fitted to reproduce the resonance energies . \n this potential is included because at short distances the structure of these nuclei is not necessarily of three - body character . \n the complex scaling method helps us to treat the resonances as if they were bound states . \n the many - body initial state resonance evolves into three clusters at large distances . \n the total angular momentum and parity @xmath10 is conserved in the process . \n this symmetry imposes constraints on the resulting momentum distributions . \n the energy distribution is the probability for finding a given particle at a given energy . \n it can be measured experimentally and is the only information that allows us to study the decay path , that can be either sequential or direct or a mixture . \n the information about the energy distributions of the fragments after the decay is contained in the large - distance part of the wave - function , which must be accurately computed . \n the single particle probability distributions are obtained after monte carlo integration of the absolute square of the large - distance wave - function . \n within this theoretical framework we have extensively studied the decay of the low - lying @xmath0c resonances @xcite . \n our results have been compared to recent experimental data @xcite with a high level of agreement . moreover , \n our suggestion to change the previously assigned spin and parity of the 13.35  mev state @xcite from @xmath11 to @xmath12 has been supported by the experimental community @xcite . \n we have studied the five lowest resonances of @xmath1be @xcite and compared them to the experimental data from @xcite . \n [ fig9 ] shows the angular distributions of these resonances , _ \n i.e. _ the probability for finding one of the decaying particles in a certain direction with respect to the direction formed by the other two . in all the cases \n we have removed the sequential decay via @xmath13be(@xmath14 ) . \n this kind of plot contains information about the angular momentum of the first particle relative to the centre - of - mass of the other two . \n we observe that the angular distribution patterns are different for different @xmath10 states . \n these features are clearly distinguishable , demonstrating that these observables can be used to determine the large - distance structure of these resonances . \n the initial state can still be determined only through the theoretical information about the dynamical evolution of the resonances . \n the @xmath2be is an unbound nucleus which has only two low - lying resonances , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . \n its decay has been recently measured @xcite and compared to theoretical predictions given by our formalism . \n we have not found any signatures of sequential decay of these resonances via intermediate two - body states . \n we show in fig . \n [ fig6 ] the angular distributions for the two resonances of @xmath2be . \n the upper panels can be compared directly to the experimental data from @xcite . \n they show that the @xmath7-particle prefers to come out perpendicular to the direction formed by the two protons . \n we have applied a general method to compute the momentum distributions of three - body decaying light - nuclei resonances . \n we have conjectured that the energy distributions of the decay fragments are insensitive to the initial many - body structure . \n the energy distributions are then determined by the energy and three - body resonance structure as obtained in a three - body cluster model . \n these momentum distributions are determined by the coordinate space wave - functions at large distances , which much be computed with a high accuracy . \n the method has been applied previously to the study of the decay of @xmath0c resonances with great success . in this contribution \n we have shown the angular distribution of the low -

{"ContextTokens": 2715, "GeneratedTokens": 86, "SynthesizedBody": "all confirmed experimental data acquired to date indicate the conservation of lepton numbers . \n this fact can be described by several different empirical laws @xcite , some of which follow additive and some obey multiplicative , parity - like , schemes . \n experiments have given no indication yet for favouring any of them . \n the standard model states for every lepton flavour a separate additively conserved quantum number \n . however , such lepton numbers have no status , unless their conservation can be associated with a local gauge invariance @xcite . \n mixings between different generations are well known in the quark sector and the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite relates the weak quark eigenstates with their mass eigenstates . \n a familiar example are the @xmath2-@xmath3 oscillations . at present \n we are left puzzled why leptons do not show any similar mixing . \n recent experimental hints for neutrino oscillations , which have a potential for changing this situation , are not covered here ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n many extensions to the standard model have been proposed and are presently discussed which try to explain further some of its not well understood features like e.g. parity violation in weak interaction or particle mass spectra . \n they are put by hand into this remarkable theoretical framework which appears to serve as an extremely robust description of all confirmed particle physics . \n lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) appears naturally in such models which include left - right - symmetry , supersymmetry , technicolor , grand unification , string theories , compositeness , and many others . \n they continue to stimulate experimental searches in a large range of energies . \n highest sensitivity has generally been reached in dedicated search experiments particularly on kaons ( @xmath4 ) and muons ( @xmath0 ) ( table [ lnv_limits ] ) , where also a high discovery potential for new physics exists @xcite , as well as in non accelerator experiments searching for neutrinoless double @xmath1-decay . \n the decays of heavier objects created in high energy collisions , however , can be observed less accurately . \n the progress in the @xmath4 and @xmath0 ( see sec . \n [ kaons ] and [ muons ] ) field is indicated in fig.[history ] which shows more than 10 decades of improvement since the first experiments in the late 1940 s . \n the highest recent gain in sensitivity is for muonium ( m=@xmath5 ) to antimuonium ( @xmath6=@xmath7 ) conversion due to a new , yet unused signature ( see sec . \n [ mmbar ] ) . \n it was noted already in the early 60ies that , e.g. the process @xmath10 is closely related to muonium - antimuonium conversion @xcite . \n indeed such scattering experiments were carried out at the princeton - stanford storage rings at stanford yielding the at the time best limit on the coupling constant @xmath11 @xcite . \n today , similar proposals have been made for scattering of high energy @xmath12 on @xmath12 , @xmath12 on @xmath13 , @xmath14 on @xmath14 and @xmath14 on @xmath15 @xcite . \n they were mainly discussed in connection with bileponic gauge bosons . \n even a lower limit for the cross section of the process @xmath16 was found , provided the sum of the light neutrino masses exceeds @xmath17 ev @xcite . \n pronounced resonances have been predicted particularly for such experiments at the next linear collider or the high energy end of a muon collider . \n + although lepton flavour conservation remains a mystery and searches for its violation were not blessed with a successful observation yet , both the theoretical and experimental work in this connection have led to a deeper understanding of particle interactions . \n one particular value of the experiments are their continuos contributions towards guiding theoretical developments by excluding various speculative models . \n zeldovitch , dan . \n ssr * 86 * , 505 ( 1952 ) b. pontecorvo , sov.phys.-jetp * 37 * , 1751 ( 1959 ) and sov . \n jetp * 6 * , 381 ( 1958 ) n. cabbibo and r. gatto , phys.rev.lett . \n * 5 * , 114 ( 1960 ) ;

adjacent terminals are short - circuited together , the resulting resistance value can be a multiple or a fraction of @xmath4 . \n fang  ( * ? ? ? \n * ( a ) ) experimentally investigated several connections achieving resistances values of @xmath5 with the same 6-terminal device at a single plateau . \n dc analytical modelling of double- and triple - series connections of single and twin devices was performed in  @xcite and  @xcite ; in  @xcite the analysis was extended to the ac regime . \n the modelling process is based on the ricketts - kemeny model  @xcite of the quantum hall device , or on its derived ones  @xcite . \n the above analyses were carried out by applying kirchhoff s laws to the chosen model with constraints given by the external connections . \n then , the resulting equations were solved to determine a particular four - terminal resistance ( or impedance ) . \n such analytical calculations can be tedious and error - prone , and numerical simulations can have problems of convergence  @xcite . \n therefore , only a few connection schemes of known practical relevance have been analysed in full .    in this paper \n , we propose a general approach for modelling the electrical behaviour of multiterminal qhe devices with external connections . \n this method is based on the use of the so - called indefinite admittance matrix . \n four - terminal resistances can then be determined from matrix equations depending on two matrices : one that represents the unconnected device ( or devices ) ; another that represents the external connections and that can be easily written by inspection . \n consider the @xmath6-terminal element @xmath7 of figure  [ fig : device_representation ] and let the terminal voltages @xmath8 be measured with respect to an arbitrary reference point @xmath9 ( datum node ) . \n we make the following assumptions :    1 . \n @xmath7 is linear and time - invariant . \n whenever @xmath7 is connected to an external network , the complete circuit is uniquely solvable . \n the sum of the terminal currents @xmath10 is identically zero , i.e.  @xmath11 . \n the terminal currents are invariant under a change of the reference point , i.e.  under the transformation @xmath12 .    by means of assumptions \n * a1 * and * a2 * , when @xmath7 is connected to an external network , we can write the relations between its terminal currents and voltages as @xmath13 where the admittance coefficients @xmath14 are complex quantities defined by the equation @xmath15 the set of equations   can be put in matrix form as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the column vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( t denotes the transpose operation ) , and @xmath21 is the matrix @xmath22 . \n this matrix , which has been called by shekel  @xcite the _ indefinite admittance matrix _ , has the following properties  @xcite :    1 . \n the sum of the elements of each column is identically zero , i.e.  @xmath23 for any @xmath24 . \n this property is a direct consequence of assumption * a3*. 2 . \n the sum of the elements of each row is identically zero , i.e.  @xmath25 for any @xmath26 . \n this property is a direct consequence of assumption * a4*. indeed , these first two properties imply that @xmath21 is a singular matrix . \n if its @xmath27th terminal is grounded , @xmath7 can be regarded as an @xmath28-port with port voltages @xmath29 . in this case , the non - singular @xmath30 _ short - circuit admittance matrix _ \n @xmath31 of the @xmath28-port can be obtained from @xmath21 by deleting the @xmath27th row and column . moreover , since @xmath32 is non - singular , it can be used to determine the @xmath30 _ open - circuit impedance matrix _ \n @xmath33 of the @xmath28-port  @xcite .    in the application of qhe devices to resistance and impedance metrology , one \n is usually concerned with the determination of four - terminal transfer resistances and impedances . with reference to figure  [ fig : impedances ] , we define the four - terminal impedance @xmath34 as the ratio of the open - circuit voltage @xmath35 to the current @xmath36 flowing into terminal @xmath26 and out of terminal @xmath24 , when all other terminals are open - circuited : @xmath37 throughout this work , impedances of the form @xmath38 , \n i.e. with one terminal in common , are referred to as three - terminal impedances , and that of the form @xmath39 , i.e. with two terminals in common , are referred to as two - terminal impedances . \n one way of determining @xmath34 from @xmath21 makes use of property  * p3 * above and is based on the fact that one can `` transform '' the @xmath6-terminal @xmath7 into an @xmath28-port by grounding one terminal , as shown in figure  [ fig : impedances_grounded ] for the @xmath27th terminal . in this case , the terminal pairs @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be considered as input ports , respectively driven by the currents @xmath36 and @xmath42 , while the terminal pairs @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be considered as output ports with port voltages @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so that the ratio @xmath47 can be easily determined from the open - circuit impedance matrix @xmath48 obtained from the application of property  * p3*. this method is described in detail in section  [ sec : ideal_device_connections ] by means of examples . \n a more straightforward , albeit more cumbersome , method of determining @xmath34 from @xmath21 is described in  @xcite . \n figure  [ fig : device_model_ideal ] shows the portion between terminals @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the ring - array dc equivalent circuit of an _ ideal _ @xmath6-terminal qhe device , as proposed by delahaye  @xcite . the magnetic flux density @xmath0 points out of the page : reversing @xmath0 , reverses the sign of the current - controlled voltage sources . \n applying kirchhoff s voltage law ( kvl ) to nodes @xmath49 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath50 yields @xmath53 where @xmath54 and it is assumed that @xmath55 . \n the above set of equations directly determines the indefinite admittance matrix @xmath56 of the ideal qhe device : @xmath57 which is an @xmath58 circulant matrix . \n as was pointed out by fang  @xcite and delahaye  @xcite , multiterminal qhe devices can be connected in different ways to obtain multiples and fractions of the quantised hall resistance . in this section , \n we describe how to analyse single - device connections by means of the indefinite admittance matrix . \n +    ( a )    ( b )    ( c )    consider the simple example of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](a ) , where a 6-terminal device is employed in a typical double - series connection with terminals 1,6 and 3,4 short - circuited . \n suppose that the two - terminal impedance @xmath59 is to be determined : this means , as shown in figure  [ fig : single_device_1](b ) , that one has to inject a current @xmath60 between terminals 1 and 4 and to measure the voltage @xmath61 to obtain @xmath62 . \n now , in order to determine @xmath59 , proceed as follow ( see  @xcite for details ) .    1 . \n ground one terminal . in the above example , for simplicity , we have chosen to ground terminal 4 , as shown in figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) . \n 2 .   choose a set @xmath63 of independent port voltages ( @xmath64 in figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) ) . \n in general , since short - circuiting terminals constraints the terminal voltages , it is @xmath65 . \n 3 .   write down the relations between the terminal voltages and the port voltages : since these relations are linear , they can be written in matrix form as @xmath66 where , in general , @xmath67 is an @xmath68 matrix and @xmath69 . for the circuit of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) , @xmath70 and therefore @xmath71 the corresponding port current vector @xmath72 \n is related to the terminal current vector @xmath17 by the equation @xmath73 so that the power flowing into the device is invariant , i.e.  @xmath74 . \n 4 .   determine the @xmath75 admittance matrix @xmath76 which relates the port current vector to the port voltage vector , @xmath77 . \n since at least one terminal is grounded , by virtue of * p3 * , @xmath32 is a non - singular short - circuit admittance matrix whose inverse is the open - circuit impedance matrix @xmath78 . for the circuit of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) , with @xmath79 , one obtains @xmath80 and @xmath81 5 . \n identify the input and the output ports . in the example of figure  [ fig : single_device_1](c ) \n , there are only one input port and one output port , and both coincide with port 1 . \n thus , @xmath82    a second , more significant , example is shown in figure  [ fig : single_device_2](a ) . \n this is one of the connections experimentally analysed by fang and stiles  ( * ? ? ? \n * ( a ) ) . in this case \n , suppose that the two - terminal impedance @xmath59 and the four - terminal impedance @xmath83 are to be determined . \n in particular , for @xmath59 , fang and stiles measured the value @xmath84 ( within few parts in @xmath85 ) . \n +    ( a )    ( b )    in figure  [ fig : single_device_2](b ) , following the method described above , we have grounded one of the terminals ( terminal 4 , again , to have one input port only ) and we have defined @xmath64 as port voltages . \n thus @xmath86 and @xmath87    the short - circuit admittance matrix and the open - circuit impedance matrix are respectively @xmath88 and @xmath89 then , to determine @xmath59 : i ) inject a current between terminals 1 and 4 , i.e.  _ in _ port 1 , which is considered as an input port ; and ii ) determine the voltage across terminals 3 and 4 , i.e.  _ across _ port 1 , which is also considered as an output port . hence @xmath90 which is in agreement with the value given in  @xcite . moreover , to determine @xmath83 : i ) inject a current between terminals 1 and 4 , i.e.  _ in _ port 1 , which is considered as an input port ; and ii ) determine the voltage across terminals 2 and 3 , i.e.  _ across _ port 2 and 3 , which are considered as output ports . hence @xmath91 \n in the equivalent circuit of figure  [ fig : device_model_nonideal ] , a contact resistance @xmath92 has been added in series to each terminal . applying kvl to nodes @xmath49 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and \n @xmath50 yields @xmath93 in matrix form , the above set of equations can be written as @xmath94 or @xmath95 where @xmath56 is given by   and @xmath96 because of  , the indefinite admittance matrix for the circuit of figure  [ fig : device_model_nonideal ] is @xmath97    actually , in analytical calculations , @xmath98 need not to be evaluated in full . \n in fact , since @xmath99 is typically very close to the identity matrix ( cf . \n equation  ) , a taylor series expansion of @xmath98 up to the appropriate order in @xmath100 might be sufficient in most cases . \n in this section we analyse the effect of contact resistances on several examples of single device connections ( table  [ tab : single_device_connections ] , first column ) . \n these examples , which were already analysed using other methods by delahaye  @xcite and by jeffery _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite , have been chosen for their practical interest . \n for each connection , the second column of table  [ tab : single_device_connections ] shows a suitable choice of port voltages and the third column shows the corresponding matrix @xmath67 . \n taking into account equations   and  , for each connection we have determined the short - circuit admittance matrix @xmath101 and the open - circuit impedance matrix @xmath78 . from @xmath48 \n it is then easy to determine the ideal values of the measured impedances and the relative errors due to the contact resistances . \n these results are shown in table  [ tab : single_device_connections ] , and references are given for comparison . \n * 2>m25mm@*5c@ & port voltages & @xmath67 & & & & ref . \n + & & & @xmath102 & @xmath103 & & ( * ? ? ? \n * eq .

( 13 ) ) + \n two _ unconnected _ multiterminal elements , @xmath107 with @xmath108 terminals and @xmath109 with @xmath110 terminals , can be considered as a single multiterminal element with @xmath111 terminals . since there is no connection between the two elements , @xmath112 unless terminals @xmath3 and @xmath113 belong to the same element . \n the indefinite admittance matrix of @xmath114 is thus a block diagonal matrix where the non - zero blocks are the indefinite admittance matrices of @xmath107 and @xmath109 , respectively . in the case of two non - ideal qhe devices , \n the indefinite admittance matrix is then @xmath115{0pt}{0pt}\\bi{d}^{-1}_\\textup{a}\\bar{\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i } & 0 \\\\ \\hline   0 & \\rule{0pt}{15pt}\\bi{d}^{-1}_\\textup{b}\\bar{\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i } \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where , for each device , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are given by .    given the matrix above , connections between two or more qhe devices can be treated following the same method described in section  [ sec : ideal_device_connections ] for single - device connections . in particular , it is then easy to obtain the results determined by delahaye in  @xcite for multiple - series and multiple - parallel connections and to experiment with new configurations . \n we have described a method to model the electrical behaviour of one , or several , multiterminal qhe devices with complex external connections . \n the indefinite admittance matrix of the ideal unconnected device , a matrix representing the contact resistances and a matrix representing the external connections , all enter a simple matrix expression from which the two - terminal and four - terminal impedances of interest can be determined .    as examples of application , \n the method has been applied to connection schemes in the dc regime of practical interest for primary metrology , already analysed in other papers . \n formally , the method is valid also in the ac regime ; however , the practical application requires to model the ac behaviour of connections , and parasitic parameters at the device level , and will be the subject of future investigations . \n the authors are grateful to stefano grivet - talocia , politecnico di torino , for pointing out the existence of the indefinite admittance matrix , and are indebted with jrgen schurr , ptb braunschweig ( germany ) : we performed together experimental testing of fang s configurations and had many discussions on the subject . \n 10    b.  jeckelmann and b.  jeanneret . \n the quantum hall effect as an electrical resistance standard . in _ the quantum hall effect _ , volume  45 of _ progress in mathematical physics _ , pages 55131 . \n birkhuser basel , 2005 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2065938484476, "RequestID": "515d59bb06111800d0118dec5272e30467da1346", "TotalTokens": 4120}
{"ContextTokens": 2943, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "the question of measuring of the spatial non - commutativity effects , in physical processes , is under intensive interest . \n non - commutative qed ( ncqed ) seems to be a straightforward method to examine such effects . for this purpose \n , one needs a precise experimental data such as positronium hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) among the other processes . \n the basic difference between ncqed and qed is the existence of new interactions ( 3-photon and 4-photon vertices ) which complicate the calculations in ncqed . \n although the feynman rules of this theory are given in @xcite , to apply these rules to bound state , one needs special treatments like bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach @xcite or non - relativistic qed ( nrqed)@xcite . in our preceding letter @xcite , using bs equation , we have shown that up to the order @xmath4 no spin - dependent correction owing to the spatial non - commutativity appears in the positronium spectrum \n . therefore one should calculate the higher order corrections . in this letter \n we calculate the corrections to the positronium by using nrqed method . in section 2 , we introduce nrqed - vertices in the nc - space . \n consequently , in section 3 , we use the modified nrqed to determine hfs at the lowest order . in this section , we show that our calculations at the leading order lead to the corrections at the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the parameter of non - commutativity . at the end , we summarize our results . \n nrqed is an effective field theory which simplifies the bound state calculation . to apply this technique in non - commutative space one should modify the nrqed vertices by performing @xmath5 expansion on ncqed scattering amplitude . in doing so \n , one obtains an effective theory of non - relativistic particles which permits the direct application of well tested techniques based on schrdinger s equation . \n now , comparing ncqed scattering amplitudes with nrqed can completely determine the matching coefficients . \n some of the vertices with their appropriate matching coefficients , are shown in fig . \n 1 . they contribute to the tree level matching to get the leading order bound state energy shift . \n one should note that these coefficients apart from a phase factor are very similar to the standard nrqed @xcite . \n this similarity is owing to the fact that the scattering amplitude of @xmath6 in ncqed is independent of the parameter of non - commutativity of space @xcite . \n the other vertices which are not shown in fig . 1 and have not counterpart in the standard nrqed , due to the existence of the three and four photon vertices have contributions to higher order corrections to energy shift . \n now , by using the first graph of fig . 1 and expanding the vertices up to order @xmath1 , one can easily verify the results of refs.@xcite at the order @xmath7 as @xmath8 such an energy shift is spin - independent and therefore has not any contribution to hfs . \n by using the modified nrqed we can determine the diagrams which contribute to the lowest order of hfs ( fig . \n 2 ) .    we can now calculate each diagram separately as follows : @xmath9 with @xmath10_i \\frac{-1}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_i({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_j}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{e({\\bf \n p}'+{\\bf p})}{2m_e}e^{i p\\wedge p'}\\right]_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the parameter of the non - commutativity is given as @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is shown that @xmath14 leads to some problems with the unitarity of field theory and the concept of causality @xcite , therefore in our calculations we consider @xmath15 . + after some algebra eq.([p1 ] ) yields @xmath16\\psi({\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\alpha}{2m_e^2}\\left<\\frac{{\\bf s}_1.{\\bf l } } { r^3}\\right>-\\frac{3\\alpha } { m_e^2}\\int d^3 r ( \\theta .{\\bf l } \\psi^*)\\frac{{\\bf s}_1.{\\bf l}}{r^5}{\\psi}+o(\\alpha^7),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the third equality we used @xmath19 \n one should note that the first term in eq.([p4 ] ) is the usual term in nrqed which is of the order @xmath20 . \n but the second term which is appeared in eq.([p4 ] ) , owing to the spatial non - commutativity is of the order @xmath0 . \n nonexistence of the terms at the order of @xmath4 which carry @xmath1-dependence is a remarkable result which happens in all diagrams of hfs . \n indeed this fact is due to appearance of @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 in all energy - correction expressions . \n therefore , to obtain the energy corrections for hfs at the order @xmath23 one should once calculate the corrections up to the lowest order of nrqed ( i.e. fig . \n 2 ) . in the other words , the @xmath24-corrections in nrqed calculations of commutative space lead to the higher order of @xmath25 in non - commutative space . \n + now we work out the figs . \n 2(b - f ) as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28_i \\frac{-1}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_i({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_j}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{-ie({\\bf p}'-{\\bf p})\\times{\\bf{\\sigma_2}}}{2m_e}e^{i p\\wedge p'}\\right]_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which results in @xmath29\\frac{1}{4\\pi r}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( \\ldots)+\\frac{3e^2}{16\\pi m_e^2}\\int d^3r\\psi({\\bf r})\\tilde\\gamma_e\\psi^*({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 means the usual part of the energy shift and @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 . the final diagram ( fig . \n 2f ) has not any contribution at the order of our interest . for @xmath33 \n one can easily find @xmath34\\ell\\psi({\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_a+\\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_b&=&\\frac{1}{2}(\\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_c+ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_d)\\nonumber\\\\ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_e&=&\\frac{3e^2}{16\\pi m_e^2}\\int d^3 r \\psi({\\bf r})\\overline{\\gamma}\\psi^*({\\bf r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 the superscript nc in eq . \n ( [ p11 ] ) means the non - commutative part of the energy shift and three lines in the eq.([p12 ] ) are related to @xmath36 , respectively . \n meanwhile for the spin zero state ( @xmath37 ) , all contributions to the energy shift are zero . \n + the average of @xmath38 over the triplet is zero , which means the spin - spin interaction part carries no correction in average and therefore the hyperfine splitting due to the non - commutativity becomes @xmath39\\ell\\psi_{nlm}({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the wave function of the positronium in the commutative space with the coulomb potential and we have defined @xmath41 . \n if the @xmath42-axis is chosen parallel to the vector @xmath43 , the above result simplifies into @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the compton wave length of the electron and @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 one should note that the divergence of @xmath48 at @xmath49 is owing to singularity of @xmath50 at @xmath51 , the region where @xmath1-expansion is not well - defined . \n actually , it is shown that @xmath1-expanded ncqed is not renormalizable @xcite . \n the @xmath1 expansion imply a cut - off @xmath52 while the validity of nrqed requires @xmath53 . \n since @xmath54 , the appropriate cut - off is @xmath55 . \n therefore the energy shift for @xmath2 , @xmath49 can be obtained as @xmath56\\alpha^6.\\ ] ]    the above result should be added to the values of hfs derived in nrqed at the order @xmath23 . \n the reported uncertainties on the experimental values of @xmath3 are about @xmath57 mhz @xcite , that give an upper bound @xmath58 . therefore determining the value of @xmath59 \n requires more accurate experiments . \n using nrqed method in the non - commutative space , we have obtained that there is not any correction at the order @xmath4 for the hfs of positronium , the order @xmath4 corrections are spin independent . \n the correction to the energy shift is started at the order @xmath23 , eqs . \n ( [ p13]-[p14 ] ) , and it depends on @xmath60 and @xmath61 quantum numbers . therefore it dosent have any contribution to the @xmath62 ( in the spectroscopic notation @xmath63 ) , while for @xmath64 there is @xmath65 different shifts . \n consequently , a closer look at the spacing between @xmath2 triplet excited levels ( @xmath3 ) , which has already been measured [ 14 - 17 ] can provide an experimental test on the non - commutativity of space . + * acknowledgement * + s.m.z . \n gratefully acknowledges research funding from shiraz university and ipm . \n the research of m.h . and \n f.l . was supported by isfahan university of technology ( iut ) and ipm . \n 99 m. hayakawa , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3641, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "the eigenvalue dynamics of the spectra of disordered systems in dependence of an external parameter has attracted considerable interest in recent years . \n it has been motivated by the fact that the conductance through a system is closely linked to the sensitivity of its eigenvalues on a perturbation @xcite . in this respect \n the work of akkermans and montambaux has to be mentioned in particular @xcite , who showed that the conductance can be expressed in terms of the quadratically averaged eigenvalue velocities , @xmath0    here the brackets denote a local average , and @xmath1 is the external parameter . \n later it was shown by simons and altshuler using supersymmetry techniques that the eigenvalue velocities @xmath2 should be gaussian distributed @xcite @xmath3    moreover , if the eigenvalues @xmath4 and the level dynamics parameter @xmath1 are rescaled according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mean level spacing , the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath7 should obey a universal behaviour @xcite . \n a recent review on these questions can be found in @xcite . \n there are a number of attempts to study the autocorrelation function ( [ eqglobalac ] ) , both theoretically and experimentally . \n the systems under consideration ranged from the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field @xcite via conformally deformed @xcite and ray - splitting billiards @xcite to the acoustic spectra of vibrating quartz blocks @xcite . in all cases \n the overall behaviour predicted by simons and altshuler was more or less observed but in nearly all cases there had been significant deviations as well . \n this was our motivation to study velocity distributions and correlations in various mircowave billiards by applying different types of parameter variations . \n most to our surprise we found that the velocity distributions show a clear dependence on the type of parameter variation . only for the type classified as ` global ' below , we found simons and altshuler s universal behaviour , whereas for a second type denoted ` local ' a completely different behaviour was found . \n a preliminary version of this paper has been published already in @xcite . \n all results presented below have been obtained by taking the eigenfrequency spectra of billiard - shaped microwave cavities , shortly termed microwave billiards . \n the technique is described in @xcite . here \n it may be sufficient to note that in quasi - two - dimensional resonators , i.e. cavities with top and bottom plate parallel to each other , quantum mechanical and electromagnetic spectra are completely equivalent , as long as the maximum frequency @xmath8 is not surpassed , where @xmath9 is the height of the resonator . in the present experiment \n the height was 8 mm yielding a maximum frequency of 18.74 ghz .    in the very \n beginning it was not evident at all which billiard parameter should be varied . according to simons and \n altshuler the parameter @xmath1 ` could denote the strength of some field , like the aharonov - bohm flux through a ring , or a magnetic field , or the position of some impurity ' ( cited literally from ref . \n @xcite ) . in microwave billiards the magnetic field \n is not available as a parameter ( though the use of billiards with ferrite - coated walls may offer an alternative @xcite ) . on the other hand \n it is straightforward to study the spectra of microwave billiards as a function of some length @xcite . \n the magnetic field and the length variation have in common that already a small change in the parameter will modify the wavefunction everywhere . \n for this reason we call this type of level dynamics ` global ' \n . the variation of the position of one impurity , on the other hand , can be easily performed in microwave billiards , with the additional advantage that , in contrast to real mesoscopic systems , we can control the disorder in every moment perfectly . \n the displacement of one impurity changes the value of the wave function only in its neighbourhood . \n consequently , we call this type of level dynamics ` local ' \n .    both types of level dynamics were realized in the experiments . \n one of the systems studied was a quarter sinai billiard with width @xmath10=200 mm , radius @xmath11=70 mm of the quarter circle , and a length @xmath12 which was varied between 460 and 480 mm in steps of 0.2 mm . \n about 120 eigenvalues entered into the data analysis in the frequency range 14.5 to 15.5 ghz . \n the second system was a rectangular billiard with side lengths @xmath12=340 mm , @xmath10=240 mm , containing 19 circular disks with a diameter of 4.6 mm whose positions were determined by means of a random number generator . \n the position of one further disk was varied in one direction in steps of 1 mm . \n two different movable disks were used with diameters of 4.6 and 20 mm , respectively ( see fig . [ figsketch ] ) . \n a part of the level dynamic spectrum of the sinai billiard is shown in fig . \n [ figleveldyn ] ( left ) . as a function of length \n the resonances experience four to five avoided crossing in the studied length range . \n this is about the maximum range usable for the velocity correlation measurements for the following reason . \n upon variation of the length it happens that a node line of an eigenfunction passes the position of the coupling antenna , leading to a temporary loss of the eigenfrequency . in the studied \n length range each resonance disappeared at most once , but with increasing length range the tieing up of the open ends became more and more unreliable . \n the situation changes qualitatively of the level dynamics of the rectangular billiard with randomly distributed scatterers shown in fig . \n [ figleveldyn ] ( right ) . \n already a comparison by eyes shows that there is much more regularity in the latter case . \n now it is no problem to follow each eigenvalue over about 10 avoided crossings . \n we start with a discussion of the sinai billiard results . fig . \n [ figglobvel ] shows the found velocity distribution both on a linear and a logarithmic scale . \n the found distribution is close to a gaussian in accordance with the universal prediction . \n the dashed line is a modified bessel function which will become important in the following . \n it is well - known that non - generic features such as bouncing balls give rise to deviations from a gaussian distribution in particular in the region of the wings @xcite . in the measurement \n we therefore carefully avoided the regions disturbed by the dominating bouncing ball . \n hence such a disturbance does not show up in the present case . \n [ figglobac ] shows the corresponding velocity autocorrelation function . to obtain the result \n , each eigenvalue was followed over the available length range including four to five avoided crossings . \n the mean squared velocity needed for the scaling ( [ eqscale ] ) was calculated for each eigenvalue independently . \n subsequently the results of all eigenvalues were superimposed . \n such a procedure was mandatory , since the individual mean squared velocities showed large variations . \n for this reason a scaling with a globally calculated mean squared velocity did not give satisfactory results .    the dotted line in fig . \n [ figglobac ] corresponds to simons and altshuler s universal velocity correlation function . \n since an analytical expression for this quantity is not available , it was obtained from a random matrix simulation @xcite . \n the overall agreement between experiment and theory is good , apart from some small but significant deviations close to the minimum . \n it was already mentioned in the beginning that in most studied cases such an agreement was not found . \n whether a movable scatterer perturbs the system globally or locally , depends on its size , or , more precisely , on the parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the diameter of the scatterer and @xmath15 the wavenumber . for small @xmath16 values ( @xmath17 ) a local level dynamics \n is expected , whereas with increasing @xmath16 values a gradual transition towards a global behaviour should be observed . fig . \n [ figlocvel ] shows the velocity distribution in the rectangular billiard with randomly distributed scatterers for three different @xmath16 ranges , again in a linear and a logarithmic plot . in fig . \n [ figlocvel](a ) the diameter of the movable disk was 4.6 mm , and the eigenvalues were taken in the range 3.4 to 6 ghz . in figs . \n [ figlocvel](b ) and ( c ) the diameter of the scatterer was 20 mm , and the eigenvalues were in the range 3.4 to 5.8 ghz and 12.5 to 14.3 ghz , respectively .    for small @xmath16 values the found velocity distribution is well described by a modified bessel function @xmath18    the logarithmic plot shows that this behaviour is found over two orders of magnitude . \n note that now asymptotically a single exponential behaviour is found in contrast to the gaussian behaviour observed for the global velocities .    with increasing @xmath16 values a transition to gaussian behaviour \n is observed as expected . \n we completed the sequence with a level dynamics in a sinai billiard , where the central circle was moved , corresponding to @xmath16 values between 30 and 40 . here \n the found velocities were again gaussian distributed ( not shown ) .    a corresponding deviation from the universal behaviour is found for the velocity autocorrelation functions . \n the left column of fig . \n [ figlocac ] shows the results for the same @xmath16 ranges as in fig . \n [ figlocvel ] . \n there is no similarity at all with the universal behaviour . only for the largest @xmath16 range \n the found correlation function seems to approach the universal function . \n all these findings are in striking contrast to all what has been expected by the experts \n . nevertheless , the discrepancy from the universal behaviour can be quite easily resolved . \n it is a well - known fact that the insertion of a metallic object into a quasi - two - dimensional microwave cavity shifts the eigenfrequencies to smaller frequencies . \n if the dimensions of the perturber are small compared to the wavelength , this shift is proportional to the square of the electric field . this technique has been used routinely for many years to map field distributions in microwave cavities @xcite and has recently been applied to the study of wave function in chaotic billiards as well @xcite . \n applied to the present problem this means that in the limit @xmath19 the eigenvalue velocities are given by @xmath20 where @xmath1 is the position of the scatterer , and @xmath21 is the gradient taken in the direction of the displacement . \n @xmath22 is a constant factor depending exclusively on the geometry of the perturber . \n it follows for the velocity distribution @xmath23 where the brackets denote an average of eigenvalues . \n this average can be calculated , if we assume that the wavefunction @xmath24 can be described by a random superposition of plane waves @xcite @xmath25 where the modulus of the wavenumbers of all waves contributing is the same , @xmath26 , but where amplitudes @xmath27 and directions @xmath28 are random . \n this approach has been proved extremely fruitful in the description of eigenfunctions in chaotic systems @xcite .    by means of the central limit theorem \n it is now an easy matter to show that under these assmptions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are uncorrelated and both gaussian distributed . with these ingredients \n the average ( [ eqvaverage ] ) can be calculated , resulting in the modified bessel function ( [ eqbessel ] ) for the velocity distribution . with help of the ansatz ( [ eqplanewaves ] ) \n the velocity autocorrelation can be calculated as well , using standard techniques @xcite . \n the result is @xmath31 '' = j_0 ^ 2(\\bar{x } ) - 2j_1 ^ 2(\\bar{x } ) - j_0(\\bar{x } ) j_2(\\bar{x } ) \\label{eqlocalac}\\ ] ] where @xmath32    note that in contrast to simons and altshuler s approach where the level dynamics parameter @xmath1 has been scaled by means of the square root of the quadratically averaged velocities , now we have got a straightforward scaling in terms of the wavenumber @xmath15 .    on the right column of fig . \n [ figlocac ] the same data shown on the left column are plotted again , but now with an abscissa scaled according to eq . ( [ eqnewx ] ) . \n the solid line has been calculated from eq . \n ( [ eqlocalac ] ) . \n it describes the experimental results quite well . \n in particular the wavelengths of the oscillations are reproduced correctly even for the larger @xmath16 ranges . \n only an increasing damping of the oscillations with increasing @xmath16 is observed . \n this oscillatory behaviour in the velocity autocorrelation function , which is already evident from a visual inspection of fig . \n [ figleveldyn ] ( right ) , is in sharp contrast to the global case , where the autocorrelation function shows only one minimum , while all subsequent oscillations found for the individual levels are completely wiped out by averaging process . \n this work has shown that in contrast to our previous understanding there is not one but there are two regimes of universality . only for the global case \n where a small variation of the level dynamics parameter changes the wave functions everywhere , the universal velocity distributions and correlations predicted by simons and altshuler are really observed . in this range \n the scaling of the level dynamics parameter in terms of the square root of the quadratically averaged velocities is the appropriate one .    in the local limit , \n on the other hand , realized in the present work by moving a small pertuber through a disordered system , another universal regime is observed . here \n the scaling of the level dynamics parameter in terms of the wave number is the correct one , and another class of velocity distributions and correlations is found , which has been discussed in this paper . \n edwards and d.j . \n thouless , j. phys . \n c * 5 * ( 1972 ) 807 d.j . \n thouless , phys . rep . \n * 13 * ( 1974 ) 93 e. akkermans and g. montambaux , phys . \n * 68 * ( 1992 ) 642 a. szafer and b.l . \n altshuler , phys . rev \n * 70 * ( 1993 ) 587 b.d . \n simons and b.l . \n altshuler , phys . \n b * 48 * ( 1993 ) 5422 b.l . altshuler and b.d . \n simons , in _ mesoscopic quantum physics _ edited by e. akkermans _ \n _ , north holland , amsterdam 1995 , p. 1 \n et  al . _ , \n * 71 * ( 1993 ) 2899 h. bruus , c.h . \n lewenkopf , and e.r . \n mucciolo , phys . \n b * 53 * ( 1996 ) 9968 y. hlushchuk _ et  al . _ , to be published . \n p. bertelsen _ \n et  al . _ , phys . \n * 83 * ( 1999 ) 2171 m. barth , u. kuhl , and h .- j . \n stckmann , phys . \n lett * 82 * ( 1999 ) 2026 j. stein , h .- j . \n stckmann , and u. stoffregen , phys . \n * 75 * ( 1995 ) 53 p. \n et  al . _ , \n * 74 * ( 1995 ) 2662 m. kollmann _ \n et  al . _ , \n e * 49 * ( 1994 ) r1 m. sieber _ \n et  al . _ , \n a * 28 * ( 1995 ) 5041 e.r . \n mucciolo , private communication l.c . maier and j.c . \n slater , j. appl . \n * 23 * ( 1952 ) 78 s. sridhar , phys . \n * 67 * ( 1991 ) 785 u. drr _ \n * 80 * ( 1998 ) 1030 d.h . \n et  al . _ , \n * 81 * ( 1998 ) 2890 m.v . \n berry , j.  phys . \n a * 10 * ( 1977 ) 2083 p. oconnor , j. gehlen , and e.j . \n heller , phys . \n * 58 * ( 1987 ) 1296 s.w . \n mcdonald and a.m. kaufman , phys . \n a * 37 * ( 1988 ) 3067 m. srednicki and f. stiernelof , j. phys . \n a * 29 * ( 1996 ) 5817", "StartTimeOffset": 2081605305036, "RequestID": "c416ad3896924f0e713e4baeddbf1267ab01e8a1", "TotalTokens": 3752}
{"ContextTokens": 2745, "GeneratedTokens": 292, "SynthesizedBody": "the effect of a planet in a gaseous disk has been well studied both analytically and numerically @xcite . \n tidal torques resulting from the gravitational perturbation of the planet lead to an exchange in angular momentum which creates a gap around the planet . to sustain the gap in viscous disks , there needs to be a balance between the tidal torques , which clear the gap , and viscous torques , which fills the gap @xcite . \n thus the gap criterion is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the mass of the planet and star , @xmath4 is the @xcite viscosity parameter , @xmath5 is the disk scale height and @xmath6 is the semi - major axis of the planet . our previous simulations ( * ? ? ? \n * hereafter bf05 ) show the settling rate  and hence the thickness of the dust layer  depends on grain size . \n since the gap criterion depends on the disk scale height , this would suggest that it is easier to create and sustain a gap in the dust layer than in the gas . \n there are a variety of observational signature of planetary gaps , including mid - infrared dips ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and direct scattered light @xcite and sub - millimetre observations of protoplanetary disks @xcite . \n recent models have indicated that alma will be able to detect planetary gaps at sub - millimetre wavelengths to distances of 100  pc @xcite . \n however , these models assume that the gas and dust are well - mixed within the disk and yet we know the dust - to - gas ratio changes substantially as grains settle to the mid - plane and migrate radially ( bf05 ) . as well as the gas - to - dust ratio varying throughout the disk , we expect that the effects of planetary gaps will be stronger in the dust phase than in the gas phase , which will further affect observations . \n in this paper we study the formation of a gap triggered by an embedded planet in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk . \n we will study the effects of planet mass and grain size on gap formation and evolution in 3d dusty - gas protoplanetary disks . \n we use our 3d , two - phase ( gas@xmath0dust ) , locally isothermal , non - self - gravitating code based on the smoothed particles hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm . \n the dusty gas is approximated by two inter - penetrating flows that interact by aerodynamic drag . for the nebula parameters used in this study , we are in the epstein drag regime and hence @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gas density \n , @xmath9 is the ( spherical ) grain radius , @xmath10 is the sound speed , and @xmath11 is the velocity difference between dust and gas . for details of how the equations of motion and the density of the two fluids are calculated , we refer the reader to bf05 .    the dust particles are incompressible ( @xmath12 = constant ) and there is no grain evaporation or coagulation , nor any gas condensation . \n all simulations presented consider just one ( spherical ) grain size at a time . \n we set up a disk of gas and dust with a total mass of @xmath13 around a @xmath14 star with an embedded planet of mass @xmath2 at a distance of @xmath6 . \n the dust phase is 1% of the total disk mass and the system is evolved for about 100 planetary orbits . \n the disk equation of state is isothermal with constant vertical temperature and radial profile @xmath15 . \n code units are set by @xmath16 and the isothermal sound speed at @xmath17 is @xmath18 . \n the initial density profile is constant and the dust density is @xmath19 ( see below for details ) . the planet is treated as a point mass particle which moves under the gravitational influence of the star on a fixed circular orbit ( i.e. no migration ) . \n simulations start with 50,000 gas and 50,000 dust particles . \n particles are removed from the simulations if they cross the hill radius of the planet , get closer than 0.4 code units of the central star ( which sets the inner disk edge ) , or if they escape past 4 code units ( which sets the outer disk edge ) .    in this work we present the results of two different disk models : ( 1 ) a small , low mass disk close to the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn model ) , and ( 2 ) a classical t  tauri star disk ( ctts model ) . \n the mmsn disk has a mass of 2.9 10@xmath20  @xmath21 and extends from 2  au to 20  au . \n the standard mmsn model has a 1 jupiter mass ( @xmath22 ) planet on a circular orbit of radius 5.2  au in a disk containing grains 1  m in size and @xmath23  g cm@xmath20 . \n the ctts disk mass is 0.01 @xmath21 and spans 16  au to 150  au in radius . \n the standard ctts model has a @xmath25 planet on a circular orbit of radius 40  au in a disk containing grains 1  mm in size and @xmath26 g cm@xmath20 .    for both disks we start by running the standard model and compare the evolution of the gap in the gas and dust phases . \n we then run a series of experiments to study the effect of grain size in the dust disk for both models , with @xmath27 1  cm , 10  cm and 1  m for the mmsn disk and @xmath28  @xmath29 m , 1  mm and 1  cm for the ctts disk . \n ( because the nebula conditions and particularly the density in the ctts and mmsn models are different , the grain sizes used in the two models are different in order to obtain similar values for the gas drag and hence dust settling and migration rates . ) \n this is followed by a series of experiments that study the effects of planetary mass on gap formation and evolution , with @xmath30 and 1.0 @xmath22 for the mmsn model and @xmath310.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 and 5.0 @xmath22 for the ctts model . \n the results of the standard mmsn model is shown in fig . \n [ fig - mmsn - standard ] . \n the left panel shows the top - down ( @xmath32 ) and side - on ( @xmath33 ) view of the gas and dust disk morphologies . \n while the planet opens a gap in the gas , the gap in the dust layer is much more striking . \n the right panel of fig . \n [ fig - mmsn - standard ] compares the evolution of the azimuthally averaged surface density profile of the gas and dust after 8.4 and 104 planetary orbits . \n recent observations have suggested that massive planets at large distances from the star may exist , such as a 5  @xmath22 planet 30  au from lkca 15 @xcite and a 12.5  @xmath22 planet 135  au from gg  tau @xcite . \n our standard ctts model has a 5  @xmath22 planet at 40  au and the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig - ctts - standard ] . \n for the nebular parameters used , such a massive planet almost completely empties the inner disk of both gas and dust ( though this is likely due to the large inner disk radius - see * ? ? ? * ) . \n since the gap criterion is partially governed by the disk scale height , and the dust scale height varies with grain size , we ran a series of simulations to determine the effect of grain size on the gap . \n three grain sizes are tested in both disk models : 1  cm , 10  cm and 1  m for the mmsn disk and 100  @xmath29 m , 1  mm and 1  cm for the ctts disk . \n [ fig - grains3d ] shows how the gap morphology of both the mmsn and ctts disks vary with dust grains size . \n we find that both the width and depth of the gap increases with increasing grain size . \n finally we investigate the effect of the planetary mass on the evolution of the gap . for our mmsn disk with 1  m grains \n , @xmath34 varies from 0.05  @xmath22 to 1  @xmath22 , and for our ctts disk containing 1  mm grains , @xmath34 varies from 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 to 5  @xmath22 . \n [ fig - planet-2ddens ] shows the comparison of the surface density profiles for both models . for the mmsn disk , \n the gap is more striking in the dust than the gas , while in the ctts disk the inner disk appears depleted of both gas and dust , while the dust pile - up at the outer gap edge is clearly seen . for the ctts disk , \n no change is seen in the surface density for a 0.1 @xmath22  planet in either the gas or dust phase . \n these results are in general agreement with the minimum planet mass required to produce a gap in the disk models of @xcite . \n structures created by planets in dusty disks are more diverse than those created in the gaseous disks . with only aerodynamic drag , we find that it is possible to create disks with a large central hole or a ring . \n @xcite also found that the presence of a planet can produce disks with a central hole for certain grain sizes . \n our results have implications for observational predictions of protoplanetary disks hosting planets . @xcite and @xcite use results of 2d hydrodynamic simulations to produce synthetic images of protoplanetary disks , but these simulations assume that the gas and dust are well mixed , which our results clearly demonstrate is not the case .    because our general findings show than the gap is generally more striking in the dust disk \n , we suggest that predictions of observations of protoplanetary disks are too pessimistic . \n our results show that the density contrast around the gap can be very strong ( and the volume density can actually be greater than the gas volume density ) and this would be detectable with alma . \n our simulations support the results of @xcite , as we clearly see density enhancements in the outer gap edge of the ctts simulations , even for the smaller grains sizes which would be responsible for the majority of the sub - mm and mm emission . \n our results also support the predictions of @xcite that gaps created by @xmath35 planets in mmsn disks should be visible with alma . for a more detailed analysis \n , we refer the reader to fouchet et al . \n ( 2007 ) . \n while we see a clear density increase in the vicinity of the external 3@xmath362 resonance of our standard mmsn disk , we do not believe that particles are trapped in the resonance . plotting the dust eccentricity against semi - major axis \n when drag was neglected clearly shows resonances as thin vertical lines and a v - shaped pattern at the edges of the gap . \n however when drag is included , we find that the drag efficiently damps high eccentricities and the resonant signatures disappear . furthermore , while the dust pile up appears to coincide with the 3@xmath362 external resonance for the mmsn disk ( when gas drag is included ) , this is not true for the standard ctts disk  see fig . \n [ fig - ctts - standard ] . \n thus the accumulation of dust that we and other authors @xcite notice close to the outer gap edge is not due to resonant trapping . \n the accumulation of grains at the external edge of the gap may , however , favour the growth of planetesimals in this high density region . \n we have conducted a series of 3d numerical simulations of two - phase ( dust@xmath0gas ) protoplanetary disks to study the behaviour of the dust in the presence of a planet . \n we ran a series of experiments with a minimum mass solar nebula disk as well as a larger , more massive classical t  tauri star disk , varying the grain size and the planet mass . \n we find that gap formation is more rapid and striking in the dust layer than in the gas layer . \n varying the grain size alone results in a variety of different structures , and for the ctts disk these differences will be detectable with alma . for low mass planets in our mmsn disk , \n a gap was found to open in the dust layer while not in the gas layer . \n simulations like these can be used to help interpret observations to constraint the planet mass and grain sizes in protoplanetary disks .", "StartTimeOffset": 2092599635910, "RequestID": "aa5f6519929669b42fee041cdf15e407f6da4366", "TotalTokens": 3037}
{"ContextTokens": 3488, "GeneratedTokens": 156, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery of a large number of short - period extrasolar planets has generated renewed interests in the study of tidally induced migration of protoplanets in disks . \n the basis of migration is the gravitational interaction between a gaseous disk and an orbiting perturber , and has been analyzed well before extrasolar planets were actually discovered @xcite . \n it has been suggested that this tidal interaction induces the embedded protoplanet to migrate under two different circumstances . in type  i migration , \n the protoplanet mass is small and the disk structure is weakly perturbed . in this limit \n , the disk response can be analyzed with a quasi - linear approximation . \n linear calculations have revealed an intrinsic imbalance of inner and outer disk torques @xcite , so the planet could migrate quite quickly inward . in type ii migration , the protoplanet mass is sufficiently large for it to open up a gap in the disk @xcite . \n the protoplanet s orbital evolution is locked to the evolution of the disk , which is likely to be on the viscous timescale @xcite . \n both types of migration have been basically confirmed by the non - linear numerical simulations . \n the high mobility of small mass protoplanets or embryo cores of giant planets from type i migration has presented a challenge to the formation of giant planets . \n the absence of deep oceans is contrary to the inference that any terrestrial planet in the solar system may be formed well outside the snow - line and migrated to their present location . \n it is thus imperative to explore the cause which may have inhibited the type i migration . \n one potential contributor to this process is the disk response to low mass planets , especially in the co - orbital region where only sketchy analytical arguments have been developed . \n there are , however , two notable recent exceptions . \n masset ( 2001 , 2002 ) has evaluated the co - orbital corotation torque and found that they can play a crucial role for the migration rate . \n extensive numerical simulations of viscous disks have been performed to understand the torque dependence on the planet mass , sound speed , disk viscosity , and the torque saturation mechanism . \n one generic behavior he found is that the total torque on the planet first shows an oscillation consistent with the librating fluid motion in the co - orbital region then it levels off to a constant due to the disk viscosity . \n another study is by balmforth & korycansky ( 2001 ) , who used matched asymptotic expansions to explore the non - linear dynamics of the flows in the co -

linear dynamics of the co - orbital region , based on direct , high resolution numerical simulations (  2 ) . \n our approach is quite similar to that of masset s except that we have focused on the inviscid limit simulations . as a consequence , the total torque on the planet exhibits some interesting new behavior , instead of leveling off to a constant as in the case of viscous disks . \n some of the findings are similar to what balmforth & korycansky have found in the excitation of vortices (  3 ) . \n we provide an interpretation of why these vortices are produced in  4 and discuss the implications of our results in  5 . \n we assume that the protoplanetary disk is thin and can be described by the inviscid 2-d euler equations in a cylindrical @xmath0 plane with vertically integrated quantities . \n two gravitating bodies , a central star and a protoplanet , are located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively and the 2-d disk is modeled between @xmath3 . \n the planet is on a fixed circular orbit at @xmath2 . \n the self - gravity of the disk is not included .    the mass ratio between the planet and the central star is taken to be @xmath4 . \n its hill ( roche ) radius is @xmath5 . \n the disk is assumed to be isothermal with a constant temperature throughout the simulation region ( i.e. , it is attached to a thermal bath ) . the isothermal sound speed , scaled by the keplerian rotation speed @xmath6 at @xmath2 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the disk scale height . \n we used a set of three sound speeds @xmath9 . in the simulations presented here , \n we choose an initial surface density profile with @xmath10 , in order that the ratio of vorticity to surface density ( potential vorticity ) has a flat radial profile @xmath11 ( note that @xmath12 has a small deviation from being a precise constant due to the finite pressure gradient which slightly modifies @xmath6 from its keplerian value . ) with this choice of initial condition , we avoid the generation of inflection points due to the rearrangement of @xmath12 distribution as it is carried by the stream lines . \n we have also made other runs which have an initial potential vorticity gradient and we find that the results presented here also hold for them . \n the detailed analysis of these results will be presented elsewhere .    since @xmath13 for all three different sound speeds , the planet is embedded . \n the planet s gravitational potential is softened by an approximate 3-d treatment . \n the key approach is to take the surface density at each cell spreading it out vertically based on a gaussian density profile with a scale height determined by the local temperature . \n the gravitional force between the planet and the disk matter is calculated using this 3-d configuration but all the forces with the same @xmath0 positions are summed together . \n this gives a correction factor @xmath14 to the gravitational forces , which effectively softens the gravitational potential . \n the torque overestimation in a 2-d geometry was studied in @xcite which arises only from locations near the planet . as a test \n if our key finding is affected by the 3-d treatment , we excluded several roche radii from the torque calculation and show that it is not the case . \n although there are some accumulation of gas near the planet , we do not allow any disk gas to be accreted onto it . \n this boundary condition is equivalent to that of sufficiently low - mass protoplanets with quasi hydrostatic envelopes ( pollack _ et al . \n the planet s potential is switched on over 10 orbits in order for the disk to make an adiabatic adjustment . \n ( we have used other , longer turn - on times but the results do not depend on them . )    simulations are carried out using a 2-d code whose basic algorithm was based on fargo by @xcite and @xcite . \n the co - rotating frame is used so that the positions of the central star and the planet are fixed at @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( acceleration due to frame rotation is also included , see @xcite ) . \n runs are made using several radial and azimuthal grids to study the influence of resolution , and those presented here have @xmath17 . \n outflow boundary conditions are used at both the inner and outer radial boundaries . \n the simulations typically last several hundred orbits at @xmath2 . \n one key difference between our simulations and previous studies is that our simulations are performed in the inviscid limit , i.e. , we do not explicitly include a viscosity term , though numerical viscosity is inevitable and is needed to handle for example shocks . \n in addition , our simulations tend to be of higher resolution . with a radial @xmath18 ( some runs go up to @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 , the diameter of the hill sphere of a planet with @xmath21 is resolved by at least @xmath22 cells in each direction . using a nested - grid technique , \n @xcite have also made very high resolution simulations , though their simulations include an explicit viscosity . \n our simulation results are generally in agreement with previous simulations for the planet on a fixed circular orbit ( see * ? ? ? \n * ) in terms of the generic structures produced in the disk by the tidal interactions between the planet and its surrounding flows . \n since the planet mass is relatively small , only density dips are produced without gaps ( at least during a few hundred orbits simulated here ) . \n we define the co - orbital region here as @xmath23 . \n the co - orbital region can be separated into several parts depending on their streamline behavior ( see * ? ? ? \n * ) , including the horseshoe ( or librating ) region @xmath24 , the separatrix region @xmath25 , and the streaming region @xmath26 . \n the horseshoe region can be further divided into real horseshoe streamlines enclosing all three libration points ( @xmath27 ) and tadpole like streamlines enclosing either @xmath28 or @xmath29 . \n our key finding is shown in fig . \n [ fig : torq_t ] which displays the total torque on the planet from the disk . \n it has two very distinct phases : phase i : the total torque is negative and smooth , modulated by a period that is similar to the libration period near the l4 and l5 points ( @xmath30 where @xmath31 is one orbit at @xmath2 ) . \n phase ii : the total torque shows very large amplitude and fast oscillations with a quasi - period of a few orbits . \n we see such a behavior in all the runs with three different sound speeds , though the times when the `` phase '' transition occurs are different . \n they are at @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . \n the obvious question is what causes such large amplitude and fast changes in torques . \n closer inspection of the co - orbital region at times around @xmath36 ( using @xmath37 as an example ) reveals that vortices are generated in the separatrix region . \n this development is shown in fig . \n [ fig : kh ] , which depicts maps of potential vorticity @xmath12 through the times when the system undergoes its `` phase '' transition . \n one can see that these vortices are anti - cyclones which are also blobs of higher densities ( not shown here ) . \n being in the separatrix region , they experience very close encounters with the planet repeatedly , thus exerting strong `` impulses '' to the planet . \n this results in the large amplitude and fast variations in the torque evolution .    to understand this phenomenon further , in fig . [ \n fig : pv ] , we plot the azimuthally averaged radial potential vorticity profile @xmath38 for @xmath37 at different times @xmath39 . \n one sees that this profile deviates progressively away from the initially flat radial profile , developing two prominent structures at @xmath40 , with a minimum at @xmath41 and a maximum at @xmath42 . comparing with fig . \n [ fig : kh ] , vortices apparently emerge from the minima . \n the existence of the extrema ( or inflection points ) in the potential vorticity profile is usually regarded as a necessary condition for non - axisymmetric instabilities in rotating shear flows ( drazin & reid 1981 ) . \n the progressive steepening of this profile , say , at @xmath43 until @xmath44 and the subsequent flattening ( see the curve at @xmath45 ) strongly suggest that there is a secondary instability which is excited around @xmath41 and vortices are the non - linear outcome of such an instability . \n how could the potential vorticity profile develop such inflection points / structures from an initially flat and stable profile ? \n as can be seen from the evolution equation for potential vorticity @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the lagrangian derivative , that @xmath12 is conserved along the streamlines in 2d ( korycansky & papaloizou 1996 ) . \n thus , the initial uniform @xmath12 distribution should be preserved in an inviscid disk . \n this conclusion , however , is only true provided that streamlines can be defined everywhere in a dissipationless flow .    disk flows in the co - orbital region around the planet , however , do not satisfy this condition ( except perhaps for flows within @xmath48 ) because of the two sets of spiral shocks produced by the planet . \n these two sets of shocks emanate from close to the planet and cut through the whole disk . \n flow lines which encounter these shocks are broken and the dissipation in shocks breaks the potential vorticity conservation . the consequence of the shock is equivalent to that of a strong viscous stress in the momentum equation , the curl of which , does not vanish .    to establish the role of shocks in breaking the potential vorticity conservation , we have performed three runs with different sound speeds @xmath49 . even though they only span a small range , but the effects are quite clear . in fig . \n [ fig : pv3cs ] , we plot the azimuthally averaged potential vorticity profiles for these three runs at a time just before the emergence of vortices . \n vortices first appear at the minimum of the `` valley '' in the profiles which moves outwards as @xmath50 increases . \n this growth pattern is consistent with the fact that the starting location of the shocks is also moving away from the planet when the sound speed increases . \n note that the cause for the emergence and growth of inflection points in the azimuthally averaged @xmath12 distribution presented here is different from that due to its re - arrangment along the horseshoe orbits ( balmforth and korycansky 2001 ) . in our calculation with a more general initial @xmath51 ( and @xmath12 ) distribution , we confirm that onset of the shearing instability occurs at an earlier epoch . \n the appearance of the subsequently self - excited vortices is quite similar to the development of the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability observed at shear interfaces . \n a detailed study on the properties of this secondary instability , such as its threshold and growth rate , will be presented in a forthcoming paper . \n in this paper , we consider the tidal interaction between a protostellar disk and an embedded planet with a modest mass . \n linear torque calculations suggest that such interaction leads to angular momentum transfer and inward migration of the planets . for planets with mass comparable to that of the earth , the inferred migration time scale ( ward 1997 ) \n is much shorter than the observationally determined depletion time scale of the disk @xcite . \n this analytic result raises a problem for the formation of giant planets through the core accretion process ( pollack _ et al . \n we reinvestigate this process in an attempt to resolve this paradox . \n the embedded protoplanet induces a circulation flow pattern near its corotation region in the disk . \n we show here that even in disks with initially uniform potential vorticities , inflection points may emerge and grow spontaneously as potential vorticity is generated near the spiral shock in the vicinity of the protoplanet . \n these inflection points lead to the onset and growth of secondary instabilities . \n the existence of secondary instabilities and their non - linear outcome as vortices indicate that the flows in the co - orbital region are perhaps more complicated than linear analyses have suggested . \n these vortices should exert strong torques on the planet . \n one limitation of our current study is that the planet is being artificially held on a fixed circular orbit . \n such strong and rapidly varying torques from the vortices on the planet might cause the planet to `` oscillate '' and lose its phase coherence with the surrounding flow . \n this feedback process should have important implications for the type i migration problem . allowing the planet to migrate radially \n must be included in order to understand the planet s response to such torques . \n these issues will be addressed in a forthcoming publication . \n we wish to thank neil balmforth , darryl holm and edison liang for useful discussions . \n this research was performed under the auspices of the department of energy . \n it was supported by the laboratory directed research and development program at los alamos and by lanl / igpp . \n we are also supported in part by nasa through nag5 - 11779 , nag5 - 9223 , and nsf through ast-9987417 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2098579911318, "RequestID": "2712288884f9ad96abad8ed03e0cc8107be38b6d", "TotalTokens": 3644}

frail et al . \n this only applies to the long - duration bursts at this point . \n models that use supernovae ( sne ) to explain grbs have been part of the discussion from the start ( e.g. , colgate 1968 ; woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . strong evidence for the grb - sn association was first provided by grb  980425 ; the optical afterglow was not found , but an unusual type ic sn was seen in the error box of the grb ( galama et al . \n 1998 ; patat & piemonte 1998 ) . \n many other circumstantial arguments were made to connect grbs with sne . \n direct evidence , where an afterglow is seen to transform into an sn , was first seen with grb  030329 ( stanek et  al . \n 2003 ; matheson et  al . \n 2003 ; hjorth et  al . 2003 ; kawabata et  al . 2003 ; kosugi et  al . \n subsequently , two other cases have been identified : grb  021211 ( della valle et  al . \n 2003 ) and grb  031203 ( malesani et  al . \n 2004 ) . in this paper \n , i will review the evidence for the grb - sn association and describe the nature of the sne that are associated with grbs . \n there were many indirect pieces of evidence that showed an association between grbs and sne . \n most of these actually related grbs to massive stars , but , since massive stars do undergo core collapse to become sne , the connection was implicit . on the large scale , \n the host galaxies of grbs showed strong star formation , indicating that massive stars were present ( e.g. , hogg & fruchter 1999 ) . \n more detailed studies found that the locations of grbs within their host galaxies were associated with the regions that contained massive stars ( e.g. ,  bloom , kulkarni , & djorgovski 2002 ) . \n other circumstantial arguments derived from evidence related to the interaction of the grb with its local environment . \n massive stars in general have stellar winds , and the observations of the afterglows are consistent with models of interaction with these winds ( e.g. , chevalier & li 2000 ) . \n a few grb afterglows have shown strong absorption features at relatively high velocities ( a few thousand km s@xmath0 ) , the best case being grb  021004 . \n for that grb , these features were interpreted as mass - loss shells from a wolf - rayet progenitor , again implying a massive star ( mirabal et  al . \n 2003 ; schaefer et  al . \n another claim of evidence for association with sne came from reported detections of line features in the x - ray afterglows of some grbs ( e.g. , piro et  al . 1999 ; reeves et  al . \n 2002 ) that would result from material synthesized in the collapse , followed by a grb after a period of time . \n recent reanalysis of all observations of x - ray afterglows , however , indicates that these earlier claims are not statistically significant ( sako , harrison , & rutledge 2004 ) . \n perhaps the strongest element in the circumstantial case for the grb - sn association was the presence of bumps in the afterglows of many grbs . \n the traditional optical afterglow of a grb decays as a power - law . \n late - time deviations from this power law were consistent in their timing and brightness with an sn having exploded at the same time as the grb ( e.g. , bloom et  al . \n rebrightening , though , is not necessarily direct evidence of a supernova . \n that would require a spectroscopic detection . \n the first evidence for an sn associated with a grb came when sn  1998bw was found in the error box of grb  980425 ( galama et  al . \n the sn was of type ic ( see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn types ) , but it was peculiar , with evidence for unusually high velocities ( patat et al . \n this event was odd in many ways . \n the grb itself was relatively weak ( woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ) and the radio emission from the sn was extraordinary , both in luminosity and the rapidity of its appearance ( kulkarni et al . \n this was clearly an object of great interest , but it was not conclusive proof that sne and grbs are related . \n it is , though , the framework upon which all further claims of grb - sn connections are built . \n a weaker case is grb  011121 ( garnavich et  al . \n 2003a ; bloom et al . \n a late - time bump in the light curve was observed from the ground and with _ hst_. at @xmath1 , the supernova component would have been relatively bright . \n a spectrum of the grb taken during the rebrightening does not show any obvious features of an sn , but the color evolution derived from broad - band photometry is consistent with a supernova ( designated sn  2001ke ; garnavich et  al . \n while sn  1998bw was a strong hint of the grb - sn association , no traditional optical afterglow was seen . without that direct association , \n the link between grbs and sne was still in question . \n the ` monster burst ' of 2003 , grb  030329 was to provide that link . \n the burst was unusually bright in gamma - rays , implying that it was relatively close . \n spectroscopy of the afterglow soon confirmed a low redshift of 0.1685 ( greiner et  al . \n 2003 ) . as the afterglow faded , subtle features appeared in the normally flat power - law spectra of the afterglow . \n by subtracting a continuum based upon the early shape of the spectrum , this structure was revealed as the spectrum of an unusual type ic sn similar to sn  1998bw , designated sn  2003dh ( garnavich et  al . \n 2003b ) . within a few days , \n the sn became the dominant component in the spectrum ( stanek et  al . \n 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 \n ; kawabata et  al . \n 2003 ) .    using the early power - law continuum spectrum as a model \n , one could decompose the observed spectra at later times into two separate components : grb afterglow and sn spectrum . using a least - squares technique , the best match for the sn among the low - redshift sample \n was sn  1998bw ( matheson et  al . \n in fact , taking into account cosmological time dilation , the spectroscopic evolution of sn  2003dh almost exactly matched sn  1998bw ( figure 1 ) . \n models of these spectra are presented by mazzali et al . \n ( 2003 ; see also mazzali s contribution in this volume ) . \n an important point about the appearance of the sn was that the light curve did not show the bump that is supposed to be the characteristic of a rebrightening caused by the sn ( see matheson et  al . \n 2003 and lipkin et  al . \n 2004 for a discussion of the light curve ) . without the spectroscopic confirmation , \n the sn in grb  030329 would still be a matter of contention . \n nebular - phase spectra of sn  2003dh show a spectrum similar to a typical type ic sn . \n kosugi et  al . \n ( 2004 ) present a spectrum at an age of @xmath23 months . \n a spectrum obtained with the keck telescope by filippenko , chornock , & foley ( 2004 ) in december of 2003 is much like a normal type ic sn ( bersier et  al . \n , in preparation ) . \n following the discovery of sn  2003dh , reexamination of spectra of an earlier burst yielded some evidence for a sn component . \n della valle et  al . ( 2003 ) found that a spectrum of the afterglow of grb  021211 had structure similar to an sn . in this case , though , the sn did not match sn  1998bw or any other peculiar type ic sn . rather , it was most similar to sn  1994i , a relatively normal type ic . \n a more clear example came with grb  031203 . despite high foreground reddening , spectroscopy with \n the vlt revealed an sn component , designated sn  2003lw ( malesani et  al . \n 2004 ) . for this sn , sn \n 1998bw was again a good match . \n of the four sne with clear grb associations , three show remarkably similar spectra . \n the classification scheme for sne ( see filippenko 1997 ) is based upon spectroscopic features . \n the type ii sne show hydrogen , while those of type i do not . \n type ia sne have a distinctive silicon feature and show an elemental pattern consistent with the theory that they arise from thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf . \n the other type i sne ( i.e. , without the strong silicon absorption ) are distinguished either by the presence ( ib ) or absence ( ic ) of helium . \n a strong circumstantial case has tied types ii , ib , and ic to the same underlying mechanism of core collapse . a transition between type ii and something like a ib \n was observed for sn  1993j ( e.g. , filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ) , strengthening this connection and providing an explanation for the subclasses . \n models of the progenitor of sn  1993j postulated that a massive star in a binary had lost most of its hydrogen layer , leaving a small amount that produced the early spectrum of a type ii , and then revealing the helium layer below ( see matheson et  al . \n 2000 for a summary and an extensive list of references ) . \n study of a large number of type ib / c sne indicated that the sne ic had less massive envelopes than the sne ib ( matheson et  al . \n this implied that the ib sne have lost their hydrogen , leaving the helium layer , while the sne ic have lost hydrogen and helium , leaving a carbon / oxygen core . the spectrum itself , though derived from the same underlying mechanism , can be very different depending on the amount of the envelope stripped from the star at the time of the explosion . \n if the grb mechanism does entail a jet ( e.g. , macfadyen , woosley , & heger 2001 ) , then a smaller progenitor with a less massive envelope would make it easier for the jet to punch through the stellar atmosphere and still have the energy to produce the observed burst and afterglow . \n in addition to sn  1998bw , there are several low - redshift peculiar type ic sne . these are objects that show high expansion velocities and sometimes , but not always , large luminosity ( they are occasionally referred to as `` hypernovae '' ) . \n two well - studied such examples are sn  1997ef and sn  2002ap ( iwamoto et al . \n 1998 , 2000 ; foley et  al . 2003 ) . \n none of these other high - velocity sne has been directly associated with a grb . \n there is a wide diversity in their spectroscopic and photometric development , but only the ones like sn  1998bw have been related to grbs . \n it is not yet clear if this is significant .    even though the overall energy budget may be different for grbs and these other peculiar type ic sne , they are clearly unusual objects . \n the high velocities set them apart from a typical sn , with the only similar objects being the sne associated with grbs . \n to study the sn component of a grb requires it to be at low redshift , a condition that also makes them rare . \n the peculiar ic sne , though , are relatively more common , and are bright enough to enable detailed studies with even modest telescopes . study of these objects could be the first step to understanding the grb mechanism . \n while circumstantial arguments had linked sne with grbs , spectroscopic data was needed for irrefutable proof . this crucial piece of evidence arrived in the form of grb  030329 , wherein a direct transformation from grb afterglow to peculiar type ic sne was thoroughly observed . \n later that same year , grb  031203 provided a further link . \n these two , along with sn  1998bw , showed similar spectra . that they were type ic implied that the progenitor was a stripped - envelope star , lending credence to jet - based models for grbs . \n although these grb - sne are rare , low - redshift examples of peculiar type ic sne are not , providing a laboratory to understand stellar explosions in extreme circumstances .", "StartTimeOffset": 2120041085082, "RequestID": "29a07f3d44e12e1bd1f8aeac0b325491192a2ae9", "TotalTokens": 3080}

called magnetars , is also suggested observationally @xcite . \n the surface magnetic field of magnetars can reach as large as @xmath9 gauss , which is determined through the measurements of the rotational period and spin down rate of soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite . according to the population statistics of soft gamma repeaters , \n even @xmath10 of the neutron stars produced via supernovae are expected to be magnetars @xcite . \n the origin of such a strong magnetic field of neutron star is still uncertain . \n maybe , a simple model is caused by fossil magnetic field of progenitor star . \n that is , a small magnetic field in progenitor star would be amplified during the gravitational collapse with conserving the magnetic flux , which produces the strong magnetic field of neutron star @xcite . \n unfortunately , this hypothesis could be difficult to be accepted for magnetars , because the stellar radius with the canonical mass of @xmath11 should be less than the schwarzshild radius defined by @xmath12 to produce a strong surface magnetic field such as @xmath13 gauss @xcite . \n another possibility of the generation mechanism is due to the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism , i.e. , the rapidly rotation of protoneutron star with the rotational period smaller than 3 ms may amplify a seed magnetic field up to @xmath13 gauss @xcite . \n this scenario is also unfavorable from the observations of supernova remnants associated with the magnetar candidates @xcite . \n additionally , the possibility of the ferromagnetism of quark liquid inside the neutron star is suggested as an origin of a strong magnetic field @xcite . \n conceivably , the hint to solve the open question about the origin of strong magnetic field of neutron star , might lay behind the magnetized properties in the core region . \n furthermore , the exact structure of neutron stars is still unclear , because the eos of neutron star matter , especially for high density region , is not fixed yet . \n even so , it is believed that , under the surface ocean composed of molten metal , the neutron - rich nuclei form a lattice structure through the coulomb interaction , which is usually called a crust region @xcite . as the energy density increases up to @xmath14 , the nuclei in the crust region would melt into uniform matter . \n this region corresponds to the core of neutron stars . \n moreover , non - hadronic matter , such as quarks , might appear in deeper part of core region , depending on the theoretical model of neutron star matter @xcite . \n in particular , the neutron star having quark matter is referred to as the hybrid star . inside the hybrid star \n , one has only to consider three flavor quark matter composed of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 quarks , because the more massive quarks can not be produced under the typical energy density of neutron stars . \n since quark matter makes eos soft , the mass of hybrid star is usually expected to be small . in practice , \n most of the hybrid stars proposed up to now might be difficult to reach the observed maximum mass , which is about two solar mass @xcite . or , quark matter occupies very tiny region , even if the massive hybrid stars could be constructed .    along with the origin of magnetic field of neutron star , \n the strength of magnetic field inside the star is also uncertain . \n the dipole magnetic field must dominate outside the star , while the magnetic configuration inside the star may be more complex due to the magnetic instability . according to the virial theorem , the maximum magnetic field for the neutron star with @xmath18 km and @xmath19 could be in the order of @xmath20 gauss @xcite . on the other hand , the maximum magnetic field in the quark phase might reach @xmath21 gauss , adopting the condition that the magnetic energy density should not exceed the energy density of the self - bound quark matter @xcite . \n if the magnetic field inside the star would be so strong , one has to take into account the effect of magnetic field on the neutron star matter , where the quantum effects such as the landau levels may also play an important role to determine the stellar configuration . \n so far , there are a few literatures about the macroscopic structures of hybrid stars under the magnetic field @xcite . considering the effects of the magnetic field in hadronic and quark phases , we find two important differences . \n one is the population of the charged particles : neutrons dominate over charged particles in the hadronic phase , while all the quarks have net electric charge . \n the other one is the difference of the mass of particles : baryons have much larger mass than quarks . \n these two features suggest that the effect of the magnetic field should be more important in quark matter . in this paper \n , we will consider the landau level in the quark phase of hybrid star . \n we derive a critical magnetic field @xmath22 for given density , above which only the lowest landau level is occupied , and find the eos becomes stiffest as a causality limit for @xmath23 , independent of the magnetic field . \n in addition , we especially examine how massive the hybrid star can become with the effect of strong magnetic field . \n we demonstrate that the eos becomes _ stiff _ as a result of the hadron - quark phase transition in the strong magnetic field . \n then , we find that the hybrid star whose mass is more than two solar mass , can have a very large quark core , i.e. ,  _ hybrid quark star _ \" . \n unless otherwise noted , we adopt the geometric unit of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively . \n assuming the uniform magnetic field along the @xmath27 axis , the @xmath28-th energy level of quark with flavor @xmath29 in the strongly magnetic field is given by @xmath30 } , \\label{eq : en}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath17 denote the particle mass , the plank constant , the magnetic field strength , and the degree of freedom of spin , respectively , while @xmath34 with the electron charge @xmath35 . \n as shown later , the lowest landau level ( lll ) plays a primary role in our discussion , where quark matter settles only in lll , the quark number density @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the fermi momentum of quark . since the typical values of the number density and magnetic field are @xmath39 with the saturation density @xmath40 @xmath2 and @xmath41 gauss in this paper , the fermi momentum of quark can be estimated as @xmath42 gev , which is much less than @xmath31 . \n then , the mass term in eq . \n ( [ eq : en ] ) does not significantly contribute to the energy level , @xmath43 . in this case , the energy density of quark @xmath44 is @xmath45 and quark matter becomes flavor symmetric , i.e. , @xmath46 , which leads to @xmath47 . \n we remark that the baryon number density @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 . \n then , the total energy density @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 within the mit bag model , where @xmath52 denotes the bag constant . from eqs . \n ( [ eq : nb ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) , @xmath50 is @xmath53 while the pressure , @xmath54 , is calculated by @xmath55 as a result , one can express @xmath54 as a function of @xmath48 , such as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 gauss ) . \n although the pressure expressed by eq . \n ( [ eq : p ] ) depends on @xmath33 as well as the baryon number density , we can find that the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath50 becomes that @xmath59 , which is independently of the magnetic field strength . from this relationship \n , the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath60 , becomes equivalent to the speed of light @xmath25 . \n thus , this is corresponding to the limiting case of a stiff eos , because @xmath61 can not exceed @xmath25 to keep the causality . note that the eos of free quark matter gives @xmath62 . \n we also remark that our eos would reduce to the same as the eos of free quark matter in the limit of low magnetic field , where quarks occupy all the landau levels . \n the condition that quark matter can settle only in lll is that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the fermi energy of quark . with the relation of @xmath65 in lll \n , one can derive the critical strength of the magnetic field so that quarks only occupy lll for each flavor . \n we then find that the critical strength for @xmath15 quarks is weaker than that for @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , due to the difference of electric charge @xmath66 . \n thus , the condition for all quarks only occupy lll is given by that the magnetic field should be stronger than the critical strength for @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , i.e. , one can show that the magnetic field strength should be larger than the critical strength @xmath22 given by @xmath67{6\\pi^4}\\hbar c}{e}n_{\\rm b}^{2/3 } \\nonumber \\\\             & = & 1.62\\times 10^{19 } \\times\\left(\\frac{n_{\\rm b}}{n_0}\\right)^{2/3 } \\ \n \\rm{gauss}.     \\label{eq : bc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it may be interesting to see that this critical strength is not changed even in the non - relativistic limit . thus the critical strength can be drawn as a universal function of density ( fig . \n [ fig : lll ] ) . \n if the magnetic field exceeds @xmath22 at some density region in quark matter , eos is given by the causal limit there . \n note that eos becomes invariant for the increase of the magnetic field once @xmath23 holds . \n [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ] \n some compact objects have a strong magnetic field , although the details of the distribution of magnetic field inside the stars are still uncertain . \n maybe , one should consider the effects of such strong magnetic field on the structure of compact objects . \n we particularly focus on the hybrid stars in this paper , i.e. , the core region of neutron stars is composed of quark matter . \n we estimate that the critical magnetic field strength above which quarks only occupy lll ( and the second landau level ) , which is shown that @xmath68 gauss . \n we also find that the equation of state ( eos ) in the phase of lll can be expressed as @xmath69 independently of the magnetic field strength , where @xmath52 denotes the bag constant . \n we remark that this is the limit of a stiff eos , i.e. , the sound speed becomes equal to the speed of light . \n we derive these results by using the mit bag model , where quarks move almost freely , so that our findings should be relevant especially in the core region due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , while there may be added non - perturbative effects in the moderate density region \n . further consideration on the eos of quark matter based on qcd is a future subject .    on the other hand , in general \n , the maximum mass of hybrid star comes to be smaller than the observed maximum mass , i.e. , @xmath70 , because the introduction of quark matter makes the eos soft . \n even if one can construct the massive hybrid star , the quark region is generally quite tiny . \n however , owing to the effect of the landau levels in the quark phase , we are successful to construct the massive hybrid quark stars occupied in large part by quark matter , which can be larger than @xmath70 . \n furthermore , in order to examine the qualitative behavior of hybrid stellar models , we simply consider three different connections of quark matter with the hadronic matter . as a result , we find that the stellar model constructed with eos connected to the hadronic matter at the lower energy density can realize more massive stellar model with smaller central energy density . in this paper \n , we consider simple stellar models as a first step , where we neglect the magnetic pressure and the deformation of stellar shape . \n such additional effects will be taken into account elsewhere . \n in addition , one might also have to consider the hadron - quark mixed phase in the more realistic stellar models @xcite . at any rate \n , one could see the properties of such phase modified by the strong magnetic field via the observations of the stellar oscillations @xcite , which tells us an additional information about the strongly magnetized compact objects . \n we are grateful to n. yasutake and t. takatsuka for their fruitful discussions , and also to our referee for reading carefully and giving valuable comments . \n this work was supported in part by grants -

a , -b , and -c eoss , we find that the magnetic field strength at the stellar center is proportional to the strength at the stellar surface as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the magnetic field strength at the stellar surface of the poles ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) , while @xmath102 is a proportionality factor . \n figure [ fig : beta ] shows the value of @xmath102 as a function of stellar mass , where the solid line with circles , broken line with diamonds , and dotted line with squares correspond to the stellar models constructed with the landau - a , -b , and -c eoss . from this figure , we can see that @xmath103 becomes at most five times larger than @xmath99 . \n that is , the central strength of magnetic field can not reach to the critical magnetic field strength to realize the landau effects in quark matter phase even for magnetar with @xmath104 gauss , if the magnetic field configuration inside the star would be simply dipole .", "StartTimeOffset": 2130196880868, "RequestID": "b6f99baca7de5447c1382c0cd17dee6183aa95c1", "TotalTokens": 3845}
{"ContextTokens": 2615, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "in his two seminal papers , @xcite not only showed that two stars can exist in an envelope of a common equipotential and thus resolved the overall hitherto unexplainable properties of w  uma - type stars , but also very clearly indicated that such contact binaries must have very dissimilar components . \n as pointed out by @xcite , evolution can create this dissimilarity . \n the evolutionary state of contact binary stars remains unclear because their spectra can not be analyzed for abundances due to the extreme broadening and blending of spectral lines . \n indirect information though , such as their progressively increasing numbers with age in old open @xcite and globular @xcite clusters , as well as the kinematic characteristics @xcite , very strongly suggest an advanced age of @xmath0 gyr . \n recently , @xcite has developed a model with the currently less massive component being the more evolved one . \n such a model is conceptually very close to that used to explain the semi - detached algols . in his model , \n the current secondary ( less - massive ) components must be in some cases very low in mass to explain systems like aw  uma or sx  crv @xcite .    in this letter we present a summary of results on the component masses ( for 112 systems ) and system angular momenta ( for 93 systems ) for low - temperature contact binaries . \n the sample used was collected mainly from the list of contact binaries defined by @xcite . \n half of the systems have solutions published in the frame of the w  uma project ( papers i - vi ) @xcite . all the rest \n were collected from the literature , the physical parameters of which have been determined accurately , using photometric light curves and radial velocity measurements for both components . we also included the near - contact binaries ( ncbs ) and the detached close binaries ( dcbs ) listed in tables 2 and 3 of @xcite , in order to compare their physical parameters with those of our sample . \n we had to exclude the cases , where the third light and the low - amplitude light variation give unreliable solutions , such as v2150  cyg , v899  her , ht  vir , bl  eri and go  cyg . in some cases , \n close binaries in triple systems have led to spurious solutions and for this reason they were excluded from our sample . other cases with third light contribution do not seem to produce any problem . \n such systems , which are members in multiple systems , have better geometrical configuration and usually have very good spectroscopic determination of the third light contribution , allowing accurate determination of the orbital and physical parameters . \n two systems , v351 peg and v402 aur were very probably incorrectly classified as w - type binaries , although the shape of their light curves does not support such a classification . \n both systems have equal minima in their light curves , making it difficult to distinguish them from each other . \n since their physical parameters ( masses and periods ) were closer to those of a - type binaries , they were classified as a - type systems . \n only recently , good spectroscopic data has become available for more than a hundred contact binaries . since even small - mass secondaries \n can be observed spectroscopically in contact systems , most objects have been analyzed as double - lined binaries bypassing any need of inferences based on single - lined data or solely on sometimes highly unreliable photometric elements ( particularly mass ratios ) . \n in our study we consider component `` 1 '' as the more massive one . \n our assumption is based on the double - lined spectroscopic observations , where the mass ratio is taken as @xmath1 . \n in figure  [ fig1 ] we present the distribution of the component masses versus the orbital period . \n it seems that the secondary components in all systems are very similar in masses , regardless of the orbital period . \n masses of secondaries are between the values of 0 and 1 @xmath2 . \n the mean value of the mass of the secondaries is @xmath3 , while the primaries have masses between 0.5 and @xmath4 ( only hv  uma has @xmath5 ) . \n the same pattern of distribution appears when the masses of a and w - type systems are plotted in separate figures ( figures  [ fig2]a and  [ fig2]b ) . in this case , the average mass of a - type secondaries is equal to @xmath6 and that of w - type equal to @xmath7 . \n it is remarkable to see the similarity of the mass distribution of secondary components with that of white dwarfs @xcite . according to @xcite \n , mass exchange is taking place in the majority of contact binaries and the secondaries are helium - rich objects . in this case \n the masses of the secondary components are expected to be similar or smaller than those of white dwarfs , which could have been grown as cores of isolated stars . \n another interesting feature shown in figure  [ fig1 ] as well as in the upper and lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] is that there is a total absence of systems with periods between 0.5 and 0.6 d. this gap is rather caused by the selection effect of our sample of contact binaries . \n many contact binaries with equal minima and periods close to 12 h are difficult to be observed and can be mistaken as pulsating variables , with a period of 6 h ( i.e. @xmath8 variables ) , or remain unclassified . a recent study @xcite has also showed that many contact binaries are still undetected .    in our sample , \n all w - type systems have orbital periods shorter than 0.5 d , while the a - type systems can have all possible periods in the range considered , with a small preference in large values . \n seven systems ( ck  boo , fp  boo , sx  crv , gr  vir , tz  boo , aw  uma and fg  hya ) ( especially aw  uma , sx  crv and tz  boo ) are plotted with triangles in all figures , as they are low - q systems with very low - mass secondaries ( @xmath9 ) . in these systems \n the rotational angular momentum is mostly `` absorbed '' from the primary component and plays a significant role on the total angular momentum of the system . \n according to @xcite these very low - q systems can not exist , since @xmath10 . \n there is a co - existence of a and w - type systems with periods between 0.3 and 0.5 d. all systems with @xmath11 d are of w - type and all with @xmath12 d are of a - type . \n a very interesting feature is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the total mass of the above systems is plotted versus the period . \n it is obvious that a - type systems are in general more massive than w - type ones . for comparison , \n in the same graph , we plotted the total mass of our cbs with the total mass of the short - period ( @xmath13 ) ncbs and dcbs , taken from @xcite . \n one can see that most of the ncb and dcb systems have total mass similar to that of a - type contact binaries but larger than that of w - type contact binaries . \n these observational facts strongly support the evolutionary progress from near - contact into contact configuration of a - type , without the need of mass loss from the system , as proposed by @xcite . \n further progress in this direction , may transform the a - type systems into w - type , with a simultaneous mass loss , or can lead the a - type systems to become binaries with extreme small mass ratio . \n the opposite direction would require the total mass to increase , which is unreasonable . \n in figure  [ fig4 ] we present a plot of the orbital angular momentum versus the orbital period . in this plot \n we see that a - type systems generally tent to have larger angular momenta than the w - type systems . on the top of each point in the graph \n , a vertical line is added , representing the amount of the spin angular momentum of the two components . \n the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta will give the total angular momentum of each system . \n in this way it can be seen that the angular momentum of close binaries can be studied with either the orbital or the total angular momentum . \n the orbital angular momentum is not affected from observational or modeling errors , but only from masses and orbital periods . on the other hand , \n the spin angular momentum is affected from the errors in mass , radius and from the assumption we make for the radius of gyration , which is still under investigation @xcite . \n for example , a slightly smaller radius of gyration would shift the seven low - q systems of our sample in a stable state . \n figure  [ fig4 ] shows that formation of w - type systems from a - type is possible to be done , but the opposite direction is not strongly supported . \n evolution from a - type to w - type systems seems to occure with a simultaneous mass and angular momentum loss , unless the evolutionary direction , after the ncbs evolve to contact systems , follows two separate tracks . \n however , we can not exclude the possibility that some a - type systems with small angular momentum have evolved from w - type systems , while others ( with large angular momentum ) have evolved directly from ncbs @xcite . \n do both a and w - type contact binaries have the same origin ? is the one type progenitor of the other ? \n the above questions are still open for investigation . \n the main result of the present study , taking into account the masses and angular momenta of contact binaries , is that the w - type systems can not produce a - type binaries , since angular momentum and mass can not be added to a system , but only lost from it . \n it seems more reasonable that a - type systems evolve to w - type systems by loosing mass and angular momentum . \n a similar evolutionary direction from long to short period binaries @xcite showed that systems with longer periods are kinematically young ( age 2 gyr ) in contrast to those with shorter periods ( age 8 gys ) . \n an interesting result extracted from our plots is that the secondary components in close binary systems are very similar in mass . \n scatter of the points in our plots is mainly due to inaccurate photometric and spectroscopic solutions and/or a possible undetected third light contribution . \n since the best of the available data is used in our sample , only the third light could produce a problem and this is why some solutions are excluded from our sample . \n a very recent study of @xcite about the formation of contact binaries in multiple systems , suggests that a large percentage of close binaries is formed into triple and multiple systems . \n in such a case , a small amount of unreliability is added to all the solutions , if they are affected from an undetected third light . \n our observational evidence ( figures 1 - 4 ) strongly supports the argument that the evolutionary process is from ncbs to a - type contact binaries , without any need of mass loss from the system . \n the next step in this scenario may lead either to a transformation of a - type to w - type systems with a simultaneous mass and angular momentum loss , or to a - type systems with extremely low mass ratio . \n these systems will eventually merge into a single , fast - rotating object . \n the opposite direction of evolution seems to be impossible , since it requires an increase of the total mass and angular momentum of the system . \n the authors gratefully acknowledge professor s. rucinski for his valuable help during the preparation of the manuscript and for many insightful discussions and new ideas about contact binary structure and evolution , as well as the anonymous referee for useful suggestions , which improved the article . \n this project was supported by the special account for research grants no 70/3/7187 ( hrakleitos ) and 70/3/7382 ( pythagoras ) of the national and kapodistrian university of athens , greece . \n rucinski , s. m. , 1998 , aj , 116 , 2998 rucinski , s. m. , 2000 , aj , 120 , 319 rucinski , s. m. , 2002 , pasp , 114 , 1124 stepien , k. , 2004 , in dupree a.k . , \n , eds , proc . iau symp . \n 219 , stars as suns : activity , evolution and planets . \n , san fransisco , p. 967", "StartTimeOffset": 2136674330838, "RequestID": "b9df40592c0b7d40073eacda01ebcb898ffcb7f6", "TotalTokens": 2763}
{"ContextTokens": 2875, "GeneratedTokens": 215, "SynthesizedBody": "many dwarf irregular galaxies ( dig ) are known to be in a starburst phase , or are believed to have experienced periods of intense star formation in the recent past . \n these galaxies are generally called blue compact dwarfs ( bcd ) . \n energetic events associated with star formation ( stellar winds and supernova explosions ) may sweep the interstellar gas out of the region actively forming stars , thus creating galactic winds . \n observational evidences of outflows have been found recently in many edge - on starburst galaxies , like ngc1705 , ngc1569 and ngc3628 . \n martin ( 1998 ) found that large expanding supershells are common byproducts of massive star formation in dwarf galaxies . \n both dynamical and chemical simulations of these galaxies have suggested the existence of a ` differential galactic wind ' , in the sense that , after a starburst event , these objects would loose mostly metals ( pilyugin 1992 , 1993 ; marconi , matteucci & tosi 1994 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ; dercole & brighenti 1999 ) . however in none of these studies , detailed chemical and dynamical evolution was taken into account at the same time .    among bcd , the galaxy izw18 ( the most metal - poor galaxy locally known ) constitutes the best candidate for a truly `` young '' galaxy . \n however , there is still a debate in literature on whether izw18 is experiencing the first burst of star formation or not . \n evolutionary population synthesis models by mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) show that the present burst is very young ( between 3 and 13 myr ) and the contribution of older stars , if any , is negligible . \n dynamical arguments ( martin 1996 ) suggest a single burst with an age between 15 and 27 myr . recent color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies of izw18 , both in the optical ( aloisi , tosi & greggio 1999 ; hereafter atg ) and in the infrared ( stlin 2000 ) , revealed the presence of an underlying older population , with an age of some 10@xmath0 yr . \n legrand ( 2000 ) and legrand et al . ( 2000 ) proposed instead a low and continuous star formation regime for izw18 . \n we study , through numerical simulations , the dynamical and chemical evolution of a gas - rich dwarf galaxy whose structural parameters resembles izw18 . \n we consider single instantaneous starburst or a couple of starburst separated by a quiescent period . \n we include effects ( both energetical and chemical ) of type ii and type ia sne in a detailed way . \n the aim of this work is to test the ` differential wind ' hypothesis with an hydrodynamical approach and to find constraints for the number and for the age of the starburts in izw18 . \n we consider a gaseous component in hydrostatic isothermal equilibrium with the centrifugal force and a potential well . \n the potential well is the sum of a quasi - isothermal dark halo ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) and an oblate king profile . \n the mass of gas inside the galactic region ( an ellipsoid with dimensions 1 kpc @xmath3 730 pc ) is @xmath4 m@xmath2 .    to describe the evolution of the ism \n , we adopt a 2-d hydrocode , with source terms describing the rate of mass and energy return from the starbursts , taking into account sne of type ii and ia and low and intermediate - mass stars ( ims ) . by using passively evolving tracers \n , we are able to follow the evolution , in space and time , of some chemical elements of particular astrophysical interest . \n the production of these elements are obtained following the nucleosynthesis prescriptions from various authors : woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for sneii , nomoto , thielemann & yokoi for sneia and renzini & voli ( 1981 ) , case r , or van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) , case v , for ims . \n see recchi , matteucci & dercole ( 2001 ) for more details about model prescriptions .    in the single - burst model , the mass of stars formed is @xmath5 m@xmath2 , whereas in the two - burst model we consider a weaker first burst ( the mass of stars is @xmath6 m@xmath2 ) . \n after 300 myr ( model m300 ) or 500 myr ( model m500 ) we consider that 10% of cold gas inside a central region ( a sphere of 200 pc of radius ) is turned into stars . \n the initial abundances of this second stellar generation are simply the metallicity of the cold gas in the central region at the onset of the burst . according to the results of atg , we consider also a flatter imf ( model m300f ) , with a slope @xmath7 . \n more details about these two - burst models are in recchi et al . \n ( 2001b ) . \n the efficiency of sn heating is assumed to be very low for type ii sne . in particular , \n following results of bradamante , matteucci & dercole ( 1998 ) , we consider a thermalization efficiency of @xmath8 for the single - burst model and @xmath9 for the two - burst model , namely only 3% ( or 5% ) of the explosion energy is able to thermalize the ism , while the rest is radiated away . \n type ia sne instead explode in an already heated and diluted medium , thus their thermalization efficiency is assumed to be @xmath10 . \n there is debate in literature about the correct value of thermalization efficiency . \n in particular , strickland & stevens ( 1999 ) assume a value @xmath11 ( see also the contribution of strickland in this volume ) . \n the reason of our choice is that the number of sneii exploding in our model is rather low , thus the time interval between single explosions ( @xmath12 yr ) is larger than the typical cooling time - scale , thus remnant of type ii sne evolve as single snr . \n in addition , we tried to run simulations with an efficiency @xmath11 also for type ii sne and the galaxy is quickly devoided of gas , thus the actual gas content in izw18 rules out the possibility of an high @xmath13 . \n owing to the energy released by type ii sne , a galactic wind develops . \n it expands faster along the z direction , where the ism density gradient is steeper . \n sneii activity lasts for only 29 myr ( the lifetime of a 8 m@xmath2 star ) , then is replaced by a weaker snia wind , not strong enough to sustain the galactic outflow ( fig . \n 1 ) . after @xmath14 300 myr , \n the expanding ism is diluted enough and the hot bubble finally breaks out through a funnel . \n most of the sneii ejecta reamins locked into the cold and dense shell , whereas metals ejected by sneia are easily channelled along the funnel . \n iron , mostly produced by type ia sne , is thus easily lost by the galaxy and the [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios ouside the galaxy are lower than inside ( see section 4 ) . owing to the low evolution of the superbubble , \n the internal cavity becomes soon radiative ( i.e. radiates an energy comparable to the thermal energy content of the shocked wind ) thus after @xmath14 10 myr most of metals are in a cold phase . \n owing to the low luminosity of the first burst , after @xmath14 300 myr a galactic wind still does not develop . \n for the model m300 a cold , dense shell of dimensions 200 @xmath3 100 pc forms and outside this region the ism is almost unperturbed . \n the impact of the second generation of stars on the ism dynamics is rather vigorous . \n already after @xmath14 30 myr after the onset of the second burst a breakout occurs ( see fig . 1 ) and \n the gas produced during this second burst is easily lost along the galactic chimney . \n the hypothesis of a differential wind is substantially confirmed in these simulations : metals are ejected more easily than pristine ism . also for the two - burst model the ejecta of type ia sne are lost more easily , but this effect is less evident compared to single - burst model . \n the consequence of this selective losses of metals is that [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside .      the evolution of oxygen abundance and c / o and n / o ratios for the single - burst model , cases r and v ( left panels ) and for the two - burst models m300 , cases r and v and m300f , case v only ( right panels ) are shown in fig . \n 2 . shaded areas represents the observed values found in literature for izw18    single - burst model reproduces the observed abundances of izw18 only for a very short time , at an age of @xmath14 31 myr . after this time , n / o ratio begins to increase over the permitted range , owing to the n produced by intermediate - mass stars . \n model m300 is able to reproduce observed abundances of izw18 for a wider range of times : between 25 and 40 myr after the onset of the second burst ( case r ) and between 50 and 70 myr ( case v ) . \n the m300f model produces too much oxygen during the first burst of star formation and does not fit the observed abundance ratios , unless the age of the second burst is extremely short ( around 4 myr ) . \n model m500 ( not shown here ) is able to fit abundances found in literature for an evolutionary time between 40 and 80 myr . \n our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * energetic events associated with the starbursts , are able to trigger a galactic wind and the metals produced in the burst leave the galaxy more easily thaan the unprocessed gas . * in particular , \n the ejecta of type ia sne are lost more efficiently than type ii sne , because this kind of explosions occur in a hot and rarefied medium . \n the consequence is that [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside . \n this effect is more evident in the single - burst model . * \n single - burst model reproduces the observed abundances in izw18 after @xmath14 31 myr , while for the two - burst model we obtain agreement with the data found in literature for wider ranges of time , when the second starburst has an age of some tenth of myr , depending on the adopted model and nucleosynthesis prescriptions . * the classical salpeter imf should be preferred over a flatter one which would predict a too high oxygen abundance . * \n finally , we can suggest that a first , weak burst of star formation , occurred more than 300 myr ago , followed by a stronger one , having an age of some tenth of myr , with a salpeter imf , best reproduces the properties of izw18 . \n aloisi , a. , tosi , m. & greggio , l. 1999 , , 118 , 302 ( atg ) bradamante , f. , matteucci , f. & dercole , a. 1998 , , 337 , 338 dercole , a. & brighenti , f. 1999 , , 309 , 941 legrand , f. 2000 , , 354 , 504 legrand , f. , kunth , d. , roy , j .- \n r . , mas -

{"ContextTokens": 2549, "GeneratedTokens": 57, "SynthesizedBody": "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are metal poor ( @xmath0 ) and gas - rich extragalactic systems undergoing brief ( @xmath1 yr ) bursts of star formation , separated by long ( @xmath2 gyr ) quiescent phases ( see thuan 1991 for a review ) . \n the detection of an extended and old low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) stellar component underlying the regions of active star formation in the majority of bcds ( loose  &  thuan 1986 , kunth et al . \n 1988 ) implies that such systems are old gas - rich dwarf galaxies undergoing recurrent activity phases . \n this faint , however dynamically important , mass constituent in bcds , together with the -gas and dark matter , determines the gravitational potential within which starbursts occur . \n the physical origin of starbursts in the mostly isolated bcds is not yet understood . \n hypotheses put forward invoke a dynamical perturbation by a nearby -cloud ( taylor et al . \n 1994 ) , interaction / merging with another dwarf galaxy ( comte et al . \n 1996 ) , or inflow and collapse of their massive -halo onto the stellar lsb - component ( loose & fricke 1981 ) . \n the prime intrinsic properties of a bcd controlling the morphology , the spatial extent , and the strength of the burst are still a matter of debate . among the hypotheses proposed \n are a massive , bcd - specific , dark matter halo dominating entirely the mass ( meurer et al . \n 1998 ) . in another scenario \n the mass and the structural properties of the stellar lsb - component , i.e. the shape of the gravitational potential of the underlying old stellar population , are believed to regulate the global star - formation process ( papaderos et al . \n 1996 ) . \n a further issue is related to the evolutionary links between bcds and other classes of galaxies such as dwarf irregulars dis and dwarf ellipticals des . \n papaderos et al . \n ( 1996 ) found that , at equal b - luminosity , the structural properties of the underlying host galaxy of bcds do systematically differ from dis / des : at m@xmath3=16 mag the central surface brightness and the exponential scale length of the lsb - component of bcds are by @xmath4 mag brighter and by factors @xmath5 smaller than dis / des . \n this result , corroborated in the range of more luminous bcds by marlowe et al . \n ( 1997 ) , implies that the commonly accepted evolutionary connection between bcds and dis can not be maintained unless the lsb component of bcds can undergo dynamical changes such as expansion and contraction on time scales of few @xmath6 yr ( papaderos et al . \n 1996 ) . \n recent investigations ( van zee et al . 1998 ) reveal that bcds show , unlike dis , a compact and dense -distribution peaking typically very close to the intensity maximum of the starburst component ( see also taylor et al . \n thus , if bcds are dis seen in active stages , the onset of a starburst must be accompanied by a large scale contraction of the massive gas - halo . \n once a burst is initiated , star formation processes as well as the subsequent dynamical evolution of a bcd may sensitively depend on the formation circumstances of a hot ( few @xmath7 k ) gas phase , a process manifesting itself in the formation of bubbles expanding within the ambient cold gas medium ( marlowe et al . \n 1995 , heckman et al . \n 1995 , bomans et al . 1997 ) . \n although , in terms of its mass , this tenuous hot gas - phase may not be dynamically important , the pressure it exerts on the ambient cold -gas has obvious consequences . \n the gradual increase of the volume filling factor of the hot gas phase within the optical bcd , i.e. the replacement of the -gas by a warm / hot gas phase may lead to a flattening of the gravitational potential , thus initiating an adiabatic expansion of the stellar lsb - component .    understanding the formation characteristics and evolution of this hot \n , x - ray emitting gas - phase in the course of a starburst is , therefore , a basic requirement for gaining insights into the dynamical evolution and the activity status of bcds . \n ( 16.8,5.2 ) ( 6.2,0 ) ( 12.2,0 )    in sect.2 we shall briefly introduce a further paradigm of the formation of a hot gas - phase in a bcd on the basis of x - ray and optical data and in sect.3 we discuss links between the structure of the stellar lsb - component and the activity of a bcd as it imprints its integrated x - ray properties . \n ( 16.8,6.25 ) \n the morphological properties of this wolf - rayet galaxy have prompted different interpretations of its nature and of the origin of its starburst activity . in one of them henize  2 - 10 is regarded a typical bcd ( corwin et al . \n 1993 ) , similar to those discussed in loose & thuan ( 1986 ) . on the other hand , the presence of two star - forming regions ( bergvall 1985 , johansson 1987 ) and the kinematics of its neutral and molecular gas ( kobulnicki et al . \n 1995 ) led to the hypothesis that henize  2 - 10 is a system of two merging dwarf galaxies . \n figure  1 shows that either starburst knot is embedded within a nearly circular stellar envelope dominating the light for @xmath8  b  . \n the average b \n r index of this lsb component of @xmath9 1.3 mag ( fig . \n 1,right ) as well as its smooth morphology suggest an old , dynamically relaxed stellar population . \n its intensity distribution can be approximated by an exponential fitting law with a central surface brightness @xmath10  and a scale length @xmath11=670@xmath120.12 pc , i.e. structural properties which are typical for bcds ( cf . \n papaderos et al . \n 1996 ) . \n ( 16.8,6.4 )    this is also the case for the concentration index ci=0.88 which is close to the expected value for a host galaxy with the absolute luminosity of that of henize  2 - 10 . on the other hand , the disturbed b \n r morphology ( fig . \n 3,left ) and the evidence described above suggest that he  2 - 10 may be a dynamically perturbed bcd . \n a thermal bremsstrahlung fit to the pspc - spectrum of henize  2 - 10 yields an average plasma temperature kt=(0.49@xmath13 ) kev and an intrinsic 0.12.4 kev luminosity of = ( 7.6@xmath14)@xmath15   in agreement with the value log(l@xmath16/)=4041 derived by hensler et al . \n ( 1997 ) and stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) . as hri - maps \n reveal ( fig . \n 2,left ) roughly one half of the x - ray emission is contributed by a compact high surface brightness source , being probably located slightly offset from the most luminous starburst knot , close to the region with low -surface density discovered by kobulnicky et al . \n ( 1995 ; cf . their fig . \n given , however , the positional uncertainty of @xmath17   in hri - maps a further check is required . \n the remaining x - ray emission extends on scales comparable to those of the -emission , the faint outskirt of the latter being visible out to @xmath905 ( 1.3 kpc ) from the nuclear region . \n the -equivalent width map of the central region of henize  2 - 10 ( fig . \n 2,right ) suggests a kinematically perturbed ism on kpc - scales with two marked supershells expanding from either starburst knot roughly perpendicular to the plane of the co - complex . \n the cavity delineated by the eastern supershell coincides with an extended blue region with an average b \n r index @xmath18 mag . \n this feature being centered @xmath19northeast from the eastern starburst knot does not seem to be associated with any conspicuous local enhancement of the stellar background ( cf . \n sauvage et al . \n 1997 , beck et al . \n an analysis in progress ( papaderos et al . \n 1998a ) focusses on the nature of the eastern shell , in particular the question of whether it may be driven by a mixture of warm and hot x - ray emitting gas inflating its interior . the measured b \n r index is consistent with the values between 0.48 and 1.1 mag predicted by krger ( 1992 ) for a photoionized gaseous continuum with metallicities of 1/20@xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . \n + these results show that henize  2 - 10 is a well suited laboratory for studying the interplay between the cold , warm and hot gas phase of a bcd in the course of a violent starburst \n . a continued investigation of this system , in particular with the help of spatially resolved x - ray maps , is apparently of great interest . \n the x - ray emission as a consequence of the starburst phenomenon , in particular the x - ray to b - luminosity ratio , may hold important information on the activity status of starburst galaxies ( cf . \n fricke & papaderos , these proceedings ) . a preliminary analysis of rosat - detected bcds ( papaderos et al . \n 1998b ) indicates that among them the more metal - rich objects follow , similar to colliding starburst galaxies , a trend of increasing  with increasing -ratio . \n thus , in certain evolutionary stages the -ratio may be regarded a measure of the burst strength . \n this , however , may not be the case in a late starburst age , when most of the x - ray emitting gas formed in a bcd inflates the galactic halo where , through adiabatic expansion , it may obtain spectral properties and a surface brightness comparable to those of the diffuse x - ray background . \n ngc  1705 ( hensler et al . 1998 , cf . their figs . \n 1&2 ) may be considered an example of this later starburst phase . \n next we shall comment on one of the questions posed in sect.1 : how the structural properties of the underlying stellar component in a bcd may influence the starburst phenomenon . in fig.4 ( top ) \n the -ratio for a sample of bcds is compared with the exponential scale length @xmath11 of their lsb component . in the lower diagram \n is correlated with the ratio of the central luminosity density of the lsb component of bcds with that of dis , @xmath22 . \n both diagrams show a trend for increasing -ratio with decreasing @xmath11 and increasing @xmath22 . from the latter trends and fig.8 in papaderos et al . \n ( 1996 ) follows that the most compact and most mass - poor bcds show the highest -ratio . \n stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) remarked that a sudden increase in the -ratio is to be expected in an instantaneous burst with age @xmath23 myr . \n by contrast , enduring star - formation is not expected to lead to such a strong increase in . combining all latter lines of evidence with the --trend \n the present results may be interpreted as follows : bursts igniting in compact and less - massive bcds are more violent than in the more massive ones , in the sense that they must be shorter and characterized by a higher burst parameter .", "StartTimeOffset": 2150724885672, "RequestID": "b41ec8507da0d0a0dc678e6a773f8adba6cb716a", "TotalTokens": 2606}
{"ContextTokens": 3624, "GeneratedTokens": 289, "SynthesizedBody": "it was firstly proposed by s. hod that the scalar field can have real bound states in the near - extremal kerr black hole @xcite . soon later \n , it was reported in @xcite that massive scalar fields can form bound states around kerr black holes by using the numerical method to solve the scalar field equation in the background . \n this bound states are the stationary scalar configurations in the black hole backgrounds , which are regular at the horizon and outside . \n they are named as scalar clouds . \n more importantly , it was shown that the backreaction of clouds can generate a new family of kerr black holes with scalar hair @xcite . \n it is suggested that whenever clouds of a given matter field can be found around a black hole , in a linear analysis , there exists a fully non - linear solution of new hairy black hole correspondingly . \n however , it requires that the field originating clouds yields a time independent energy momentum tensor . \n generally , the field should be complex , and have a factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the superradiance critical frequency . \n for instance , real scalar fields can give rise to clouds but not hairy black holes @xcite . \n so , it seems that the studies of scalar clouds in the linear level are very important for us to find the hairy black holes in the non - linear level . \n this subject has attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite . \n generally speaking , the existence of stationary bound states of matter fields in the black hole backgrounds requires two necessary conditions . \n the first is that the matter fields should undergo the classical superradiant phenomenon @xcite in the black hole background . \n this condition can be satisfied by the bosonic fields in the rotating black holes or the charged scalar fields in the charged black holes @xcite . \n when the frequencies of these matter fields @xmath11 are smaller than the superradiant critical frequency @xmath10 , there are time growing quasi - bound states . \n when @xmath12 , the fields are time decaying . \n so , the scalar clouds exists at the boundary between these two regimes , i.e. the frequencies of the fields are taken as the superradiant critical frequency @xmath10 . for the rotating black holes , the critical frequency @xmath10 is @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal index and @xmath2 is the horizon angular velocity . while for the charged black holes , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charge of scalar field , and @xmath5 is the horizon electrostatic potential . \n the second one is there should be a potential well outside the black hole horizon in which the bound states can be trapped . \n this potential well may be provided by the mass term of the field , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass of the scalar field . however , \n sometimes the artificial boundary conditions can also play the same role .    in this paper , we will study the scalar clouds in a spherically symmetric and charged background . \n specifically , we will consider the charged scalar field in the backgrounds of the charged stringy black holes . at first sight \n , it seems that the massive scalar field can form the clouds in this background . \n however , it is proved that the the massive charged scalar field is stable in this background and there is no superradiant instability @xcite . to generate the superradiant instability @xcite \n , the mirror - like boundary condition should be imposed according to the black hole bomb mechanism @xcite . \n the analytical and the numerical studies on this subject can be found in @xcite and @xcite . correspondingly , the scalar clouds are only possible with the mirror -

gordon equation @xmath23 where @xmath4 denotes the charge of the scalar field . by taking the ansatz of the scalar field @xmath24 , where @xmath11 is the conserved energy of the mode , \n @xmath25 is the spherical harmonic index , and @xmath1 is the azimuthal harmonic index with @xmath26 , one can deduce the radial wave equation in the form of @xmath27 where we have introduced a new function @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the potential function is given by @xmath31    the superradiant condition of the charged scalar field is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electric potential at the horizon@xcite . \n it is proved in @xcite that the massive charged scalar field is stable in this black hole background . to have superradiant instability \n , we should impose the mirror - like boundary condition @xcite . in order to study the bound states , \n we shall focus on the critical case that the scalar frequency equals to the superradiant critical frequency , i.e. @xmath34    to solve the radial equation ( 5 ) , we should impose the following boundary conditions , which are given by @xmath35 the first line indicates that the scalar field is regular near the horizon and the second line implies that the system is placed in a perfectly reflecting cavity . \n the numerical methods employed in this problem are based on the shooting method , which is also called the direct integration ( di ) method @xcite . \n it is shown that the di method is specially suited to find stationary field configuration with the mirror - like boundary condition . \n firstly , near the event horizon @xmath20 , we require the radial function is regular and expand the radial function @xmath36 as a generalized power series in terms of @xmath37 as have done in the first line of eq.(9 ) . because the radial equation is linear \n , we can take @xmath38 without loss of generality . substituting expansion of the radial wave function into the radial equation ( 5 ) \n , we can solve the coefficient @xmath39 order by order in terms of @xmath37 . \n we have only considered six terms in the expansion . \n the @xmath39s can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath40 , which are not exhibited here . \n then , we can integrate the radial equation ( 5 ) from @xmath41 and stop the integration at the radius of the mirror . in this procedure \n , we have taken the small @xmath42 as @xmath43 \n . the procedure can be repeated by varying the input parameters @xmath40 until the mirror - like boundary condition @xmath44 is reached with the desired precision . \n we can use a numerical root finder to search the location of the mirror that support the stationary scalar configuration . \n we have found that , for the given input parameters @xmath40 , scalar clouds exist for a discrete set of @xmath6 , which is labeled by the quantum number @xmath45 of nodes of the radial function @xmath36 . \n firstly , we make a comparison of the numerical and analytical results . from the analytical result eq.(35 ) in ref.@xcite , one can obtain the mirror radius that supports scalar cloud can be approximately given by @xmath46 we have labeled the @xmath47-th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath48 as @xmath49 . \n the numerical results show that this `` quantum number '' is closely connected with the nodes number @xmath45 of the radial function @xmath36 towards the simple relation @xmath50 . \n it should be noted that this analytical expression for the mirror radius is only valid for the case of @xmath7 . with the condition @xmath7 \n , the asymptotic expansion matched method can be employed to solve the radial equation approximately @xcite . in fig.(1 ) , we have displayed the analytical results and the numerical results of the mirror location @xmath6 in terms of the black hole charge @xmath19 . here \n , we do not consider the naked singularity spacetime , so that the value range of black hole charge @xmath19 is @xmath51 $ ] , where we have fixed the black hole mass as @xmath52 . \n it is shown that the analytical results of mirror location @xmath6 for the clouds are perfectly coincide with the numerical results , even in the region where the analytical approximation is unapplicable . \n when @xmath53 , the analytical approximation is always precise in all range of @xmath19 . \n when @xmath54 , the analytical results have obvious difference with the numerical results only for large @xmath19 .    in fig.(2 ) , we have drawn the mirror location @xmath6 that support the scalar cloud as a function of the black hole charge @xmath19 for various values of node number @xmath45 of the radial function . \n it is observed that , when the black hole charge @xmath19 increases , we need to place the reflecting mirror more closer to the horizon in order to have a scalar cloud . when the node number @xmath45 of radial function increases , the plotted lines become away from the axis . \n this observation is coincide with the analytical result ( 10 ) in the regime of @xmath7 .    in fig.(3 ) and ( 4 ) , we display the mirror location @xmath6 as a function of the black hole charge @xmath19 for various different @xmath25 and @xmath4 \n . we can observe that , the lines become far away from the axis when increasing @xmath25 , while the lines become more closer to the axis when increasing the scalar charge @xmath4 . \n this is also expected from the analytical result ( 10 ) . \n in addition , fig.(3 ) and ( 4 ) together with fig.(2 ) show that , when @xmath55 , @xmath56 . \n this indicates that there is no massless scalar cloud for schwarzschild black hole with the mirror - like boundary condition @xcite , even thought it is possible for massive scalar fields in schwarzschild black hole to have arbitrarily long - lived quasi - bound states @xcite . \n we also consider the radial dependence of the massless scalar clouds . in fig.(5 ) and ( 6 ) , we have fixed the mirror radius as @xmath57 . \n we can solve the radial equation numerically and obtain a discrete set of black hole charge @xmath19 which is labeled by the node number @xmath45 of the radial wave equation . \n then we can integrate the radial equation for the fixed node numbers and obtain the corresponding numerical solutions of the radial wave functions . \n it is shown that the radial profile have the typical forms of standing waves with the fixed boundary conditions . \n we have also calculated the case that @xmath58 . \n the results is not present here . \n the general form of the radial wave function is similar to the profiles in fig.(5 ) .    in fig.(7 ) \n , we consider the case that the mirror location is very close to the horizon . \n we take the mirror radius as @xmath59 . from our previous analytical and numerical work on the superradiant instability of scalar field in the background of the charged stringy black hole plus mirror system , we need a large scalar field charge @xmath4 . here , we set @xmath60 . \n we can see that , the scalar field can be bounded by the reflecting mirror very near the horizon to form the clouds . the radial wave function in this case have the similar profiles as fig.(5 ) and ( 6 ) . \n in the above numerical calculations , we find the radial equation becomes hard to integrate when the scalar charge @xmath4 is large . \n so it is important to make an analytical study of the stationary charged scalar clouds in the @xmath8 regime . in this section \n , we will give an analytical expression of special mirror radius @xmath6 in @xmath8 limit , for which the charged scalar field can be confined to form stationary cloud configuration . \n following @xcite , it is convenient to introduce new dimensionless variables @xmath61 in terms of which the radial equation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath62r=0\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have submit the superradiance critical frequency @xmath3 in the above equation . \n this equation can be solved by bessel function in the double limit @xmath63 in this asymptotic regime , the radial equation can be reduced to @xmath64 the solution is then given by the bessel function of the first kind @xmath65 i.e. , the stationary scalar field is then described by the above function . by taking account to the mirror - like boundary condition @xmath66 , we can obtain the special mirror radius @xmath6 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath45th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath69 . from this expression \n , we can see that , when @xmath70 , the reflecting mirror should be placed very near the horizon to form the cloud configuration . \n this is consistent with the near horizon condition @xmath71 . \n in summary , in this paper , we have studied the massless scalar clouds in the charged stringy black holes with the mirror - like boundary conditions . \n the scalar clouds are stationary bound states satisfying the superradiant critical frequency @xmath3 . \n the scalar clouds in rotating black holes @xcite can be heuristically interpreted in terms of a mechanical equilibrium between the black hole - cloud gravitational attraction and angular momentum driven repulsion . for the charged black hole cases , \n the charged clouds can not be formed because gravitational attraction and electromagnetic repulsion can not reach equilibrium @xcite . \n additional mirror should be placed at special location to reflect the charged scalar wave . \n we show that , for the specific set of black hole and scalar field parameters , the clouds are only possible for the specific mirror location @xmath6 . \n for example , for the fixed parameters of black hole and scalar field @xmath72 , the discrete set of the mirror location @xmath6 is characterized by the node number @xmath45 of the radial wave function . \n it is shown that , the analytical results of mirror location @xmath6 for the clouds are perfectly coincide with the numerical results in the region of @xmath7 . \n however , the agreement becomes less impressive for @xmath73 values . \n in addition , we also show that the massless scalar clouds are also possible when the mirror locations are very close to the horizon . at last , \n we present an analytical calculation of the specific mirror locations @xmath6 for the scalar clouds in the @xmath8 regime . \n the authors would like to thank dr . \n hongbao zhang for useful discussion on the numerical methods . \n this work was supported by nsfc , china ( grant no . \n 11205048 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2162650027014, "RequestID": "173de8f41723385d991e64fda77dc097390d79d8", "TotalTokens": 3913}

although the nlo heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory predicts that finite size effects for charmed baryons are less than 1 % , higher order terms may give significant contributions . \n a direct confirmation in lattice qcd by comparing spectra among different lattice volumes is desirable . \n second , strong decays such as @xmath39 are not taken into account in our analysis , since @xmath39 is kinematically prohibited on our lattice volume . \n last but not least , our results are obtained at a single lattice spacing without continuum extrapolation . although a naive order counting gives a percent level of cutoff effects from @xmath40 terms in the relativistic heavy quark action , the continuum extrapolation is necessary to remove this uncertainty . \n additional calculations should be performed in the future to remove all systematic errors mentioned above . \n for doubly and triply charmed baryons , an experimental value has been reported only for @xmath4 , though the

of singly charmed baryons are consistent with experiments within 2 @xmath33 uncertainty . \n this confirms that we are able to control charm quark mass corrections successfully , not only in the meson

{"ContextTokens": 2780, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are extreme extragalactic objects with an observed luminosity outshining their host galaxy . their non - thermal continuum emission extending from radio band to x rays or @xmath0 rays suggest underlying relativistic emission mechanisms . \n agn have been subject to comprehensive studies since their discovery , leading to classification and unification schemes based on multiwavelength observations and polarization measurements  @xcite . in this frame , \n agn are classified as either radio - quiet or radio - loud , and blazars constitute a subclass of the latter , with their jet axis oriented close to the observer s line of sight . \n this particular orientation combined with relativistic beaming gives rise to prominent observational features in blazars , such as anisotropic radiation , rapid variability , high polarization and superluminal motion . \n blazars are divided into two subclasses , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacertae objects ( bl lac ) . \n fsrqs are characterized by a broad line emission region , depicted with strong lines in their optical spectra , that are not present in bl lacs . \n the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars exhibit a two - component structure , with a low - energy component peaking around ir to uv band and a high - energy one around x - ray to @xmath0-ray energies . \n the underlying emission mechanism reponsible for low - energy component is believed to be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the blazar jets . on the other hand , the high - energy component could either have leptonic  @xcite or hadronic  @xcite origin . \n instrumental selection effects brought up two distinct classes for bl lacs as radio - selected ( rbl ) or x - ray - selected ( xbl ) . \n this instrumental classification was later replaced with a more physical one based on radio to optical and optical to x - ray spectral indices , introducing the terminology of _ high- _ and _ low - frequency - cutoff _ bl lac objects ( hbls and lbls )  @xcite . \n another approach based on the peak frequency of the synchrotron component of the sed is also used to define the same classification ( _ high- _ and _ low - frequency - peaked _ bl lacs as hbls and lbls ) . \n detection of intermediate objects ( ibls ) between these two observationally distinct groups has made it more plausible that bl lac objects constitute a continuum rather than a discrete sequence  ( e.g.,@xcite ) . \n mkn 421 was the first blazar and extragalactic object detected as a very high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath1gev ) @xmath0-ray emitter with the whipple telescope in 1992  @xcite . \n since then , different candidate selection methods have been applied to radio , x - ray or high - energy ( he ; @xmath1mev ) @xmath0-ray blazar data in the aim of finding new tev blazars  @xcite . to date , 40 blazars have been detected in the tev sky , with a census consisting of 29 hbls , 4 ibls , 4 lbls and 3 fsrqs . \n our blazar sample contains all blazars with a published vhe spectrum before february 2011 , with a total of 26 sources ( see table  [ sample ] ) . \n this includes 19 hbls , 3 ibls , 2 lbls and 2 fsrqs . \n seven of these blazars were detected with egret and 23 of them are in the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog . \n more than half of the sample have been detected multiple times in the vhe band . \n these multiple detections extending over several years and obtained mostly with different instruments suggest that spectral variability in the vhe band is a common property for vhe blazars . even though no general pattern has been established for vhe variability , several sources \n have been observed to have a flux increase up to a few times their baseline emission  @xcite , occasionally accompanied by a change in spectral index  @xcite and minute - scale flux doubling times  @xcite . \n .vhe blazar sample . \n no secure redshift is available for 3c 66a , pks 1424 + 240 and pg 1553 + 113 . \n the _ fermi _ states `` low '' and `` high '' are as described in the text . in some cases \n simultaneous data were available , and in the remaining cases 27-month time - averaged _ fermi _ data were used . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first 27 month of _ fermi _ data and archival vhe spectra published before february 2011 were used to construct combined gev - tev seds . \n these include six data sets where vhe data overlaps with the _ fermi _ era ( rgb j0710 + 591 , 1es 1218 + 304 , pks 1424 + 240 , pks 2155 - 304 and two different measurements for 3c 66a ) . \n the remainder of the vhe data were taken before the _ fermi _ mission . \n all vhe spectra were corrected for the extragalactic background light absorption using  @xcite . \n the fact that most of the gev and tev data are not contemporaneous introduces caveats for the interpretation of the combined spectra . \n moreover , _ fermi _ data represents an average state over a fairly long period , whereas the vhe spectra consist of day - scale  snapshots \" , mostly taken during flares . as a solution to this problem , for bright - enough sources , \n the _ fermi _ data were split into  low \" and  high \" states as described below . \n thus , non - contemporaneous gev and tev measurements were matched in a more realistic way than directly using all the time - averaged _ fermi _ data . \n _ diffuse class _ events with energy between 300mev100gev from the first 27-month of _ fermi _ data ( from 4 august 2008 to 4 november 2010 ) were used for the analysis . for blazars that were observed during the _ fermi _ era , \n only the time periods of a few months that cover the corresponding vhe observations were selected . \n first , a 27-month light - curve analysis was performed for each source using an aperture photometry technique . \n events from a region of @xmath2 radius from the target location were selected and counts were plotted as a function of time , each time bin containing 49 counts . for sources with high statistics , low- and high- flux states were identified and separated using the average count rate as a threshold ( see figure  [ lc_mrk501 ] and table  [ sample ] ) .        next , a spectral analysis was done for each data set . \n events from a region of interest of @xmath3 were selected and analyzed with fermi science tools v9r18p6 , using instrument response functions p3_v6_diffuse . \n sources from the 1fgl catalog  @xcite , bright spots with test statistics @xmath4 and standard galactic and isotropic diffuse emission background components within the region of interest were included in the source model files . \n spectral points were calculated using an unbinned maximum - likelihood analysis technique  @xcite . \n figure  [ sed_mrk501 ] shows the combined sed for the hbl mrk501 . \n the peak frequency of the inverse - compton ( ic ) component is a salient parameter for describing blazar non - thermal continua and studying population trends . \n systematic studies for measuring the ic peak frequency mostly suffer from the lack of statistics and simultaneous data  @xcite . in this work , \n we focus on finding the ic  peak frequency band \" rather than the  peak frequency \" , using a model independent approach . for each blazar sed , we identify the energy decade in which the largest amount of power is emitted . \n figure  [ ic_peak_dist ] shows the distribution of peak frequency bands . \n we observe that the low - synchrotron - peaked objects ( lsps ) have the maximum of their emission mostly below 1 gev . \n on the other hand , high - synchrotron - peaked objects ( hsps ) tend to peak in the tev range . \n a power - law function often fails to describe the combined seds successfully . for most blazars , \n the fits are significantly improved with a broken power law ( see figure  [ sed_mrk501 ] ) or an absorbed power law . particularly , some lbl objects display absorption - like features in the 10 - 100 gev range . to investigate this feature , we considered the following absorption scenarios from the broad line region ( blr )  @xcite for the blazars s5  0716 + 714 ( lbl ) , w comae ( ibl ) and bl lacertae ( lbl ) :    * h i line ( 13.6 ev ) * he ii line ( 54.4 ev ) * h i & he ii combined * full blr spectrum    in all the cases , absorption from the he ii complex seems to be dominant \n . a double - absorption scenario does not provide an improved fit over the he ii single - line absorption . on the other hand , \n the full blr absorption underproduces the tev emission ( see figure  [ s5_0716_sed ] ) . \n we also modeled a full blr absorption combined with cascade emission from the @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption  @xcite . \n no significant contribution from cascading effects in the fermi band is expected ( see figure  [ wcomae_sed ] ) . \n in this paper we give some results from our ongoing gev - tev blazar population studies . \n we analyzed 27 months of _ fermi _ data and combined it with archival tev data . \n we see absorption - like features mostly in lbl spectra , these features are best described as blr absorption from the he ii complex . in addition , we observe that the peak frequency in the gev - tev region follows the synchrotron peak frequency trend . \n complete results will be discussed in a forthcoming paper . \n 9 urry , c. m. , & padovani , p.  1995 , pasp , 107 , 803 maraschi , l. , ghisellini , g. , & celotti , a.  1992 , apj , 397 , l5 dermer , c.  d. & schlickeiser , r.  1993 , apj , 416 , 458 aharonian , f.  2000 , newa , 5 , 377 mcke , a. , et al . \n 2003 , aph , 18 , 593 padovani , p. & giommi , p.  1995 , apj , 444 , 567 nieppola , e. , valtaoja , e. , tornikoski , m. , hovatta , t. , kotiranta , m.  2008 , a&a , 488 , 867 punch , m. , et al . \n 1992 , nature , 358 , 477 costamante , l. , & ghisellini , g.  2002 , a&a , 384 , 56 de la calle prez , i. , et al . \n 2003 , apj , 599 , 909 behera , b. , & wagner , s.  i.  2009 , arxiv0908.4574b acciari , v. a. , et al . \n 2009 , apj , 707 , 612 albert , j. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 669 , 862 aharonian , f. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 664 , l71 domnguez , a. et al . \n 2011 , mnras , 410 , 2556 abdo , a.  a. , et al . \n 2010 , apj , 715 , 429 cash , w.  1979 , apj , 228 , 939 mattox , j.  r. , et al . \n 1996 , apj , 461 , 396 anderhub , h. et al . \n 2009 , apj , 705 , 1624 zhang , j. , et al . \n 2011 , arxiv:1108.0607v1 [ astro-ph.he ] poutanen , j. et al .  2010 , \n apj , 711 , 118 roustazadeh , p. et al . \n 2010 , apj 717 , 468 anderhub , h. et al . \n 2009 , apjl , 704 , 129 acciari , v. a. et al . \n 2008 , apjl , 684 , 73", "StartTimeOffset": 2187500760474, "RequestID": "09211f9ad460a18bfc39300e31134c985f6fa86e", "TotalTokens": 2929}
{"ContextTokens": 2610, "GeneratedTokens": 187, "SynthesizedBody": "the dwarf elliptical galaxy class has been a point of much interest in recent years . \n photometric surveys have revealed a whole range of substructures : spiral arms , bars , disks , twists , lenses ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . through the kinematic studies of , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we have learned about the variety of rotation patterns , and stellar populations analyses \n have shown a variety of ages , metallicities , and their gradients ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n thus , des have come a long way from being considered simple low - mass extension of giant ellipticals to having their complicated structure and history unveiled in numerous studies which led to the conclusion that they are most likely environmentally - transformed late - type galaxies ( see e.g. the review in @xcite ) . \n since the effect of such transformation processes depends on the local environment density , we would expect galaxy properties to change with clustrocentric distance . \n indeed , such trends have been found for the shape and the degree of substructure in virgo ( @xcite ) , and for the ages and metallicities of both virgo ( @xcite ) and coma des ( @xcite ) . with our integral - field spectroscopic data for virgo des \n we have now turned to investigating their dynamical properties and the connection thereof to the location in the cluster . \n stellar velocity _ v _ maps of our full sample shown here together to emphasize the kinematic variety . \n the level of rotation is not tied to flattening , we see kinematics twists ( vcc0523 , id0918 ) and kinematically - decoupled components ( id0650 and id0918 ) . \n a full set of maps and profiles ( _ v _ , @xmath0 , and their errors ) can be found in @xcite . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=566 ]    details on data selection , observations and data reduction are presented in @xcite . in short \n , we observed 12 des : 9 in the virgo cluster and 3 in the field . \n our objects span a wide range of ellipticities and distances from the cluster s center . \n the observations were carried out in jan 2010 and apr 2011 ( 8 nights in total ) using the wht / sauron instrument at the roque de los muchachos observatory in la palma , with each galaxy typically exposed for 5h . \n for the extraction and calibration of the data we followed the procedures described in @xcite using the specifically designed xsauron software developed at the centre de recherche astrophysique de lyon ( cral ) . \n the data were spatially binned to achieve the required minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 30 per pixel . \n the stellar absorption - line kinematics were derived for each galaxy by directly fitting the spectra in the pixel space using the penalized pixel - fitting method ( ppxf ) of @xcite . \n these velocity maps shown in figure  [ fig1 ] are the best example of the level of variety we are finding . \n the maps show varying degrees of rotation : from @xmath140 km / s for vcc0523 to virtually no rotation for vcc1261 . \n rotation seems to be uncorrelated with flattening since we see all possible combinations of both . \n in addition to that , in two galaxies ( id0650 and id0918 ) we observe large - scale kinematically - decoupled components , counter - rotating with regard to the main bodies . also , kinematic twists are seen in vcc0523 and id0918 .    to relate this variety to the formation histories of these galaxies , \n we need to tie the results to the transformation mechanisms acting in cluster \n . the combined influence of ram - pressure stripping and harassment is the most likely answer , given that they allow for the random shaping of galaxy properties , based on the variety initial infall parameters ( disk inclination and orbit type ) and the number of encounters with large galaxies . \n since des used to be thought of as a low - luminosity extension of giant ellipticals ( es ) , we present here a comparison of the kinematic properties of our des and early - type giants ( etgs ) of @xcite . to estimate the amount of rotation in our objects we have therefore decided to use the new @xmath2 parameter defined in @xcite ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) . \n @xmath2 is better suited for angular momentum estimate than the traditionally employed v/@xmath0 .    for the most part des \n behave like the members of the fast - rotator family : their integrated @xmath3 values are above or on the line that divides the etg group into slow and fast rotators . \n their @xmath2 profiles also tend to increase for larger r / r@xmath4 or lie in between those of slow- and fast - rotator groups . \n a direct comparison is , however , tricky . \n a range of differences stand behind each type that include photometric , kinematic , dynamic , and x - ray properties ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n thus , the empirical dividing line can not be easily used to accommodate des in the same diagram . moreover , by their very nature the data for des are noisier , which will produce a positive offset in the calculated @xmath2 . \n one , thus , needs to be cautious when devising their analysis approach in such cases as ours . \n _ left _ : radial @xmath2 profiles for the combined sample of des from this study ( thick red lines ) and etgs of @xcite ( thin grey lines ) . \n slow - rotating etgs have profiles that are decreasing or nearly flat and fast - rotators have increasing profiles . _ \n right _ : @xmath2 versus ellipticity for the same sample ( des  red diamonds , es  black triangles ) . \n the green solid line corresponds to @xmath5 , the threshold separating the fast- and slow -

rotator families defined by @xcite ) , title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    nevertheless , these results support the claim of des having late - type origin . \n giant fast rotators ( most of which are s0s ) have properties more similar to those of late - type galaxies . \n s0s are believed to be faded spirals ( e.g. @xcite ) , so the fact that our des show a similar level of variety as the sauron survey s fast rotators only strengthens the argument in favor of them being transformed late - type galaxies .      as we have already discussed in @xcite , the analysis of any property trends with clustrocentric distance , should be performed using intrinsic ( i.e. deprojected ) distances in order to minimize the projection bias when dealing with incomplete samples . \n we show this effect in the left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] where a trend of rotational support versus virgocentric distance is shown for both projected and intrinsic distances . \n our results , albeit based on a limited - size sample , tentatively show little if any relation between the two aforementioned quantities . \n we have also investigated the relation between the dark matter fraction and the location in the cluster , motivated by the simulations of @xcite and @xcite who suggest that ( at a fixed radius ) dark matter might be lost more easily due to its different orbital distribution . \n the preliminary results of this analysis are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] . \n the total ( dark+stellar ) masses come from jeans axisymmetric mge models @xcite which we constructed combining our sauron stellar kinematics and sdss r - band imaging . to obtain the stellar mass estimates we used the @xcite sdss g - r colors and the color - mass conversion of @xcite      _ left _ : specific angular momentum @xmath6 virgocentric distance . for all galaxies both intrinsic and projected distances \n are shown . \n no radial trend is found when intrinsic distances are used ( @xcite ) . \n _ right _ : dark -

{"ContextTokens": 2278, "GeneratedTokens": 217, "SynthesizedBody": "adass is the major annual conference for those interested in astronomy software and systems , from architects and developers to users and managers . \n its 24 year history indicates its usefulness to individuals and institutions , as a place to showcase our latest work , to learn new techniques and discover which have been successfully used in our specialist field ; to discuss emerging technologies with colleagues with similar interests and generally to work towards continually improving the overall shape of the field of astronomical software . \n success is no reason for complacency , however . over the last two decades we have seen the needs of our community change , and \n indeed our demographic has itself changed . on the broader astronomical stage \n we re seeing our travel budgets shrinking , and many find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether their single overseas conference for the year will focus on their science or on the technology aspects of their work if it is to continue being a useful and worthwhile conference , adass must adapt , keeping up with the needs of the adass community and the astronomical community as a whole , while keeping in mind our changing demographics .    to this end \n the adass program organising committee ( poc ) ran a survey in early 2014 to ascertain the needs of the community and the direction and shape which future adass meetings should take . \n 140 people participated ( as a comparison , a typical adass has around 270 attendees ) , 84% of whom had attended 2 or more adass conferences , 12% had attended 1 and 14% had never been to an adass . \n identity : :    we advertise the adass conference as _ `` a forum for * _ scientists _ * ,    * _ developers _ * and * _ programmers _ * working in areas related to    algorithms , software and systems for the acquisition , reduction ,    analysis , and dissemination of astronomical data''_. the 140 survey    participants identified themselves as astronomers ( 69% ) , software    engineers ( 38% ) , programmers ( 30% ) , software architects ( 29% ) ,    managers ( 28% ) and computer scientists ( 22% ) , with a small number of    instrument scientists , and database , archive and data    specialists . the fact that 31% of people did not self - identify as    astronomers shows that we have moved from a community of `` astronomers    who code '' , to a more diverse one which includes people whose primary    expertise is in engineering . \n this reflects the trend we see in our    institutes and telescope facilities , and it is important that the    focus and program of the adass conference also evolves over time to    keep up with the changing needs of our community . \n the very small    numbers of postdocs ( 6 ) and students ( 4 ) who participated in the    survey is compatible with the small number from these two groups who    attend the conference . \n this was discussed in the bof and it was agreed    that mechanisms should be put in place to encourage more students and    early career postdocs to come to adass . \n themes : :    each year s conference is based around a handful of key themes . these    are chosen by the poc and are intended to reflect the current work ,    trends and needs of our community , including suggestions made by the    conference attendees . \n the bof participants    agreed that final responsibility for theme selection should rest with    the poc , and also that the community should be actively encouraged to    nominate key themes . \n the appgree mobile    application , which was tested during    this conference , was put forward as a possible way of facilitating    participation and of canvassing community preferences on the submitted    topics . for adass \n xxv the poc plans to use appgree to receive theme    suggestions and hopes to see wide participation from the community .    additionally , 88 people submitted key topic suggestions through the    survey , and these will also inform the selection of key themes for the    next several conferences . \n conference content : :    both the survey and the bof discussion agreed that there is a need for    greater focus on algorithms , statistics , analysis methods , data    science , etc . \n , in invited and contributed talks , and less emphasis on    update reports . \n adass talks should be more about the algorithms and    techniques than about the projects themselves . \n there was considerable    support from the bof session for invited review talks looking at the    state of play in various aspects of software . \n +    there were several practical suggestions made during the bof which had    the support of the room : authors should be able to classify their    paper under more than one key theme when submitting an abstract . \n this    would help the loc when setting up the conference sessions and ensure    that each talk was presented in the most relevant session from the    author s point of view . \n there was also a request to allow authors to    supply , when submitting an abstract , an optional link containing more    information about the proposed paper . \n +    discussion on student attendance saw strong agreement on ensuring that    the conference fee has a student rate , and allowing authors to    indicate whether they are a student both on registration and abstract    submission . \n there was also a general feeling that there should be a    way to reserve contributed talk slots for early career attendees    ( particularly those who have not previously presented a talk ) , but the    details of how this might be achieved were not discussed . \n +    another subject raised was whether some plenary discussion time could    be scheduled during the oral sessions , at the end of each major topic ,    at the end of each day , or at the end of the conference . \n there was    some support for this and also some concern , from participants who    thought it would cut into the time available and result in fewer    talks . \n +    a few people showed interested in a hack day , and there was no    opposition to the idea . \n this could be scheduled as a half - day at the    end of the conference , or be run concurrently with the tutorial . \n posters : :    adass has a strong tradition of lively and effective poster sessions .    the posters are displayed in a prominent position ( close to where    coffee is served ) and a good amount of time is allocated to allow    people to view the posters and for meaningful discussions to occur . \n both the survey results and the bof discussion expressed support for    maintaining the poster sessions as they are .    +    a popular suggestion raised at the bof was to declare two time slots    ( one for even - numbered and another for odd - numbered posters ) when    people were expected to be in attendance at their posters , to    facilitate discussion . \n birds of a feather : :    bof sessions at adass are an opportunity for informal , free - flowing    discussions among people with a common interest . \n bofs are scheduled    based on proposals submitted by attendees wishing to organise and    chair a session on a given subject . \n an average of 5 bofs are held each    year although the number proposed and held in any one year varies    widely . \n some subjects ( e.g.  fits and other data formats ) have a bof    most years whilst other topics come up once or twice when they are of    interest to the community and then fade away as their relevance and    urgency decreases . \n +    at the xxiii - rd meeting in 2013 informal `` pop - up '' bofs were    suggested and tried , where the subjects for discussion were proposed    and scheduled during the conference , in the style of an    `` unconference '' . \n this was repeated at this year s meeting , and    although the take - up of pop - up bofs has been small the opinion at the    bof was that we should continue to offer them . \n +    a suggestion was made to dedicate a session to people s specific    technical problems - `` i ve got a problem , does anyone know the    answer ? '' , harnessing the concentrated expertise of the conference    attendees . \n it was agreed that pop - up bofs may be useful here , or a    hack - day , depending on the nature of the problem . \n governance : :    the adass program organising committee ( poc ) consists of around 15    people , these being representatives of the adass sponsoring    institutions and members of the community with an interest in adass . \n members are nominated to the poc and ratified by the sitting    committee . \n the 2014 poc consists of 16 people , and includes an    executive committee comprised of the poc chair , vice - chair , secretary    and treasurer . \n +    the survey indicated that the majority of the adass community are    satisfied with the conference organisation and governance ( 67% ) with    smaller fractions preferring the poc to be directly elected from and    by the community ( 18% ) , or wanting to change the length of the term of    poc membership ( 17% ) . \n +    it was noted at the bof session that the poc is gender - unbalanced at    present , and has been so for all of adass s history . additionally the    wish was expressed for the composition of the poc to be more    geographically diverse . \n costs and sponsorship : :    there was agreement at the bof that we should seek industry support    for the conference . \n this was mainly seen as a way to reduce costs , and    particularly to make it easier for students to attend . \n the    practicalities are open to debate , but nobody saw it as bad , as long    as our independence is preserved . \n +    once specific idea which saw considerable support was to secure    sponsorship from a printer company in the form of a printer loan for a    few days at the start of the meeting . \n the posters could then be    printed at the conference location , avoiding the too - common event of    posters getting lost or damaged in transit . \n +    the conference fee was discussed , but there was no obvious consensus    on whether lowering the fees would make a difference to people s    ability to attend the meeting , as this is often a fraction of the    travel and accommodation cost . \n the comment was made that it is hard    for young people to obtain travel funding to come to adass , although    it was agreed that it is important that they do . \n student conference    rates help slightly as does the financial aid scheme . \n +    finally , the demonstration fees were deemed to be too high by some    survey respondents , who argued that demo booths are no longer the    technological burden on the loc that they once were , and that several    of the institutes who wish to have a booth at adass are the same ones    who sponsor the conference . \n after discussion the poc agreed to reduce    the fee for demonstrations from research institutions , but maintain    the current fee for commercial bodies . \n the discussion must continue . please make your ideas and suggestions known . \n speak with a member of the poc , or send your thoughts by email ( poc@adass.org ) . \n alternatively tweet your suggestions to ( @astroadass ) or use appgree to participate in adass polls .", "StartTimeOffset": 2220042084270, "RequestID": "49d7a8b78b5d54c75861dd989f11132e690ccafc", "TotalTokens": 2495}
{"ContextTokens": 3072, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "most maps of large scale structure use redshifts of galaxies to indicate position . \n such maps are known to have distortions , the most familiar of which are the so - called fingers - of - god , elongated artifacts pointing at the observer and caused by velocities of galaxies within clusters . on scales larger than a typical finger - of - god , \n the maps show other features , such as great connected walls of galaxies . on these scales , are redshift - space maps essentially accurate representations of the real - space distribution ? can they be treated as fuzzy photographs of the universe ?    in this paper \n we show that the answer may be _ \n no_. a spectacular feature seen in redshift surveys \n the curving `` great wall '' of galaxies which together with the pisces - perseus chain seems to form a giant ring encircling us ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite)may get its visual punch from a redshift - space distortion we call the bulls - eye effect .    using an n - body simulation \n , we find that structures perpendicular to the line of sight are enhanced in redshift - space , due both to the finger - of - god distortion and a distortion caused by infall . \n we can further strengthen the effect by applying a magnitude limit . \n the result is that any observer concludes , erroneously , that he or she is encircled by galaxy walls in a bulls - eye pattern . \n when peculiar velocities are small and uncorrelated , redshift maps are just fuzzier versions of real - space maps . \n however , large correlated velocities produce striking artifacts . \n one example of such an artifact is the finger - of - god produced by the random orbital motions of galaxies in a bound cluster . \n another artifact , not as well known but important for this paper , is caused by the inward flow of material toward either a single center or an extended region . \n such a flow produces an artifact because infalling material on the near - side of the accreting center or extended region has peculiar velocity away from the observer and material on the far - side has peculiar velocity toward the observer . \n therefore , in redshift - space , the near - side is moved back and the far - side moved forward , squashing the material together along the radial direction . \n for example , studies show that spherical infall produces an extended saucer - like artifact face on to the observer , encircling the cluster finger - of - god like an outspread skirt or tutu ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ps ) . \n these results are generalizable to aspherical flows . \n it is easy to show that _ any _ infall field will produce a similar artifact : see the discussion of fig .  1 in ps . \n kaiser ( 1987 ) speculates that infall distortions may be `` well able to account for '' connected features seen in redshift surveys . \n likewise , the schematic fig .  6 of ps shows how an observer in a universe with many clusters might see a bulls - eye pattern in redshift - space . \n more realistic scenarios than the isolated cluster model can produce an even stronger effect : bulls - eyes are present ( but uncommented on ) in figures presented by park(1990 ) and ryden & melott ( 1996 ; hereafter , rm ) . \n weinberg & gunn ( 1990a;b ) comment on `` hints of circular symmetry '' visible in their plots ( which show the effect less clearly ) , but attribute it to the selection function . as we will show below , the full bulls - eye effect is a true distortion in redshift - space , and the selection function plays only a secondary role . \n we wish to emphasize that walls and filaments are _ real _ features that arise from long - wave motion producing `` pancakes '' by gravitational instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and so do not require additional explanation such as in kaiser ( 1987 ) . on the other hand \n , we find that redshift effects selectively enhance pancakes forming perpendicular to the line of sight , accelerating their apparent collapse . the toy model of an oblate spheroid may be useful here . \n collapsing with its short axis along the line of sight , it may look very thin and dense in redshift space . with short axis perpendicular to the line of sight , \n redshift distortions make it look smaller and more nearly spherical . \n before comparing redshift surveys with simulations of gravitational clustering , the two sets of data should be transformed to the same coordinate system . \n observers usually work with selection effects in redshift - space , whereas simulations give complete information in real - space . \n since it is presently impossible to deconvolve an observed data set to a complete real - space distribution , we must simulate realistic observational constraints , as done by park ( 1990 ) and weinberg & gunn ( 1990 a;b ) . \n the simulation we choose to look at is from a set of two - dimensional studies described in detail in beacom et al . \n ( 1991 ) and kauffmann & melott ( 1992 ) . \n rm calculated the properties of voids in three simulations in real - space and redshift - space . \n of the three , the one with initial power spectrum of the form @xmath0 shows the bulls - eye effect most strongly . \n this index corresponds to @xmath1 in three dimensions , which is a reasonable approximation to the observed power spectrum over a wide range of scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for these spectra \n , displacement varies logarithmically with @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , which can cause structure to `` pile up '' . \n the main effect of the reduced dimensionality of the simulation is the absence of the occasional very long finger - of - god due to clusters like coma seen in the first cfa slice ( @xcite ) . \n figure  [ fig : twoobs](a ) shows this simulation in real - space , and fig .  [ fig : twoobs](b ) in redshift - space , as seen by two hypothetical observers whose positions are labeled on the plot . \n the simulation has periodic boundary conditions , so the figure shows the original points tiled together with copies . as in rm , \n we ve first reduced the number of particles by randomly selecting one out of every four . \n the square has a side of approximately @xmath3 mpc , where @xmath4 is the fudge factor in the hubble constant : @xmath5 , and where we let @xmath6 for convenience . \n the assumed value of @xmath4 affects only the selection function , not redshift displacement . \n the redshift - space maps made by the observers each have a radius of about @xmath7 and overlap as indicated . \n each map includes a selection function simulating the effect of a magnitude 16 limited survey . \n specifically , the luminosities of the points are assumed to obey a schechter luminosity function : @xmath8 , where we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) . \n we also assume that the `` volume '' of the observer s sample increases with distance as in a constant angle slice . \n that is , we randomly select points so that the surface density at distance @xmath11 goes as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the luminosity corresponding to the magnitude limit at the distance @xmath11 . \n note that when we apply the selection function above , we essentially treat the two - dimensional simulation as if it were a three - dimensional slab . \n this is admittedly a swindle , but we believe a not inaccurate approximation for a thin slice . \n our maps are similar in appearance to those in park ( 1990 ) , which were constructed from a three - dimensional model . due to the high resolution of our simulation , the number of points exceeds the number of galaxies that would lie in a thin slice . since we wish to show the origin of the effect as clearly as possible ( rather than compare our results with specific surveys ) , we have normalized the selection function to keep all the subset simulation particles in the region of its maximum . \n the difference between the real - space distribution in fig . \n [ fig : twoobs](a ) and the redshift - space maps in fig . \n [ fig : twoobs](b ) is readily apparent . in the first , \n the distribution of `` galaxies '' is fairly uniform , whereas in the second , the galaxies seem to lie in curving walls which roughly circle the observer , regardless of position ! why are the two maps so different ? \n figure  [ fig : unselsel ] shows the simulation from the point of view of the first observer in more detail . \n note : ( 1 ) the positions of the galaxies are distorted in redshift - space into smeared arclets concentric around the observer . \n figure  [ fig : unselsel](a ) shows the points plotted in real - space and redshift - space without the selection function . \n this pair of plots should be compared with fig .  2 of rm , which shows a similar pattern appears for an observer at the center of the original square . \n ( 2 ) the selection effect of the magnitude limit enhances arclets at the distance where the selection function peaks . \n figure  [ fig : unselsel](b ) shows the real - space and redshift - space distribution of the points when the selection function is applied . \n this time the magnitude limit is 17 , to show the effect of an increase ( compare with fig .  [ fig : twoobs ] ) \n . the selection function is picking out bulls - eye rings already existing in redshift - space : it does not _ \n produce _ the pattern , as suggested by weinberg & gunn ( 1990a;b ) . \n the mechanism underlying the bulls - eye effect is redshift - space distortion caused by peculiar velocity . \n both infall onto clusters and orbital motions within clusters contribute , as can be seen in an expanded piece of the simulation . \n figure  [ fig : wedge ] shows a @xmath14 wedge of the simulation in real - space and redshift - space , from the point of view of an observer at the center of the original square ( fig .  2 of rm ) looking north . \n it shows several points clearly :    \\1 . \n the distortion due to infall tends to empty voids and pancake galaxies on top of each other in redshift - space , perpendicular to the line of sight . note how the two filaments on the left - hand side of the wedge between 100 and 150 mpc are squashed together in redshift space . \n the finger - of - god artifacts give structures lying perpendicular to the line of sight more visual weight , by smearing the points out along the line of sight . \n a careful inspection of the loose filament running along the top of the wedge between 250 and 300  mpc reveals that points are just smeared out from their positions right on top of each other . \n furthermore , the fingers - of - god can be seen to be longer in dense regions with more tightly bound clumps . \n this correlation further increases the visual contrast . \n the bulls - eye pattern appears because only structures perpendicular to the line of sight are enhanced . \n the long filament running down the center of the wedge from 200 to 300  mpc is not particularly enhanced in redshift - space . however , \n if the observer was located to the left or right of this filament , it would appear darker and thicker than it does in this view . \n again , we reiterate that the effect is caused by both the infall compression distortion and the more subtle finger of god smearing distortion . \n we have looked at two simulations in which one or the other distortion is suppressed . in one , \n small scale clustering ( and thus fingers of god ) are suppressed : the result is a bulls - eye pattern which is not quite as striking as the ones shown here , rather like the figures in weinberg & gunn ( 1990a;b ) . in the other , \n peculiar velocities were reassigned randomly , removing infall : the result is a much more uniform pattern with only extremely weak suggestions of walls . \n note that the velocities in our simulation are not large . \n a few hundred km / s displacement is enough to produce the effect . \n in the simulation examined above both motions within clusters and flows toward clusters produce distortions in redshift - space which enhance structures perpendicular to the line of sight . \n redshift maps thus give the impression that the observer is surrounded by concentric walls of galaxies : the bulls - eye effect . \n it is not implausible that the bulls - eye effect may be responsible for the visual impact of wall - like features concentric about our position , such as the great wall of galaxies . \n we would not argue that there is no physical structure underlying these features , but that existing structure may be enhanced by a simultaneous smearing and compressing distortion as in the simulation . \n we note that a full view of the simulation in redshift - space shows multiple rings , separated by fairly uniform intervals . \n a corresponding prediction is that as the magnitude limit of magnitude complete redshift surveys is increased , other sets of walls concentric on our position but at larger distances should become apparent . \n indeed , the map produced by the las campanas survey ( @xcite ) is similar in appearance to fig . \n [ fig : unselsel](a ) above . \n we also suggest a possible relationship to other findings based on `` core - sampling '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n it is possible that the bulls - eye effect is giving a misleading impression about the nature of the large scale structure of the universe . \n the distribution of galaxy clusters and filaments may be more uniform than impressions from redshift - space maps imply . \n we wish to emphasize that our simulation only demonstrates the effect qualitatively . a detailed comparison with observational data demands \n the use of a three - dimensional simulation with a power spectrum more closely matched to that observed in the local universe . \n the spacing and intensity of this effect will depend on details of the power spectrum and mass density of the universe . \n in fact , characteristic ring spacing combined with the measured angular power spectrum should measure bulk flows and provide information on @xmath15 . \n future work should include examination of the effect with a variety of three dimensional spectra and background cosmologies . \n we wish to thank s. schneider , i. praton , s. shandarin , d. weinberg , and j. gott for helpful comments . \n alm wishes to acknowledge financial support from nasa grant nagw 3832 , the nsf epscor program , and space telescope science institute award number 6007 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2230645408356, "RequestID": "e285b345ac21b991d1366f0b58a3d8b8e83a0907", "TotalTokens": 3197}

possibility of studying extremely complex systems with high accuracy . in this context , the success of the kohn  sham density  functional theory@xcite ( dft ) began when crucial developments in its exchange  correlation terms gave the theory predictive power to compete with well  developed wavefunction methods@xcite . \n the importance of the exchange \n correlation potentials in chemical physics has been emphasized by bartlett@xcite . \n exchange potentials are in general constructed by local approximations to the nonlocal hartree  fock exchange operator ( i.e. the slater potential@xcite , the optimized effective potential@xcite , the krieger \n iafrate@xcite and several others@xcite ) .    the atomic collision community , on the other hand , is also eager to accurately determine effective one  electron local potentials which would allow to generate in a simpler way the wavefunctions of the particles interacting in a scattering process . in particular , \n

filippi _ _ et al__@xcite ) . \n some other works start with a particular kohn \n sham potential and solve the corresponding equations , obtaining the ks orbitals@xcite . through inversion , they obtain a reconstructed ks potential , which agrees almost everywhere with the original one , except in some regions where huge oscillations arise . in some cases , the reconstructed potential may be distorted beyond recognition@xcite . \n the same type of procedure was suggested many years ago by hilton _ \n et al . _ , \n in applications circumscribed to the calculation of photoionization processes of atoms@xcite , water@xcite and other molecules@xcite . \n these papers , in turn , refer to the earlier work in atomic polarizability carried out by sternheimer@xcite and dalgarno and parkinson@xcite . however , they focused on the final photoionization cross section results , and did not provide details about the quality of the potentials and the wavefunctions they generated .    assuming the validity of the separation between exchange and correlation functionals \n , we will focus here only on the calculation of the exchange contribution to the potential . since hartree  fock \n does not include the correlations , our approach allows to obtain the `` exact '' one  electron local potential representing the exchange interactions . strictly speaking \n , the method does not rely on the ks inversion formula since the hartree \n fock solutions were the ones used for the inversion . \n that is , we solved a ks  type equation , but rather than having ks  orbitals , we operated directly with the hartree \n fock wavefunctions . for open  shell atoms \n , we were able to find orbital spin \n polarized exchange potentials , this being crucial , for instance , to find the hyperfine coupling constants@xcite . \n however , this is not a simple task , and probably that is why the method presented here has not been widely applied in the past . \n if the wavefunction has nodes , it will produce huge poles in the potential . \n moreover , even for nodeless states , the asymptotic decaying behavior of the bound wavefunctions produces severe numerical difficulties ,

)     = \\varepsilon_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}\\ , u_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}(r ) \\ , . \n \\label{eq : ks}\\ ] ] the effective potentials given by , @xmath7 are composed of the external potential @xmath8 ( the coulomb field of the nucleus ) , the direct ( or hartree ) potential @xmath9 ( the electrostatic electron repulsion ) , and the orbital exchange potentials @xmath10 . \n we have ignored the correlation term since the hf solutions do not include  it .    since the solutions @xmath4 are known ( calculated numerically with the hf code by c. f. fischer @xcite , and the nrhf code by w. johnson @xcite ) we proceeded to directly invert the kohn  sham  type equations : @xmath11 obtaining the _ hf inverted potential _ @xmath12 . assuming a coulombic  type shape , it is convenient to define an _ hf inverted charge _ @xmath13    the direct computation of ( [ eq : v ] ) is known to pose serious numerical problems@xcite . \n _ first _ , the presence of ( genuine ) nodes in the wave function to be inverted produces poles and unrealistic features around them . \n this has led to the general consensus that the inversion method can only be used for nodeless orbitals@xcite . _ \n second _ , numerical rounding up of the exponential decay of the bound states hinders the corresponding inverted potential from having the physically desired asymptotic form . \n moreover , there is a _ \n third _ problem at the very heart of the hartree fock method : the exact solutions may have oscillations ( and therefore , spurious nodes ) in the large  r or `` tail '' region of the functions . \n the existence of these spurious nodes in hartree fock was already suggested by fischer@xcite . \n this failure is not caused by the numerical scheme but it is inherent to the method . probably , these nodes are surviving long  range exchange effects due to the non  local character of the hartree  fock wavefunctions : the behavior of a particular orbital depends on all others . \n we have found the same spurious nodes at the same places even using different numerical codes . as a general rule , the spurious nodes appear at very long distances , in regions where the amplitude of the wavefunction is very small . therefore , their existence has no practical consequences , and they can be ignored in any general hartree  fock calculation . \n however , this is not true as far as the inversion procedure is concerned , as we will discuss in the next section . \n other examples where the presence of orbital nodes ( both formal and those in the tail region ) can be problematic in inversion procedures can be found in the literature ( see for instance peach _ \n et al._@xcite ) . \n the difficulties mentioned above make it very hard to obtain the correct @xmath12 potentials using the simple inversion formula given by eq . \n ( [ eq : v ] ) . to overcome these troubles \n we have developed a depurated inversion method ( dim ) which optimizes the effective charges rather than the effective potentials . \n we managed to constrain any potential to have the right boundary conditions by enforcing the _ effective depurated inverted charge _ to behave as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nuclear charge . \n once the charge is determined at the boundaries , we can obtain a smooth analytic expression for @xmath16 , fitting the @xmath17 for the largest possible range , except in the neighborhood of the nodes . \n all this can be accomplished by imposing the effective dim charge to fit the following analytical expression : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .    as a clear instance of the numerical problems mentioned and the way \n propose to solve them , we show , in figure [ fig:2skr ] , the orbital @xmath20 of the ground state of the kr atom ( part ( a ) ) , and its correspondent effective charge @xmath21 ( dashed line curve , in part ( b ) ) . \n first , note that the @xmath22 orbital has a genuine node at @xmath23 a.u . which produces the first pole in the effective charge , as shown in the lower graph . \n the node appears at a relatively low@xmath24 value , so the corresponding charge ( see eq . \n ( [ eq : zeff ] ) ) is not very sensitive to its presence . \n therefore , it is very easy to eliminate the pole from the effective charge ( by just erasing a few points around this radius ) . \n corresponding to the ground state of the kr atom . \n it presents two nodes , a genuine one at @xmath23 a.u . , and a spurious one at @xmath25 a.u . \n ( shown in the inset ) . \n ( b ) dashed line : the corresponding inverted effective charge @xmath21 , spoiled by the presence of poles . solid line : depurated @xmath26 effective charge.,width=319 ]    all the bound wavefunctions decay exponentially beyond the last turning point @xmath27 , defined as the position in which the energy equals the effective potential . at first glance \n , it seems that the turning point of @xmath28 is located around @xmath29 , and from that point on , the wavefunction should start to decay exponentially . \n from the numerically point of view , @xmath30 is a good point to stop the inversion , since beyond there , the effective charge could begin to diverge . \n thus , one might infer that by erasing the points belonging to the neighborhood of the first node , and by stopping the inversion about @xmath31 , the inversion procedure will work well . \n however , the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig:2skr](b ) shows a completely unphysical @xmath32 resulting from the inversion . a very careful examination of the @xmath20 orbital function evidences the presence of a spurious node at @xmath33 a.u . \n , in a region where the amplitude of the wavefunction is less than @xmath34 times the maximum value ( see the inset of fig . \n [ fig:2skr](a ) ) . \n even though this node is completely innocuous for practical matters , it produces devastating effects in the inversion procedure , evidenced by the second huge peak in the @xmath21 curve ( see figure [ fig:2skr](b ) ) . \n this pole is so big that it affects a broad vicinity and causes the abrupt rising of the effective charge for @xmath35 a.u .. this is really a surprising result since _ a priory _ there is no reason to suspect that a negligible oscillation in the tail of the wavefunction would produce such a big drawback at small distances . \n care must be taken then to discard these kind of undesired effects . \n the adjustment of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 also requires carefull work . \n the key issue in the successful approximation is the region chosen for the fitting : it has to be as large as possible , in such a way that @xmath16 overlaps the inverted @xmath17 across a broad range , allowing an accurate fitting procedure , but discarding the points surrounding the nodes . also , the inversion must be halted at a particular ( as large as possible ) @xmath24 value , as soon as the amplitude of the function is too small . \n further on , the inversion procedure diverges . \n another issue to consider is the self consistency within the computer codes used in the calculations and the particular code used to generate the input wavefunctions . to that end \n , we make sure that the same specific numerical grid is used , including the derivatives and integrals at the same pivots . the optimization procedure is completed by a number of iteration steps , in which the parameters are optimized to give accurate energies and wavefuntions . \n most density functional approximation methods are based on a variational principle , minimizing the density functionals according to energy ( others are defined by density ) . without underestimating its importance , \n energy is only one of the many parameters that characterizes a quantum state . \n different trial functions ( having different forms ) can produce , through a variational procedure , the same final energy . \n a simple example is given by bartschat @xcite in which two different potentials ( one having exchange , the other omitting it ) led to producing very similar and accurate energies of the rydberg series in several quasi \n one electron systems . \n however , a further examination of these potentials shows large discrepancies in scattering calculations @xcite . \n therefore , in addition to the energy criterion , we have included in our optimization method a variational procedure to reproduce accurately the wavefunctions . \n this is achieved by optimizing the mean values @xmath38 ( which characterize the quality of the wavefunction near the origin ) , and @xmath39 ( probing it at longer distances ) . \n furthermore , we defined the quantity @xmath40 to determine the accuracy of the orbitals generated by the diagonalization of the dim potentials and the original hf orbitals . \n the effective depurated inversion charge @xmath26 corresponding to the @xmath22 orbital of the kr atom resulting from the optimization is shown solid curve in figure [ fig:2skr](b ) . \n as seen in the figure , both boundary conditions are fulfilled ( at the origin , @xmath41 , and asymptotically @xmath42 , as stated in eq . \n ( [ eq : zasympt ] ) ) . \n the fitting parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 defining the effective charges @xmath16 in eq . \n ( [ eq : atomseq ] ) for the noble gases helium , neon , argon and krypton , are given in table [ tab : parameters ] . \n we have limited the @xmath36 and @xmath37 to six ( about two per shell ) . \n for kr , we would probably need two more since there are four shells involved .    .fitting parameters for the effective charge @xmath16 for he , ne , ar , and kr , applying eq . ( [ eq : atomseq ] ) . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n a crucial requirement of the density functional method is the accurate representation of the exchange functional . on the other hand \n , the atomic collision community needs accurate one \n electron potentials in order to generate the bound and continuum states on the same footing for further calculations of collisional processes . \n these potentials need to be worked out for any @xmath0specific orbital , a feature that in general is not present in the chemistry community functionals . in the present work we devised and implemented a depurated inversion method , which allows to obtain the intended potentials through a very simple analytical expression of the effective charges . \n the method consists in the inversion of a kohn  sham equation , in which the ks orbitals have been replaced by the hartree \n fock orbitals . by means of diagonalization \n we have achieved accurate wavefunctions having almost perfect agreement with the original hartree \n fock wave functions . \n the quality of the potentials obtained by the present method is remarkably good . \n we applied the developed methodology to the calculation of the ground state orbitals of noble gases and the nitrogen atom . \n it is worth mentioning that the same technique can be used for any other level , i.e. , it is not limited to the ground state .", "StartTimeOffset": 2244126669012, "RequestID": "8d618453350789eeef62cc9221c5f1c4963bc6a9", "TotalTokens": 3868}

{"ContextTokens": 3937, "GeneratedTokens": 198, "SynthesizedBody": "a typical rainfall time series has several properties that are difficult to capture in a simple statistical model , including a heavily skewed marginal distribution that is distinctly non - gaussian , a large proportion of zero values , and frequent large fluctuations . \n thus there is a need for specialised models for rainfall which can capture the unique characteristics of this type of process . \n the existing literature on modelling rainfall is large and spread over fields such as hydrology , atmospheric sciences , environmental risk analysis and statistics . \n @xcite classifies the different approaches into four categories : meteorological models based on large sets of differential equations , multi - scale models concerned with the spatial evolution of rainfall , statistical models that capture spatial and temporal trends , and finally stochastic process models that make simple assumptions in order to remain parsimonious . in the following \n we will focus on models of the last category . \n many of the early attempts at modelling rainfall use a simple model that represents the rainfall occurrence process as a two - state markov chain , and models the intensity of rainfall with a gamma distribution  @xcite . \n this model is easy to interpret and enables the direct use of likelihood methods for fitting . \n however , it makes several restrictive assumptions on the rainfall process , and may require a high - order markov chain with many parameters to capture observed temporal dependence . \n there is also a large literature on modelling rainfall for hydrological applications based on a form of the poisson - cluster model , first developed by @xcite and @xcite . \n this model is based on a hierarchical structure , with a primary poisson process controlling the arrival of storms and a secondary process generating cells from each storm , which then deposit rainfall . \n there have been numerous extensions of the poisson - cluster model that focus on fitting specific properties of the observed rainfall process . \n for example , @xcite considers an extended model that allows for different rainfall cell types , where each cell has a random duration and intensity depending on its type , allowing for the different types of precipitation that are observed in practice .    in terms of fitting specific properties of rainfall that are of interest for hydrological applications , extensions to the poisson - cluster model \n generally perform very well . \n however , as remarked by @xcite , there is always a trade - off between the inclusion of more features and the mathematical tractability of the resulting models . \n poisson - cluster based models are usually fitted by the method of moments , which involves matching analytical expressions for properties such as the mean , variance , and proportion of dry intervals to their empirical equivalents . \n @xcite , remarks that the method of moments approach `` suffers from the disadvantage that the parameter estimates can vary greatly depending on the properties used in the fitting procedure '' , and proposes a spectral estimation method for estimating rainfall models based on point processes . \n the contribution of the present paper is twofold . \n first , we develop a parsimonious and analytically tractable model that captures the distributional features and autocorrelation structure of the observed rainfall time series . \n we relate the model to the framework of lvy - driven , continuous - time arma ( carma ) processes , and use this connection to develop a suitable fitting method , which is illustrated using empirical rainfall data . \n the model structure may be interpreted as a non - clustered poisson model with multiple cell types , cf . \n the main benefit of this model is its parsimonious formulation based on a stochastic integral , making it suitable for applications where mathematical tractability and fitting methodology are of primary importance . \n second , we derive a formula specifying the so - called risk - neutral distribution of a general class of lvy - driven stochastic processes , which includes our model as a special case . \n we then use this result to calculate prices for rainfall futures based on our model . \n rainfall derivatives were introduced at the chigago merchantile exchange ( cme ) in 2010 , as a recent addition to the class of weather - related products . \n these products have a large potential market in all economic sectors that depend on favourable weather conditions , such as farming and energy development . \n the literature on rainfall derivatives pricing is currently rather limited . \n because the underlying rainfall can not be traded directly , the rainfall derivative market is incomplete , and thus there is no single fixed price for the derivative . due to this incompleteness \n , there are several distinct methods that can be used for rainfall derivative pricing . \n it appears that most current approaches rely on either the utility indifference approach or risk - neutral pricing using the esscher transform . \n the utility indifference approach is used in @xcite . in this paper a modification of the poisson - cluster model is considered , which makes the rainfall intensity a markov jump process , thus enabling maximum likelihood estimation . \n this modification relies on the assumption that the data used , though inevitably discrete , approximates continuous - time observations of the rainfall intensity . \n @xcite also use the utility indifference approach for pricing hypothetical rainfall derivatives in kenya , based on a markov - gamma model with seasonality . \n a natural choice for pricing based on lvy process models is the esscher transform @xcite , as it is structure - preserving @xcite and moreover gives rise to a minimal entropy martingale measure @xcite . \n @xcite use the esscher transform for pricing based on a version of the daily rainfall model by @xcite . \n they fit simulated monthly rainfall totals to a normal inverse gaussian distribution , and use the esscher transform to obtain a risk - neutral distribution . \n @xcite also use the esscher transform for pricing , but base their underlying rainfall model on an independent increment process . \n in contrast to the markov - gamma and independent increment models that have been used for pricing rainfall derivatives , our proposed model has the advantage of not making assumptions about temporal independence or markovianity of the rainfall process increments . furthermore , the model and the fitting method used are based on the assumption that the available data represents accumulated rainfall , i.e.  the instantaneous intensity can not be directly observed , which is typically the case for applications . by allowing for temporal dependence and considering carma processes of arbitrary order \n , we obtain a model with a flexible autocorrelation structure , which is particularly relevant for data on finer time scales . \n this flexibility is illustrated by fitting the model to hourly rainfall data . \n we also compare our model to that given in @xcite , which was used in @xcite for pricing rainfall futures based on daily data from detroit . \n this paper is structured as follows : section 2 discusses characteristic features of the rainfall process in light of data from different locations and time scales . \n section 3 presents the rainfall model and shows how it fits into the continuous - time arma ( carma ) model framework . \n section 4 gives details on the fitting method , and section 5 investigates the model performance using empirical data . in section 6 \n we derive a method for pricing rainfall derivatives based on our model . \n in this section we motivate the structure of our model by illustrating some of the characterising features of rainfall time series . \n we base this illustration on two data sets which will be used throughout this paper : the first consists of hourly accumulated rainfall amounts at heathrow ( uk ) over the years 1980 - 2012 , provided by the @xcite . \n the second data set gives daily accumulated rainfall amounts in detroit ( us ) over the years 1980 - 2010 , provided by bloomberg professional service . \n figure [ detroit_heathrow_3yrs ] shows the rainfall time series for both locations over the years 2008 - 2010 . \n these plots illustrate that the rainfall process is subject to sudden transitions between periods with little or no rain and periods of higher intensity , causing the large spikes in the graph . \n there is also a large amount of zero values in both data sets , as shown in table [ zerotable ] . \n because the data is rounded to the nearest unit of measurement ( @xmath0 mm for the heathrow data and @xmath1 inch for the detroit data ) , these zero values represent all data points with a value smaller than this unit . \n the proportion of zero values is dependent on the measurement time scale , with fewer zero values for the daily data . \n this is because periods with no rainfall must persist throughout the measurement time interval in order to induce a value of zero in the data . \n .percentage of rainfall measurements equal to zero . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n we have introduced a new class of continuous - time stochastic processes , driven by the hougaard lvy process , and shown how it can be used to construct a parsimonious and analytically tractable model for rainfall . by generalising the ornstein - uhlenbeck process representing rainfall intensity to a continuous - time arma ( carma ) process \n , we obtain a model with a very flexible autocorrelation structure . \n we presented a general fitting method for this class which exploits a correspondence between integrated carma and arma processes . \n we showed that the model fits the marginal distribution of the rainfall very well on both hourly and daily time scales . \n in particular , the marginal fit for daily rainfall is better than that of the standard model described in @xcite , and we also obtain an adequate fit to the mean and marginal distribution on a month - by - month basis .    by virtue of the carma generalisation , the extended model manages to accurately reproduce the autocorrelation structure of the observed rainfall , a characterising feature of the process which becomes increasingly significant for smaller time scales . \n the last part of the paper gives a result specifying the risk - neutral expectation of a function of the rainfall process , which can be used for pricing general derivatives written on a precipitation index . to construct a risk - neutral measure we use the esscher transform , with a time - dependent parameter representing the risk premium . \n we state the result for a general moving average process , a class which includes our model as a special case . \n the pricing methodology constitutes an important generalisation of the independent increment model considered in @xcite , which does not allow for price dynamics of derivatives . \n we illustrated the pricing method by calculating futures prices based on empirical daily rainfall data from detroit , and showed how they can be calibrated to observed prices . \n given a sufficient amount of price data , one can study the properties of the market price of risk ( mpr ) that is implied by this calibration . @xcite discuss the market price of weather risk , focusing on temperature derivatives , and provides an example of modelling the mpr of temperature derivatives as a deterministic function of the seasonal temperature variation . \n as the market for rainfall derivatives matures , one could conduct a similar study for the mpr of rainfall derivatives . \n [ [ acknowledgements . ] ] acknowledgements . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we thank the associate editor and two anonymous referees for constructive suggestions that led to significant improvements of the paper . \n r. c. noven gratefully acknowledges financial support from the grantham institute for climate change , imperial college london . \n we thank the uk meteorological office and the british atmospheric data centre for providing the data used . \n in the following we present the proofs of our theoretical results . \n [ intlem ] let @xmath2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] be a left -

{"ContextTokens": 3495, "GeneratedTokens": 146, "SynthesizedBody": "it is known that the neutrino physics plays an unique role in astrophysics and cosmology . in particular , these light weakly interacting particles are special for astrophysical phenomena like a supernova explosion when a large number of neutrinos is produced in a collapsing stellar core ( raffelt 1996 ) . \n the compact core with the typical radius @xmath1 km , the supranuclear density @xmath2 and the high temperature @xmath3 mev , is opaque for neutrinos . while a rather rarified remnant envelope with the typical density @xmath4 and temperature of the order of few mev , becomes partially transparent for the neutrino flux . \n notice that in investigations of neutrino processes in medium not only dense substance , but also a magnetic field should be taken into account . \n we stress that a magnetic field can play the role of additional component of an active medium , and influence substantially on particle properties . \n this influence becomes especially important in the case when the magnetic field strength reaches the critical , schwinger value @xmath5 g.  , @xmath6 is the elementary charge . ] \n according to modern astrophysical models , very strong magnetic fields up to @xmath7 g could be generated , for example , in a rapidly rotating supernova remnant ( duncan and thompson 1992 ; bisnovatyi - kogan 1993 ; mathews et.al . \n 1997 ) . \n previously , in the studies of neutrino interactions with a dense stellar medium the main attention was given to the neutrino \n nucleon processes . \n this is due to the fact that the urca - processes and the neutrino - nucleon scattering defined the major contribution into the energy balance of the collapsing core , and were considered as a main source of neutrino opacity . \n the neutrino - electron processes were less investigated . however , as it was pointed in studies mezzacappa and bruenn ( 1993 ) , taking account of the neutrino - electron scattering in a detail analysis of the supernova dynamics is physically justified indeed . in particular , the neutrino - electron processes can contribute significantly into the asymmetry and provide a competition with the neutrino - nucleon processes . \n for example , in the paper kuznetsov and mikheev ( 2000 ) the total set of neutrino - electron processes ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) was investigated in a strong magnetic field limit , when electrons and positrons occupied the lowest landau level . \n it was shown that the neutrino force action on plasma along the magnetic field turns out to be of the same order and , what is essential , of the same sign as the one caused by the @xmath11-processes ( gvozdev and ognev 1999 ) .    by this means , the investigations of the neutrino - electron processes under extreme conditions of a high density and/or temperature of matter and also of a strong magnetic field are the subject of a great interest .    in this study \n we investigate the neutrino \n electron processes in a dense magnetized plasma . \n in contrast to ( kuznetsov and mikheev 2000 ) we consider the physical situation when the magnetic field is not so strong , whereas the density of plasma is large . \n thus the chemical potential of electrons , @xmath12 , is the dominating factor : ^2 > 2eb t^2 , e^2 m_e^2 , [ eq : cond1 ] where @xmath13 is the plasma temperature , @xmath14 is the typical neutrino energy . under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) \n plasma electrons occupy the excited landau levels . at the same time \n it is assumed that the magnetic field strength being relatively weak , ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , is simultaneously strong enough , so that the following condition is satisfied : eb e. [ eq : cond2 ] in the present astrophysical view , the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) could be realized , as an example , in a supernova envelope , where the electron chemical potential is assumed to be @xmath15 mev , plasma temperature @xmath16 mev . \n the magnetic field could be as high as @xmath17 g. under the conditions considered the approximation of ultrarelativistic plasma is a good one , so we will neglect the electron mass wherever this causes no complications .    as it was shown in paper mikheev and narynskaya ( 2000 ) \n , under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) the total set of neutrino - electron processes reduces to the process of neutrino scattering on plasma electrons . \n moreover , both initial and final electrons occupy the same landau level . \n the neutrino  electron scattering in dense magnetized plasma was investigated by bezchastnov and haensel ( 1996 ) . \n numerical calculations of the differential cross  section of this process in the limit of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) were performed . \n the purpose of our work is to calculate analytically not only the probability of this process , but also the volume density of the neutrino energy and momentum losses under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1]),([eq : cond2 ] ) . \n we start from the effective local lagrangian of the neutrino  electron interaction in the framework of the standard model : l_eff= [ e _ ( c_v - c_a_5)e ] j^ , [ eq : lag ] where @xmath19 $ ] is the current of massless left neutrinos , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . here \n upper signs correspond to the electron neutrino @xmath22 when both z and w boson exchange takes part in a process . \n the lower signs correspond to @xmath12 and @xmath23 neutrino @xmath24 , when the z boson exchange is only presented in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] ) .    in order to impart a physical meaning to the probability of the neutrino - electron scattering per unit time , \n it is necessary to integrate not only over the final but also over the initial electron states as well : @xmath25 here @xmath26 corresponds to the maximal possible landau level number , which is defined as the integer part of the ratio @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the total interaction time , @xmath29 is the s - matrix element squared of the process considered , @xmath30 is the normalization volume , @xmath31 is a distribution function of final neutrinos , @xmath32^{-1}$ ] , @xmath33 is the final neutrino energy , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the effective chemical potential and the spectral temperature of the neutrino gas correspondingly . in a general case \n the neutrino spectral temperature @xmath35 can differ from the plasma temperature @xmath13 ( we do not assume the equilibrium between neutrino gas and plasma ) . \n the phase - space elements of the initial and final plasma electrons in the presence of a magnetic field are defined by the following way : , the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath36 axis . ] \n dn_e^- = l_y l_z f(_n ) , dn_e^- = l_y l_z ( 1 -

electron process in the presence of a magnetic field . in the limit of a rare neutrino gas \n when @xmath60 , the result has a more simple form : w _ ( ) i(u ) , [ eq : prob3 ] i(u ) = _ 0 ^ 1 ( u^4 ( 3 z^2 + 2z + 1 ) - 12 u^2 z + z^2 + 2z + 3 ) . for comparison we present here the probability of the neutrino - electron scattering without field in the same limitof the rare neutrino gas : w_vac=. \n [ eq : probvac ]     is the probability in a non - magnetized plasma . ] \n the numerical estimation of the ratio of the probabilities ( [ eq : prob3 ] ) and ( [ eq : probvac ] ) is presented in fig.[fig : graf1 ] . \n it is seen that the probability in a magnetized plasma excesses the vacuum probability in the vicinity of a point @xmath61 only . \n in this section we will calculate the volume density of neutrino energy and momentum losses per unit time in a medium , which could be defined by the following way : ( , ) = dw , [ eq : defloss ] where @xmath62 is the difference between the momenta of the initial and final neutrinos , @xmath63 . \n the zeroth component , @xmath64 , determines the neutrino energy loss in unit volume per unit time . in general , a neutrino propagating through plasma can both lose and capture energy . \n so , we will mean the  loss  of energy in the algebraic sense . \n the vector @xmath65 in eq.([eq : defloss ] ) is associated with the volume density of the neutrino momentum loss in unit time , and therefore it defines the neutrino force acting on plasma . because of the isotropy of plasma without a magnetic field , in the presence of a magnetic field one would expect to obtain the neutrino force action along the magnetic field only . \n however , as it was shown above , the probability of the neutrino - electron scattering ( [ eq : prob2 ] ) is the symmetric functions with respect to the substitution @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) . \n this means that the neutrino scattering on excited electrons does not give a contribution into the neutrino force acting on plasma along the magnetic field . \n thus , under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) there is no neutrino force action on plasma at all . \n therefore , this force is caused by a contribution of neutrino interactions with ground landau level electrons only , and the result obtained by kuznetsov and mikheev ( 2000 ) has a more general applicability in fact . \n it may be used even in the limit of dense plasma when chemical potential is considerably greater than the magnetic field strength ( @xmath68 ) .    for the neutrino energy loss in unit volume per unit time in the limit of a very dense plasma we obtain the following result : _ b = ^2 t^4 n _ j_b ( ) , [ eq : lossb ] @xmath69\\nonumber   \\\\   & \\qquad &    \\hspace{30 mm }   \\times \\,\\ , \\frac{1 - e^{y(1 - \\tau)}}{1 - e^{-y\\tau } } \\,\\ , e^{-y ( 1+z)/ 2z } ,   \\label{eq : jb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the concentration of initial neutrinos , the parameter @xmath23 has a meaning of a relative neutrino spectral temperature , @xmath71 . \n it is interesting to compare this result with the one in a non - magnetized plasma which can be presented in a similar form : _ \n b=0 = ^2 t^4 n _ j_b=0 ( ) , [ eq : loss0 ] j_b=0 ( ) = 4 ^4 _ 0^ d^2 . \n [ eq : j0 ] the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 define the dependence of the neutrino energy losses on the relative neutrino spectral temperature in a magnetized plasma and in a plasma without field correspondingly . in the limit of a sufficiently large neutrino spectral temperature ( @xmath74 ) they reduce to the power functions : @xmath75     ( solid line ) and @xmath73 ( dashed line ) versus the relative spectral neutrino temperature . ]    the graphs of the functions ( [ eq : jb ] ) and ( [ eq : j0 ] ) are presented in fig.[fig : graf2 ] . \n as one would expect , at neutrino spectral temperature smaller than the plasma one ( @xmath76 ) the values of the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are negative . \n it implies that neutrino propagating via medium captures energy from the plasma . at the @xmath77 \n more then @xmath13 ( @xmath78 ) , neutrino gives up energy to the plasma . at the point \n @xmath79 there is a thermal equilibrium when there is no energy exchange between neutrino and electron - positron plasma . \n it can be seen that the neutrino energy loss in a magnetized plasma is less than the one in non - magnetized plasma . by this means , under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) the magnetized plasma becomes more transparent for neutrinos than plasma without field . \n in this paper we have investigated the neutrino - electron scattering in a dense magnetized plasma . \n we have considered the physical situation when the plasma component is the dominating one of the two components of the active medium . at the same time , a magnetic field was assumed to be not too small ( @xmath80 ) . the probability and the volume density of the neutrino energy - momentum losses have been calculated . \n it is found , that the neutrino scattering on excited electrons does not give a contribution into the neutrino force acting on plasma . \n this force is caused by the neutrino - electron processes when plasma electrons occupy the lowest landau level only . \n thus the result for this force , obtained in paper kuznetsov and mikheev ( 2000 ) , has a more wide area of application . \n it may be used under a condition @xmath81 as well . \n it is shown that under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) the combine effect of plasma and strong magnetic field leads to a decrease of the neutrino energy loss in comparison to the one in a pure plasma . \n therefore , the complex medium , plasma + strong magnetic field , is more transparent for neutrinos than non - magnetized plasma . \n one would believe that the result obtained will be useful for the detail analysis of astrophysical cataclysms like supernova explosions . \n this work was supported in part by the russian foundation for basic research under the grant no . \n 01 -

limited surveys of the full sky visible to the array ; 3 ) time domain astrophysics through exploration of the variable radio sky ; and 4 ) solar imaging and characterisation of the heliosphere and ionosphere via propagation effects on background radio source emission . \n the mwa has reached the point of practical completion and will be available to the global user community from mid-2013 , based on an `` open skies '' policy ( http://www.mwatelescope.org ) . \n users will be able to propose observational programs with the mwa in the first half of 2013 , including for solar science . \n considerable data have been obtained in advance of completion of the full instrument . \n a prototype array was operated for approximately 2 years , from 2009 to 2011 , and during construction of the full array , science commissioning observations were undertaken . \n this paper will briefly describe the capabilities of the mwa for solar physics and summarise some of the solar results thus far obtained . \n the results to date have been obtained with arrays four times less sensitive than the final array that will be available in 2013 , and generally with lower angular resolution and image fidelity than will be available with the final array . \n low radio frequency imaging of the sun was pioneered in australia under the leadership of paul wild @xcite . \n wild and others imaged the sun at frequencies similar to the mwa frequencies for the first time , revealing the nature of type ii and type iii bursts ( these types were defined by the same group based on high quality dynamic spectra ) and monitoring their evolution as a function of time and frequency @xcite . \n this work used the culgoora solar heliograph , built by wild and his team in the late 1960s .    since the closure of culgoora in 1984 \n , there has been no low frequency solar imaging capability in australia . \n the mwa will therefore renew this capability in australia using modern instrumentation on a radio quiet site . \n important capabilities of the mwa for solar physics are the time and frequency resolution of imaging . \n the mwa can produce images at a rate of two per second , for each of the four stokes parameters and for each frequency channel across the bandwidth . \n the bandwidth is 30.72 mhz , tunable in the range 80 to 300 mhz , with the 30.72 mhz broken up into a maximum of 3072 channels of 10 khz each . \n thus , in one minute it is possible for the mwa to produce almost 1.5 million images ( number of frequency channels @xmath0 number of stokes parameters @xmath0 number of time steps ) , allowing a comprehensive exploration of the evolution of the radio emission as function of both frequency and time . \n the angular resolution of the mwa at these low frequencies is of order 1 arcminute , likely within a factor of a few of the expected scattering size due to the intervening plasma , at the top end of the mwa frequency range . \n approximately 1000 resolution elements will cover the disk of the sun , at the top end of the mwa frequency range ( fewer resolution elements at lower frequency ) . \n in novemnber 2012 the mwa reached a major milestone in practical completion of the full instrument as described by @xcite and in early 2013 the full capabilities of the mwa will be exercised for the first time , leading to commencement of the first science operations phase from mid-2013 . during the period 2009 - 2011 , \n a 32 tile prototype array was operated and used as a science and engineering testbed . \n this was decommissioned in early 2012 , to make way for the construction of the final instrument . in the final stages of construction , from approximately september 2012 , science commissioning of the final instrument commenced , overlapping with construction ; 32 tile subsets of the final instrument were commissioned and tested as they were completed . \n the 32 tile sub - arrays ranged from configurations with only short baselines ( low angular resolution ) to configurations with close to the maximum length baselines ( high angular resolution ) .    during both the prototype phase and science commissioning phase , \n scientific observations were performed across all mwa science themes . in the prototype phase \n , @xcite performed the first demonstration of the spectroscopic imaging capabilities of the mwa ( albeit with relatively low angular resolution ) , revealing a rich variety of phenomena in the observed frequency range of 171 - 202 mhz , consisting of many short - lived , narrow - band , non - thermal emission features . \n while the @xcite images are of low angular resolution , they show a number of these events to be marginally resolved . a somewhat surprising feature of these first serious solar observations with the mwa was the rich variety of weak transient events , showing that to effectively study the sun at these frequencies a surperb radio quiet location is required . \n even to study the sun , one of the brightest radio objects in the sky , very low levels of human - made interference appear critical to success . \n other mwa prototype observations of type iii flares from 2011 are currently being analysed in conjunction with sdo and rhessi data ( cairns et al . \n 2013 , in preparation ) . \n even the prototype phase of the mwa development was scientifically productive in terms of solar science .    in the science commissioning phase of the final mwa instrument , since approximately september 2012 , \n almost 100 tb of solar imaging data have been collected ! \n this vast store of data covers observations with five different 32 tile sub - arrays , generally during quiet periods for the sun . \n the most effective sub - array was the so - called `` gamma '' array , since the configuration of 32 tiles used included long baselines and therefore produced high angular resolution images ( few arcminute angular resolution ) . \n an example is shown in figure 1 , from data obtained on october 29 , 2012 ( 03:35:44 ut ) . \n this image represents a single 1 second integration and a 40 khz channel at a frequency of approximately 150 mhz in a single linear polarisation . \n the disk of the sun is well - resolved . \n the sun on this day was rated as quiet . however , even in this state weak transient events are clearly seen when a series of images are made over a period of several minutes ( tingay et al . \n 2013 , in preparation ) . \n a limb brightening effect could be expected for the data presented in figure 1 @xcite . \n however , with an angular resolution of only @xmath14 arcminutes ( @xmath210% of the solar disk diameter ) , the brightening is likely to be smeared into the disk emission . at 150 mhz , \n the altitude of the resonant plasma lies at a distance of around 1.2 rs , which gives a diameter of around 38 arcminutes at the earth . \n this is approximately the diameter of the sun seen figure 1 . \n we take this as evidence for additional limb emission due to the corona and the absence of an apparent change in the surface brightness at the limb because of the smearing due to limited angular resolution . \n in addition to the capabilities of the final instrument described above , the mwa will have the ability to record the raw voltage streams from each tile . \n this capability makes it possible to produce dynamic spectra and images at very high time and frequency resolution , sub - millisecond and sub-10 khz ( but not at maximum time and frequency resolution simultaneously ) . \n such high resolution imaging will open up the ability to study the temporal and frequency sub - structure of both strong flares and the weak features seen by @xcite . \n the mwa data will be of most use if they can be combined with data from other solar observation platforms in other wavelength ranges . \n part of the motivation for attending this conference and providing an update on the capabilities of the mwa was to make contact with other instrument teams and to start to coordinate mwa solar observations with multi - wavelength campaigns . \n as described in @xcite , the mwa could play a significant role in tracking large coronal mass ejections and making early predictions regarding collisions with the earth . \n it is thus timely that the mwa will come into full operation in the first half of 2013 , presumably the year of maximum activity during cycle 24 . \n this scientific work makes use of the murchison radio - astronomy observatory . \n we acknowledge the wajarri yamatji people as the traditional owners of the observatory site . \n support for the mwa comes from the u.s . \n national science foundation ( grants ast-0457585 , phy-0835713 , career-0847753 , and ast-0908884 ) , the australian research council ( lief grants le0775621 and le0882938 ) , the u.s . \n air force office of scientic research ( grant fa9550 -

{"ContextTokens": 1554, "GeneratedTokens": 106, "SynthesizedBody": "the measurement of electromagnetic observables in relativistic nuclear collisions has constituted a vigorous experimental effort at different facilities around the world for several decades , and it is fair to write that this program has lived up to its promises . \n indeed , photons ( real and virtual ) carry information complementary to that in hadronic observables , as they suffer essentially no final state interaction . \n one may show @xcite that the photon emission rate in a finite - temperature medium is directly related to the in - medium retarded self - energy of the photon : a valuable quantity . however , the measured signal is comprised of several contributions which have to be under simultaneous theoretical control before significant claims can be substantiated . \n as in nucleon - nucleon interactions , nucleus - nucleus collisions will produce prompt photons during the early collisions of the nuclear constituents . \n the prompt ( direct + fragmentation ) photon spectrum can be calculated in @xmath2 collisions at next - to - leading order @xcite . \n the direct contribution comprises both compton and annihilation components : @xmath3 the nlo effects are contained in the k - factors ; their list of arguments has been omitted for brevity . in principle , the prompt photon spectrum depends on the choice of renormalization , factorization ( @xmath4 ) , and fragmentation ( @xmath5 ) scales ; in the above the first has been set equal to the second . choosing them to be @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the photon transverse momentum , yields a photon spectrum in proton - proton collisions in good agreement with observation @xcite . \n this can be then be used as a baseline for calculations of photon production in nucleus - nucleus collisions . in this case , isospin effects are included in the parton distribution function , by using the parton species for the proton or for the neutron , as appropriate . \n shadowing corrections are also taken into account .      in a thermal environment , whether composed of partons or of hadrons in the confined phase , the photons produced are calculated simply by performing an integral over the space - time history of the strongly interacting system : @xmath8 the differential photon production rate , @xmath9 , is evaluated in the local thermal rest frame , and at a given time will consist of partonic and/or hadronic contributions . \n another process which depends on the temperature is that of jet - thermal photon production . \n this happens when a jet crossing the hot medium undergoes a photon - producing interaction with a thermal parton . \n this can further be divided in two classes , those which will benefit from collinear enhancements , and those which will not @xcite . \n all of the rates introduced so far need to be integrated using with a realistic time - evolution model of the relativistic nuclear collision . \n we will use a two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical approach - azhydro - which provides a good global description of hadronic observables @xcite and , importantly , is not tuned to specifically reproduce electromagnetic measurements . \n the initial jet energy profiles calculated from qcd are evolved in time according to amy @xcite . \n the evolution of the parton energy profile , @xmath10 , is determined by solving a set of coupled fokker - planck rate equations which have the following generic form : @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transition rate for processes where partons of energy @xmath12 loose energy @xmath13 is @xmath14 . the energy gain channels are included through the possibility for @xmath13 to be negative . \n also , amy smoothly handles the crossover between the bethe - heitler and landau - pomeranchuk - migdal regimes @xcite . \n a free parameter of the model is @xmath15 , the strong coupling , which is adjusted to reproduce @xmath16 . \n the calculated photon spectra , together with their different components , are shown in figure [ pho_spec ] . \n the reader may judge of the good agreement between theory and data . \n no parameters have been tuned to generate these figures . \n two other useful representations of the experimental data are displayed in figure [ r_aav2 ] . \n the first ( left panel ) is the ubiquitous @xmath0 variable , while the second is a plot of the photon azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath1 .    in both panels , \n the data does not yet permit an accurate determination of model parameters and ingredients . \n however , the fact that @xmath17 1 at high values of @xmath18 is a consequence of the fragmentation photons being affected by the energy loss of the fragmenting jets ( as well as by an isospin effect @xcite ) : should this trend be confirmed experimentally , a link would exist between the nuclear modification factor of photons and that of strongly interacting particles also borne out of fragmentation .    turning to @xmath1 \n , one observes that the azimuthal anisotropy associated with the jet - plasma photons is indeed negative , as originally suggested @xcite . \n however , the net value of @xmath1 appears to be essentially zero for @xmath19 4 gev . \n the reason for this is two - fold . \n first , the geometric anisotropy of the medium in the realistic 2d+1 model is rather small initially , and then proceeds to shrink as time evolves . \n second , the geometry of the initial jet profile is evaluated here with a realistic woods - saxon distribution , rather than using a hard sphere profile . \n however , these results do show that the photon @xmath20 is rather sensitive to early time dynamics in relativistic nuclear collisions : precise measurements thus have the potential to stringently constrain the time - evolution scenarios . \n a global picture is emerging where the physics of qcd jets and the generation of electromagnetic radiation in nuclear collisions need to be treated simultaneously and consistently . \n the results displayed here are being generalized to include energy loss by elastic collision processes @xcite , and the effects of a 3d+1 hydrodynamical evolution . \n 10 kapusta j and gale c 2006 _ finite -

weisz gauge action@xcite with a chirally improved dirac operator@xcite . in this paper \n we extend the scaling analysis in ref.@xcite on the fp action by adding new results on an @xmath5 lattice with lattice unit @xmath6fm . \n this extension is necessary , since our scaling test in @xcite referred to a small @xmath7fm spatial size lattice with low statistics , while our large @xmath8fm lattice results with good statistics could be compared with other simulations only . \n the new data have been used already in a scaling test on the @xmath9 scattering length@xcite . \n no cut - off effects were seen there , but it is difficult to measure the scattering length precisely . \n we need reliable information on the cut - off effects in the quenched approximation since these results help to choose the parameters of future full qcd simulations the bgr collaboration is moving towards . \n in addition , this information might be helpful when comparing the results from different actions for consistency . \n indeed , there exist unclarified inconsistencies between different works in light hadron spectroscopy . on the ape plot , for example , \n the cp - pacs@xcite continuum extrapolated numbers lie significantly below the data obtained with most of the different improved actions . for a recent comparison of numerical data obtained with different actions see ref . \n @xcite .    the parametrized fp dirac operator lives on the hypercube , has 81 offsets , a large number of paths , uses all the elements of the clifford algebra@xcite and satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation up to parametrization errors . \n the setup of the present simulation and the analysis follows closely those applied in ref.@xcite . \n we generated 180 gauge configurations separated by 500 alternating metropolis and pseudo over - relaxation sweeps at gauge coupling @xmath10 . \n at this coupling the lattice unit is @xmath6fm as determined from the sommer parameter @xmath11fm@xcite . \n as it is well known , it is difficult to give an estimate on the systematic errors of @xmath12 if the lattice is not fine . at this resolution \n , the systematic error should be on the percent level , while the statistical error is smaller than @xmath13@xcite . \n the spatial extension of the lattice is @xmath14fm . in our earlier results obtained at @xmath15fm and @xmath8fm at resolution \n @xmath16fm we saw no finite size effects beyond the statistical errors . \n our scaling analysis might be influenced by small finite size effects , however , and these physical effects might mix with the topological finite size artifacts as we discuss below .    before summarizing our results , \n let us make two general remarks concerning scaling analyses in light hadron spectroscopy . \n although the most interesting part of the spectrum for physics is where the quark masses go to their small physical values , the heavier quarks bring more information for scaling studies : the hadrons are more compact , they are more difficult to resolve and the cut - off effects are expected to be larger . \n in addition , the statistical and systematic errors are smaller , so the analysis is more conclusive . \n the second remark refers to a special artifact of _ quenched _ light hadron spectroscopy : the topological finite size artifacts . \n the discrete zero modes of the dirac operator at @xmath17 are not suppressed in the quenched approximation and , in a finite volume at sufficiently small quark masses , they will corrupt the hadron propagators@xcite . in ref.@xcite we eliminated / reduced the topological finite size artifacts by using special hadron correlators in the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , nucleon ( n ) and delta ( @xmath18 ) channels . \n unfortunately , in the vector channel we did not find a natural solution for this problem and the artifacts turned out to be larger at @xmath6fm than at @xmath19fm in the same physical volume @xmath15fm . \n the effect is seen in the vector meson mass at the lightest quark masses in fig . \n [ fig : rawdata ] , where the dimensionless hadron masses are shown as the function of the dimensionless quark mass . \n this feature ( namely , the bending down of the vector meson curve at small quark masses ) is very similar to the artifacts we saw earlier appearing in smaller volumes , and then disappearing in our largest box with @xmath8fm@xcite . \n these quenching artifacts should be separated from the cut - off effects in a scaling test . \n this is relevant in particular in the vector channel , since the vector meson mass is used traditionally ( unfortunately ) as a unit for other hadron masses . \n the problem occurs at sufficiently light quark masses only , which gives an additional argument to avoiding this region in scaling studies . \n the hadron masses as the function of the quark mass in lattice units at @xmath20fm in a box of size @xmath15fm.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we give here a brief summary of our conclusions . considering mass ratios ( like in the ape plot , or measuring the masses in units of a well determined fixed hadron mass ) we see small cut - off effects in the baryon channel when comparing the results at @xmath16 and 0.102fm resolutions . \n the effect is seen for relative heavy quarks beyond the statistical errors . in the @xmath21 channel \n this is a several standard deviation effect and has a size of up to @xmath22 in the ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the vector meson mass . in the nucleon and delta channels the cut - off effects are smaller , but for heavy quarks they are also visible beyond the statistical errors \n this small shift brings the fp results on the ape plot closer to and essentially consistent with the cp - pacs continuum extrapolated results with wilson fermions@xcite . \n the improved staggered ( asqtad@xcite ) data at @xmath25fm@xcite with heavier quarks lie a few standard deviations higher and are close to the cp - pacs results at @xmath26fm . in addition , unlike at @xmath16fm , we see a discrepancy in the overall scale obtained in the gauge sector from the sommer parameter @xmath27 and the scale from the spectrum of light hadrons . \n the hadron sector prefers a scale of @xmath28fm as opposed to the scale of @xmath6fm . in this case \n , however , it is difficult to estimate the systematic errors . \n concerning the details of the analysis we refer to ref.@xcite . in order to avoid very busy figures we shall use a few selected results only from other works in this paper . \n one can get a more complete picture by combining the figures here with those in ref.@xcite . \n the measured new data are collected in tables 1 and 2 . \n [ fig : overview ] gives a quick overview on the cut - off effects in the different channels . in this figure \n the hadron masses are measured in @xmath29 units , where @xmath29 is the vector meson mass at @xmath30 . \n this figure indicates already that the change due to cut -

{"ContextTokens": 3321, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "during the last 15 years , thanks to satellite missions like _ bepposax _ \n @xcite , _ swift _ @xcite , and _ fermi _ \n @xcite , our progress in the understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been quite spectacular . \n we now know that grbs are cosmological events related to a catastrophic energy release in stellar mass objects . \n energy dissipation within a highly relativistic `` fireball '' , presumably emitted in the form of a jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , is believed to power the observed @xmath0-ray flash ( prompt emission ) and the subsequent `` afterglow '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n traditionally , grbs have been divided in two main categories , long and short ones ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , depending on the duration of their prompt @xmath0-ray emission ( @xmath1s for the short bursts , @xmath2s for the long ones ) . \n these two populations of bursts are thought to be related to two different progenitor models : `` collapsars '' for the long - soft bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) , and the merger of binary systems of compact objects such as neutron star ( ns)-ns or black - hole ( bh)-ns systems , for the short - hard ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n despite the recent issues raised in the classification of short and long grbs based solely on their prompt emission properties ( e.g , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the general picture of two classes of bursts related to two main progenitor models , still holds . \n the collapsar scenario is observationally supported by the fact that long grbs occur in galaxies with high specific star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , and that at least some long grbs have been observed to be associated with core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) of rare type @xcite . \n indeed , the question of what makes some stars die as sne and some other as relativistic grbs , is not solved yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n indications that progenitors of short bursts belong , on average , to old stellar populations with a typical lifetime of several gyr @xcite , provide support to the binary merger scenario . \n collapsars and binary mergers leading to the formation of a bh plus an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , have the potential to power the grb fireball via the energy released from the accretion of the disk onto the newly formed bh . while the formation of a bh plus disk system is common to both progenitor models , the more compact scale of the ns - ns ( or bh - ns systems ) , and the less massive debris left over after merger , are invoked to explain the shorter duration and the smaller isotropic energies of these bursts with respect to long ones .    within the standard fireball model , \n once the fireball is launched from the central engine , the observed radiation is explained as synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission from electrons accelerated in internal and external shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , taking place at distances @xmath3 cm from the central source . \n high - energy ( gev ) tails observed in some grbs have challenged the internal - external shock fireball model in its simplest formulation @xcite . \n however , it remains true that the electromagnetic emission from grbs , being produced at large distances from the central engine , provides indirect information on the progenitor . on the other hand , gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted from the progenitor \n could directly probe its nature . \n being related to catastrophic events involving stellar - mass objects , grbs are good candidates for the detection of gws @xcite . coalescing binaries , thought to be associated with short bursts , are one of the most promising gw sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) for detectors like the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ; * ? ? ? * ) and virgo @xcite . \n for such systems , a chirp signal should be emitted in gws during the in - spiral , followed by a burst - type signal associated with the merger , and subsequently a signal from the ring - down phase of the newly formed bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n the last , initially deformed , is expected to radiate gws until reaching a kerr geometry @xcite .    in the collapsar scenario , \n relevant for long grbs , the high rotation required to form the centrifugally supported disk that powers the grb , should produce gws via bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) or fragmentation instabilities that might develop in the collapsing core ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for recent reviews ) and/or in the disk @xcite \n . moreover , asymmetrically infalling matter is expected to perturb the final bh geometry , leading to a ring - down phase @xcite . \n ligo and virgo have been carrying out electromagnetically triggered searches for gws @xcite over the past decade ( for bar detectors electromagnetically triggered searches , see e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the ligo scientific collaboration operates two ligo observatories in the u.s . \n along with the geo600 detector @xcite in germany . \n together with virgo , located in italy , they form a detector network capable of detecting gw signals arriving from all directions . \n grb - triggered searches for gws by ligo and virgo have targeted both the chirp signal expected in the case of short grbs during the ns - ns or bh - ns in - spiral , and short unmodeled pulses of gws that may be expected during the merger / collapse , and ring - down phases of short / long grbs @xcite . \n these searches have adopted on - source time windows of few minutes ( long grbs ) or few seconds ( short grbs ) around the grb trigger time . \n in fact , for long grbs , the time delay between the gw signal and @xmath0-ray trigger is thought to be dominated by the time necessary for the fireball to push through the stellar envelope of the progenitor ( 10 - 100s ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , for short grbs , \n the ns - ns / bh - ns merger is believed to occur quickly , and be over within a few seconds ( naturally accounting for the short nature of these bursts ) . \n it is estimated that triggered searches for gws in few minutes time - windows yield a factor of @xmath4 improvement in sensitivity with respect to untriggered ones @xcite . \n the most exciting results from ligo grb - triggered searches of gws are probably represented by the cases of the short grbs 070201 @xcite and 051103 @xcite , whose error boxes overlap with nearby galaxies ( m31 for grb070201 ; m81 for grb051103 ) . a ns - ns binary merger scenario occurring in such hosts \n was excluded by ligo with rather high confidence @xcite . \n however , the possibility that grb070201 and grb051103 are related to ( extra - galactic ) soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) giant flares ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , could not be ruled out . \n indeed , ligo upper - limits for short unmodeled pulses of gws from grb070201 and grb051103 , are above the maximum gw energy emissible in sgr giant flares @xcite . \n a very appealing prospect is represented by the possibility of using gws to trigger electromagnetic ( radio , optical , x - ray ) follow - ups of gw sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the discovery of off - axis optical or radio afterglows @xcite triggered via the ( non - beamed ) gw emission from the grb progenitors , would yield a dramatic confirmation of the `` jet model '' , map out the beaming distribution , and provide fundamental inputs to models of relativistic outflows . \n radio follow - ups , in particular , are an effective tool to identify relativistic and mildly relativistic outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) in the absence of a @xmath0-ray trigger . \n finding electromagnetic counterparts to gw triggers is technically challenging due to imperfect localization of the gw signal and uncertainty regarding the relative timing of the gw and electromagnetic emissions . \n the localization of ligo - virgo triple - coincidence gw triggers can yield error - areas of @xmath5deg@xmath6 , possibly spread over different patches of the sky ( see e.g. fig . 3 in * ? ? ? \n * ) . the problem of following - up with optical ( or radio , or x - ray ) telescopes such a large error - area can be partially mitigated by : ( i ) restricting the search for electromagnetic counterparts to transients in nearby galaxies ( within the ligo - virgo horizon distance ) ; ( ii ) by noticing that the most promising electromagnetic counterparts of gw events detectable by ligo and virgo \n are expected to be `` exotic '' ( rare ) ones ( e.g. , the orphan afterglow of a grb , and/or the  kilonova  from a binary merger - see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n in 2009 - 2010 , ligo and virgo , together with partner electromagnetic observatories , performed their first `` looc - up '' - locating and observing optical counterparts to unmodeled pulses of gravitational waves - experiment ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at the time , there were two operating ligo interferometers @xcite , each with 4-km arms ( one near hanford , washington , the other in livingston parish , louisiana ) . \n the virgo 3-km arms detector @xcite located near cascina ( italy ) , was also operating . \n the looc - up search has established a baseline for low - latency analyses with the next - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo and advanced virgo ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the collaboration between gw and electromagnetic observatories is likely to continue to develop over the next few years , as the scientific community gets ready for a global network of advanced gw detectors . \n the forthcoming years may see the development of new gw searches in coincidence with grbs , aimed at answering some of the questions opened by recent observations . \n in particular , a compelling result from _ swift _ has been the discovery that the `` normal '' power - law behavior of long grb x - ray light curves is often preceded at early times by a steep decay , followed by a shallower - than - normal decay ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . \n the steep - to - shallow and shallow - to - normal decay transitions are separated by two break times , @xmath7  s and @xmath8  s  @xmath9  s. it has been suggested that the shallow phase may be attributed to a continuous energy injection by a long - lived central engine , with progressively reduced activity @xcite . \n newborn magnetars , besides being candidate grb progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , have also been proposed to account for shallow decays or plateaus observed in grb light curves @xcite . \n independent support for the magnetar scenario comes from the observation of sn2006aj , associated with the nearby sub - energetic grb060218 , suggesting that the sn - grb connection may extend to a much broader range of stellar masses than previously thought , possibly involving two different mechanisms : a `` collapsar '' for the more massive stars collapsing to a bh , and a newborn ( highly - magnetized ) ns for the less massive ones @xcite . \n several studies have shown how magnetars dipole losses may indeed explain the flattening observed in grb afterglows @xcite . @xcite \n have explored a scenario in which the newly born magnetar left over after the grb explosion undergoes a secular bar - mode instability @xcite , thus producing a bar - like gw signal associated to the electromagnetic plateau , potentially detectable by the advanced ground - based interferometers like ligo and virgo ( up to distances of @xmath5mpc ) . compared to current analyses that gw detectors are carrying out ( see section [ triggered ] ) , \n this scenario @xcite involves a new class of gw signals , with a longer duration ( @xmath10 s ) and a different frequency evolution . \n data analysis techniques for the search of longer duration gw signals possibly applicable to grb searches , are being developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the ligo interferometers are being upgraded to the next - generation advanced detectors @xcite , that are expected to become operational around 2015 . \n virgo will also be upgraded to become advanced virgo @xcite . \n additionally , the new lcgt detector @xcite is being built in japan . \n these advanced detectors are expected to detect compact binary coalescences , possibly at a rate of dozens per year after reaching design sensitivity @xcite , so that the short - grb progenitor scenario may finally be probed directly . \n long - standing open questions ( e.g. , is the jet model for grbs correct ? why do some massive stars die as sne and others as relativistic grbs ? ) , or other issues raised by more recent observations ( such as the difficulties in the long - short grb classification ; the role of magnetars as grb progenitors ; the link between long grbs and sgrs , etc . ) , will greatly benefit from joint gw studies . \n the advanced gw detectors will provide a totally new view of the transient sky @xcite . \n the prospects for this new era of astronomy are exciting , and promise a return of big scientific impact .", "StartTimeOffset": 2341411351698, "RequestID": "11a8ebc75d04559f061c881f492ad741c57d0166", "TotalTokens": 3459}
{"ContextTokens": 3484, "GeneratedTokens": 253, "SynthesizedBody": "@xmath8 scuti stars are a class of pulsating variable stars that lies in the classical instability strip crosses the main sequence on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , whose pulsations are driven by the @xmath9mechanism which drives both the cepheids and the rr lyrae stars as well . with masses between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , periods between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , \n luminosities between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , these stars pulsate with amplitudes from mmag up to tenths of a magnitude . \n + the high - amplitude @xmath8 scuti stars ( hereafter hads ) are traditionally found to be slow rotators with one or two dominant radial modes with amplitudes larger than 0.1 mag , although they may occasionally have low - amplitude , non - radial modes in addition to the main pulsation modes ( @xcite ) . it is interesting to probe whether it is an overall property of all hads . \n + sx phoenicis ( sx phe ) stars , a subgroup of hads , are old pop . \n because of the insufficient amount and the poor photometric precision of the observation data , whether any low - amplitude pulsations exist besides the dominant radial modes in most sx phe stars are unknown . \n according to the existing data , they could probably be either in a post - giant branch stage of evolution or merged binary stars ( @xcite ) . \n although most sx phe stars , which are characterized by high amplitudes of pulsation , low metallicity , and large spatial motion , are found to be members of globular clusters ( @xcite ) , some of them have been discovered in the general star fields ( @xcite ) . \n particularly , pulsations in the majority of the field sx phe variables display very simple frequency spectra with short periods ( @xmath16 ) and large visual peak - to - peak amplitudes ( @xmath17 , c.f.@xcite ) . \n precise time - series photometric observations reveal period changes in these stars , which should theoretically reflect the evolutionary changes in radius . @xcite \n collected observed period changes found in some hads ( including sx phe stars ) and indicated that sudden jumps of period could be an explanation for the period changes observed in the sx phe stars . \n additionally , the study of period changes of double - mode sx phe stars raises a further important question : how does the overtone frequency change ? from a simple theoretical consideration , one could guess that the fundamental and overtone frequencies of radially pulsating sx phe stars change in the same direction and at about the same rate . \n however , the star we study in this paper , ae uma , has the fundamental and first overtone frequencies changed neither in the same direction nor at the same rate ( @xcite,@xcite ) . \n therefore , it is interesting to investigate pulsation behaviors of this star with the extended data of improved photometric precision . \n + the star ae ursae majoris ( hereafter ae uma)(= hip 47181 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , a9 ) , was discovered by @xcite . \n the spectral type of ae uma was classified by @xcite as a9 in accordance with the type of variability . until 1973 \n , it was shown that the star had significant light - curve variation with the determination of the period of the light variation and the type of variability as dwarf cepheid ( @xcite ) . \n then , the 1974 konkoly observations found the beat phenomenon ( @xcite ) . in 1995 , \n the star is listed as an sx phe star in @xcite . \n however , @xcite showed strong evidence against this classification , and reclassified it as a normal population i , high - amplitude @xmath8 scuti star . according to the calculation of @xcite , \n ae uma had such fast period decreasing ( @xmath23 ) only if it was a pre - ms star , but there exists no evidence that it is a pre - ms star . \n at last , both @xcite and @xcite analyzed pulsations of the star with better and longer data sets , and the results rejected the outcomes from @xcite . \n ae uma was classified as a pop . \n ii , post - ms sx phe star once again , with the fundamental frequency stable and the first overtone decreasing with a rate of about @xmath24 . + in the following sections , we present a detailed study of the period changes of ae uma , mainly based on extended time - series ccd observations from 2009 to 2012 collected at the xinglong station of national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) . \n the organization of the paper is : section 2 describes observations and data reduction ; section 3 introduces the pulsation analysis of the new data ; section 4 discusses the variations of the periods ; section 5 calculates the models with the constraints of the frequencies and their variations ; section 6 lists our conclusions . \n photometric observations for ae uma were made with the 85-cm telescope located at the xinglong station of naoc between march 2009 and may 2012 . \n the 85-cm telescope is equipped with a standard johnson - cousin - bessel multicolour filter system and a pi1024 bft ccd camera mounted on the primary focus ( @xcite ) . \n the ccd camera has @xmath25 pixels , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath26 . since march 2012 \n , the ccd camera has been replaced by a pi512 bft , which has @xmath27 pixels corresponding to a field of view of @xmath28 . \n the observations were made through a standard johnson @xmath29 filter with the exposure time ranging from 15 to 120 seconds , depending on the atmospheric conditions . \n a journal of the new observations is listed in table [ tab1 ] . \n .journal of observations with the 85-cm telescope . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can see that the results were in agreement with the values in @xcite , except the mass . with their observations and the method used , \n onecan believe that the @xmath30 $ ] and the @xmath31 values were in great reliability ( @xcite ) . \n so , we decided to use the value @xmath30 = -0.3 $ ] and @xmath32 . \n we used the fomula @xmath33 = \\log(\\frac{z}{x } ) - \\log(\\frac{z}{x})_{\\odot}\\ ] ] and the fomula @xmath34 to calculate the initial z. in @xcite , the model was calculated with the couple of value @xmath35 , which accord with the values in our previous calculation ( derived by mesa astero with the value of @xmath30 $ ] ) . \n at last , integrating all the informaiton about the value of @xmath36 , we decided to choose @xmath37 as the unique initial value for the subsequent calculation . \n not like the solar - like stars for which many frequencies are detected , hads exits only one or two frequencies . as a result , \n the period variation becomes a very important constraint on the model calculation of these stars . \n detection of high precision of period variation may offer strong constraints on ae uma . \n it is interesting that ae uma exits two frequencies with period variations in different scales and signs . \n but with the linear pulsation theory , variation of the period along with the stellar evolution should have values in the same sign and the same scale in most time . \n we used two different ways to calculate the period variations of ae uma theoretically . \n the vatiation rate of the fundamental period derived from long intervals of observations of ae uma shows a positive period change . from the theoretical point of view , the period changes caused by stellar evolution in and across the lower instability strip permit an observational test of stellar evolution theroy ( @xcite ) .    assuming that the stellar mass @xmath38 for the @xmath8 scuti stars during the observation interval with mass of @xmath39 and that the variation of pulsation constant is negligible as a very small quantity , @xcite got @xmath40 where p is the period of a radial pulsation \n , @xmath41 is the bolometric absolute magnitude , @xmath42 is the effective temperature . \n as indicated by @xcite , the sx phe variables locate on or near the main sequence of the h - r diagram . \n consequently , the evolutionary models are constructed from the pre - main - sequence hayashi phase to the end of the post main sequence . \n as mentioned , the parameters we used are @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . \n in addition , we do not take the effect of rotation into account since ae uma is a low - speed rotator . \n the evolutionary tracks we constructed from @xmath46 to @xmath47 are shown in figure [ fig6 ] , and the corresponding variation of the period were marked in the figure . \n to @xmath47 for @xmath43 . \n the rectangle shown on the h - r diagram is determined from the observed parameters of ae uma . \n marks on the tracks indicate the evolutionary period changes of @xmath48 with the value inside the interval @xmath49 $ ] in units of @xmath50 . ]    as shown in the figure [ fig6 ] , the state which are consonant with the observed period change values derived from the @xmath2 analysis appear before the first turn - offs and after the second turn - offs on the evolutionary tracks when they leave the ms .      adipls ( the aarhus adiabatic oscillation package ) is a programme for calculation of adiabatic oscillations of stellar models ( @xcite ) . \n we used it to calculate the frequencies of the model at each step of our evolutionary state . \n as a result , we got the frequencies of the model of @xmath51 and @xmath52 then deduced the variation of the frequencies of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the calculation \n , we assumed that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the frequencies with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . \n we calculated the evolutionary tracks from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , getting the frequencies on each tracks , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] .    in figure [ fig7 ] \n , one can see that the models with appropriate frequencies for ae uma could appear ( a ) just before the first turn - offs , ( b ) after the first and before the second turn - offs , ( c ) just after the second turn - offs . \n in addition , we also calculated the variation of the frequencies of the models using adipls . \n the results are shown in figure [ fig8 ] . \n it was not surprising that figure [ fig8 ] was in accord with figure [ fig6 ] , which showed also the variation of the fundamental frequency . \n in figure [ fig9 ] , we show the models with variation of the first overtone frequency @xmath52 in accord with the observed values . for the adiabaticity of the code adipls \n , we get the variation of @xmath52 almost as that of @xmath51 , with the same scale and the sign , even though they may not be equal to each other exactly in every points . \n the @xmath55 values from literatures have a low reliability , but the @xmath31 values have a high reliability are not sensitive to the evolutionary effect . as a result , we show the figures both of them ( @xmath55 vs @xmath56 , @xmath31 vs @xmath56 ) .    integrating the results of calculation of the frequencies and the variation of frequencies and comparison with the observed values , we can conclude that ae uma should locate on either before the first turn - offs or after the second turn - offs of the evolutionary tracks leaving the ms . \n we assume that ae uma is a regular radial pulsator with two frequencies . \n the variation of the fundamental frequency of ae uma is caused by the evolutionary effect . \n the rate of the variation is consistant with the theoretically predicted values by @xcite .    on the other hand \n , we would discuss the variation of the first overtone period which puts another constraint on the models . \n but once we put these constraints ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 ) together , we can not find any overlap on the evolutionary tracks ( superimposing figure [ fig7 ] , figure [ fig8 ] and figure [ fig9 ] ) . considering with the adiabaticity of adipls \n , we can just obtain the different pulsation modes period changes with same signs and scales . \n as we know , the evolutionary effect is originated from the core nuclear reaction , and propagate from inner to outer of the stellar . \n so we can conclude the evolution of the exterior is later than it of interior . \n in the theory of stellar pulsation , the domain of fundamental mode pulsation is deeper ( more close to the core ) than first overtone mode pulsation . or \n we can say that the fundamental mode is more sensitive than the first overtone mode to the effect of evolution .    hence , when the evolution state of the interior of the star pass through the second turn - off on the tracks ( figure [ fig8 ] ) , the exterior of the star is still in the state between the two turn - offs and preparing to pass through the second turn - off .    with the discussion above \n , one can explain the different signs of the period changes of the two pulsation modes , and conclude that ae uma is located just after the second turn - off on the evolutionary tracks ( see figure [ fig8 ] and figure [ fig9 ] ) . \n its corresponding mass ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath58 , age from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . \n with the photometric observation data from 2009 to 2012 obtained at xionglong station of naoc , we analyed the pulsations of ae uma and resolved up to 37 frequencies , 25 of which are newly detected . \n all these frequencies are shown to be harmonics or combinations of the two main frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath61 , corresponding to the fundamental and the first overtone modes . \n a new @xmath2 diagram was constructed with the 84 times of maximum light determined from our new observations and those listed in the literature , leading to the updated value of period @xmath62 . \n the new ephemeris with a quadratic solution suggests that the fundamental period change rate of ae uma @xmath3 and the first overtone period change with a rate of @xmath63 . \n the first value is different from the result obtained by @xcite , but the second is consistent with the value obtained by @xcite and @xcite . \n we calculated models of stars with masses between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . with the constraints of the values of @xmath51 , \n @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 , we concluded that ae uma locate near the second turn -

{"ContextTokens": 1915, "GeneratedTokens": 277, "SynthesizedBody": "present work is the follow - up on part i of this paper @xcite , discussing a relatively simple model capable of describing the behavior of a massive structure until the point of  localized failure . \n the model contains all the ingredients for taking into account both the  diffuse damage mechanism , which leads to the appearance of microcracks , as well as  the  failure process characterized by the propagation of macrocracks . \n perhaps the most important advantage of the proposed model is the fact that all its parameters have a clear physical interpretation and can be straightforwardly visualized in terms of the shape of a stress - strain diagram . \n in addition , influence of each parameter is dominant only for a specific , easily recognizable , stages of material behavior . \n this kind of a priori knowledge has a potential to greatly simplify the model calibration and will be systematically used throughout the  paper . \n in part ii of this paper , we discuss the identification of the model parameters from experimental measurements made on a structural level . generally speaking , the complexity of the identification procedure is determined by the choice of experimental setup . solely from the identification point of view , the simplest experiment to execute is the uniaxial tensile test . in this case \n , the strain field stays mostly homogeneous during the whole procedure and the global response represented by the load - displacement diagram is very similar to the stress - strain curve for one material point ; see section [ tensile ] for more details . \n the  model parameters can be then directly determined from the shape of the load - displacement curve . \n such a uniform loading is , however , very difficult if not impossible to impose in a laboratory test , especially for quasi - brittle materials . \n therefore , other tests are often used in  experimental practice .    the three - point bending test , in particular , \n is considered to be much simpler to perform and its results are well - reproducible . \n therefore , we focus on the identification procedure for the proposed model parameters directly from results of three - point bending test . \n main difficulty is in this case imposed by heterogeneity of the stress and the strain fields , which is present since the very start of the experiment . \n the macro - scale measurements provide the load - deflection curve that integrates data from different parts of the specimen experiencing different regimes of ( in)elastic behavior . \n for that reason , the possibility of a simple determination of model parameters from load - deflection curve is lost and an advanced calibration procedure needs to be applied .    to take advantage of the model specific structure , \n already mentioned above , the identification procedure should be divided into three sequential stages discussed in detail in  section  [ tpb ] . from the algorithmic point of view \n , the material calibration can then be understood as  a  sequential optimization problem . \n such approach has two main advantages : first , solving three simpler identification steps in a batch form is typically much more efficient then the full - scale problem ; second , it allows to use only a subset of simulations for initial stages of identification process . \n a variety of techniques is available to identify material parameters via optimization methods , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? \n * and reference therein ) . \n the gradient - based methods are usually considered to be the most computationally efficient optimization algorithms available and  as  such have been successfully used in a variety of identification problems , e.g. @xcite . for the  current model , however , analytic determination of sensitivities is fairly difficult , mainly due the history dependency of the model as well as complex interaction of individual parameters . \n the accuracy of numerical approximation to the exact sensitivities , on  the  other hand , is driven by the choice of pseudo - time step used in numerical simulations . \n clearly , to reduce the computational time , the pseudo - time step should be used as large as possible . \n therefore , the response - based objective function will not be smooth and gradient - based methods are unlikely to be very successful . \n as an alternative , techniques of soft - computing can be employed for optimization of complex objective functions . \n for example , stochastic evolutionary algorithms have been successfully used for solution of identification problems on a level of material point @xcite or  on  a  level of simple structures @xcite . for the current case , \n however , complexity of  the  optimization can be attributed rather to its non - smooth character than to the appearance of multiple optima ; the family of problems where evolutionary algorithms are the most successful methods . \n this opens the way to more specialized tools , which deliver higher efficiency when compared to usually time - consuming evolutionary algorithms . \n the approach adopted in the present work is based on an adaptive smoothing of the objective function by artificial neural networks  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for alternative ann - based solutions to identification problems ) . in particular , the approximated model is provided by the radial basis function network , described in section  [ rbfn ] , dynamically evolved by  minima located by a real - encoded genetic algorithm , briefly reviewed in section  [ grade ] . the proposed sequential numerical strategy is systematically verified in section  [ results ] with  attention paid to a detailed assessment of the proposed stochastic algorithm reliability . \n final remarks and conclusions can be found in section [ conclu ] . \n in the present section , we give a brief description of  the model on which the identification procedure is based . \n for the readers interested in more details , the complete description of  the  model is given in part i of this paper . \n as already mentioned , the proposed model is capable of taking into account two different types of dissipation ( e.g. see @xcite ) :    * a bulk dissipation induced by the appearance of uniformly distributed microcracks . \n this bulk dissipation is taken into account by the use of a classical continuum damage model ; * a surface dissipation induced by the development of macrocracks responsible for  the  collapse of the structure . as presented in part \n i of this paper , this phase is taken into account by the use of a strong discontinuity model . \n the surface dissipation is taken into account by the introduction of a traction / displacement jump relation . \n therefore , two different models are involved in the constitutive description : the one associated with the bulk material and the one associated with the displacement discontinuity . \n both are built on the same scheme considering the thermodynamics of continuous media and interfaces . \n the key points of the construction of each of the two models are summarized in table [ tab : tab_continuum ] and table [ tab : tab_discrete ] . \n .main ingredients of the continuum damage model [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n we have proposed a sound identification procedure for material parameters of the constitutive model for representing the localized failure of massive structures . \n the most pertinent conclusions can be stated as follows :    \\i ) the sequential identification approach employed for the uniaxial tensile test can be extended to the three - point bending test . \n the resulting algorithm is very straightforward and has a clear link with the structure of the constitutive model . \n moreover , each of three stages uses only a part of the test simulation , which leads to substantial computational time savings . \n \\ii ) due to the physical insight into the model , it was possible to construct simple objective functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with a high sensitivity to the relevant parameters \n . this led to  non - smooth and non - convex objective functions , which were optimized by robust soft - computing methods . \n \\iii ) the proposed identification procedure was verified on @xmath6 independent optimization processes executed for each objective function . in the worst case , the reliability of  the  algorithm is @xmath7 due to very small number of objective functions calls set in the termination condition . from our experience with evolutionary algorithms @xcite , such a result is rather satisfactory . \n \\iv ) as the result of a sequential character of the identification procedure , the errors in  identified parameters accumulate . therefore , the values need to be determined with higher accuracy then usually required in applications ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and achievable by neural network - based inverse analysis @xcite . \n \\v ) the major difficulty of the proposed methods is to properly identify the three stages of structural behavior . from the point of view of method verification , where the reference load - deflection diagram is not noisy , \n the problem was successfully resolved . to fully accept the procedure \n , however , the experimental validation of the method appears to be necessary . \n the financial supports for this work by the czech ministry of education ( research project msm  6840770003 ) and the french ministry of research are gratefully acknowledged . \n jz acknowledges the support of the ens - cachan invited professor funding program . \n d.  brancherie and a.  ibrahimbegovic . \n novel anisotropic continuum - discrete damage model capable of representing localized failure . \n part i : theoretic formulation and numerical implementation . , accepted for  publication ( 2008 ) . \n a.  kuerov and m. lep and j.  zeman . \n back analysis of microplane model parameters using soft computing methods . \n , * 14*(2):219 - 242 , 2007 ( special issue of the international symposium on neural networks and  soft computing ( nnsc-2005 ) )", "StartTimeOffset": 2359360494846, "RequestID": "9711b278e5ae99bb6cae018ea09ecb700183581b", "TotalTokens": 2192}

section of a white cauliflower . \n then , the fractal dimension of the bulk cauliflower is introduced . \n next , we create a mathematical model for the cauliflower , and compare it with our experimental measurement . \n the condition of creating the fractal in our mathematical model is discussed , too . \n there are many definitions of fractal dimensions , and the basic concept in our model has almost the property as follows : let us introduce that @xmath1 is a measurement scale , and that the measurement is @xmath2 , then the fractal dimension @xmath3 of a set @xmath4 is determined by the power law @xmath5 if @xmath3 is a constant as @xmath6 , @xmath4 has a dimension of @xmath3 .    the term \n capacity dimension \" or  box - counting dimension \" is most widely used , because it can be easily applied to fractal objects . \n it is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the smallest number of sets of diameter at most @xmath1 which can cover @xmath4@xcite . \n fractal objects embedded in one- or two - dimension are easy to measure relatively compared to other higher dimensions , but most of fractals in nature that are embedded in three dimensions is difficult to measure even in the capacity dimension . however , the dimensions of a cross - section is generally known to be related with that of the bulk . \n let us think of a bulk of three dimensions , and assume the dimension of its cross - section is two , that is , it is 2/3 of the bulk . \n we can propose an _ \n ansaz _ from the above property : let @xmath9 be a fractal dimension of a cross - section embedded in two dimensions . \n then , the fractal dimension of the bulk imbedded in three dimensions can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents every possible cross - section . as the fractal dimension of the cross - section is independent of directions , eq . \n ( [ 30 ] ) is simply written as @xmath12 . \n we prepared several white cauliflowers of about @xmath13 in mass and @xmath14 in diameter . \n we cut half of them in horizontal ( h ) direction , and the other half in vertical ( v ) direction . \n then , we scanned the cross - section by a scanner and read the image into black and white in fig . 1 . here , the two figures by the two perpendicular directions look totally different . \n next , we read the image into matrix of numbers . \n the numbers of the matrix are the reflectivity of each pixels . \n the black backgrounds produces 0 s , and the white images produce large numbers . \n let us call the non - zero number 1 for convenience . \n the size of the matrix is about @xmath15 . \n note that the size of a pixel is an order of 100@xmath16 .    in order to measure the fractal dimension of the cross - sections in eq . \n ( [ 20 ] ) , we count the non - zero numbers by the box - counting method . \n it becomes the smallest number of sets to cover the white images by @xmath17 . in a half reduction procedure of the matrix , \n a @xmath18 component becomes 1 if it contains any non - zero number , otherwise it becomes 0 . \n then , the number of 1 s becomes the smallest number of sets to cover the white images by @xmath19 . and so on . \n in the reducing steps in half , that is @xmath20 , the conversion from the reduced matrices to images is plotted in fig . 2 for the first four steps . \n we see that the basic structure of the cross - sections remains unchanged . \n 3(a ) is the log - log plot for the h - direction , and fig . \n 3(b ) is for the v - direction . \n we plotted it for a couple of different cauliflower samples . \n the slopes are the capacity dimensions of the cross - sections . \n surprisingly , we found the two slopes for different directions are very similar . \n it is @xmath21 . repeating the procedure for different white cauliflowers , we observed similar values of @xmath22 as @xmath23 for the two different directions \n therefore , from eq . \n ( [ 30 ] ) we predict that the capacity dimension of the white cauliflower is about 2.8 . \n converting a fractal found in nature into a corresponding mathematical model is a hope of a theorist , but most of the work is far away from the real world or extremely complicated in analysis . \n the modeling of nature should be as simple as it can , and at the same time , it should contain the basic structure of nature . \n furthermore , if some physical quantities of the model can match the real systems , it will guarantee more credits to the mathematical model . \n we modeled the cross - section of a cauliflower in v - direction as a rectangular tree that has three equilateral sides in fig . \n this is the simplest model of a self - similar set that has a single scale factor @xmath24 . \n note that the cross - section of a broccoli in v - direction has modeled into a self - similar set of triangular tree or pythagoras tree @xcite . \n the the scale factor @xmath24 of the rectangular tree in fig . \n 4 have the following relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle of the rectangular tree . \n downsizing the tree by a ratio @xmath24 , it creates three branches . \n therefore , the fractal dimension of fig . \n 4 is @xmath27    the areas of the rectangular tree have the following series @xmath28 where @xmath29 . because the fractal is the limit of the series \n , it should converge as @xmath30 increases . \n the condition of convergence of the series is @xmath31 , or @xmath32 . \n it is clear from @xmath33 . \n this condition corresponds to @xmath34 by eq . \n ( [ 40 ] ) . \n since the @xmath9 in the cauliflower is 1.88 , the scale factor @xmath24 and the angle @xmath26 in the model is obtained as 0.56 and @xmath35 from eqs . \n ( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) . \n we recognize that the cross - section in v - direction of the cauliflower is pretty close to two dimensions . \n as the @xmath26 approaches @xmath36 , the dimension of the tree goes to two because the limit bents to cover the two dimensional surface . on the other hand , \n as the @xmath26 approaches @xmath37 , the dimension of the tree goes to one because the limit goes to a long rod . \n the head of the real cauliflower is rounded not like the model in fig . \n 4 . it gives a possibility that the real cauliflower is not a self - similar set of single scale factor , but a set of multi - scale factors . \n we measured the fractal dimension of the cross - section of a white cauliflower by the direct scanning method . \n it was @xmath0 , and almost independent of the directions of the cross - sections . from these results \n , we predict that the fractal dimensions of the bulk cauliflower is about 2.8 . \n we created a mathematical model for the v - direction of a cauliflower with only one scale factor . \n it is a rectangular tree of three equilateral sides . \n we suggested the condition of creating fractals in our model , and we showed that the angle of the model is 67 degrees and the scale factor is 0.56 comparing with experiment . \n this method of a scanning cross -

{"ContextTokens": 3464, "GeneratedTokens": 62, "SynthesizedBody": "the main obstacle to identifying the progenitor of a core - collapse ( @xmath010 @xmath1 ) supernova ( sn ) is that the sn leaves few traces of the star that exploded . before now , \n only five out of ( at the time of this writing ) nearly 3000 historical extragalactic sne have had their progenitors directly identified . \n these include sn 1961v in ngc 1058 ( zwicky 1964 , 1965 ) , sn 1978k in ngc 1313 ( ryder et al . \n 1993 ) , sn 1987a in the lmc ( e.g. , gilmozzi et al .  1987 ; sonneborn , altner , & kirshner 1987 ) , sn 1993j in m81 ( aldering , humphreys , & richmond 1994 ; cohen , darling , & porter 1995 ) , and sn 1997bs in m66 ( van dyk et al . \n it should be noted that these five sne were all at least somewhat unusual , and both sne 1961v ( van dyk , filippenko , & li 2002 ) and 1997bs ( van dyk et al . \n 2000 ) may not have been actual sne . \n clearly , direct identification of the progenitors of additional core - collapse sne is essential . \n ideally , one pinpoints the exact sn location by comparing a late - time sn image with a pre - sn image . \n we got the ball rolling for this whole game by exploiting the superior spatial resolution afforded by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and identifying the sn 1997bs progenitor , by comparing archival wfpc2 images used to measure the cepheid distance to the host galaxy , in which the sn was clearly detected at late times , with an archival pre - sn f606w wfpc2 image ( van dyk et al . \n 1999 ) . \n we undertook a more extensive search to isolate the progenitors of 6 sne ii and 10 sne ib / c in wfpc2 images in van dyk , li , & filippenko ( 2003a ) . in that paper \n we recovered sne 1999dn , 2000c , and 2000ew at late times , but , unfortunately , their pre - sn images did not show a progenitor candidate at the sn position . for \n the other 13 sne the trick was determining the sn location on one of the four wfpc2 chips . to achieve the highest astrometric accuracy possible for all image data we had to measure the sn position on a kait image \n ( see the contribution by filippenko for more on kait ) and then locate the sn site by applying an _ independent _ astrometric grid to the pre - sn image . \n we adopted 2mass ( with positional uncertainty @xmath2 ) as the basis for the grid for both the ground - based and _ hst _ images . \n once the sn site was located , photometry of the appropriate wfpc2 chip was performed using the routine hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , b ) with a 3@xmath3 detection threshold . \n we had possibly identified the progenitors of the sne ii 1999br , 1999ev , and 2001du as supergiant stars with @xmath4 mag , and the progenitors of the sne ib 2001b and 2001is as very luminous supergiants with @xmath5 to @xmath6 mag , as well as the progenitor of the sn ic 1999bu as a supergiant with @xmath7 mag . for all other sne in our sample \n we could only place limits on the progenitor absolute magnitude and color . \n six of the sne ( 1999an , 1999br , 1999ev , 2000ds , 2000ew , 2001b ) had been imaged in multiple bands with acs at late times by smartt and collaborators . \n these data became available in the _ hst _ archive . \n we had already recovered sn 2000ew , and , along with sne 1999an and 2000ds , we did not detect a sn progenitor in each pre - sn image . \n we also found we had not correctly identified the progenitor for sn 2001b ( the progenitor , in fact , is not detected in the pre - sn image ) . in figures 1 and 2 \n we show that the limits which we are able to place on the progenitors of the sn ic 2000ew and the sn ib 2001b are not very restrictive . \n possibly the sn ib / c progenitors instead are massive interacting he star binaries ( e.g. , avila - reese 1993 ) , and the theoretical single - star evolutionary tracks shown are not relevant . \n for sn 2001du we isolated three possible candidate progenitor stars within the uncertainty of the measured sn position : one reddish star with a detection in both the f555w and f814w bands , and two stars with only f555w detections , implying bluer colors for these latter two stars ( van dyk et al . \n late - time multi - band wfpc2 sn images were obtained by smartt and collaborators . \n we had assumed that , since sn 2001du is of type ii - p , the most plausible candidate is the redder star . \n we used the late - time sn images , specifically the @xmath8 image , and found the sn position on the pre - sn images to be 0.70@xmath90.15 wf pixel ( @xmath10 ) northeast of one of the _ blue _ stars ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003b ) . \n thus , we concluded that the progenitor is not detected in the pre - sn images . \n we used the f555w and f814w pre - sn image detection limits to constrain the nature of the progenitor : adopting @xmath11 mag and distance modulus @xmath12 mag for sn 2001du , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mag for the progenitor star . \n these limits were converted to the likely supergiant progenitor luminosity , assuming the full range of possible stellar surface temperatures ( drilling & landolt 2000 ) . \n stars with luminosities brighter than these limits should have been detected in the pre - sn images . \n we compared the limits to model stellar evolutionary tracks for a metallicity appropriate for the sn environment and for a range of masses , and estimated that the sn progenitor mass is @xmath15 , which is consistent with the mass limits on other previous sne ii - p . \n see smartt et al . \n ( 2003 ) for a similar result for sn 2001du . also see the estimate for the sn 2004dj progenitor by maiz - apellaniz et al . \n using a precise sn position from ground - based images , we isolated the sn position on pre - sn archival wfpc2 images to @xmath16 ( @xmath96 wf pixels ) . \n two stars , a and b , were detected near or within the error circle . \n color information for both progenitor candidates were obtained from a high - quality , ground - based @xmath17-band image , on which two faint objects are seen near the positions of both a and b. both stars are red supergiants , and from model evolutionary tracks for above - solar metallicity , assuming @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 mag for sn 2003gd , star b had initial mass @xmath20 ( formally below the theoretical lower limit for core - collapse sne ) , and star a had @xmath219 @xmath1 . \n although star a is farther from the sn position we measured than is star b , and just outside the edge of the error circle , star a was considered the most plausible progenitor candidate , based on its initial mass and the fact that it was the brightest @xmath17-band object within the sn s larger , @xmath221 radius , environment ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003c ) . \n this identification was confirmed via late - time _ hst _ imaging of the sn by smartt et al . \n ( 2004 ) , who arrive at the same conclusion for the progenitor s initial mass . \n ( see the contributions by hendry and maund to these proceedings . ) \n nomoto et al .  ( 2004 ) argued that the faint sne ii - p 1997d and 1999br ( e.g. , zampieri et al . \n 2003 ) are highly massive ( @xmath2330 @xmath1 ) , `` failed '' sne ( presumably a massive envelope smothers the core - collapse energy release ) . to the contrary , \n when the luminosity of the possible progenitor of sn 1999br progenitor seen in _ \n hst _ images ( van dyk et al . \n 2003a ) is placed in context with stellar evolution models ( figure 3 ) , and the progenitor is assumed to be a red supergiant , the upper mass limit is @xmath241215 @xmath1 . \n ( a similar result is found even if the candidate star we identified was _ not _ the progenitor , and we can only place an upper limit on the progenitor luminosity . ) \n as mentioned above , a growing number of sne have been shown to likely not be sne at all , but are more likely analogs of @xmath25 car . \n these so - called `` sn impostors '' include sne 1961v and 1997bs , but also sn 2002 kg , among others . \n we ( van dyk et al .  1999 ;

see figure 4 . \n the minimum mass allowed by the luminosity , for @xmath28 k , is @xmath29 . \n if the precursor was a blue supergiant , however , the mass can range up to 120 @xmath30 or more . \n the precursor of sn 2002 kg has been identified in high quality , multi - band ground - based , pre - outburst images of the host galaxy . \n the star had been previously identified by tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) as the `` irregular blue variable '' v37 , which had an erratic @xmath31 light curve over several decades . \n the star had @xmath32 mag and unreddened colors consistent with a very luminous ob supergiant ( the spectra at outburst resemble those of known b - type lbvs ) . placing the star on a h - r diagram \n we conclude that @xmath33 for the star ( unfortunately , the photometric uncertainties do not allow this mass to be more tightly constrained ) . \n this is the first time that an @xmath25 car analog has had its initial mass accurately estimated . \n we are continuing our search for core - collapse sn progenitors in high - quality ( mainly , _ hst _ ) images . the possible detections and constraints on the sn ii progenitors are broadly consistent with red supergiants as progenitor stars , with their colors implying spectral types typically m or somewhat earlier . \n in fact , sne ii - p progenitors appear to have @xmath34 . \n the sn ii - p 2003gd progenitor is only the sixth ever directly identified , with @xmath35@xmath36 . \n the data so far for the progenitors of sne ib / c are inadequate ; we are unable to place rigorous constraints on either the wolf - rayet star or massive interacting binary models for the progenitors of these sne ib / c , the most extreme examples of which have been associated with some grbs ( see matheson , these proceedings ) \n . direct identification of the progenitors of sne ib / c is of the utmost importance , given this connection . \n the sne iin are a very heterogeneous group , a topic that deserves considerably more discussion elsewhere . \n some sne iin are `` sn impostors , '' which are more likely superoutbursts of very massive evolved stars , similar to @xmath25 car . \n this is borne out by the identification of the sn 2002 kg progenitor , or precursor , with @xmath33 . \n if sn 2002 kg is instead a real sn ( which we doubt ) , then its progenitor is only the seventh , out of 1000 s , to be directly identified . \n aldering , g. , humphreys , r. m. , & richmond , m. w. 1994 , , 107 , 662 avila - reese , v. 1993 , rmxaa , 26 , 99 cohen , j. g. , darling , j. , & porter , a. 1995 , , 110 , 308 dolphin , a. e. 2000a , , 112 , 1383 dolphin , a. e. 2000b , , 112 , 1397 drilling , j.s . , & landolt , a.u . \n 2000 , in allen s astrophysical quantities , 4th ed . , ed . \n cox ( new york : aip ) , 381 gilmozzi , r. , et al . \n 1987 , nature , 328 , 318 lejeune , t. , & schaerer , d. 2001 , , 366 , 538 maiz - apellaniz , j. , et al . \n 2004 , , 615 , l113 nomoto , k. , et al . \n 2004 , in stellar - mass , intermediate - mass , and supermassive black holes , eds . \n k.  makashima & s.  mineshige , in press . \n ryder , s. , et al . \n 1993 , , 416 , 167 smartt , s. j. , et al . \n 2003 , , 343 , 735 smartt , s. j. , et al . \n 2004 , , 303 , 499 sonneborn , g. , altner , b. , & kirshner , r. p. 1987 \n , , 323 , l35 tammann , g.a . , & sandage a. 1968 , , 151 , 825 van dyk , s.d . , et al .  1999 , , 118 \n , 2331 van dyk , s.d . , et al . \n 2000 , , 112 , 1532 van dyk , s.d . , \n filippenko , a.v . \n , & li , w.  2002 , , 114 , 700 van dyk , s. d. , li , w. , & filippenko , a. v. 2003a , , 115 , 1 van dyk , s. d. , li , w. , & filippenko , a. v. 2003b , , 115 , 448 van dyk , s. d. , li , w. , & filippenko , a. v. 2003c , , 115 , 1289 zampieri , l. , et al .  2003 , , 338 , 711 zwicky , f. 1964 , , 139 , 514 zwicky , f. 1965 , in stars and stellar systems , vol . 8 , stellar structure , ed . l.h . \n aller & d.b . \n mclaughlin ( chicago : university of chicago press ) , 367", "StartTimeOffset": 2375743081380, "RequestID": "1cf161c41e0eea0e455ca059e6fd48fa01baf972", "TotalTokens": 3526}

e.g. rocha - pinto et al . \n the mean amrs estimated for our glos show the expected trend with high metallicity stars forming at more recent times in agreement with observations . \n the dispersion found in the simulations indicates the existence of coeval sf sites of different metallicities at a given time . \n the values and trend of these relations depend on the particular evolutionary history of each glo , and the sf and sn model parameters ( see tissera et al \n . 2000 for details ) . \n the chemical abundances in the ism in gas - rich galaxies allows to trace the evolution of individual galaxies , being hii regions and early b - type main sequence objects the most accesible probes of interstellar abundances . \n fairly steep negative gradients are found : @xmath25 dex kpc@xmath26 within @xmath27 kpc for oxygen ( smartt & rolleston 1997 ) . \n figure 2 shows abundance gradients of the oxygen for glos 596 and 325 as examples . \n the curves represent the mass - weighted averages of the metal abundances at each particle position : they clearly show negative abundance gradients . \n the slopes of the calculated gradients range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 dex kpc@xmath26 , in agreement with observations . \n the differences in the abundance gradient slopes for a given glo are due to the sf mechanism and sn parameters , and the fact that we are only including gas in hybrid particles . \n the slopes of glo 325 are less pronounced than those of glo 596 . \n the different behaviour may be due to the fact that the gas in glo 596 forms a well - defined disk , while glo 325 is a clear spheroid , indicating that their histories of formation and evolution have been very different .    to sum up , in our simulations \n , glos have different evolutionary history in consistency with a hierarchical clustering scenario that affect their sf rates and chemical evolution . \n this chemical model can take all these physical processes into account , resulting in a powerful tool to study galaxy formation . \n barton , e. j. , geller , m. j. , & kenyon , s. j. 1999 , , 195 , 2104 chiappini , c. , matteucci f. , & gratton , r. 1997 , , 477 , 765 gratton , r. , cannetta , e. , matteucci , f. , & sneden , c. 1996 , in formation of the galactic halo , inside out , ed . \n h. morrison & a. sanajedini , 92 , 307 mosconi , m. b. , tissera , p. b. , lambas , d. g. , & cora , s. a. 2000 , , submitted raiteri , c. m. , villata , m. , & navarro , j. f. 1996 , , 315 , 105 rocha - pinto , h. j. , maciel , w. j. , & flynn , c. 2000 , , submitted ( astro - ph/0001383 ) smartt , s. j. , & rolleston , w. r. 1997 , , 481 , l47 steinmetz , m. , & mller , e. 1994 , , 281 , l97 thielemann , f. k. , nomoto , k. , & hashimoto , m. 1993 , in origin and evolution of the elements , ed . \n n. prantzos , e. vangoni - flam , & m. cass ( cambridge university press ) , 299 tissera , p. b. , lambas , d. g. , & abadi , m. g. 1997 , , 286 , 384 tissera , p. b. 2000 , , 534 , 636 tissera , p. b. , mosconi , m. b. , cora , s. a. , & lambas , d. g. 2000 , in preparation woosley , s. e. , & weaver , t. a. , 1995 , , 101 , 181", "StartTimeOffset": 2377869081318, "RequestID": "f46f20cdacf1a6ce07ac4711ee91fb7b5eabaa8e", "TotalTokens": 2065}

[ \n fig : eandpiraa ] ) . these data \n falsify the assumption that heavy quark quenching is dominated by radiative energy loss when the bulk qcd matter parton density is constrained by the observed @xmath4 of produced hadrons . \n this discrepancy between radiative energy loss predictions and current data and recent papers motivated us to revisit the assumption that pqcd elastic energy loss is negligible compared to radiative energy loss . in some earlier studies , \n the elastic energy loss was found to be @xmath5 gev / fm , which was erroneously considered to be small compared to the several gev / fm expected from radiative energy loss . in fig . \n [ fig : deltae ] we see that above @xmath6 gev the light and charm quarks have elastic energy losses smaller but of the same order of magnitude as the inelastic losses . due to the large mass effect , \n both radiative and elastic energy losses remain significantly smaller for bottom quarks than for light quark and charm jets , but the elastic loss can now be greater than inelastic up to @xmath7gev . the uncertainties from the coulomb log , as illustrated by the difference between the tg and bt lines  @xcite , are largest for the heaviest b quark : as they are not ultrarelativistic , the leading log approximation breaks down in the jet energy range accessible at rhic . \n we present a calculation of jet suppression using the model explained in @xcite . \n we assume initial @xmath8 and a fixed coupling , @xmath9 . \n the main difference from the previous calculation  @xcite is the inclusion of two new physics components in the energy loss probability @xmath10 . \n first , @xmath11 is generalized to include both elastic and inelastic energy loss and their fluctuations . \n the second major change is that we now take into account geometric path length fluctuations . \n the geometric path averaging used here is similar to that used elsewhere , but the inclusion of elastic energy loss together with path fluctuations in more realistic geometries was not considered .    the results for the suppression of non - photonic single electrons are shown in the upper plot in fig . \n [ fig : eandpiraa ] . as emphasized in  @xcite , any proposed energy loss mechanisms \n must also be checked for consistency with the extensive pion quenching data  @xcite , for which preliminary data now extend out to @xmath12 gev . \n this is also shown in fig . \n [ fig : eandpiraa ] . \n @xmath13    it is important to examine the theoretical uncertainties involved in these predictions . \n uncertainty in the leading log approximation has already been shown and two other sources are illustrated in fig .

{"ContextTokens": 3846, "GeneratedTokens": 113, "SynthesizedBody": "the strategy to address the reconstruction of boosted top quarks can be subdivided in two different categories depending on the decay of the top quark . for high-@xmath0 top quarks decaying leptonically , the main issue is the small angular separation between the the lepton and the @xmath1-jet . \n classic lepton isolation algorithm might then reject boosted leptonic top quarks . a solution to this problem \n consists in shrinking the isolation cone around the lepton in function of its @xmath0 @xcite . for boosted hadronic top \n quark decays , the main topic of this document , the hadronic decay products might be too close together for standard jet algorithms and sizes to be reconstructed separately . the strategy for the reconstruction of boosted hadronic top quarks \n can then be outlined as :    1 . \n use a large - cone jet ( @xmath2 ) to cluster the whole top quark decay ; 2 .   apply an algorithm that looks inside the large - cone jet to try and recover the decay products of the top quark ( top tagger ) ; 3 . \n use jet substructure variables to discriminate between real top decays and other processes .      the starting point of top quark taggers is the clustering of jets with a large radius ( @xmath3 ) , however these jets tend to collect a lot of soft qcd radiation . \n dedicated algorithms , called `` jet groomers '' are needed to resolve the hard decay products removing soft and wide angle radiation . \n one of these algorithms is called `` jet trimming '' @xcite , and consist in the following steps :    1 .   inside the large - cone jet , cluster subjets of radius @xmath4 using the @xmath5 algorithm 2 . \n reject the soft subjets that do not satisfy the condition @xmath0(subjet)@xmath6(jet)@xmath7 . \n the optimal values of the parameters of the algorithm ( @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) are determined through monte carlo simulations . \n dedicated studies using full - detector simulation @xcite show an improvement in performance of the reconstructed jet mass variable . \n this section contains a summary description of the most widely used algorithms by the cms @xcite and atlas @xcite experiments at the lhc . \n the cmstoptagger algorithm uses a cambridge - aachen jet with a radius of 0.8 as a starting point . \n a detailed description of the algorithm can be found in ref . \n the cmstoptagger has been commissioned by the cms collaboration @xcite . \n the heptoptagger algorithm uses a cambridge - aachen jet with a radius of 1.5 as a starting point . \n given the larger radius of the starting jet , this algorithm is able to cluster top decays with a smaller boost with respect to the other algorithms . \n a detailed description of the algorithm can be found in ref . \n the heptoptagger has been commissioned by both the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite , @xcite \n .    the tagger s efficiency drops at very high @xmath0 because the initial clustering radius is too large and collects too many particles from the underlying event or pileup . \n thus a series of improvements have been developed leading to the multi - r heptoptagger . \n namely , the algorithm now tests different initial clustering radii and finds the optimal one . \n the optimal radius in function of jet @xmath0 can be used as a tagging variable . \n the usage of top tagging algorithms from large - cone jets poses a problem in the calibration of such tools for usage in real data . \n the strategy adopted by the cms collaboration consists in deriving data  simulation correction factors computed using a `` tag and probe '' method in a semileptonic @xmath9 enriched selection . \n the idea is to `` tag '' an event by identifying a leptonic top , then probe for the tagger s efficiency on the hadronic side of the @xmath10 event . \n the comparison of efficiencies derived in data and simulation gives the correction factors , measured in function of @xmath11 , @xmath0 , and monte carlo generators @xcite . \n the atlas collaboration uses a different approach : for subjets of the heptoptagger a dedicated calibration is performed for different r subjets . for large - cone jets , \n the mass scale is validated by comparing the ratio of calo - jet mass divided by its correspondent track - jet mass in data and simulation @xcite . \n the starting point of the shower deconstruction tagger is the decomposition of the large - cone jet in small jets with radii between 0.1 and 0.3 ( microjets ) . \n a detailed description of the algorithm can be found in ref . \n comparison of data with monte carlo simulations shows a reliable behavior of the discriminant and the kinematic variables related to the microjets @xcite . \n @xmath12-jet tagging is an essential tool in many physics analyses to distinguish the interesting signal containing top quarks from the multijet background .    @xmath12-tagging algorithms use information from jet tracks ( especially the impact parameter of the track ) , and secondary vertices . \n the variables are then combined in a discriminator obtained from a neural network ( mv1 tagger used by the atlas collaboration ) or a likelihood function ( combined secondary vertex , csv used by the cms collaboration ) .    in the boosted regime , \n the decay products of the hard scatter process have a small angular separation , in addition to this there is a higher probability of contamination with tracks from light flavor jets . \n these factors lead to a degraded performance of @xmath1-tagging algorithms . \n the atlas collaboration developed a series of improvement to the current @xmath1-tagging algorithm @xcite , @xcite . \n the first of these improvements regards the addition of new variables with more discrimination power between real @xmath1-jets and misidentified @xmath1-jets . \n the neural network used to derive the final discriminator variable is then retrained using samples enriched in high-@xmath0 @xmath1-jets . considering a boosted topology , for a given @xmath1-tagging efficiency , \n the new algorithm yields a light flavor rejection rate that is , on average , twice that of the old algorithm . \n the second point of improvement in the atlas @xmath1-tagging framework , is the usage of different input jets collections to the algorithm . \n jets with a smaller cone are able to resolve better the boosted decay products , in addition to this , track jets provide a better jet direction resolution . \n the cms collaboration uses two different approaches for @xmath1-tagging in boosted topologies @xcite . \n the first approach consist in running the csv algorithm on the large - cone jets used to cluster the decay product of the hadronic top quark . \n the second approach consist in running the csv algorithm directly on the subjets found by a top quark tagging algorithm . \n the second approach represent a more natural way to address the issue of @xmath1-tagging in top jets , as only one of the subjets is expected to come from the decay of a b quark . \n a performance assessment of the two approaches confirms that , for top jet identification , the subjet @xmath1-tagging approach is the most performing both in medium and very high boost scenarios . \n other improvements to the csv algorithm have been implemented in the @xmath1-tagging framework @xcite : among them there is the usage of the inclusive vertex finder ( ivf ) to search for secondary vertices . \n a number of other jet substructure variables provide discrimination power between jets coming from high-@xmath13 top quark decays and other processes . \n the n - subjettiness ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , used by the cms and atlas collaborations , aims at describing how well a jet of radius @xmath15 can be described as containing n or fewer @xmath5 subjets . \n the variable is defined as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 runs over all the jet constituents and @xmath18 . \n the algorithm computes the @xmath0 weighted average of minimum @xmath19(jet constituent , subjet axis)@xmath20 . for boosted hadronic top quarks the variable ratios @xmath21 and @xmath22 are relevant . \n the @xmath5 splitting scale variable ( @xmath23 ) , used by the atlas collaboration , describes how likely it is for a jet to be composed by a two or three prongs decay . \n the algorithm is describe in ref . \n both of these algorithms have been commissioned on data collected by the lhc at a center of mass energy of 8 tev @xcite , @xcite . \n the variables have been used in a number of physics analyses .      in medium boost regimes ( @xmath0(jet)@xmath24 ) \n angular separation between the decay products of a top quark might be big enough that a large - cone jet is not able to cluster the whole decay . in these cases it is possible to cluster the @xmath1-jet and the hadronic decay products of the w boson in two separate jets . for the @xmath1-jet reconstruction , \n standard size jets ( @xmath25 ) and standard @xmath1-tagging techniques can be used . \n the hadronic w boson decay can then be clustered separately in a large - cone jet ( w - jet ) .    to distinguish jets originated from boosted w boson decay from other \n processes a class of algorithms called w - taggers is used . \n w - jets are a benchmark topology for jet substructure studies , so a large amount of techniques were developed in the past few years @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n one of the most used techniques used to identify large cone jets coming from w bosons consists in the following steps :    1 . \n use a jet grooming algorithm ; 2 .   compute the jet mass from the groomed jet and apply a cut on the groomed jet mass ; 3 . \n eventually use a jet substructure variable to select two - prong decays ( e.g. n - subjettiness ) . \n pileup represents a major issue in the reconstruction and energy measurement of large - cone jets , commonly used for top quark tagging . \n jet substructure variables built starting from the jet components are also affected by the same problem . \n many standard techniques to treat pileup contamination exist already . \n however , dedicated techniques are being developed to address pileup in the forthcoming data taking period at the lhc . \n one of these techniques is pileup per particle identification ( puppi ) @xcite . \n this new approach consist in assigning a weight to each reconstructed object in the detector ( by scaling its momentum ) based on pileup event properties and tracking information . \n the novelty of the approach consist in acting directly on the input component of the jet clustering algorithm ; the immediate consequence of this fact is that all the jet substructure variables computed using the jet components as input are automatically corrected by the procedure @xcite . \n the various top tagging algorithms and jet substructure variables can be compared by computing performance curves ( also called roc curves sometimes ) , plotting the top misidentification probability in function of the tagger s efficiency . \n a continuous line can be obtained for each tagger by varying the parameters of the algorithm . \n different tagging algorithms and jet substructure variables can be combined together to obtain a better discrimination power . \n performance comparison is shown for atlas and cms in fig .

{"ContextTokens": 2404, "GeneratedTokens": 145, "SynthesizedBody": "there has been a significant sensitivity improvement of the gravitational wave detectors since the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite and virgo observatory  @xcite started their operation . in 2007 \n ligo and virgo completed the two year run at sensitivity that allows detection of a merger of two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) as far as @xmath0  mpc away  @xcite . in the most recent run ( may 2009 - october 2010 ) \n the binary neutron star horizon distance has been increased to @xmath1  mpc . however , even at this impressive sensitivity , the anticipated detection rate with the initial ligo and virgo detectors is quite low . \n a detection may be possible in the case of a rare astrophysical transient event such as a supernova explosion in our galaxy or a nearby merger of binary neutron stars . \n the signal is likely to be weak and it will be difficult to prove its astrophysical origin unless it is confirmed with a coincident observation of the electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart . \n for this reason the ligo and virgo collaborations are conducting a wide range of joint observations  @xcite with other astrophysical experiments including radio  @xcite , optical and x - ray telescopes  @xcite , and neutrino detectors  @xcite . \n a more robust detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources is anticipated in the next five years as advanced ligo and advanced virgo come online . \n numerous gw signals , expected to be observed by advanced detectors ( likely @xmath1 ns - ns events per year  @xcite ) , will begin our exploration of the gravitational - wave sky and start the era of the gravitational wave astronomy . \n along with the advanced gw detectors , a new generation of optical telescopes will come online  @xcite , which will enable a wide and deep survey of the electromagnetic sky . \n joint observations with the advanced gravitational wave detectors and electromagnetic instruments will not only increase the confidence of detection but also bring fundamentally new information about the gw sources . \n they will reveal the physics and dynamic of sources , provide the identification of host galaxies and the associated redshifts , and in some cases determine luminosity distance to the source . \n one of the major challenges for such joint observations is to establish unambiguous association between a gravitational wave signal and a possible electromagnetic counterpart . \n it greatly depends on the ability of the gw networks to reconstruct sky coordinates of a detected gw source . \n given an accurate sky location , a corresponding electromagnetic transient may be identified in a list of events obtained with the all - sky telescope surveys , or the em instruments can be guided to take images of a small area in the sky . in the second case , it is important that the sky localization is performed by gw detectors in real time with low latency . \n the efficiency of the gw - em association and the choice of a partner telescope is affected by the sky localization error which should be well within the instrument s field of view ( typically less than few square degrees ) . moreover , exploring smaller area in the sky will decrease the probability of the false association . \n the problem of the source localization with networks of gw detectors is in the focus of research in the gravitational wave data analysis . \n there are several analytical studies  @xcite of this problem considering geometrical reconstruction of source coordinates based on the triangulation , which requires a measurement of the arrival time of a gw signal at different detectors \n . however , the accurate timing of the gw signal is intimately related to the reconstruction of the signal waveforms . due to the different detector sensitivities to the gw polarizations , the waveforms recorded by individual detectors may be different and they may not have a common timing reference ( like a signal peak time ) for a direct measurement of the differences in the arrival time . \n therefore , the problem of the source localization is better addressed in the framework of the coherent network analysis  @xcite , which reconstructs the waveforms and the sky coordinates simultaneously . by using both these methods ( triangulation and coherent network analysis ) , several practical source localization algorithms  @xcite have been recently developed and used during the ligo and virgo data taking runs in 2009 - 2010 . \n there have been a number of studies addressing benefits of individual detectors  @xcite and various detector networks  @xcite . in this paper \n we present a simulation study of the source localization and the reconstruction of gw waveforms with the networks of advanced detectors . \n the study is performed with a coherent network method , called coherent waveburst  @xcite ( cwb ) , based on the likelihood analysis . in cwb the data from all detectors in the network \n is processed simultaneously in order to reconstruct a common gw signal which is consistent with the recorded detector responses . \n the consistency is measured by the likelihood ratio , which is a function of the source parameters ( waveforms and sky location ) . \n the most probable source parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood ratio over the signal waveforms and sky coordinates . \n the method performs reconstruction of unmodeled burst signals ( arbitrary waveforms ) and signals with a certain polarization state : elliptical , linear and circular . \n the paper is organized as follows . \n possible networks of advanced detectors and their fundamental properties are descussed in section  [ sec : networks ] . in sections  [ sec : \n algorithm ] we describe the reconstruction algorithm . the simulation framework for this study \n is presented in section  [ framework ] . \n the results are reported in section  [ results ] . in sections  [ limitation ] and  [ conclusions ] \n we describe main factors limiting the source reconstruction and discuss the results . \n [ network ]    in 2001 - 2010 the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) and the virgo collaboration operated a network of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors which are the most sensitive instruments from the first generation of the gw interferometers ( 1 g ) . \n they consist of power - recycled michelson interferometers with kilometer - scale fabry - perot arms designed to detect gravitational waves with frequencies between tens of hz and several khz . \n the two ligo observatories  @xcite are in hanford , washington ( 4  km and 2  km detectors ) and in livingston , louisiana ( 4  km detector ) , and the 3-km virgo detector  @xcite is located in cascina , italy . \n other gravitational waves interferometers are the 300 m detector tama  @xcite in mitaka , japan , and the 600 m detector geo600  @xcite in hannover , germany . currently all 1 g interferometers are decommissioned , except virgo and geo600 , which continue to take data . \n the second - generation gw detectors ( 2 g ) are currently under construction . \n they include the advanced ligo detectors  @xcite , and the advanced virgo detector ( v )  @xcite which will have by an order of magnitude better sensitivity than the 1 g detectors . \n all advanced ligo detectors have 4-km long arms , with one detector in livingston ( l ) and two identical co - aligned detectors in hanford ( h and h ) . also there are plans to build the large cryogenic gravitational telescope ( lcgt )  @xcite in japan ( the j detector ) and possibly move the ligo h detector to a site in australia  @xcite ( the a detector ) . figure  [ fig:2gsensitivities ] shows the design sensitivity for the listed 2 g detectors . \n these , hopefully all five interferometers , compose the most advanced gw detector network which will be in operation after 2015 . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      there are several factors limiting the accuracy of the coordinate and waveform reconstruction due to the cwb algorithm . for high snr events the coordinate resolution is limited by the cwb sky segmentation which is @xmath2 degrees . therefore the error angle can not be less than @xmath3 degrees . \n also for the high frequency events the coordinate resolution is limited by the discrete time delays @xmath4 ( see section  [ sec : algorithm ] ) with the step of 1/16384 seconds and by the accuracy of the time delay filter ( few percent ) used in the analysis . \n also in the analysis we did not use any unmodeled constraint specific for individual networks , which , in principle , may improve reconstruction . \n these limitations are not fundamental and the algorithm performance can be improved in the future . \n in the paper we present the results of the source localization and reconstruction of gw waveforms with the networks of gw interferometers . for a general characterization of the detector networks we introduce few fundamental network parameters , including the effective noise , and the network antenna and alignment factors . \n the effective power spectral density of the network noise determines the average network snr for a given population of gw signals . for each direction in the sky \n the network performance is characterized by its antenna and alignment factors . \n the antenna factor describes how uniform is the network response across the sky . \n the alignment factor , which strongly depends on the number of detectors and the orientation of their arms , determines the relative contribution of the two gw polarizations into the total network snr . \n it requires several non - aligned detectors ( preferably more than three ) for a robust detection and reconstruction of both gw components . \n the coordinate reconstruction strongly depends on the signal waveforms , network snr and the number of detector sites in the network . \n the reconstruction can be significantly improved when it is constrained by the signal model . \n although a crude coordinate reconstruction ( ring in the sky ) is possible with the networks of two spatially separated sites , at least three detector sites are required to perform the source localization . \n the accuracy of the localization dramatically increases for networks with more than three sites , particularly for the low snr events . \n for example , the lhhv and lhva networks are expected to have about the same detection rates , however , the 4-site lhva network would have much better performance for the accurate reconstruction of gw signals . \n the pointing resolution required for joint observations with the electromagnetic telescopes is achievable with the networks consisting of four sites . \n the lhvaj network demonstrates further improvements , both in the detection and reconstruction of gw signals , reaching a sub -

{"ContextTokens": 3193, "GeneratedTokens": 209, "SynthesizedBody": "despite their relative rarity , massive stars are dominantly dangerous for their environments . \n this is a result of their mass and energy input via stellar winds and subsequent core - collapse supernovae ( sn ) . a overarching parameter for the life expectancy of a massive star concerns its strong mass outflow which is driven by radiative forces on millions of ionic spectral line transitions , providing it with its name `` line - driven wind '' . \n on the one hand , mass loss is thought to be a key agent in revealing chemically processed material at the stellar surface , making it responsible for evolutionary scenarios such as the o @xmath0 luminous blue variable ( lbv ) @xmath0 wolf - rayet ( wr ) star @xmath0 sn sequence ( e.g. conti 1976 , chiosi & maeder 1986 , langer et al . \n furthermore , it determines the stellar mass before collapse and is thus relevant for the type of compact remnant that is left behind ( i.e. neutron star or black hole ) . on the other hand , \n the role of mass loss may be equally relevant for the loss of angular momentum ( e.g. meynet & maeder 2003 ) .    with respect to the latter , it has been suggested that low metallicity ( actually low `` iron '' contents ; vink & de koter 2005 ) leads to less mass and angular momentum loss in low metallicity environments , perhaps resulting in a preference of long gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) in the early universe , but however interesting the metallicity dependence and the long grb puzzle may be , the temperature dependence of stellar winds and its role in the angular momentum evolution of massive stars has been highlighted more recently with respect to the possibility of _ bi - stability braking _ ( vink et al . \n 2010 ) .    given the crucial role that mass loss plays for massive star evolution , we discuss the theory of massive star mass loss and its implications , with a focus on the metallicity ( @xmath1 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence . \n we will see that the _ iron line opacity _ plays a dominant role in both cases . \n the theory goes back to the early 1970s when lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) suggested that selective radiation pressure on spectral lines is capable of driving stellar winds from the surface of massive stars , proving an explanation for the p cygni profiles observed in the ultraviolet spectra of o - type stars in the late 1960s . for an extensive overview of both the theory and recent observational developments , such as wind clumping \n , we refer the reader to puls et al . \n the theoretical framework is based around the momentum equation :    @xmath3    where for simplicity the gas pressure has been ignored ( as the radiative pressure is the much more dominant factor in most parts of the stellar wind ) . \n an oft - cited paper concerns the study of castor et al . \n ( 1975 , hereafter cak ) who expressed the radiative line acceleration @xmath4 as a function of the sobolev velocity gradient ( @xmath5 ) , involving a 2-parameter force multiplier ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) parametrization . \n subsequent improvements such as the inclusion of improved line lists by the munich group led to a reasonably good agreement with observed values ( e.g. pauldrach et al . \n we note that the cak - type wind dynamics is based on the assumption that @xmath8 plays the same role as @xmath9 , such that the critical point of the wind is no longer the sonic point ( as in solar wind theory ) but further downstream . \n the validity of this approach has been questioned by lucy ( 2007 ) . \n furthermore , these works relied on the assumption that stellar photons could interact with the outflowing ions only once .    in order to account for multiple scatterings abbott & lucy ( 1985 ) developed a monte carlo methodology , which was updated and extended by vink et al . \n ( 2000 , 2001 ) . in these oft - used mass - loss prescription the velocity law \n was originally adopted ( based on a semi - empirical motivation ) , but this assumption has recently been alleviated by mller & vink ( 2008 ) who express the line acceleration as a function of radius @xmath10 rather than the velocity gradient as done explicitly in cak theory . \n the implication is also that the critical point is mathematically the sonic point . \n the resulting mass - loss rates follow a scaling relation that only depends on the basic stellar parameters , approximately as :    @xmath11    over the entire range of @xmath12kk  except for the _ bi - stability _ jump around 25 kk , where the mass - loss properties are predicted to change drastically , with @xmath13 dropping by a factor of two ( pauldrach & puls 1990 ; vink et al . 1999 ) and the mass - loss rate jumping upwards by a factor of five ( vink et al . 1999 \n ; see sect.[s : tdep ] ) . \n massive stars rotate rapidly , with rotational velocities of up to 400 km / s . \n this is understood to have dramatic consequences for their evolution and ultimate demise , which may involve the production of a long - duration gamma - ray burst ( long grb ) .    as a result of this rotation , \n the pole becomes hotter than the stellar equator ( von zeipel theorem ) , which enables a rather complex meridional circulation in the stellar interior . during this process \n , nuclear processed material is transported from the core to the stellar envelope , thereby enriching the stellar surface with elements such as nitrogen ( n ) , which is produced during the cno cycle of hydrogen ( h ) burning . \n later on , the combination of mass loss and rotation also leads to the transfer of products of helium ( he ) burning to the surface , enriching the atmosphere with carbon ( c ) during the final carbon - rich wolf - rayet ( wc ) phases before the stellar core is expected to collapse , producing a supernova ( sn )  in some cases in conjunction with a long grb .      the most popular explanation for the long grb phenomenon involves the collapsar model ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) in which a rapidly rotating core collapses and produces an accretion disk surrounding a black hole . \n one of the persistent problems with the collapsar model was that the object not only requires a high rotational velocity at the very beginning of its life , but that it is required to maintain this rapid rotation until the end . \n this is a significant challenge because strong stellar outflows are expected to remove angular momentum . \n stellar models with rotation show that the objects not only remove up to 90% of their initial mass in winds when they have reached their final wolf - rayet phase , but as a result of this wind , the stars are also expected to come to a complete standstill . \n the question is what is expected for wolf - rayet stars in low metallicity galaxies . \n are they subject to similar mass and angular momentum loss ? \n radiation hydrodynamic simulations show that stellar winds from massive o - type stars are driven by the radiation pressure on metal lines , and specifically on iron ( fe ) , despite the fact that it is such a rare element . \n it should be noted that even in the metal `` rich '' environment of the milky way the h abundance is already 2500 times larger than that of fe . \n however , owing to iron s highly complex atomic structure it has millions of line transitions , which makes it an extremely efficient absorber of radiation in the inner atmosphere around the sonic point , where the mass - loss rate is set ( vink et al . 1999 , \n puls et al . 2000 ) . \n figure  [ fig : zrel ] shows the contribution of the different chemical elements ( h , he , cno , f ) to the total line acceleration for normal o - type stars . at solar @xmath1 , \n fe dominates the line acceleration near the sonic point , whilst its contribution drops significantly at lower density . \n therefore , the fe line contribution is less important in the supersonic region where the wind terminal velocity is set ( panel b ) . and similarly at lower @xmath1 ( panels c and d ) . here \n , the contribution of cno and elements such as cl , ar , p and s becomes highly relevant instead ( vink et al . \n 1999 , 2001 ) . \n up to 2005 most stellar modellers assumed that due to the overwhelming presence of c in wc atmospheres , it would probably be c that drives wolf - rayet winds , rather than fe . \n this assumption also implied that wc stars in low metallicity ( @xmath1 ) galaxies would have stellar winds equally strong as those in the galaxy , and still removing the required angular momentum . \n it was for this reason that there was no satisfactory explanation for the long grb puzzle . \n in 2005 , we performed a pilot study of wolf - rayet mass loss as a function of @xmath1 finding that although c may be the most abundant metallic element in wc atmospheres it is nonetheless the much more complex fe element that drives the stellar wind ( vink & de koter 2005 , grfener & hamann 2008 ) . \n in other words , host galaxy metallicity plays a crucial role : objects that are born with fewer fe atoms lose less matter by the time they reach the end of their lives , despite their larger contents of cno material . \n the striking implication is that objects in low metallicity environments  such as those characteristic for the early universe  can keep their angular momentum , enabling a potential grb event . \n interestingly , there indeed appears to be a preference for long grbs towards lower @xmath1 systems ( e.g. vreeswijk et al . \n as discussed at the end of sect .  [ s : theory ] , the mass - loss rates of massive objects are predicted to increase strongly when stars evolve towards the b supergiant regime . this @xmath14 jump is referred to as the bi - stability jump . \n the mass - loss behaviour is depicted as the dotted line in fig . \n [ fig : brott ] . \n recent stellar models with rotation of brott et al . \n ( 2010 ) that include this vink et al . \n mass - loss jump show a dramatic braking ( see solid line ) , which we refer to as _ bi - stability braking ( bsb)_. bsb might explain the general slow rotation of b supergiants . an alternative explanation for the slow rotation of b supergiants might involve a core he - burning nature for b supergiants ( see vink et al . \n 2010 for a detailed discussion ) . \n the cause of the mass - loss bi - stability jump is that the most important line driving element fe recombines from fe iv to fe iii at 25 000 k and that suddenly the fe lines become much more effective as they fall in the wavelength range where the flux distribution is maximal . \n the result is an increase in @xmath14 and a drop in terminal velocity . \n the latter has been confirmed in observed data - sets ( e.g. lamers et al . \n 1995 ) , but the jump in mass - loss rate is still controversial ( e.g. crowther et al . \n 2006 , benaglia 2007 , markova & puls 2008 ) . \n the relevance for stellar evolution is that when massive stars evolve to lower @xmath15  after the o star main sequence phase , they are expected to cross the bi - stability jump . \n interestingly , lbvs brighter than log ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ \n fig : hrd ] ) . are expected to encounter it continuously - on timescales of their photometric variability , which we discuss in the next section . \n 22 000 k ( after humphreys & davidson 1994 ; smith et al . \n 2004 ; vink 2009).,width=340 ]    in the previous section , we discussed the physics of the bi - stability jump in the context of normal ob supergiants . \n the jump might also play a role in the mass - loss behaviour of lbvs , in particular with reference to the normal `` s doradus '' type variations where the stars change their effective temperatures from values as high as 30 kk ( where they are identified as b supergiants ) to approximately 10 kk ( where they are identified as f supergiants ) . during these s dor excursions , \n the stars keep crossing the temperature range of the bi - stability jump ( see fig.[fig : hrd ] ) , thereby likely inducing variable mass loss . \n such variable mass loss is in turn understood to be responsible for a non - uniform circumstellar medium , which could show up in the lightcurves and spectra of core - collapse sne  if lbvs were in an advanced enough evolutionary state . \n current wisdom is that lbvs are not evolved enough ( e.g. langer et al . \n 1994 ) and that the lbv phase of evolution is the stage in which most of the outer hydrogen envelope is lost , prior to the objects turning to the much hotter wr phase . during this stage \n , they are thought to be subject to core he - burning for another couple of 100 0000 years before they finally run our of fuel and collapse . \n however , there have been recent observational hints that lbvs might explode early . \n kotak & vink ( 2006 ) noted that the variable radio emission of some transitional core - collapse sne such as sne 2001ig and 2003bg might be the result of variable lbv progenitor mass loss , which was subsequently followed up with spectroscopic wind velocity variations in sn 2005gj ( trundle et al . \n 2008 ) . in the meantime , \n smith et al . \n ( 2007 ) have argued for lbv super - outburst circumstellar material being responsible for a number of luminous interacting sne , whilst gal - yam et al . \n ( 2007 ) identified an lbv - type hypergiant star in the pre - explosion image of sn 2005gl . \n in other words , there appears to be a growing body of observational evidence that lbvs might explode already during their lbv phase of evolution . \n it might turn out to be an interesting puzzle to reconcile these findings with the theory of stellar structure and evolution . \n in this communication , we have presented a couple of examples of the type of information that mass - loss predictions can provide for our understanding of the evolution and fate of massive stars , especially with respect to sne and long grbs . \n the manner in which these mass - loss predictions depend on the basic stellar parameters , such as @xmath1 and @xmath18 , can ultimately only be as good as the underlying atomic data . \n extensive opacity data and linelists , such as those provided by kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) that have been used in our study , are thus of fundamental importance not only for the mass - loss predictions themselves , but also for understanding the lives and deaths of massive stars  over all cosmological epochs .", "StartTimeOffset": 2438196510174, "RequestID": "57cf0cbe7b63475d42f75adc9a0c5f2e84febbf5", "TotalTokens": 3402}

like systems is still a matter of debate and several scenarios have been proposed in order to explain the growth of these two components and their interactions . \n the simplest scenarios currently accepted for the formation of the bulges are two : the first one establishes that the bulge and the disc are formed independently ( andredakis et al . \n 1995 ) , and the second one assumes that the disc forms first and the bulge emerges from it as a consequence of gas inflow during a period of secular evolution ( courteau et al . \n 1996 ) . \n numerical simulations are a powerful tool to tackle galaxy formation since they can account for the joint evolution of baryons and dark matter in a cosmological framework . \n we use smooth particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulations to investigate the effects of mergers and interactions on the determination of the structural properties of galaxies . \n we analize galactic objects identified from numerical sph simulations that take into account the gravitational and hydrodynamical evolution of the matter in cold dark matter universes . \n we run two simulations with @xmath0 ( s1 ) and @xmath1 ( s2 ) total number of particles and the following cosmological parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( s1)and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( s2 ) , where ( @xmath8 ) . \n the simulated boxes represent cubic volumes of @xmath9 ( s1 ) and @xmath10 ( s2 ) mpc length . \n we select galaxy - like objects ( glos ) at @xmath11 by using a density - contrast criterium and follow their evolution with look - back time , constructing their star formation and merger histories ( see scannapieco & tissera 2003 for details ) . with the aim at investigating the effects of mergers on the structural properties of the systems we perform bulge - disc decompositions to the projected mass surface density of the glos at @xmath11 , and of the progenitors during merger events , assuming an exponential profile for the discs and the srsic law for the bulges . \n galaxy -

like objects during merger events by studying the variation of their structural parameters . \n we find that secular evolution during the orbital decay phase produces the largest changes in the structural parameters of the systems : bulges get larger with respect to the discs and with more exponential profiles . \n these changes are found to be more important in unstable systems with shallower potential wells . \n fusions introduce further modifications in the opposite direction although they are less important . \n we also find that secular evolution phases contribute to establish the observed fundamental relations : after secular evolution , bulges tend to satisfy the observed fundamental plane and the disc components the tully - fisher relation . \n fusions may add some dispersion but do not significantly change them ( smith castelli et al . \n departures from the fundamental relations could be indicating a lack of secular phases . \n our findings suggest that interactions play a fundamental role being able to transform discs into spheroids . \n discs can also survive violent events , being either partially destroyed or just feeded by the colliding object . \n the stability properties of the initial system seem to be a fundamental point in the response of the disc to the incoming satellite . \n other factors such as orbital parameters and relative masses of the colliding objects would also affect the determination of the structural properties of the outcome systems . \n the different possible histories of evolution of galactic systems in hierarchical universes could potentially explain the diversity of galaxies in our universe .", "StartTimeOffset": 2445857708760, "RequestID": "9803642d89aabcd4460b047ef35284d14d08e71f", "TotalTokens": 1150}

[ \n moehler : fig : arc_raw ] ) . \n the positions of arc lamp spectra on the ccd are determined by a pattern matching technique applied to the detected emission lines . \n for that an estimate of the linear dispersion as well as a line catalog ( which may both be provided by the user ) are required . \n adjacent slitlets with no offsets in dispersion direction are not distinguished and will form one longer slitlet . \n the spatial curvature is determined by tracing the edges of the corresponding flat field spectra ( cf . \n [ moehler : fig : spat_curv ] ) when possible . \n the curvature is fit by default with a second order polynomial . \n the final wavelength calibration is obtained taking into account the spatial curvature of the spectra . \n the pipeline provides the following output calibration files :    * slit positions on the ccd at the central wavelength of the grism * coefficients for the dispersion relation and the spatial curvature * master bias * master flat field ( normalized and not - normalized ) * wavelength map and spatial map * reduced arc lamp frame * spectral resolution and line widths    the wavelength map specifies at the position of each original ccd pixel its corresponding wavelength . \n thus the user can avoid the re - sampling of the spectra usually done after the wavelength calibration . \n the spatial map provides in the same manner the position of the ccd pixel within its associated slitlet . \n the reduced arc lamp frame allows to judge the quality of the calibration ( straight arc lines , no wriggles , no offsets ) . if successful ( see sect . \n [ moehler : sec : weak ] ) the pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.1 pixel both in spatial and dispersion direction . \n the default reduction of spectroscopic science data is as follows : the data are first corrected for bias . \n then the extraction mask derived above ( i.e. the positions of the slitlets and the curvatures of the resulting spectra ) is applied to the science data ; they are flat - fielded and re - mapped eliminating the optical distortions . \n afterward they are rebinned to constant wavelength steps . \n the wavelength calibration can be adjusted using sky emission lines . \n this allows to correct for shifts between night - time science and day - time calibration data . \n such shifts ( of the order of 1 pixel ) are known to happen due to flexure for mxu observations . \n finally object spectra are detected and extracted , together with the corresponding error spectra and sky spectra . \n for long - slit spectroscopy the sky background is determined using a median . \n this is a valid approach if not more than half of the pixels contain flux from objects _ and _ there is no spatial gradient in the sky background . for multi - object spectroscopy instead the sky is subtracted before remapping , i.e. when the spectra are still in the original ccd coordinate system . \n the sky is determined with a robust linear fitting , which allows for a linear spatial gradient in the background . \n also in this case , however , not more than half of the pixels may contain flux from the object(s ) . \n the output science files are    * positions and widths of object spectra * extracted object spectra , error spectra , and sky spectra * unmapped ( corrected for spatial distortions , not rebinned ) science frames * mapped ( i.e. corrected for spatial distortions and rebinned ) science frames * adjusted dispersion coefficients and wavelength map \n the major strength of the new pipeline is its flexibility and robustness . \n it requires only very limited input information ( mainly dispersion estimate and line catalog ) and can therefore be applied to a large variety of instrument configurations . \n thus it is now possible for the first time to _ automatically _ reduce long - slit ( lss ) and multi - object spectroscopic data ( mos / mxu ) from the two fors instruments for all grisms and both collimators ( standard and high - resolution ) . to verify its flexibility \n the pipeline was applied to data from the low - resolution spectrograph of the hobby eberly telescope , which it handled without any problems . \n the pipeline does have problems if there are too few arc lines , e.g. for slitlets with large offsets . \n in such cases it sometimes fails to correctly identify the slitlet . \n this can be most easily recognized by comparing the not - normalized and the normalized screen flat ( cf . \n [ moehler : fig : bad_mos ]  one slitlet is partly missing , another one was not processed at all ) . \n large gaps between arc lines can be problematic as non - linear dispersion terms can become important , while the pipeline currently uses only linear dispersion estimates for the pattern matching . \n the pipeline will fail in case of regularly spaced arc lines , like those created by a laser comb , as its pattern matching ( see contribution by izzo et al . ) \n does not work for such data . \n in order to check the quality of observational data a pipeline is of great importance . otherwise it is difficult to distinguish between well - known and correctable instrument effects and real problems . \n quality control shall ensure that the data observed with the forses can be calibrated . \n in addition the trending of certain parameters allows to have an eye on the instrument health ( see http://www.eso.org/dfo/quality for more details ) . \n therefore the resolution , central wavelength , and number of identified arc lines are regularly monitored . \n a change in the number of identified lines can indicate reduced flux of the arc lamp and possibly impending failure of the lamp . \n a change in resolution could indicate focus problems . \n 079@xmath0 0@xmath1007 with respect to chip 1 ( the known value being 0@xmath1083 ) . the reduced arc lamp image corresponding to the coefficients in the dashed box \n is shown in fig . \n [ moehler : fig : pccx_bad ] ]    the situation for the quality control of fors data has vastly improved with the new pipeline , as now almost all data can be reduced ( with polarimetric data being the only exception ) . \n moreover , the new pipeline also provides additional information on the instrument . \n for example , the combination of the curvature coefficients can be used to monitor grism alignment : the coefficients c1 and c2 describe the slope and the curvature of a slitlet , respectively . if the curvature is 0 , then the slope should be 0 as well  otherwise this indicates that the grism is not well aligned . \n [ moehler : fig : coeff ] shows the coefficients obtained for the 600z fors2 grism . \n obviously the correlation for the majority of solutions passes through zero . \n some solutions , however , show significant offsets from the general trend . \n [ moehler : fig : pccx_bad ] shows a reduced arc lamp image for such a deviating case ( marked by the dashed box in fig .  [ moehler : fig : coeff ] ) . obviously the wavelength calibration obtained for several slitlets is rather bad ( wriggles instead of straight lines ) . \n thus diagrams like fig . \n [ moehler : fig : coeff ] allow to look for bad solutions efficiently in case of large data volume , which may prohibit checking all solutions individually .    . \n ]    other new parameters become available if there are more than 12 slitlets distributed across the ccd . in this case \n the pipeline calculates a global distortion model , which contains good indicators for the monitoring of the instrument s health , like the instrument scale . \n the new spectroscopic pipeline for the fors instruments has been a great success in that it allows to reduce _ automatically _ long - slit and multi - object spectroscopic data for all fors grisms . the fact that it does not need a first guess from an instrument model makes it a promising candidate for the reduction of spectroscopic data from a variety of instruments . \n in addition this approach is extremely helpful in the presence of instrument instabilities as it allows to reduce data whose configurations deviate from the expected one ( e.g. due to instrument aging or earthquakes ) . \n i would like to thank c. izzo and u. hopp for their valuable comments on this manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 2469487543728, "RequestID": "095aa9ae3a8219e1ed1a9598f51b35bc50e46ac0", "TotalTokens": 1845}

70 channels have taken data during 1998 . \n this is in contrast to 1999 and 2000 data taking where stability had improved . \n ten events within a 30 degree half angle cone around nadir have been selected and limits on the excess of muon flux due to wimp annihilation in the center of the earth have been derived . \n also a new limit on the flux of fast monopoles has been obtained .    in the following years , _ \n nt-200 _ will be operated as a neutrino telescope with an effective area between 1000 and 5000 m@xmath22 , depending on the energy . \n it will investigate atmospheric neutrino spectra above 10 gev ( about 1 atmospheric neutrino per two - three days ) . \n due to the high water transparency and low light scattering with effective scattering length greater than 150m@xmath1200 m , the effective volume of _ \n nt-200 _ for high energy electron and tau neutrinos detection is more than two orders of magnitude larger than its geometrical volume . \n this will permit a search for diffuse neutrino fluxes from agn and other extraterrestrial sources on a level of theoretical predictions .    with an effective area two times larger than super -

landau band plasmons ) and those within a single landau - band ( intra - landau band plasmons ) . \n inter - landau band plasmons involve the local 2d magnetoplasma mode and the bernstein - like plasma resonances , all of which involve excitation frequencies greater than the landau - band separation . since , in this work , we are not considering landau level broadening therefore only the inter - landau band plasmons will be investigated . \n we now examine the inter - landau - band transitions . in this case @xmath20 @xmath49and eq.(11 ) yields @xmath50 where @xmath51 which permits us to write the following term in eq ( 10 ) as@xmath52 next , we consider the coefficient @xmath53 in eq.(10 ) and expand it to lowest order in its argument ( low wave -

landau - band plasmon dispersion relation for bilayer graphene is @xmath78      eqs.(18 ) and ( 22 ) are the central results of this work . \n eq.(18 ) is the inter - landau band plasmon dispersion relation for monolayer graphene . \n the inter - landau band plasmon energy as a function of the inverse magnetic field for the monolayer and bilayer graphene system with the plasmon energy for 2deg at zero temperature is presented in figs.(1,2 ) . \n the following parameters were employed for doped graphene ( @xmath79 substrate ) : @xmath80 , @xmath81 m@xmath82 , @xmath83 m/s . \n for the conventional 2deg ( a 2deg at the gaas - algaas heterojunction ) we use the following parameters : @xmath84(@xmath33 is the electron mass ) , @xmath85 and @xmath81 m@xmath86 for electron density and magnetic field considered , electrons fill approximately 30 landau levels , the upper limit in the summation for @xmath87 is taken to be @xmath88 while the lower limit is @xmath89 in fig.(1 ) we have plotted the plasmon energy as a function of the inverse magnetic field for both monolayer graphene and conventional 2deg . \n the sdh - type oscillations are clearly visible that are a result of emptying out of electrons from successive landau levels when they pass through the fermi level as the magnetic field is increased . \n the amplitude of these oscillations is a monotonic function of the magnetic field . \n these oscillations have a @xmath0 berry s phase due to the chiral nature of the quasiparticles in this system , the phase acquired by dirac electrons in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite . \n we also observe that the plasmon energy is @xmath90 times greater than in the 2deg for the parameters considered . \n this is essentially due to the higher fermi energy of the electrons in graphene and the smaller background dielectric constant .    for bilayer graphene , we consider eq.(22 ) . \n there are two main differences between the plasmon dispersion relation for bilayer graphene given in eq.(22 ) and the standard 2deg result . \n firstly , the cyclotron frequency @xmath91 in bilayer is @xmath92 greater than the cyclotron frequency @xmath93 at the same magnetic field in 2deg due to the difference in the effective masses of the electrons in the two systems . \n secondly , the 2d plasma frequency @xmath94 is also larger than in 2deg for the same wave number @xmath95 due to the smaller effective mass of electrons in bilayer compared to 2deg and the smaller background dielectric constant @xmath96 in bilayer . \n the inter - landau band plasmon energy as a function of the inverse magnetic field for doped bilayer and the 2deg is shown in fig.(2 ) . \n the following parameters were used ( @xmath79 substrate ) : @xmath97 , @xmath81 m@xmath82 and @xmath98with @xmath33 being the usual electron mass . \n we again observe the sdh - type oscillations whose amplitude is a monotonic function of the magnetic field . \n we observe that the plasmon energy is @xmath99 times greater than in the 2deg due to the smaller effective mass , valley degeneracy and smaller background dielectric constant . \n due to the chiral nature of the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene , @xmath1 berry s phase is evident in the sdh type oscillations displayed in fig.(2 ) .    in conclusion \n , we have determined the inter - landau band plasmon frequency for both monolayer and bilayer graphene employing the scf approach . \n the inter - landau band plasmon energy is presented as a function of the inverse magnetic field . \n the sdh - type oscillations are clearly visible in both the systems and their amplitude is a monotonic function of the magnetic field . due to the chiral nature of the quasiparticles in the mono and bilayer graphene system , @xmath0 and @xmath1 berry s phases are observed in the sdh- type oscillations in the plasmon spectrum . \n one of us ( k.s . ) would like to acknowledge the support of the pakistan science foundation ( psf ) through project no . \n c -

? ? \n * ) , raising the ratio of be - hmxbs to o , b - hmxbs close to 0.5 . \n the study of this new population may have strong implications on the scenarios of binary formation and evolution . in this perspective \n , the use of x - ray spectroscopy at different orbital phases makes it possible to probe the stellar wind , providing two - dimensional information on the density and ionization structure of the wind . \n for instance , the soft excess that is present in the soft x - ray spectra of many hmxbs , whose origin is still quite mysterious , is linked to the physics of the wind close to the compact object , especially the region where the fast moving stellar wind collides with the slow moving and highly ionized gas surrounding the compact object @xcite . \n igr  j19140@xmath00951  was discovered by _ integral _  by the satellite _ integral _  in march 2003 @xcite . \n prior to our study , it was identified an a hmxb with an orbital period of 13.552 days @xcite , composed probably of a neutron star @xcite orbiting a b0.5 i type supergiant companion star @xcite . \n thus , it is a good candidate to study the properties of the obscured x - ray binaries . \n the data from the two satellites were reduced using the latest software packages available . since igr \n j19140@xmath00951  is a fairly faint source , we also corrected the spectra for the galactic x - ray background ( gxb ) , using the parameters measured by @xcite . \n this correction aimed mostly at minimising the errors on the measure of the photoelectric absorption , by removing the galactic contribution and keeping only the absorption intrinsic to the source . \n we identified the emission process as thermal comptonization , which is quite common for this type of source . but \n a more interesting characteristic is the detection of a so called `` soft excess '' .    during our study , some spectra exhibited an excess in the soft x - ray part of the spectra , which we modeled by adding a black body component to the model . \n this feature has already been observed in many x - ray binaries ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . \n its origin is mysterious , but can be linked to the immediate environment of the neutron star , and explained qualitatively by the following scenario . due to its high energy emission , the neutron star ionizes the surrounding material . since the stellar wind is accelerated by ionization in the uv lines , the already ionized gas around the neutron star is no longer accelerated by the stellar radiation field . \n when the compact object moves along its orbit , the hot gas will gradually be overtaken by the stellar wind . \n this will lead to the formation of a  tail \" trailing the neutron star .    as the gas in this tail is ionized , its absorption will be lower , but its precise effect on the emission is not clear . \n since the soft excess is only visible just prior the superior conjunction ( between phases 0.25 and 0.5 ) , one possibility is that the hard x - ray emission may be scattered around the tail . \n the precise study of this effect , however , would require better spectral resolution in the soft x - ray range than what is available on _ \n in order to constrain several parameters for the system , we used a simple wind model based of the fact that b - type stars emit strong stellar winds , usually taken to be stationary and spherically symmetric . \n see e.g. @xcite for a precise description of the method \n . using the evolution of the photoelectric absorption , we were able to constrain the inclination of the system and the mass - loss rate of the companion star . \n for the most probable stellar radius of 21 @xmath4 , the lower inclination limit is constrained between 37 and 42 degrees ( fig . \n [ meilleur ] , left ) , with @xmath5 being at a minimum in the range 5563 degrees . \n [ meilleur ] , right , shows the best - fit model against the experimental normalised data , with a good agreement . \n @xmath6 is constraint in the range 0.61.0@xmath710@xmath2 m@xmath3/year , which is consistent with what is expected for a b0.5 type supergiant . \n symbols ) , for the stellar model with parameters m@xmath8 = 20m@xmath3 , r@xmath8 = 21r@xmath3 and @xmath9 = 0.5 . \n phase 0 corresponds to when the compact object is located between the earth and the companion star ( inferior conjunction).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   symbols ) , for the stellar model with parameters m@xmath8 = 20m@xmath3 , r@xmath8 = 21r@xmath3 and @xmath9 = 0.5 . \n phase 0 corresponds to when the compact object is located between the earth and the companion star ( inferior conjunction).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] \n the study of x - ray binaries is challenging since it is often difficult if not impossible to identify their visible and infrared counterparts . \n even if an infrared counterpart were observed , the distance to some systems prohibits the measurement of the orbital characteristics . \n our study shows that x - ray observations can overcome these limitations and produce very precise inferences . \n the _ rxte _  and \n _ integral _  observations of igr  j19140@xmath00951  have led to good measurements of the orbital period of the system and constraints on its inclination angle .    moreover \n , we can use the compact object to probe the stellar wind of the companion . in the case of igr \n j19140@xmath00951 , we diagnosed the type of the companion ( supergiant o or b ) , the wind density and its structure around the neutron star . \n more precise observations could lead to constraints on the mass and radius of the companion , and better constraints on the stellar wind . \n this allows the study of new _ integral _ \n sources , either distant or highly absorbed , and ultimately the determination of new useful data for x - ray binary evolution scenarios .", "StartTimeOffset": 2505547840476, "RequestID": "3666576a49e2cc8fa8ef2cbd0ec70dd081fa866a", "TotalTokens": 1726}

{"ContextTokens": 3032, "GeneratedTokens": 189, "SynthesizedBody": "memory - based learning of classification tasks is a branch of supervised machine learning in which the learning phase consists simply of storing all encountered instances from a training set in memory @xcite . \n memory - based learning algorithms do not invest effort during learning in abstracting from the training data , such as eager - learning ( e.g. , decision - tree algorithms , rule - induction , or connectionist - learning algorithms , @xcite ) do . \n rather , they defer investing effort until new instances are presented . \n on being presented with an instance , a memory - based learning algorithm searches for a best - matching instance , or , more generically , a set of the @xmath0 best - matching instances in memory . \n having found such a set of @xmath0 best - matching instances , the algorithm takes the ( majority ) class with which the instances in the set are labeled to be the class of the new instance . \n pure memory - based learning algorithms implement the classic @xmath0-nearest neighbour algorithm @xcite ; in different contexts , memory - based learning algorithms have also been named lazy , instance - based , exemplar - based , memory - based , case - based learning or reasoning @xcite )    memory - based learning has been demonstrated to yield accurate models of various natural language tasks such as grapheme - phoneme conversion , word stress assignment , part - of - speech tagging , and pp - attachment @xcite . \n for example , the memory - based learning algorithm ib1-ig @xcite , which extends the well - known ib1 algorithm @xcite with an information - gain weighted similarity metric , has been demonstrated to perform adequately and , moreover , consistently and significantly better than _ eager - learning _ algorithms which do invest effort in abstraction during learning ( e.g. , decision - tree learning @xcite , and connectionist learning @xcite ) when trained and tested on a range of morpho - phonological tasks ( e.g. , morphological segmentation , grapheme - phoneme conversion , syllabification , and word stress assignment ) @xcite . \n thus , when learning nlp tasks , the abstraction occurring in decision trees ( i.e. , the explicit _ forgetting _ of information considered to be redundant ) and in connectionist networks ( i.e. , a non - symbolic encoding and decoding in relatively small numbers of connection weights ) both hamper accurate generalisation of the learned knowledge to new material . \n these findings appear to contrast with the general assumption behind eager learning , that data representing real - world classification tasks tends to contains ( i ) redundancy and ( ii ) exceptions : redundant data can be removed , yielding smaller descriptions of the original data ; some exceptions ( e.g. , low - frequency exceptions ) can ( or should ) be discarded since they are expected to be bad predictors for classifying new ( test ) material . \n however , both redundancy and exceptionality can not be computed trivially ; heuristic functions are generally used to estimate them ( e.g. , functions from information theory @xcite ) . \n the lower generalisation accuracies of both decision - tree and connectionist learning , compared to memory - based learning , on the above - mentioned nlp tasks , suggest that these heuristic estimates may not hold for data representing nlp tasks . \n it appears that in order to learn such tasks successfully , a learning algorithm should not forget ( i.e. , explicitly remove from memory ) any information contained in the learning material : it should not abstract from the individual instances \n .    an obvious type of abstraction that is not harmful for generalisation accuracy ( but that is not always acknowledged in implementations of memory - based learning ) is be the straightforward abstraction from tokens to types with frequency information . \n in general , data sets representing natural language tasks , when large enough , tend to contain considerable numbers of duplicate sequences mapping to the same output or class . \n for example , in data representing word pronunciations , some sequences of letters , such as ing at the end of english words , occur hundreds of times , while each of the sequences is pronounced identically , viz . \n /i/. instead of storing all individual sequence tokens in memory , each set of identical tokens can be safely stored in memory as a single sequence type with frequency information , without loss of generalisation accuracy @xcite . \n thus , forgetting instance tokens and replacing them by instance types may lead to considerable computational optimisations of memory - based learning , since the memory that needs to be searched may become considerably smaller . \n given the safe , performance - preserving optimisation of replacing sets of instance tokens by instance types with frequency information , a next step of investigation into optimising memory - based learning is to measure the effects of _ forgetting instance types _ on grounds of their exceptionality , the underlying idea being that the more exceptional a task instance type is , the more likely it is that it is a bad predictor for new instances . \n thus , exceptionality should in some way express the unsuitability of a task instance type to be a best match ( nearest neighbour ) to new instances : it would be unwise to copy its associated classification to best - matching new instances . in this paper \n , we investigate three criteria for estimating an instance type s exceptionality , and removing instance types estimated to be the most exceptional by each of these criteria . \n the criteria investigated are    1 . \n typicality of instance types ; 2 .   class prediction strength of instance types ; 3 . \n friendly - neighbourhood size of instance types ; 4 . \n random ( to provide a baseline experiment ) . \n we base our experiments on a large data set of english word pronunciation . \n we briefly describe this data set , and the way it is converted into an instance base fit for memory - based learning , in section  [ data ] . in section  [ experimental ] we describe the settings of our experiments and the memory - based learning algorithm ib1-ig with which the experiments are performed . \n we then turn to describing the notions of typicality , class - prediction strength , and friendly - neighbourhood size , and the functions to estimate them , in section  [ criteria ] . \n section  [ results ] provides the experimental results . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the obtained results and formulate our conclusions . \n converting written words to stressed phonemic transcription , i.e. , word pronunciation , is a well - known benchmark task in machine learning @xcite . \n we define the task as the conversion of fixed - sized instances representing parts of words to a class representing the phoneme and the stress marker of the instance s middle letter . to generate the instances , \n windowing is used @xcite . \n table  [ overall - windows - ex ] displays example instances and their classifications generated on the basis of the sample word booking . \n classifications , i.e. , phonemes with stress markers ( henceforth pss ) , are denoted by composite labels . \n for example , the first instance in table  [ overall - windows - ex ] , _ _ _ book , maps to class label /b/1 , denoting a /b/ which is the first phoneme of a syllable receiving primary stress . \n in this study , we chose a fixed window width of seven letters , which offers sufficient context information for adequate performance , though extension of the window decreases ambiguity within the data set @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n figure  [ edited - gs ] displays the generalisation accuracies in terms of incorrectly classified test instances obtained with all performed experiments . the leftmost point in the figure , \n from which all lines originate , indicates the performance of ib1-ig when trained on the full data set of 222,601 types , viz . \n 6.42% incorrectly classified test instances ( when computed in terms of incorrectly pronounced test words , ib1-ig pronounces 64.61 of all test words flawlessly ) . \n the line graph representing the four experiments in which instance types are removed randomly can be seen as the baseline graph . \n it can be expected that removing instances randomly leads to a degradation of generalisation performance . \n the upward curve of the line graph denoting the experiments with random selection indeed shows degrading performance with increasing numbers of left - out instance types . \n the relative decrease in generalisation accuracy is 2.0% when 1% of the training material is removed randomly , 3.8% with 2% random removal , 10.7% with 5% random removal , and 20.7% with 10% random removal . \n =    surprisingly , the only experiments showing lower performance degradation than removal by random selection are those with class - prediction strength ; the other criteria for removing exceptional instances lead to worse degradations . it does not matter whether instance types are removed on grounds of their typicality : apparently , a markedly low , neutral , or high typicality value indicates that the instance type is ( on average ) important , rather than removable . \n the same applies to friendly - neighbourhood size : instances with small neighbourhood sizes appear to contribute significantly to performance on test material . \n it is remarkable that the largest errors with 1% and 2% removal are obtained with the friendly - neighbourhood size criterion : it appears that on average , the instances with few or no nearest neighbours are important in the classification of test material . \n when using class - prediction strength as removal criterion , performance does not degrade until about 5% of the instance types with the lowest strength are removed from memory . \n the reason is that class - prediction strength is the only criterion that detects minority ambiguities , i.e. , instance types with prediction strength 0.0 , that can not contribute to classification since they are always overshadowed by their counterpart instance types with majority classes , even for their own classification . in the training \n set , 9,443 instance types are minority ambiguities , i.e. , 4.2% of the instance types ( accounting for 3.8% of the instance tokens in the original token set ) . \n thus , among the tested methods for reducing the memory needed for storing an instance base in memory - based learning , only two are performance - preserving while accounting for a substantial reduction in the amount of memory needed by ib1-ig :    1 . \n replacing instance tokens by instance types accounts for a reduction of about 63% of memory needed to store instances , excluding the memory needed to store frequency information . \n when frequency information is stored in two bytes per instance type , the memory reduction is about 54% . \n removing instance types that are minority ambiguities on top of the type / token - reduction accounts only for an additional memory reduction of 2% , i.e. , for a total memory reduction of 65% ; 56% with two - byte frequency information stored per instance . \n as previous research has suggested @xcite , keeping full memory in memory - based learning of word pronunciation strongly appears to yield optimal generalisation accuracy . \n the experiments in this paper show that optimisation of memory use in memory - based learning while preserving generalisation accuracy can only be performed by ( i ) replacing instance tokens by instance types with frequency information , and ( ii ) removing minority ambiguities . \n both optimisations can be performed straightforwardly ; minority ambiguities can be traced with less effort than by using class - prediction strength . \n our implementation of ib1-ig described in @xcite already makes use of this knowledge , albeit partially ( it stores class distributions with letter - window types ) . \n we note that with @xmath1 ( in our tested implementation of ib1-ig , @xmath2 ) , removing minority ambiguities may distort performance , since taking more than single nearest neighbours into account may allow for minority ambiguities to play a constructive role in classification . \n our results also show that atypicality , non - typicality , and typicality @xcite , and friendly - neighbourhood size are all estimates of exceptionality that indicate the importance of instance types for classification , rather than their removability . as far as these estimates of exceptionality \n are viable , our results suggest that exceptions should be kept in memory and not be thrown away .      * \n the tested criteria can be employed as instance weights as in each @xcite and pebls @xcite , rather than as criteria for instance removal . \n instance weighting may add relevant information to similarity matching , and may improve ib1-ig s performance rather than just preserving it . \n * the tested implementation of ib1-ig performs a @xmath0-nn search through instance space with @xmath2 . \n when @xmath3 , ib1-ig s performance may change , as well as the effect of applying the instance - removal techniques tested here . removing instances from memory may have a less drastic effect when more instance types at more distances are allowed to match a new instance . \n daelemans , w. 1996 . \n abstraction considered harmful : lazy learning of language processing . in h.  j. van den herik and a.  weijters , editors , _ proceedings of the sixth belgian  dutch conference on machine learning _ \n , pages 312 , maastricht , the netherlands . matriks . \n daelemans , w. and a.  van den bosch \n generalisation performance of backpropagation learning on a syllabification task . in m. \n f.  j. drossaers and a.  nijholt , editors , _ twlt3 : connectionism and natural language processing _ , pages 2737 , enschede . \n twente university . \n daelemans , w. , a.  weijters , and a.  van den bosch . \n empirical learning of natural language processing tasks . \n lecture notes in artificial intelligence , , number 1224 , pages 337344 . \n berlin : springer - verlag . \n rumelhart , d.  e. , g.  e. hinton , and r.  j. williams . \n learning internal representations by error propagation . in d. \n e. rumelhart and j.  l. mcclelland , editors , _ parallel distributed processing : explorations in the microstructure of cognition _ \n , volume 1 : foundations . \n cambridge , ma : the mit press , pages 318362 .            , a. , w.  daelemans , and a.  weijters . \n morphological analysis as classification : an inductive - learning approach . in k. \n oflazer and h.  somers , editors , _ proceedings of the second international conference on new methods in natural language processing , nemlap-2 , ankara , turkey _ , pages 7989 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2526777772740, "RequestID": "ed8dc206e2be420f9e7d5eaa429bacb050d69d89", "TotalTokens": 3221}

10 ] . \n yu and eberly [ 11 , 12 ] showed that entanglement loss occurs in a finite time under the action of pure vacuum noise in a bipartite state of qubits . \n they found that , even though it takes infinite time to complete decoherence locally , the global entanglement may be lost in finite time . \n recently , researchers have focused on relativistic quantum information in the filed of quantum information science due to conceptual and experimental reasons . in the last few years , much attention had been given to the study of entanglement shared between inertial and non - inertial observers by discussing how the unruh or hawking effect will influence the degree of entanglement [ 1322 ] . \n most of the investigations in non - inertial frames are focused on the study of the quantum information in bipartite qubit system with one subsystem as an accelerated . since , it is  not possible to completely isolate a quantum system from its environment . \n therefore , one needs to investigate the behavior of entanglement in the presence of environmental effects . \n a major problem of quantum communication is to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel . \n when quantum information is sent through a channel , the carriers of the information interact with the channel and get entangled with its many degrees of freedom . \n this gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence on the state space of the information carriers . \n implementation of decoherence in non -

@xmath5@xmath6 ) @xmath7 are often exploited to constrain the cross section of new physics processes  @xcite . \n indeed , under the assumption that new physics contributions to the z width are exclusively positive ( as is the case for processes kinematically allowed at @xmath8 ) , this agreement allows a 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) limit of @xmath9 to be set on any exotic contribution to @xmath10 . \n however , extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry or technicolor , generate a whole set of new particles , which may or may not be produced in @xmath11  collisions at @xmath8 . \n the particles that are too heavy to be produced in z decays may still contribute to the z width through vacuum polarization diagrams with a generally undetermined sign . \n it may therefore well occur that negative contributions be sizeable and invalidate the widely used aforementioned limit on @xmath12 . \n it is the purpose of this letter to derive model - independent limits on additional contributions to z decays , and to use these limits to unambiguously constrain the light gluino mass window . \n it is indeed controversial if a light gluino @xmath3  of mass below 5@xmath6  is phenomenologically viable  @xcite \n . a review of existing limits and of the related weak points can be found in ref . \n in particular , a study of the qcd colour factors from four - jet angular correlations and the differential two - jet rate in z decays , performed by aleph , allowed a 95%c.l . \n lower limit of 6.3@xmath6  to be set on @xmath13  @xcite . \n however , it was argued by the light gluino defenders  @xcite that this limit was to be weakened because _ ( i ) _ the theory uncertainties were too aggressive ; and _ ( ii ) _ no next - to - leading - order mass corrections were available for the four - jet angular correlations . \n this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : \n vacuum ] , the reader is reminded of the model - independent parametrization of the weak loop corrections to the electroweak observables according to the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite . \n this formalism is extended in section  [ sec : hadronic ] to the corrections caused by any new physics production process , in either the hadronic , the leptonic or the invisible final state . \n the result is applied to the @xmath14 process in section  [ sec : gluino ] and a model - independent lower limit on the gluino mass is obtained . \n virtual contributions to the `` electroweak observables '' have been parametrized in a model - independent way by several authors . here , the choice was made to parametrize the basic electroweak observables , _ \n i.e. _ , those sensitive to the weak loop corrections , with the ( linearized ) @xmath0 formalism , according to  @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the born approximations of the corresponding observables , _ \n i.e. , _ without any weak loop corrections , and where the pure qcd- and qed - corrections were parametrized as @xmath17    in the standard model , or in any theory that does not predict new open processes in @xmath11  collisions at @xmath8 , the three @xmath0 s can then be fit to the precise measurements of lep and slc  @xcite , summarized in table  [ tab : data ] . \n .precise lep and slc measurements of the z lineshape parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , of @xmath21 and of @xmath22 , together with their correlation matrix . \n the last two measurements have been taken here as uncorrelated with the first three  @xcite . \n [ tab : data ] [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     because the existence of new particles could also modify the evolution of the electromagnetic coupling constant from 0 to @xmath23 , it was checked whether these limits could be affected by a variation of @xmath24 . this check is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : alpha]a , where it appears that the standard model value of @xmath25 yields the largest upper limits on the three partial widths . the limits of table  [ tab : \n limit ] are therefore conservative in this respect . \n new light hadronic flavours would also modify the evolution of the strong coupling constant . \n although , as already mentioned , @xmath26 is constrained by measurements performed directly at the z mass scale , it is also determined with at least as accurate low energy measurements extrapolated at @xmath23 . a different scaling law for the latter would modify the world average of @xmath26 . however , a contribution from new coloured scalars or fermions would always slow down the running from low energy to @xmath23  so as to increase the value of @xmath27  @xcite . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : alpha]b , such an increase of @xmath26 would render more constraining the limits on the hadronic and invisible partial widths . the limit on the leptonic width \n would be slightly weakened , but would anyway remain the strongest of the three constraints . \n the conservative choice of ignoring this effect was made throughout . \n finally , it may be argued that a new hadronic contribution to z decays would decrease the value of @xmath26 fitted from the z lineshape . \n however , the @xmath26 world average and its uncertainty ( saturated by common theory errors ) , and therefore the result of the present fit , do not change noticeably when the @xmath26 measurement from the z lineshape in taken out . \n ( 160,80 ) ( 71,70)(a ) ( 150,70)(b ) ( 0,-2 ) ( 80,-2 )    the fit of @xmath28  can be repeated in any other configuration of hadronic , leptonic and invisible contributions to the z decays from the new physics process . \n let @xmath29 , @xmath30  and @xmath31  be the fractions of hadronic , leptonic and invisible final states produced by the new physics process under consideration . by definition , a final state which is neither hadronic nor leptonic is called invisible , therefore @xmath32 . \n the z lineshape parameters

limit on @xmath28  everywhere in this plane . the corresponding 95%c.l . \n limit on @xmath34 , the new physics contribution to the z total width , is displayed in fig . \n [ fig : plane]a . \n similarly , the limit on @xmath34 under the hypothesis that the new particle production contributes to hadronic and invisible final states , and to only one lepton flavour ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) , is shown in fig . \n [ fig : plane]b . \n ( 160,80 ) ( 0,-2 ) ( 71,70)(a ) ( 150,70)(b ) ( 80,-2 )    very constraining limits on @xmath34 are set all over the plane , but no absolute limit can be obtained when the new particle production leads to fractions in the hadronic , invisible and leptonic ( three flavours ) final states identical to the z branching fractions . in this case , only @xmath18 depends on @xmath28 . \n equations  ( 4 ) to  ( 7 ) no longer yield an independent determination of @xmath37  and @xmath38  with meaningful accuracy , because they all depend on the same linear combination of the two quantities . as a result \n , the new particle contribution to the z width can always be cancelled by the @xmath39 virtual contribution , if a sufficient amount of fine tuning takes place . \n whether or not this amount of fine tuning is acceptable would need different measurements and/or more theory to decide . \n the results obtained in section  [ sec : hadronic ] can be applied to a variety of new processes . in this letter , they are used to constrain the cross section of the gluino production at @xmath8 in the process @xmath40 displayed in fig . \n [ fig : gunion ] as a function of the gluino mass  @xcite . \n because this cross section is the product of the @xmath41 cross section and a term that describes the gluon splitting into a gluino pair , the uncertainties related to the weak loop corrections to @xmath14 were alleviated by using the measured  cross section in the prediction . \n when the gluino is light , the final state arising from this process is purely hadronic irrespective of the gluino decay and hadronization , and therefore contributes solely to the z hadronic decay width in all quark flavours . \n upper limit on the production cross section at @xmath8 can then be set at 67pb ( table  [ tab : limit ] ) . \n the corresponding lower limit on the gluino mass can be read off from the curve in fig . \n [ fig : gunion ] , and is ( including a 2% systematic uncertainty on @xmath27 ) @xmath42    ( 160,95 ) ( 25,-2 )    1.6 mm    this limit confirms the one obtained by aleph  @xcite with an independent study of the qcd colour factors , which makes no use of the absolute z decay rates , and that derived from the running of the strong coupling constant  @xcite , which checks in addition the compatibility of the @xmath26 measurements at all energy scales . because it would add fully independent information and because it would avoid the conservative choices of section  [ sec : hadronic ] to be made , \n a combination of these results would further consolidate the light gluino exclusion . \n for instance , a combination of the present limit and that of ref . \n @xcite yields lower limits on @xmath13  of 6.8@xmath6  and 5.7@xmath6  at 95% and 99.63%c.l . \n , respectively . \n the present limit is not affected by the criticisms put forward to invalidate the previous results . \n it is only if three different fine tuning processes took place , _ \n i.e. , _    1 . \n if other new particles were produced in association with the gluino with a cross section of the order of or larger than that of the gluino production , but still were not directly detected at lep ; 2 .   if these processes led to final states such that the overall fractions of hadronic , invisible and leptonic new decays be similar to those of the z decays , for all lepton and quark flavours ; 3 .   and \n if additional new physics yielded large negative virtual contributions to the z total decay width ( from the @xmath43 combination ) to exactly compensate this multiple new particle production ;    that the limit derived with the method presented in this letter would not hold . \n i leave it to the champions of the light gluino scenario to find a theory in which this devilish conspiracy could take place . \n a method to derive model - independent limits on new physics contributions to z decays has been presented . no general upper limit on the total z decay width \n could be obtained , but very stringent constraints apply when the final states produced by the new physics process of interest are known . in particular , conservative upper limits have been put on @xmath18 of 0.55 , 1.3 and 3.9 mev in the case of purely leptonic ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) , invisible and hadronic final states . \n 99 the lep

{"ContextTokens": 2739, "GeneratedTokens": 153, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , there was a great increase of interest in the study of the physics beyond the standard model , in particularly in the study of the supersymmetric grand unification theories ( susy guts ) . \n this interest was in particular stimulated by the new data due to lep1 and lep1.5 experiments . \n if one believes literally in all this data , especially in the @xmath1 measurements , one comes to the conclusion that neither the standard model ( sm ) nor the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are sufficient to explain the experimental results @xcite . \n one naturally has to turn to the other models . \n one of the most popular directions in the search for the new physics is the study of susy guts . \n unfortunately , one immediately encounters the problem of how to break supersymmetry ( susy ) . \n the most popular way is to use a hidden sector through which susy breaking is transferred to the visible world by means of supergravity ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a review ) . \n recently a new approach to break susy was developed@xcite . in this approach susy \n is broken dynamically and the effects of susy breaking are transferred from hidden sector to the visible world by means of gauge interactions . \n the natural question is whether one can use this mechanism to construct realistic susy gut theories @xcite . \n there are several tools one can use at present to decide whether the gut theory is realistic or not . \n one of the most powerful among them is the experimental limit on the proton lifetime . \n it was shown in ref.@xcite that simple extension of mimimal su(5 ) susy gut with the mechanism of dynamical susy breaking due to refs . \n @xcite leads to the too small lifetime of proton . \n consequently , this model is ruled out . \n the purpose of this note is to return once again to the analysis of the proton lifetime in the minimal su(5 ) susy gut with dynamical supersymmetry breaking due to dine and nelson , and to include the yukawa couplings in the analysis of ref . \n we study the influence of yukawa couplings , both of the 3rd generation and of the hiden sector , on the proton lifetime and masses of the color triplet higgs boson @xmath2 . \n we shall see that the inclusion of yukawa couplings increases the proton lifetime but not significantly . \n however , the model can not be ruled out at @xmath3 level . \n the model is not ruled out in a small window at small @xmath4 if one takes into account the uncertainties in the lep data for @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 qed and weak coupling constants at @xmath8 scale . \n the note is organised in the following way : first we use renormalization group ( rg ) equations for gauge couplings taking yukawa couplings into account . \n we then find the masses of color triplet bosons @xmath2 , depending on @xmath9 ( qcd coupling ) for different values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 . \n we then use the formula for proton lifetime from ref.@xcite to find the proton lifetime for different allowed by lep data values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath9 . \n our final results are depicted in figs.1 - 6 , thus giving the bounds on the possibility of using mechanism of refs.@xcite to break susy in su(5 ) gut model . \n let us briefly describe the model we are going to study ( we refer to the reader to refs.@xcite for details ) . \n the model is the mimimal su(5 ) susy gut plus the messenger superpotential @xmath12 here l and d , that carry quantum numbers of sm gauge groups and form together into @xmath13 of su(5 ) , are the messenger lepton and quark chiral superfields added to the model . \n s is a scalar chiral superfield singlet under the sm gauge groups . \n s transfers the supersymmetry breaking from hidden sector to the fields of the standard model . at the messenger scale @xmath14 tev \n the singlet s and its f - component get vacuum expectation values and susy breaks down . \n the heavy superfields l and d transfer the information of susy breaking to the fields of sm through their couplings to the sm gauge groups . \n the analysis of proton decays in this note is similiar to the work by carone and murayama@xcite . \n however , these authors did not take into account the influence of the yukawa couplings on the evolution of gauge couplings . \n we use below the rg equations for yukawa couplings that can be derived using ref.@xcite . \n first , we evolute the rg equaions from @xmath8 to @xmath15 using the sm @xmath16-functions and then from @xmath15 to @xmath17 ( taken as 100tev ) using the mssm ones . above @xmath17 we take into account the effects of the messenger fields : @xmath18 the evolution of yukawa couplings themselves are taken into account in one loop approximation and are carried out using the following rg equations ( for scales larger than @xmath17 ) : @xmath19 our notations are self - evident : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are yukawa couplings of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 to the corresponding higgs doublets in the miminal su(5 ) susy model . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the messenger yukawa coupling constants to the singlet s. we proceed then in the same way as in ref . \n we use the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 to determine the gut scale @xmath26 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 unify into @xmath27 , and then get the mismatch between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which should be attributed to the gut threshold effects , that are assumed to originate from the color triplet @xmath30 . \n we get the mass of the color - triplet higgs @xmath31 from its dependence on the threshold effects ( the detailed formulae can be found in @xcite ) . \n once @xmath31 is determined , we use the standard formulae for the proton lifetime(see ref . \n @xcite ) to find the partial width and to compare them with the current experimental bounds .    in our numerical evolution , we use the following boundary conditions . \n first , we made a standard choice of the masses of @xmath32-quark , @xmath0-lepton and the top - quark as : @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 gev . \n we do not depict uncertainties in these boundary conditions due to masses , since their influence on the results is not large . \n for the messenger yukawa couplings we take the largest possible values : @xmath36 if we choose the boundary conditions to be given by eq . \n ( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 unify into a common value at the gut scale . \n if inputs larger than those in ( [ 7 ] ) is taken , the messenger yukawa couplings will blow up at the gut scale . \n the boundary conditions for gauge couplings are determined from lep data@xcite : @xmath37 for the qcd coupling we use @xmath38 @xcite  the number that incorporates both low energy data and lep1 data . \n all the gauge couplings are taken within @xmath3 variations in our estimations . \n our main results are depicted in figs . 1 - 6 . \n first , we depict the mass of the color - triplet , @xmath31 , as a function of @xmath9 for different @xmath4 . \n these results are depicted in fig . 1 - 3 for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n we take the lowest bound of @xmath4 as 0.85 . below this \n bound the yukawa couplings will blow up at the gut scale . \n this lowest bound can be achieved only when the yukawa couplings are included in the rg analyses . \n we see that for reasonable values of @xmath4 , yukawa couplings of messenger quarks and leptons actually do not influence @xmath31 greatly . \n however , when we consider the different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 within @xmath3 variations , we see that @xmath31 can change quite significantly as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n the most favored @xmath31 is gained when @xmath5 is taken at its upper bound while @xmath6 the lower one . \n next , we consider the decay rate of a typical process @xmath39 . this mode was argued in ref . \n @xcite to be the most appropriate one in analysing proton decay bound in susy gut . \n the results are shown in figs . \n we see that the allowed region of @xmath40 and @xmath4 depends on the inputs @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n inclusion of the usual yukawa couplings in rg equations improves the situation with the proton lifetime . on the other hand , inclusion of the messenger yukawa couplings \n even worses the situation slightly . as the current experimental bound@xcite of proton decay lifetime \n is concerned , the only window where the model survives is the region of small @xmath4 combined with large @xmath5 and small @xmath6 as input . \n our general conclusions are that , first , the inclusion of yukawa couplings does not lead to significant changes in the mass of color triplet and the allowed parameter space for the model we consider . \n second , the allowed parameter space , color triplet mass and proton lifetime seem to be quite sensitive to exact values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath41 scale . \n the authors thank m. shifman for useful discussion . \n 99 j. hewett , talk at workshop on heavy flavors , technion , december 1995 . \n j. ellis , invited talk at lp95 : international symposium on lepton photon interactions ( ihep ) , beijing , p.r . \n china , 10 -

{"ContextTokens": 3432, "GeneratedTokens": 217, "SynthesizedBody": "the large abundance spread seen in the red giant branch ( rgb ) of @xmath0 cen has long been recognized as one of the unique features of this peculiar milky way globular cluster . \n recent photometric analyses of the @xmath0 cen rgb ( e.g. , lee et al .  1999 ; pancino et al . \n 2000 , pfbpz hereafter ; majewski et al .  2000a , \n m00a hereafter ) indicate a metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) stretching from [ fe / h]@xmath9 to perhaps as high as [ fe / h]=@xmath10 . \n this spread , together with clear evidence for a 2 - 4 gyr age spread ( hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) as well as other unusual characteristics relating to its large mass , elongated shape , and internal and external dynamics ( see summary in m00a ) , suggests that @xmath0 cen may represent an important transitional link between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies . \n here we revisit the m00a analysis of the @xmath0 cen mdf with the addition of new membership data for correcting sample contamination and an improved photometric metallicity calibration . \n we have imaged eight pointings of @xmath0 cen in the washington @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters with the swope 1-m telescope and a site ccd ( fig .  1 ) . \n the data were reduced using standard routines , and daophot ii and allframe ( stetson 1994 ) was used for psf photometry . \n our resulting catalogue of stars is not complete in the core ( see fig .  1 ) due to crowding and a conservative cut on stellar profile shape . \n analysis was further limited to stars with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mag , reducing the catalogue of 223,110 photometered stars to 52,923 stars . outside the core ( @xmath14 ) , our data are complete to past the main sequence turnoff ( fig .  2 ) . \n to create an @xmath0 cen mdf , we first isolate its upper giant branch ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to limit our analysis to where we have the greatest resolution in photometric metallicities , and to reduce contamination from asymptotic giant branch stars ( fig .  2 ) . \n this cut and the photometric error cut above combine to make the present analysis much more conservative than what we presented in m00a  our goal here is to search for mdf peaks that would tend to be washed out under the more liberal criteria used previously . \n while the selected cmd region is dominated by @xmath0 cen rgb stars , we want to remove contamination by milky way field stars . \n the @xmath3 filter samples the strength of the mgh+mgb feature at 5150 , which is greatly enhanced in dwarf stars ( fig .  3 ) . via the ( @xmath17 , @xmath5 ) \n diagram ( fig . \n 3b ) , we can eliminate most foreground dwarf stars from the giant star sample ( majewski et al . \n remaining field giants are removed statistically (  3 ) . \n our mdf is based on photometric metallicities derived for @xmath0 cen stars as shown in fig . \n 3 . to the extent that magnesium tracks iron \n , we can derive rough [ fe / h ] estimates for @xmath0 cen giant stars due to the secondary sensitivity of ( @xmath5 ) to metallicity . \n isometallicity curves in the two - color diagram ( fig . \n 3 ) are rgb loci from synthetic colors ( paltoglou & bell 1994 ) calibrated to fit stars with spectroscopically determined [ fe / h ] from suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) as discussed in majewski et al . \n ( 2000b ) . \n stars coded by these photometric metallicities are plotted in the rgb cmd of @xmath0 cen in fig . \n @xmath18 isochrones ( yi et al .  2001 ) for old ( 13 - 15 gyr ) giants , converted to the washington system by matching the output @xmath19 and log @xmath20 from @xmath18 to the corresponding values in the tabulated synthetic washington colors by bessell ( 2001 ) , are also provided for comparison ( fig . \n the initial mdf is constructed using these derived photometric metallicities ( fig . \n the @xmath18 isochrones shown in fig . \n 4 match metallicities that correspond to major mdf peaks in fig .  5 . \n in general , the derived photometric abundances for stars track the position of isochrones of corresponding metallicity in the cmd , but of course there is scatter . \n some scatter is due to inherent limitations of photometric abundances combined with observational errors , but a significant source of scatter may derive from the intrinsic 1 dex spread in [ mg / fe ] in @xmath0 cen giants ( smith et al . \n 2000 ) . nevertheless , we believe the data to be sufficiently reliable to reveal gross characteristics of the mdf . \n we could further limit the mdf to only known @xmath0 cen members , but these are a small fraction of our data set and , moreover , this smaller subsample is not unbiased with respect to [ fe / h ] . \n however , we can correct our mdf statistically by taking advantage of the available cluster membership data to scale each metallicity bin by the proportion of @xmath0 cen members found among stars in that bin having membership data ( fig . \n spectroscopic membership data are derived from suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) , norris et al . \n ( 1996 ) , and our own work . \n our spectra , centered on the calcium infrared triplet , were obtained with the las campanas dupont 2.5 m @xmath21 modspec ( see m00a ) and the ctio 4-m @xmath21 hydra / loral 3k . in total , we have obtained 68 new spectra of candidate rgb stars in the fig . 4 sample , among which we identify 49 members . \n additional membership data were obtained by matching our data to the proper motion catalogue of van leeuwen et al . \n ( 2000 ) , and adopting as members all stars with @xmath22 probabilities from that work . using all membership criteria , a total of 176 stars out of 215 stars in our fig . \n 4 sample were found to be @xmath0 cen members ( fig . \n the mdf corrected by fractional membership is shown in fig . \n 6 .    with the intention of reducing errors in derived [ fe / h ] \n , we have adopted a much more conservative sample selection here than we used in m00a . \n the result is an mdf that is less smoothly varying , with narrower , more defined peaks , than our previous mdf . \n no doubt the width of the peaks are still exaggerated by observational errors , but they have now been reduced sufficiently that the new corrected mdf ( fig . 6 ) shows three distinct peaks at [ fe / h ] = @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . \n these peaks agree well with peaks identified by pfbpz at [ fe / h]=@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , and by lee et al . \n ( 1999 ) at [ fe / h]=@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 , and the overall range of [ fe / h ] is consistent with the spread found by norris et al . \n ( 1996 ) . however , like lee et al . , while we also find evidence for @xmath0 cen members as metal rich as [ fe / h]@xmath27 , fig . \n 6 does not show an additional mdf _ peak _ at [ fe / h ] = @xmath10 , corresponding to the metal rich ,  rgb - a \" giant branch identified by pfbpz . \n surely some of the most metal rich rgb candidates from fig . 5 may have been accidentally  corrected out \" of the mdf in fig . \n 6 as a result of bad luck in finding no members among the statistically small number of stars with these metallicities available for the membership correction analysis . \n indeed , the impact that small number statistics can have on the correction process is demonstrated by the results of our previous analysis ( m00a ) in which we had found almost _ no _ @xmath0 cen members among any star with derived photometric [ fe / h ] @xmath28 , which resulted in a corrected mdf terminating near _ that _ abundance limit and completely eliminating the now obvious @xmath8 dex peak from that previous analysis . \n but even given the lesson of this experience , the more likely reason that we do not see as high a relative frequency of metal rich stars in the fig . \n 6 mdf compared to the frequency identified in the pfbpz survey is because , as these authors point out , their metal - rich  rgb - a \" stars are concentrated to the inner 6 arcmin of the cluster , a radius within which the present analysis faces severe incompleteness . \n however , we have found that in a less conservatively selected subsample that admits more stars in the cluster core we can see the  rgb - a \" in the cmd ( indeed , a trace of it can be seen in figs . 2 and 4 ) , \n and we have even confirmed radial velocity membership for eight of these metal - rich stars ( almost all within 9 arcmin )  unfortunately they are not admitted to the subsample under discussion here . \n thus , the mdf we have constructed in fig . \n 6 must not be taken to represent the mdf of the core of @xmath0 cen , but rather it more closely approximates the mdf outside the core . \n we note the existence of at least one further bias in our mdf , which relates to age / metallicity differences in the fractional lifetime of rgb stars beyond our @xmath17 color limit . \n we hope to address this in future work . \n it is well known that @xmath0 cen does not conform with most globular clusters in a variety of ways ( see m00a ) : it is the most massive cluster , it shows substantial rotation and flattening , and , of course , it has a large metallicity spread . \n several theories about the origin of @xmath0 cen have been proposed , including that it is a rare cluster that ( for some reason ) encountered substantial self - enrichment , that it is the product of the merger of two stellar systems , that it is the remains of a disrupted dwarf spheroidal , and even that it derived from some amalgam of these possibilities . \n that @xmath0 cen seems to have at least _ three _ primary enrichment peaks and an overall [ fe / h ] spread from at least @xmath290.4 to @xmath292.0 dex , coupled with claims for an age spread of up to 4 gyr in the cluster s main sequence turn - off ( hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) , makes a simple two cluster merger hypothesis unlikely ( see also norris et al . \n confronted by the difficulties of multiple metallicity populations and motivated by the relative spatial distributions of these populations , pfbpz propose a more complicated scenario  the merger of two systems with at least one of the systems having undergone self - enrichment and sinking into the center of @xmath0 cen . for the merged , self - enriched entity , which is intended to account for the two intermediate as well as the most metal rich populations , pfbpz propose a giant molecular cloud or a gas - rich protocluster . \n however , a number of aspects of @xmath0 cen lead one to suspect its closer association with dwarf galaxies . for example , the  peaky \" mdf of @xmath0 cen bears great resemblance to the burst - like , multiple populations seen in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( grebel 1997 ) . \n interestingly , the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy shows a similarly large ( and punctuated ) spread in [ fe / h ] to @xmath0 cen ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) . for a variety of reasons , including the similarity in mdfs as well as the fact that the mass of @xmath0 cen is comparable to that of the globular m54 , which appears to be the core of sgr , it has been proposed ( e.g. , lee et al .  1999 , m00a ) that @xmath0 cen may be the remnant nucleus of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy analogous to the sgr system . as pointed out by shetrone et al . \n ( 2001 ) , for this model of @xmath0 cen formation to work , the cluster would have to be a daughter product of a large dwarf galaxy like sgr , since the heavy - element abundance patterns of smaller , dsph systems like ursa minor , draco and sextans differ from that of @xmath0 cen , which shows a large enhancement of s to r - process elements with increasing metallicity ( smith et al . \n 2000 ) . on the other hand , the apparent greater concentration of more metal rich stars observed in @xmath0 cen by pfbpz mimics a trend seen in dwarf galaxies both great ( like fornax  grebel & stetson 1998 ) and small ( like sculptor  e.g. , majewski et al . \n 1999 ) . \n apart from the actual difficulty of two clusters merging , which requires relative velocities of @xmath30 km s@xmath31 ( thurl & johnston , this proceedings ) , the merger hypothesis suffers from at least one other unlikelihood : if @xmath0 cen were the result of the merger of two cluster - like systems , the parent clusters would _ each _ have to have been among the largest clusters in the galaxy , and even if only the metal poor part of @xmath0 cen began its life as a traditional cluster , it too would be at the extreme end of the galactic cluster mass scale . \n somehow it is easier to accept that the peculiar properties of @xmath0 cen are the _ result _ of its large mass , rather than that its large mass and other peculiar properties were accumulated as the result of a series of unlikely occurences . \n indeed , the present orbit of @xmath0 cen ( i.e. , barreling retrograde within and through the galactic plane \n dinescu et al . \n 1999 ) is one that undoubtedly subjects it to substantial tidal stripping . \n therefore , not only was @xmath0 cen almost certainly larger and even more like a dwarf galaxy in the past , but there is every expectation that it has led a battered life much like its sgr counterpart . \n evidence for tidal tails extending from @xmath0 cen have been reported by leon et al . \n ( 2000 ) . \n we have attempted to present a more accurate representation of the mdf for @xmath0 cen . however , as pointed out by majewski et al . \n ( 2001 ) , if a system has endured substantial mass loss over its lifetime , one must be wary of interpreting the presently observed mdf to represent the true enrichment history of that stellar system . \n older ( and more extended ) populations will have had more time to have been stripped , and especially in the case of @xmath0 cen , whose planar orbit has almost certainly evolved considerably , that mass loss rate may have been highly variable over the enrichment timescale . \n majewski , s. , patterson , r. , dinescu , d. , johnson , w. , ostheimer , j. , kunkel , w. , & palma , c. 2000a , in  the galactic halo : from globular clusters to field stars , ed . \n a. noels , et al . \n ( li ` ege : univ . li ` ege ) , 619 [ m00a ]", "StartTimeOffset": 2581557987744, "RequestID": "deb46e37258a445d1bc993053eac7994f3dfe1d5", "TotalTokens": 3649}

[ sec : quarks ] , correspond to a slice along which @xmath3 is fixed to its value in our universe , while @xmath4 is adjusted in order to keep the average mass of the lightest baryon flavor multiplet fixed to what it is in our world . \n we only consider worlds with at most three light quarks , not due to any theoretical prejudice but simply because those are the only worlds for which we can reliably estimate baryon masses , by using first - order perturbation theory in the breaking of flavor @xmath6 symmetry , with the corresponding parameters extracted from the spectrum of baryon masses in our own world . \n dimensional analysis suggests that all scales @xmath7 relevant to nuclear physics including the baryon masses as well as the masses of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances that determine nuclear binding energies - wave.] should vary roughly as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the light quark mass variation being considered , and the superscript @xmath13 indicates the value of the parameter in our own world . since we consider @xmath12 s only up to order @xmath14 mev , we expect @xmath15 s of only a few percent . \n nuclear structure is exquisitely sensitive to the baryons masses : for instance , the @xmath16 baryon could be as little as 20 mev heavier than the proton and the neutron and still not form stable nuclei . \n the reason for this is well understood , and can be seen even in a simple fermi gas model of the nucleus @xcite . \n we therefore keep the variation in the baryon masses ( which we can compute using perturbation theory ) and ignore the quark - mass dependence of the nuclear binding energies ( which can not be reliably computed at the moment ) . \n it should also be pointed out that some of the universes that have stable forms of hydrogen and carbon might never efficiently synthesize those elements . \n previous research has explored the effects on nucleosynthesis of varying the light quark masses @xcite , but mapping out the history of universes different from our own and determining for which of them the elements required for organic chemistry never become sufficiently abundant to sustain life anywhere , seems too ambitious a task , given our current level of understanding . \n congenial worlds are green , and uncongenial worlds are red . \n white areas can not be definitively classified at this time.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we estimate nuclear masses as functions of the baryon masses using either analog nuclei @xcite or a generalized semi - empirical mass formula . \n we can then check for the stability of nuclei against various strong and weak decay processes . \n this allows us to categorize worlds as congenial or uncongenial , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : triangles ] . \n the region marked ( 1 ) in fig . \n [ fig : triangles ] correspond to worlds like ours , with nuclei made of one positively charged and one neutral baryon . \n the region marked ( 2 ) corresponds to worlds made of a neutral and a negatively charged baryon . \n the region marked ( 3 ) ( called the `` baryonic zoo '' in @xcite ) corresponds to worlds in which more than two species of baryons can form stable nuclei . \n it is difficult to characterize these worlds in detail , but worlds in which flavor @xmath6 is nearly unbroken are very likely uncongenial , because heavy stable nuclei would tend to be electrically neutral . \n this implies that there probably is a lower anthropic bound on @xmath17 : if the mass of the @xmath2 quark were smaller than its observed value in our world by more than about an order of magnitude , it is unlikely that a stable form of carbon would exist . \n only the lightest lepton will be stable against weak decays , and the next lepton will not have a long enough lifetime to be relevant to chemistry unless there is a very near degeneracy in mass . for simplicity , we shall refer in general to the lightest lepton as the `` electron . '' \n clearly , there must be an anthropic upper bound on the electron mass , when other physical parameters are held fixed . \n in particular , the bohr radius must be greater than the size of the nucleus for long - lived atoms to exist at all . since the bohr radius @xmath18 is inversely proportional to @xmath3 , and \n since in our world @xmath19 m , while nuclei have a size of order @xmath20 m , worlds in which the electron is more than @xmath21 times heavier than it is in our world are anthropically forbidden . \n a more restrictive constraint on the electron mass comes from avoiding too large a spontaneous rate for the weak fusion process @xmath22 . as is well known from the study of muon - catalyzed fusion @xcite \n , a heavier electron would enhance the rate of fusion due to the greater overlap of the wavefunctions of the protons in a hydrogen molecule . \n a back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests that if the electron were more than about two orders of magnitude heavier than it is , fusion would prevent a mole of water from ever cooling below its boiling point .    the best constraint on the electron mass , however , seems to come from avoiding the instability of nuclei to decays mediated by the capture of an atomic electron . \n if we keep track of the dependence on @xmath3 in the analysis of @xcite , we see that there will be no stable form of hydrogen unless @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the binding energy of the triton . \n a bound of the same order is obtained from requiring that heavy nuclei not be unstable to weak neutron emission @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the binding energy per nucleon for nuclei at to bottom of the valley of stability , which for medium to heavy nuclei @xmath27 mev . \n therefore , the stability of heavy nuclei also requires @xmath28 mev .    whether there might also be a _ \n lower _ anthropic bound on the electron mass is a more difficult question . the congeniality bounds of sec . \n [ sec : quarks ] for worlds where @xmath29 came from stability of carbon isotopes against @xmath30 decay , but these would change little even if the electron were massless . lowering the electron mass would decrease the energy of ionization of hydrogen and other elements , which would change the temperature of recombination and alter the late history of the universe . \n it would also change the temperature scale of organic processes . \n it is , however , difficult to translate these considerations into sharp statements about which universes would contain intelligent life and which would not . \n * acknowledgements * : the author thanks allan adams and bob jaffe for discussions leading to the results of sec . \n [ sec : leptons ] , and gilad perez for permission to use fig . \n [ fig : triangles ] . this work was supported in part by the u.s . \n department of energy under contract de - fg03 - 92er40701 . \n s.  weinberg , phys . \n * 59 * , 2607 ( 1987 ) . \n a.  g.  riess _ et al . \n _ [ supernova search team collaboration ] , astron .  j.   * 116 * , 1009 ( 1998 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph/9805201 ] ; s.  perlmutter _ et al . \n _ [ supernova cosmology project collaboration ] , astrophys .  j.   * 517 * , 565 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph/9812133 ] . \n m.  r.  douglas and s.  kachru , rev . \n * 79 * , 733 ( 2007 ) [ arxiv : hep - th/0610102 ] . \n r.  l.  jaffe , a.  jenkins and i.  kimchi , phys . \n d * 79 * , 065014 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0809.1647 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n g.  perez , physics * 2 * , 21 ( 2009 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2587879891890, "RequestID": "74afa0ec89eb9ec7b698ed8e77cdf3622dbdfa40", "TotalTokens": 4053}
{"ContextTokens": 3672, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "the rare earth nitrides ( re - n ) have recently attracted attention following theoretical advances that have yielded credible band structures in these strongly correlated materials.@xcite however , despite their simple rock - salt structure and their strongly localized 4__f _ _ states there are disagreements among various theoretical treatments regarding the nature of their band structures in either the ambient - temperature paramagnetic state or their magnetic ground states . \n interestingly , among the predictions one finds that some may be half metals@xcite which are of interest for spintronics applications , though their magnetic order is limited to temperatures below 70  k. however , even at ambient temperature the lattice constant varies systematically across the series , leading in turn to a systematically varying band structure and band gap . \n thus the re - n compounds may prove useful in a range of electronic and electro - optic applications . \n the ionicity of these materials is manifest in their band structures , so that their valence bands are of n 2__p _ _ and the conduction bands re 5__d _ _ , 6__s _ _ character . in the presence of \n partially filled re 4__f _ _ levels the exchange interaction shifts the spin - split conduction and valence band edges in the opposite sense , reducing the majority spin gap while the minority spin gap opens.@xcite clearly a sufficiently large shift will reduce the majority spin gap to zero , resulting in a half metal . besides the strong correlation effects affecting the 4__f _ _ \n states , the gap is also affected by the usual underestimate of the gap by the local density approximation ( lda ) . \n the latter is primarily due to long - range coulomb contribution which is over - screened by the electron - gas screening used in lda . in the present case , the conduction band minimum consists of re-@xmath0 states and the underestimated gap can be corrected by shifting the re-_d _ states upward within the lsda+__u _ _ method by introducing a @xmath1 even though the underlying physics is rather different from the hubbard @xmath2 shifts.@xcite the calculations require experimental input concerning the gap in order to fix a value for the empirical parameter @xmath1 . in this paper \n we present transmission data that establish the optical gaps of gdn in both magnetic states , which then allow us to adjust the computed band structure . \n the experimental description of re - ns is far from clear . \n although their nacl structure is well established,@xcite there is remarkably little consensus in the literature concerning their physical properties . \n most are known to be magnetically ordered at low temperature,@xcite though there remains much uncertainty about transition temperatures , saturation moments and even in some cases whether there is magnetic order at all and whether it is ferro- or antiferro - magnetic.@xcite there is also debate about their temperature - dependent conductivity , with specific samples of even nominally the same composition claimed variously as a metal , semimetal or semiconductor.@xcite nitrogen vacancies are common , and even in a material that is fundamentally a semiconductor they may dope the material to degenerate carrier densities.@xcite    optical transmission experiments have the potential to settle these questions by providing a measurement of the optical ( i.e. , minimum _ direct _ ) band gap , but here also the few reported measurements have provided ambiguous results . \n very early studies of the entire range of rare earth nitrides ( excepting the radioactive pm ) were based on powder samples , which dictated that only diffuse reflection measurements could be made.@xcite those data show only a weak dip in their diffuse absorption ( @xmath3 ) , with enhanced absorption at energies both larger and smaller than the quoted gap , which was interpreted as resulting from competition between inter - band and free - carrier contributions to the optical conductivity . \n the gaps , all near 1  ev , were taken as the weak minima between the two competing contributions to the diffuse absorption , rather than by observations of any clear absorption edges . \n in contrast gaps of 2 to over 4  ev@xcite are likely to be associated with severe oxidation ; gd@xmath4o@xmath5 has a 5.2  ev gap.@xcite we find that unprotected films become transparent insulators within seconds after exposure to air.@xcite the propensity of the re nitrides to oxidize joins the presence of n vacancies as the phenomena most responsible for ambiguous historical results . \n gdn , with its half - filled 4__f _ _ shell , is by far the most thoroughly investigated of the re - ns . \n it has the highest curie temperature among the re - ns,@xcite with reports as high as 90  k.@xcite we and others have recently reported a resistivity showing a magnitude and temperature dependence that is characteristic of a semiconductor above t@xmath6 , followed by a rapid fall as the temperature is lowered into the ferromagnetic phase.@xcite however , below 25k the resistivity again begins to increase in a form consistent with a reduced - gap semiconducting ferromagnetic state.@xcite    we recently reported visible - near ir measurements on gdn demonstrating a clear ambient - temperature absorption edge near 1  ev , but without sufficient data below 1  ev to make a reliable estimate of the gap.@xcite in this paper we extend transmission measurements to lower energy , which has permitted an unambiguous determination of the optical gap . \n more importantly the measurements have been completed at temperatures from ambient down to 6  k and signal clear band structure changes at the curie temperature . \n thin films of gdn were grown , as described in more detail earlier,@xcite by deposition of gd from an electron beam heated source in the presence of @xmath7  mbar of pure nitrogen gas . \n the 200 nm - thick film was capped with @xmath8200  nm gan , which we have shown to be an effective barrier to reaction with the atmosphere.@xcite note that in gan the inter - band edge is 3.4  ev ,  @xcite and there is only a small , approximately energy - independent absorption in the energy range probed in this study . \n the gdn in the present study contains crystallites with diameters of about 8 nm and has a resistivity of 0.15  @xmath9  cm at 300  k , rising through a peak of 0.25  @xmath9  cm at a curie temperature of 66  k and thereafter falling to a minimum of 0.18  @xmath9  cm . a carrier density of @xmath10  @xmath11 at 300 \n k has been estimated by noting that the mean - free - path can not be larger than the radius of the crystallites . \n spectral measurements in the range of 0.2 - 2  ev were performed with a bomem model da8 fourier transform spectrometer using films on sapphire substrates . for variable - temperature data the film was mounted in a flow - through cryostat with polyethylene windows . \n the multilayer system , sapphire - gdn - gan , shows complex interference . \n fringes with a periodicity of about 6  @xmath12 ( @xmath80.1  mev ) associated with the substrate have been simply smoothed , leaving weak interference associated with the film and capping layers . despite the weak fringes the band edges are strikingly clear , permitting an unambiguous determination of the optical gap and its red shift in the ferromagnetic phase . \n figure  [ fig1 ] shows the frequency - dependent transmission at temperatures of 6 , 75 and 300  k. turning first to the 300  k data it can be seen that there is a clear onset of absorption just above 1 ev . \n there is no evidence of sub - gap absorption at lower energies , with the transmission flat except for interference fringes that modulate the transmission by 3% . \n the gap of @xmath13  ev is estimated as the intersection of the frequency - independent transmission below the edge and the extrapolation from the inflection point centered on the edge . at 75 \n k ( immediately above t@xmath6 ) the transmission is little changed from 300  k , showing merely a 1 - 2% fall in the low - frequency transmission and a changing interference pattern associated with contraction and with the temperature dependence of the optical constants in the film and substrate . \n most importantly there is only a very weakly shifted inter - band edge as compared to the results at 300 k. in contrast the ferromagnetic phase , at 6  k , shows a very significant change in both the absorption edge and the sub - gap transmission . \n a very clear tail extends to a new edge at lower energy , which can be seen much more clearly in a plot of the difference between the transmissions at 75 and at 6  k , in the inset of fig . \n using again the intersection of extrapolated data above and below the edge we find a gap of @xmath14  ev in the ferromagnetic state . \n the lower - energy edge enhances the refractive index below the gap , which then increases the reflectivity and is in turn responsible for the reduced sub - gap transmission .    in order to estimate the energy - dependent absorption coefficient , @xmath15 , across the edge note that , with the neglect of interference enhancement within the gdn film , the transmission coefficient @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the thickness and @xmath19 the reflectivity of the multi - layer . \n figure [ fig3 ] shows the absorption coefficient estimated using this equation , replacing the factor @xmath20 by the transmission in the sub - gap region . \n it is significant that the absorption coefficient rises steeply to over @xmath21  @xmath12 . \n such strong absorption is typical of inter - band direct transitions , and is orders of magnitude larger than is seen at indirect transitions . \n as discussed above there exist historical data suggesting that the optical gap in gdn is 0.98 ev.@xcite it is interesting that the same paper reported what was regarded as anomalous optical data on one sample of gdn , apparently with a lower - than - typical n deficiency and thus weaker free carrier absorption , in which the diffuse absorption showed an onset close to that reported here . \n the paper also made the claim that there was no shift of the edge in the ferromagnetic phase , but that the sub - gap absorption increased significantly . \n although no low temperature data were presented , that description suggests a behaviour similar to the present report , except that the data were apparently not extended to the red - shifted edge . \n more recently there has been a report of band shifts in gdn observed in x - ray magnetic circular dichroism data.@xcite the conduction - band density - of - states ( cbdos ) at the gd l@xmath22 edge was seen to red - shift by a few hundred mev in the ferromagnetic state . \n those data measure the cb maximum relative to the gd @xmath23 core level , so they are not directly comparable to the present inter - band data . however , it is interesting that the red shift of the gd 2p - to - cbdos is of very similar magnitude to the inter - band edge red shift reported here . \n the very clear optical gaps that we report relate directly to the lsda+__u _ _ computed band structure of larson _ et al._,@xcite in which the same red shift of 0.4  ev is predicted between the para- and ferro - magnetic phases . \n however , the absolute magnitudes of the gaps are in disagreement with our data . \n the experimental optical gap of busch _ et al_. @xcite was used in that calculation as a means to fine tune the gap . \n this is done by choosing a @xmath24 parameter that is applied to the empty gd 5__d _ _ levels , shifting them up . \n the gap , 0.98  ev in the paramagnetic state , was assumed to correspond to the average of the majority- and minority - spin gaps in the ground state for which the calculation was made . from this \n they fix @xmath1 at 6.4  ev . using the same method and software we have recalculated the gdn band structure to fit the new data . in a remarkable agreement between theory and experiment we find that a choice of @xmath24 = 8.0  ev leads to a majority - spin gap of 0.91  ev and an average gap of 1.30  ev , which correspond to our measurements within their uncertainties . \n figure [ fig4 ] shows the band structure calculated with that parameter ; note that gdn is an indirect - gap semiconductor with the direct gap at x and an indirect ( @xmath25 ) gap of 0.43  ev ( 0.98  ev ) in the ferromagnetic ( paramagnetic ) state . \n it is important to explore whether the representation of the gap in the paramagnetic state as the average spin - resolved ferromagnetic gap is realistic . \n to test the idea we have carried out calculations of both ferromagnetically - aligned and non - collinear random - aligned spins in a @xmath26 supercell of the conventional cubic fcc cell , containing 32 atoms . \n this calculation was done within the atomic sphere approximation and shifts were simply added to the gd-@xmath27 and gd-@xmath28 bands mimicking the full - fledged lsda+__u _ _ ferromagnetic state as closely as possible . with this approach the average gap of spin up ( 1.12  ev ) and \n spin down ( 1.58  ev ) gaps came out to be 1.35  ev in the ferromagnetically - aligned case . \n the simple shift approach compared to the lsda+__u _ _ has as a side - effect that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) at @xmath29 ( of rocksalt ) equals the vbm at @xmath30 , making the direct and indirect gap equal . \n however , the calculation clearly illustrates the relation between the gap of a disordered spin arrangement and the average of spin up and spin down gaps of the ferromagnetic system as a proof of principle . using the same shifts in the supercell with non - collinear spins , \n the gap was found to be 1.30  ev , as can be seen in fig . \n [ fig5 ] , which is indeed close to but slightly less than the average of the ferromagnetic gaps . \n the reason for the small discrepancy is that the calculation was performed for only one representative random sample and the size of the cell is still relatively small to represent a random configuration . \n in fact , it had a net residual magnetic moment of 1.44 @xmath31/gd in the cell . \n so , one could say it is still 20  % magnetized instead of completely demagnetized . \n thus it has only 80  % of the upward shift in gap from the ferromagnetic case , i.e. 1.30  ev . \n the bands in fig . \n [ fig5 ] are color coded according to their spin content . \n red means 100  % majority spin , blue means 100  % minority spin and bands with mixed spin character have the appropriate mix of blue and red . \n one may see that the valence band maximum still has 100  % majority spin character but the conduction band minimum has a mixed character , the lower one being slightly more majority and the next one being slightly more minority spin in character . \n this direct way of simulating the paramagnetic system would require larger cells to be fully converged . \n nevertheless , it provides a direct test that the gap is indeed larger for a system with randomly oriented spins compared to the gap for the ferromagnetic system and provides additional support to our procedure of estimating the gap of the paramagnetic system as the average of majority and minority spin gaps in the ferromagnetic state . \n we have reported an unambiguous signature of the direct optical gap in a rare - earth nitride . \n the absorption edge is seen as a rapid loss of transmitted intensity as the photon energy rises through the edge , and is accompanied by an energy - independent transmission indicating no significant absorption below the edge . \n the direct gap is seen at 1.3  ev in the paramagnetic phase at 300  k , and on entering the ferromagnetic phase it falls to 0.9  ev . \n the red shift of 0.4  ev is in good agreement with recent lsda+__u _ _ calculations and a slight fine tuning of the empirical @xmath24 parameter used in those calculations allows us to reproduce the absolute values of the gaps in the band structure calculation . \n the procedure of estimating the gap of the paramagnetic state as the average of majority and minority spin gaps in the ferromagnetic state was justified by a separate calculation for a system with randomly oriented spins . \n it is significant that earlier predictions concerning the conducting character of the entire range of re nitrides were based on the value of @xmath24 in gdn , adjusted so as to reproduce the earlier incorrect optical gap of 0.98  ev in the paramagnetic state . \n similar fine - tuning readjustments of band structures will be required also for other re nitrides . \n the macdiarmid institute for advanced materials and nanotechnology is supported by a grant from the new zealand tertiary education commission under the centre of research excellence fund . \n the work at cwru was supported by the army research office under grant number w911nf-06 -

of - transit variation . \n when computing dsp , we always use the tfa code in the signal reconstruction mode to get a better estimate on this parameter . \n properties of the injected signal and the number of detections are listed in table  2 . \n we note that the synthetic signal has a flat out - of - transit part and a trapeze shape with rather long ingress / egress durations . \n the condition of detection is given by a cutoff imposed on dsp . \n the value of this cutoff is large enough to eliminate false alarms ( see sect .  4 ) . \n we see that there is a highly significant increase in the detection probability due to the application of tfa . \n this increase is especially striking when the top 500 bright stars are tested . \n these are the ones that are most seriously affected by systematics related to saturation effects ( see above ) . \n we note that the detection ratio can be slightly increased ( from @xmath34% to @xmath35% ) if we choose templates only from this brighter set of stars . \n crrc tfa & @xmath15 & @xmath36 & @xmath36[% ] + 0 & @xmath33 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + 1 & @xmath33 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + 0 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + 1 & @xmath41 & @xmath44 & @xmath34 + \n by `` false alarms '' we mean those cases when the detection statistics indicate the presence of a signal , but the probability distribution of the statistics ( derived on pure noise ) shows that the observed value may also occur due to a random event and the probability of this to happen is `` greater than we would like to '' . in assessing fap we resort to direct statistical tests , in which we generate pure gaussian time series on the time base of the observed light curves . \n we analyze these artificial time series and count the number of cases when dsp exceeds a prescribed limit . in this way we get estimates on faps for a given dataset when \n tfa and bls are used . \n the results of the tests are presented in table  3 . \n several conclusions can be drawn from this table . \n first of all , as expected , application of tfa introduces correlation in the time series . \n this increases fap by a substantial amount . \n second , larger number of data points results in a decrease of fap . \n third , larger number of templates leads to stronger correlation , and therefore , to an increase of fap . \n fourth , although increasing the number of data points decreases fap , it is present in a relative high value even for higher dsp cutoff values ( when we already expect a visible sign of the ( fake ) transit in the folded / binned light curve .    in an attempt to reduce fap , the following method is suggested . by using several tfa runs , corresponding to various template numbers , we compute dsp values for the given database . due to the way the template sets are constructed , \n these results are expected to be largely independent from each other . in a conservative approach of signal detection \n , we require the signal to be present in all these runs . in the primary selection of transit candidates we require only that the dip is negative ( i.e. , corresponding to dimming ) and that @xmath45 . \n the result of this multiple template fap filtering is shown in the lower three lines of table  3 . \n we see that the method is very effective already with three different tfa runs . for example , even for the sparsely sampled field # 127 , with three or more different tfa runs we can filter out false alarms with a probability better than 99.9% for signals with dsp@xmath46 . \n lrrrcrrr & & & + @xmath47  : & 5 & 6 & 7 & & 5 & 6 & 7 + @xmath48 & 68 & 7 & 0 & & 26 & 3 & 1 + a & 827 & 400 & 107 & & 258 & 24 & 2 + b & 856 & 523 & 168 & & 306 & 31 & 6 + c & 842 & 560 & 220 & & 394 & 42 & 3 + d & 890 & 638 & 328 & & 474 & 60 & 5 + ab & 386 & 112 & 9 & & 73 & 2 & 0 + abc & 184 & 38 & 1 & & 25 & 0 & 0 + abcd & 97 & 21 & 1 & & 14 & 0 & 0 + \n signal reconstruction is an essential ( but optional ) part of signal processing when tfa is used . \n this is because we do not know _ a priori _ which part of the observed signal comes from the systematics and which one from the true signal ( and all these are coupled with noise ) . without knowing the signal parameters _ a priori _ , we resort to an iterative scheme in reconstructing the true signal ( see also sect .  2 ) . \n our experiments on the hatnet database show that this reconstruction can be quite successful without making any assumption on the signal shape . \n once the signal shape is reliably identified , one can proceed by more specific assumptions , e.g. , by using trapeze transit shapes , and thereby further decreasing the number of parameters fitted . to illustrate the efficiency of the tfa reconstruction , we show two examples in fig .  2 .    ] , signal -

type analysis is made with the goal of reaching the theoretical white noise limit of signal detection . in the search for extrasolar transiting planets \n this issue becomes even more highlighted due to the delicacy of the detection . \n we have shown in this paper that tfa is capable of filtering out various systematics , thereby allowing the detection and a concomitant reconstruction of faint regular ( e.g. , simple- or multi - periodic ) signals . \n furthermore , by requiring multiple detections in time series filtered by various tfa templates , false alarm probability can be pushed down near to the white noise limit . \n support for program number hst -

{"ContextTokens": 1167, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "analyses of the faint carina dsph have revealed that it contains a variety of stellar populations ( e.g. ,  [ 4 ] ) , exhibiting prominent old ( @xmath111gyr ) and intermediate - age ( 56 and 3gyr ) populations . \n this implies that carina must have undergone several star forming ( sf ) episodes with at least three significant pulses . despite this wide spread in ages , \n its colour - magnitude diagram features a remarkably narrow rgb . \n the reason for that can be an age counteracting spread in metallicities , where metal rich , young stars have colours comparable to the older , more metal poor ones . \n such a possible age - metallicity degeneracy can be overcome if accurate and independent [ fe / h ] measurements are obtained so that the remaining parameter of age can be estimated from isochrones . \n moreover , the overall shape and spatial variations of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) itself contain valuable implications for analysing carina s unusual sf history . \n in the course of an eso large programme , we observed 1257 red giants covering five fields in carina out to the tidal radius . \n our observations were performed during 23 nights with the multi - object spectrograph flames at the vlt in low - resolution mode , centered at the near infrared cat . \n the data were reduced using the standard flames reduction pipline . since sky contamination from bright emission lines is strong in the cat region , we calculated an average sky - spectrum from 20 dedicated skyfibres , which then was carefully subtracted from the science spectra . typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios for our spectra lie between 25 and 150 pixel@xmath2 . \n after rejection of foreground stars and stars with too low a s / n , 487 radial velocity members were analysed . \n finally , metallicities were derived from the reduced equivalent width w@xmath3 ( [ 1],[5 ] ) . \n the resulting mdf for our 487 red giants is shown in the top panel of fig . \n 1 . it is peaked at an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath4dex , which is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic study of  [ 6 ] , who found a value of @xmath5dex . \n we find a dispersion of @xmath6=0.25dex and as fig . \n 1 implies , the full spread of [ fe / h ] is at least one dex . \n this suggests that the wide range in age is in fact counteracted by a wide spread in metallicity , which can explain carina s narrow rgb and confirms that a complex mixture of stellar populations as in carina does not necessarily contradict the rgb s narrowness . \n the different stellar populations in carina have also different spatial distributions , where , the intermediate age red clump stars are clearly concentrated towards the center compared to the old hb ( see [ 1 ] ) \n . thus we plot in fig .  1 ( bottom panel ) the error - weighted mdfs for three different regions along the galaxy s axes . \n while the curves for the central region and larger minor axis distances do not differ largely and also resemble those along the major axis , there is a shift of the mdf s peak towards the metal poor end by 0.2dex when concentrating on the outer , northwestern region ( lower axis distances ) . \n 1 also overplots a model curve from  [ 3 ] , showing the predicted mdf for carina . \n this model uses a sf efficiency of 0.1gyr@xmath2 and a galactic wind efficiency at the lower end of wind rates in dsphs . \n such a lower wind rate nicely explains the smooth decline of the observed mdf towards the metal rich end , as a higher wind rate would expel enriched gas more efficiently thus preventing the formation of this metal rich tail . \n secondly , the low sf rate is able to explain the metal poor peak of the mdf in terms of a moderate enrichment history . \n however , remaining caveats are the higher fraction of predicted extremely metal poor stars and the lower number of metal poor stars around [ fe / h]@xmath7 , which can be understood in the context of the low infall timescale of gas assumed in dsphs ( [ 3 ] ) . with our accurate [ fe / h ] measurements at hand we will in the next steps pursue the underlying age distribution and use the abundance ratios from our multi - object high - resolution spectroscopy to further unravel the mechanisms governing carina s evolutionary history .    . \n the bottom plot shows spatially separated mdfs in three different regions of carina , measured along the major and minor axes.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] . \n the bottom plot shows spatially separated mdfs in three different regions of carina , measured along the major and minor axes.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]      cole , a.a . \n , et al . , mnras , 347 , 367 harbeck , d. , et . \n 2001 , aj , 122 , 3092 lanfrachi , g. , & matteucci , f. 2004 , mnras , 351 , 1338 monelli , m. , et al . \n 2003 , aj , 126 , 218 rutledge , g.a . , \n hesser , j.e . , stetson , p.b . \n 1997 , pasp , 109 , 907 smecker -

{"ContextTokens": 3904, "GeneratedTokens": 114, "SynthesizedBody": "top quark physics is an important part of the research program at the lhc . since its discovery in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron collider , \n the properties of the top quark have been studied in detail ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . with the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , top - quark processes can be studied for the first time in multi - tev collisions .    due to its large mass  @xcite \n , the top quark may play a special role in the standard model . \n the top quark decays rapidly , long before having the chance to form a bound state hadron . \n hence , it allows direct access to measurements of its mass , spin , charge and other properties . \n additionally , since the higgs boson of the standard model couples to fermions in strength proportional to the fermion s mass , the higgs coupling to the top quark is large . because of this \n , detailed study of the properties of the top quark can provide constraints on the yet - to - be observed higgs boson . \n further , in light of its large mass , it is hypothesized that the top quark could play a role in electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of particle masses in alternatives to the higgs mechanism . \n finally , several signatures of new physics accessible at the lhc either suffer from top - quark production as a significant background or contain top quarks themselves .    at the lhc \n , the top quark is expected to be produced primarily via the strong interaction ( mostly via gluon - gluon fusion , in contrast to the tevatron ) in @xmath2 pairs . the next -

{"ContextTokens": 3575, "GeneratedTokens": 223, "SynthesizedBody": "asteroseismology is a unique approach to investigate stellar properties , which is similar to helioseismology for the sun . \n this is a technique to see the stellar properties by using the observable information of stellar oscillations . via the observations of spectra of oscillation frequencies , one expects to find the stellar mass , radius , equation of state ( eos ) , spin frequency , and information about magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in practice , \n the possibilities to constrain the saturation parameters of nuclear matter are also suggested , using the quasi - periodic oscillations observed in the giant flare phenomena @xcite , whose sources are considered as strongly magnetized neutron stars @xcite . \n furthermore , the direct observations of gravitational waves induced by the stellar oscillations might enable us to probe the gravitational theory in strong - field regime @xcite . \n many experiments and observations in weak - field regime , such as the solar system , tell us the validity of general relativity , while the tests of gravitational theory in strong - field regime are still poor . \n that is , the gravitational theory in strong - field regime might be different from general relativity . \n if so , one could probe the gravitational theory through the observations associated with compact objects @xcite . \n verification of gravitational theory is one of the importances to directly detect the gravitational waves . \n eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity ( eibi ) @xcite recently attracts attention as a modified gravitational theory , because the big bang singularity can be avoided with this theory . \n eibi is based on the gravitational action proposed by eddington @xcite and on the nonlinear electrodynamics by born and infeld @xcite . \n eibi becomes completely equivalent to general relativity in vacuum , while eibi can deviate from general relativity in the presence of matter . because the gravity in eibi is nonlinearly coupled with matter \n , one can expect the significant deviation in the high density region , such as inside the compact objects . \n actually , the spherically symmetric neutron star models in eibi have been constructed , which can deviate from the predictions in general relativity even for the low - mass neutron stars @xcite . \n that is , via the direct measurements of stellar mass and radius , one might be able to distinguish eibi from general relativity .    on the other hand , as mentioned before , the frequencies of compact objects could tell us the information associated with the compact objects . if the spectra of stellar oscillations expected in eibi would become different from those in general relativity \n , one might be possible to distinguish the gravitational theory via the observation of stellar oscillations such as the gravitational waves radiated from the compact objects . \n so , in this paper , we consider the stellar oscillations in eibi . \n in particular , to examine the oscillation frequencies , we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation , where the metric is assumed to be fixed during the oscillations . \n then , as changing the coupling parameter in eibi and stellar models , we will examine the spectra systematically . \n this paper is organized as follows . in the next section \n , we briefly summarized eibi and equilibrium stellar models in eibi . in sec . \n [ sec : iii ] , we derive the perturbation equations describing the stellar oscillations and solve it numerically . \n finally , we make a discussion in sec . [ \n sec : iv ] . in this paper \n , we adopt geometric units , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath8 . \n in this section , we briefly mention eibi and the relativistic stellar models in eibi , where we especially consider the spherically symmetric stellar models . eibi is proposed by baados and ferreira @xcite , which can be obtained with the action as @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the determinants of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while @xmath14 is the ricci tensor constructed with the connection @xmath15 . \n we remark again that the connection @xmath16 should be considered as the independent field from the metric tensor @xmath13 in eibi . \n the matter action @xmath17 depends on the metric and matter field @xmath18 . \n this theory has two parameter @xmath19 and @xmath0 . \n the dimensionless constant @xmath19 is associated with the cosmological constant @xmath20 , such as @xmath21 . in this paper , we consider only asymptotically flat solutions , i.e. , we adopt that @xmath22 . \n the remaining parameter @xmath0 is the eddington parameter , which is constrained in the context of the observations in solar system , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the existence of neutron stars @xcite . \n additionally , terrestrial measurements of the neutron skin thickness of @xmath23pb and astronomical observations of the radius of @xmath24 neutron star could enable us to constrain @xmath0 @xcite . \n the field equations are obtained by varying the action @xcite ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote an auxiliary metric associated with the physical metric @xmath13 via eq . \n ( [ eq:2 ] ) and its determinant , while @xmath28 is energy - momentum tensor defined with the matter action @xmath17 as @xmath29 with the covariant derivative @xmath30 , which is defined with @xmath13 , the energy - momentum conservation law is expressed as @xmath31 . from eq . \n ( [ eq:3 ] ) , one can show that the physical metric @xmath13 is completely equivalent to the auxiliary metric @xmath26 , when @xmath32 . \n the structures of neutron stars in eibi have been discussed in some literatures @xcite . \n the metric for the spherically symmetric objects is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath19 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are functions of @xmath38 . assuming that the neutron stars are composed of perfect fluid , the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy density and pressure , while @xmath42 corresponds to the four velocity of matter given as @xmath43 . \n then , from eqs . \n ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) , and the energy - momentum conservation law , one can obtain the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in eibi @xcite . to close the equation system \n , one needs prepare the relationship between the pressure and density , i.e. , eos . \n in particular , in this paper , we adopt two realistic eoss to construct the neutron star models , i.e , shen eos @xcite and fps eos @xcite . \n shen eos is based on the relativistic mean field approach , while fps eos is based on the skyrme - type effective interaction ( see @xcite for more details about the adopted eoss ) . \n note that the appearance of the curvature instabilities at the stellar surface constructed with a polytropic eos is pointed out @xcite , which could be a problem to solve . \n furthermore , the coupling constant @xmath0 is constrained from the evidence that compact objects exist @xcite , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the central pressure and density . \n hereafter , we adopt @xmath47 as a normalized coupling constant , where @xmath2 is the nuclear saturation density given by @xmath48 g @xmath49 . \n we remark that the coupling constant @xmath0 has been constrained from the observations in the solar system , i.e. , @xmath50 m@xmath51 s@xmath52 kg@xmath53 @xcite , which leads to @xmath54 .    . \n the shaded region surrounded by the broken line shows the allowed values of mass and radius for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss in general relativity , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines show those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ]    in fig . \n [ fig : mr ] , we show the mass - radius relations in general relativity and in eibi with @xmath57 , where the shaded region surrounded by the broken line corresponds to the allowed region in mass - radius relation for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines correspond to those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from this figure , one can observe a large uncertainty in the mass - radius relation due to eos , compared with that due to the gravitational theory . in practice , \n even if @xmath58 , it might be difficult to distinguish the gravitational theory by using the measurements of stellar mass and radius . \n in this paper , as mentioned before , we focus on the stellar oscillations of the relativistic stars in eibi . for this purpose \n , we adopt the cowling approximation as a first step , i.e. , we neglect the metric perturbations as @xmath59 . the lagrangian displacement vector of matter element @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond to functions of @xmath64 and @xmath38 , while @xmath65 denotes the spherical harmonics . with such variables , \n the perturbation of four - velocity @xmath66 can be expressed as @xmath67 where the dot denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath64 . \n additionally , the perturbations of energy density and pressure are given by @xmath68    then , the perturbation equations in the cowling approximation can be derived from the variation of the energy - momentum conservation law , i.e. , @xmath69 . in practice , one can obtain the following equations ; @xmath70 = 0 , \\label{eq : a } \\\\ \n \\frac{\\epsilon+p}{r^2}e^{-\\nu } \\ddot{w } + e^{-\\lambda}\\delta p ' + \\frac{\\nu'}{2}e^{-\\lambda}\\left(\\delta p + \\delta\\epsilon\\right ) = 0 ,        \\label{eq : b } \\\\    -\\frac{\\epsilon + p}{r^2}e^{-\\nu}\\ddot{v } + \\frac{1}{f}\\delta p = 0 , \\label{eq : c}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath38 . \n in addition to the above equations , one can show that @xmath71 is associated with @xmath72 as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the sound speed . \n at last , combining eqs . \n ( [ eq : a ] )  ( [ eq : c ] ) with the relation of @xmath73 , one can get the perturbation equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath75w        + \\left[\\frac{\\omega^2}{c_s^2 } fe^{-\\nu } -   \\ell(\\ell+1)\\right]v , \\label{eq : a1 } \\\\    v ' = -\\frac{1}{f}e^{\\lambda}w + \\left[\\frac{2}{r } - \\frac{f'}{f } + \\nu'\\right]v . \n \\label{eq : a2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we assume that the perturbation variables have a harmonic time dependence , such as @xmath76 .    with the appropriate boundary conditions , \n the problem to solve becomes the eigenvalue problem with respect to @xmath77 . \n the boundary condition at the stellar surface is that the lagrangian perturbation of pressure should be vanished , i.e. , @xmath78 , which reduces to @xmath79 on the other hand , the perturbation variables should be regular at the stellar center . using eqs . \n ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , one can show that @xmath62 and @xmath63 should behave in the vicinity of stellar center as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant . \n hereafter , we especially focus on the @xmath82 modes , which can be dominating modes in gravitational wave radiations from the compact objects . \n [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from the observational point of view , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : mr ] , one might have to take into account the uncertainty due to eos . in fig . \n [ fig : l2 ] , we show the @xmath37 mode frequencies ( left panel ) and @xmath83 mode frequencies ( right panel ) both in general relativity and in eibi with @xmath57 as a function of the stellar average density . in the both panels , \n the shaded regions surrounded by the broken lines denote the frequencies expected for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss in general relativity , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines denote those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . comparing to the mass - radius relation shown in fig . \n [ fig : mr ] , one can observe that the frequencies depend weakly on the eos . \n this could be because that the @xmath37 mode oscillation , which is an acoustic wave , propagates inside the star with sound velocity associated with the stellar average density . \n in fact , it has been suggested in general relativity that the @xmath37 mode frequencies are written as a linear function of the stellar average density , which weakly depends on the adopted eos @xcite . from the left panel in fig . \n [ fig : l2 ] , one can obviously see that the @xmath37 mode frequencies in eibi with @xmath84 could be distinguished from those in general relativity , even if the uncertainty in frequencies due to eos would exist . \n that is , via the direct observations of @xmath37 mode oscillations , one could distinguish eibi from general relativity , if @xmath1 , independently of eos for neutron star matter . of course , \n if the eos for neutron star matter would be determined or constrained via the other astronomical observations and/or terrestrial unclear experiments , one might distinguish eibi even with @xmath4 from general relativity . on the other hand , with the uncertainty due to eos \n , it seems to be difficult to distinguish eibi with @xmath85 from general relativity via the observations of @xmath83 mode oscillations . \n eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity ( eibi ) attracts attention as a modified gravitational theory in the context of avoiding the big bang singularity . \n this theory completely agrees with general relativity in vacuum , but can deviate from general relativity in the region with matter . in this paper , \n we especially forces on the stellar oscillations in eibi , and examine the oscillation frequencies of neutron stars as changing the eddington parameter @xmath0 . for this purpose \n , we derive the perturbation equations with relativistic cowling approximation by linearizing the energy - momentum conservation law . as a result \n , we find that the @xmath37 and @xmath83 mode frequencies depend strongly on the eddington parameter . compared with the expectations in general relativity ( @xmath86 ) , the frequencies in eibi with negative @xmath0 become high and those with positive @xmath0 become low . \n additionally , in general , there exists an uncertainty in stellar models due to eos of neutron star matter , but we show that one could identify eibi with @xmath1 from general relativity independently of the adopted eos . \n furthermore , one might be able to distinguish eibi even with @xmath4 from general relativity , if the eos would be constrained from the astronomical observations and/or terrestrial nuclear experiments . in this paper , although we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation as a first step , we will do more complex analysis for gravitational waves radiated from neutron stars in eibi without such approximation somewhere . \n in fact , the damping time of gravitational waves is also one of the important information from the asteroseismological point of view . \n such an additional information must help us to constrain the gravitational theory more clearly . \n this work was supported by grants -

{"ContextTokens": 3463, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "the realistic world is affected by randomness . unlike non - random systems , those with randomness sometimes show rich and complicated phenomena . one of the interesting issues for such random systems is spin glass . \n many studies mainly by the mean - field analysis have been successful to elucidate various concepts for understanding spin glasses @xcite . \n one of the current issues in spin glasses is their nature in finite dimensions below the upper critical dimension . \n unfortunately , for finite dimensions , we often rely on numerical simulations , because there are few ways to analytically study spin glasses in finite dimensions . \n we need long equilibration times for the numerical simulations for spin glasses and average over many realizations of random systems to make error bars small enough . \n it is thus difficult to give conclusive understanding on nature of spin glasses in finite dimensions . \n to establish reliable analytical theories of spin glasses has been one of the most challenging problems for years . \n a part of successful analyses to elucidate properties on spin glasses is by the use of the gauge symmetry . by use of the gauge symmetry , \n one can obtain the exact value of the internal energy , evaluate the upper bound for the specific heat , and obtain some correlation inequalities in a subspace known as the nishimori line hn81,rev3 . \n this gauge symmetry also enables us to rewrite the free energy along the nishimori line as the entropy for the distribution of frustration @xcite . \n many aspects on spin glasses are essentially related with frustration . \n therefore we expect the possibility that a basis of establishment of a systematic approach to spin glasses would be in the gauge symmetry . \n a recent related development with the gauge symmetry is the _ conjecture _ to predict the location of the multicritical point , which is the special point lying on the intersection between phase boundaries and the nishimori line as in fig . \n [ fig1 ] @xcite .     ising model on two -

component fourier transformation gives the dual edge boltzmann factors as , @xmath17 as a result , we establish the relation between the partition functions with different components as , @xmath18 we here extract two principal boltzmann factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 to measure the energy from the state with edge spins on each bond being parallel as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the number of bonds , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are called the relative boltzmann factors defined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . each partition function \n is now reduced to a single -

random bond ising model . \n we describe schematically the relationship two reduced partition functions @xmath46 as the curves of the relative boltzmann factors @xmath47 ( the thin curve going through the multicritical point @xmath2 ) and @xmath48 ( the dashed line ) as in fig . \n [ trajectory ] . \n we now consider the relationship between these curves by the projections on the two -

temperature limit ) along the thin line in fig . \n [ trajectory ] . \n then the corresponding dual point @xmath53 moves along the dashed line in the opposite direction from p to f ( the low - temperature limit ) . \n these features have been shown rigorously and imply the existence of the duality relation for the temperature @xcite . \n if two curves describing change of @xmath54 and @xmath48 become completely coincident with each other , we can obtain a relation @xmath55 . solving this relation , \n we obtain the duality relation for the temperature @xmath56 . \n the well - known duality relation @xmath28 for the non - random ising model can be indeed derived from the relation @xmath57 . \n unfortunately the thin curve @xmath54 does not coincide with the dashed curve @xmath48 for the replicated @xmath0 ising model on the nishimori line as shown schematically in fig . \n [ trajectory ] . in the case for the replicated @xmath58 ising model \n , we can neither find a duality relation for the temperature explicitly , nor identify the multicritical point as the fixed point of duality . \n we thus have provided a hypothesis on determination of the multicritical point @xcite . \n we assume that the equation @xmath59 is also satisfied at the multicritical point , similarly to the non - random bond ising model at the critical point , for any @xmath39-replicated systems including the quenched system ( @xmath60 ) @xcite . \n validity of this hypothesis can be rigorously shown for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and for @xmath63 , and has been numerically confirmed for the @xmath64 case of the replicated @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice within error bars of the numerical simulation @xcite . \n relying on these facts , we assume that we can predict the location of the multicritical point for the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice by the single equation @xmath65 . \n the quenched limit @xmath60 for this equation yields @xcite , @xmath66 the solution to this equation is @xmath67 . \n we can also predict the location of the multicritical point for other types of randomness . \n for instance , that of the gaussian ising model with the mean @xmath68 and the variance @xmath69 is given as @xmath70 @xcite . \n .comparisons among the results derived by the conventional conjecture and the existing numerical results . \n sq denotes the square lattice , tr means the triangular lattice , and hex means the hexagonal lattice . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the estimated values for the square lattice shows convergence to the exact solution @xmath71 @xcite , similarly to the case for the @xmath0 ising model . \n in addition , we remark that the improved technique works very well for the critical points of the bond - diluted @xmath72-state potts model , and @xmath72-state villain model @xcite . from these points of view \n , we conclude that the improved technique is also a systematic approach leading to the precise locations of the critical points in broader classes of the random spin systems . \n we proposed an improved technique applicable to the square , triangular , hexagonal lattices , and derived the precise locations of the multicritical points for the @xmath0 ising model , the gaussian ising model , and the potts spin glass on the square lattice , as well as the @xmath0 ising model on the triangular lattice and the hexagonal lattice . \n this improved technique is still approximation for the location of the multicritical point . \n however we can enhance the precision of the approximation by the summation over spins in the cluster taken from the considered lattice , if we need the precise location of the critical points in a random spin system . \n this would open a way to analytically derive the location of the critical points in random spin systems with very high precision . \n unfortunately , in the low - temperature region under the nishimori line , the improved technique can not give satisfactory answers yet . \n we solve this problem in the low - temperature region under the nishimori line , and have to examine the validity of some hypotheses on the improved technique .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the random spin systems in two - dimensional systems . \n however we can apply the duality to other dimensional systems . \n for example , the duality can transform the random - bond ising model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice into the random - plaquette gauge model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice . \n the random - plaquette gauge model is an attractive one in terms of the quantum toric code dklp , whp . \n an accuracy threshold to correct error of the quantum toric code corresponds to the location of the multicritical point on the random - plaquette gauge model with the random couplings following the @xmath0 distribution function on the three - dimensional cubic lattice . \n the conventional conjecture relates this threshold with the location of the multicritical point of the @xmath0 ising model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice @xcite . \n the improved technique also can not directly derive such an accuracy threshold , but can make more precise relationship between the locations of the multicritical points on the random - bond ising model and the random - plaquette gauge model .    as another direction of studies in the future \n , we should clarify the physical meaning of the equation consisting of the entropy of the distribution of frustration , which determines the location of the multicritical point . \n the author greatly acknowledges the fruitful discussion with prof . \n h. nishimori , prof . \n a. n. berker and dr . \n m. hinczewski , and sincerely thanks prof . \n y. okabe for sending unpublished numerical data of the bond - diluted potts model and the bond - diluted villain model , and prof . \n m. picco , who informed him of a his recent result of the multicritical point on the square lattice . \n he would like to also thank prof . \n s. l. a. de queiroz for a valuable comment and dr . \n k. takahashi for reading the manuscript and giving stimulating comments . \n this work was partially supported by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture , grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b ) no . \n 20740218 , and for scientific research on the priority area deepening and expansion of statistical mechanical informatics ( dex - smi ) , and by crest , jst .", "StartTimeOffset": 2643769349814, "RequestID": "0789ee28c26d1d4fdd7a8d3a301aadb7b3a87521", "TotalTokens": 3647}

world systems  @xcite . \n the introduction of new ideas and concepts in the field has been very often associated to the availability of new , more accurate , or larger data sets , and to the discovery of new structural properties of complex systems from the real world  @xcite . \n this is the reason why a lot of interest has been recently devoted to the study of multiplex networks , i.e. networks in which the same set of nodes can be connected by means of links of qualitatively different type or nature . \n several data sets of real - world systems that can be represented and studied as multiplex networks have appeared in the recent literature  @xcite , and we expect that many more will arrive in the next few years . the first papers on the subject have focused on the characterization of the structure of multiplex networks  @xcite , and on modeling the basic mechanisms of their growth  @xcite . in parallel to this , some effort has been also devoted on investigating various kinds of dynamical processes on multiplex topologies , including diffusion  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite , cooperation  @xcite , opinion formation  @xcite , and percolation  @xcite . \n there is today a general agreement on the fact that multiplex networks represent the ideal framework to study a large variety of complex systems of different nature . \n and there are already some numerical and analytical results showing that the dynamics of processes on multiplex networks is far richer than in networks with a single layer . \n a comprehensive review of the main advances in this new vibrant field of research can be found in a few recent survey papers  @xcite .    in this article \n we focus on an issue that has revealed of great importance in single - layer networks , but has not yet been investigated thoroughly in multiplex networks , i.e. that of correlations  @xcite . in networks with a single layer it has been found that there are correlations in the properties of connected nodes . \n namely , the degree of a node can be either positively or negatively correlated with the degree of its first neighbors . in the first case , the hubs of the networks \n are preferentially linked to each others , while in the second case they are preferentially connected to low - degree nodes  @xcite .    in multiplex networks \n the very same concept of correlations is far richer than in a network with a single layer . \n in fact , on one hand it is still possible to explore the standard degree - degree correlations at the level of each layer of the network , but on the other hand it is more interesting to introduce a truly multiplex definition of correlations , for instance by looking at how a certain property of a node at a given layer is correlated to the same or other properties of the same node at another layer . \n we present here a complete and self - consistent study of correlations of node properties in multiplex networks . in doing this , we follow the usual steps of the typical approach to complex networks : _ \n i ) _ we first explore empirically correlations in real multiplex networks , _ ii ) _ we introduce various measures to characterize and quantify correlations in multiplex networks , _ iii ) _ we propose a series of models to reproduce the correlations found in real multiplex systems , or to assess their relevance . \n we find that multiplexity introduces novel levels of complexity . \n in particular , in real - world multiplex networks the patterns of presence and involvement of the nodes at the different layers are characterized by strong correlations . and \n this has to be taken into account when it comes to model such systems . \n the article is organized as follows . in sect . \n [ why ] we focus on two small real - world networks and we use them as examples to explain why a description in terms of multiplex networks captures more information on a system than a single - layer projection . in the remaining sections we study the structure of five real - world multiplex networks ( additional information about the networks are provided in appendix ) , with the main attention to the concept of correlations . in particular , in sect . \n [ sec : activity ] we focus on the patterns of node activity and involvement at the various layers . \n we say that a node is active at a given layer if it has at least one link at that layer , and we introduce various quantities to characterize the distribution and the correlations of node activities . \n we also investigate the activity correlations between pairs of layers . \n we find that real - world multiplex networks are quite sparse , with only a few nodes active in many layers , and are characterized by strong correlations : interestingly , the activity of a node in a particular layer is very often correlated with its activity in some other layer . in sect . \n [ sec : activity_models ] we introduce the first null - models to assess the significance of the observed patterns of node activity . in sect . \n [ sec : cartography ] we investigate correlations between the activity and the degree of the nodes of a multiplex network , while in sect . \n [ sec : degree - degree ] we show how to quantify inter - layer degree correlations ( degree correlations between layers ) . \n in particular , we focus our attention on measuring correlation in the node degrees of a pair of layers , either by using the spearman s rank correlation coefficient of the two degree sequences , or by plotting , as a function of @xmath0 , the average degree @xmath1 at one layer of nodes having degree @xmath0 at the other layer . \n we find that there exist significant correlations among the degree of the same node at different layers , and such correlations can be either positive , meaning that nodes tend to have similar roles across layers , or negative , meaning that nodes with a large degree in one layer tend to have small degrees in another layer . finally , in sect.[sec : model_degree - degree \n ] , we propose two algorithms based on simulated annealing which allow to construct multiplex networks with tunable inter - layer degree - degree correlations , and in sect .

minimum structure in a wide 155 - 210  mev temperature range , with improved fit quality at global minimum . \n this change is attributed to a larger suppression of ( anti)deuteron yield at higher temperatures due to larger eigenvolume . \n it is remarkable that fit can be so sensitive to the properties of only single particle species . \n similarly , the inclusion of yields of @xmath24he and @xmath25h does not help to stabilise the fit , as seen in fig . \n [ fig : deuteron]b . \n this is so despite the remarkably large number of degrees of freedom @xmath34 . \n we therefore conclude that introduction of light nuclei into thermal fits leads to a further destabilisation of the fit as it requires non -

{"ContextTokens": 3402, "GeneratedTokens": 145, "SynthesizedBody": "recently there has been much interest in random growing networks review , review1,review2 , both from the point of view of theoretical modelling , as well as the empirical study of real networks . \n there is considerable evidence that while traditional erds - renyi random graphs have a poisson degree distribution @xcite , real graphs and random growing graphs have a power - law degree distribution .    of particular interest \n are directed networks , which can be used to model systems in which directed flow takes place . \n such networks include the world wide web @xcite , the phone - call graph @xcite and the citation graph 3 .    as a complement to computer simulations and exact solutions of simplified systems , \n thermodynamic formulations have been used to study a number of complex co - operative systems including granular media , econophysics , breaking phenomena and many others . in a recent paper @xcite , bianconi and \n barabsi ( bb ) mapped the different behaviour of random growing networks with fitness onto the thermodynamically distinct phases of a free bose gas . \n the fitness model predicts that , in the large network limit , the fittest node will have the most links . \n this is called the _ fit - get - rich _ ( fgr ) phase . unlike the scale - free model ( sfm ) , in which the degree distribution of the network is power - law , the fgr behaviour ( phase in the thermodynamic language ) has nodes with a very large degree which dominate the network . \n another phase revealed in @xcite is the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , when the fittest node acquires a finite fraction of the total degree . \n in contrast to bec , in the fgr phase the richest node is not an absolute winner , since its share of the links ( _ i.e. _ the ratio of its degree and the total degree of the network ) decays to zero for large system sizes , whereas in bec the winner maintains its share irrespective of system size .    in this case , the fact that this ratio is constant corresponds to the extensivity property of a bose gas , when the gas keeps a finite fraction of its particles in the ground state . in this paper \n we examine the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation , which was considered for an undirected graph in @xcite on the random directed growing network introduced in @xcite .    to do this we work with the model introduced in @xcite , introducing a dependence between the vertex fitness and an energy . \n as each vertex has two fitnesses ( for in - degree and out - degree ) then it is necessary to assign two different energy levels to represent each vertex . \n this is detailed in the first sub - section , together with the description of edges in terms of particles assigned to two energy levels . \n the necessary coexistence of two sub - systems forming the network and the formulation of an equilibrium condition in a formal way is discussed in detail in sections 3 and 4 . \n the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation , and its interpretation in a physical framework makes it possible to describe the directed network in terms of canonical concepts of statistical physics , such as a phase diagram and first and second order phase transitions . \n these are introduced in the following sections .    in the conclusions we emphasize the usefulness of this formulation in providing a clear and concise interpretation of different phenomena in networks . \n so , the possibility of coexistence of phases in which the in - degree distribution exhibits a clear winner whereas the out - degree shows scale free behaviour , or the simultaneous existence of two different winners ( bipolarity ) and the conditions for its existence are predicted in thermodynamic language . \n in bb @xcite , a correspondence between fitness @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 given by @xmath10was introduced . in our model \n the vertices have , in general , different fitnesses @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the addition of an in- or out - degree . as in er , here the model \n consists of the addition of bare vertices ( i.e. without edges , but with fitness @xmath11 for in - degree and @xmath12 for out - degree ) to the network with probability @xmath0 , and the creation of directed edges between vertices with probability @xmath13 .    a kinetic equation describing the process of directed networks must include the kinetics of both in - degree and out - degree simultaneously since they coexist and influence each other . \n then , the kinetic equation for the mean number of vertices with in - degree @xmath4 and out - degree @xmath5 is , as in er ,    @xmath14+\\frac{qb } { m_{2}}[jn_{i , j-1}-(j+1)n_{ij}]+p\\delta _ { i0}\\delta _ { j0}f(a , b ) .\\ ] ]    where the fitnesses @xmath2 are chosen from the fitness distribution @xmath15 . \n the normalisation factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath18and @xmath19the first term in the first square brackets of eq.(2 ) represents the increase in @xmath20 when vertices with in - degree @xmath21 and out - degree @xmath5 gain an incoming edge and the second term represents the corresponding loss . \n the second square brackets contain the analogous terms for outgoing edges and the last term ensures the continuous addition of new vertices with fitnesses @xmath22 . \n the translation of this problem into an energetic formulation is straightforward . \n we associate the addition of a vertex with fitnesses @xmath23 to the network with the creation of two energy levels ; one representing the fitness of the incoming edge and the other for the outgoing edge . \n this means that the edge can be mapped into two separate isolated sub - systems . \n then the creation of a directed edge corresponds to the creation of two particles , one in each sub - system , simultaneously . \n the particles are created in the energy levels corresponding to incoming fitness of the receiving vertex and the outgoing fitness of the emitter vertex , as fig . \n 1 illustrates . \n then , using the energy variables , rather that the fitness , we have @xmath24@xmath25and @xmath26+\\frac{% qe^{-\\beta _ { 2}\\varepsilon _ { 2}}}{m_{2}}[jn_{i , j-1}-(j+1)n_{ij}]+p\\delta _ { i0}\\delta _ { j0}f(\\varepsilon _ { 1},\\varepsilon _ { 2}).\\]]and the normalisations \n are re - written as @xmath27and @xmath28    as we distinguish between incoming and outgoing edges , and their respective fitnesses , when going to the energy representation the edges and their fitnesses must also be distinguished as belonging to different isolated sub - systems of the same system . \n let us denote the sub - systems as 1 and 2  so , the creation of a vertex in the network implies the simultaneous creation of an energy level in each sub - system , i.e. @xmath29and @xmath30 . \n the creation of an edge joining two vertices implies the simultaneous creation of one particle in each sub - system in the energy levels corresponding to the fitnesses of the vertices gaining an in- and out - degree , as fig.1 illustrates .    it should be noted that we are doing a simultaneous description of two isolated sub - systems which compose the whole system ( the network ) . \n these sub - systems do not exchange energy or particles , but are correlated in the sense that the creation of an energy level ( a particle ) in one of the sub - systems implies the simultaneous phenomenon in the other .    by definition of the model , \n the total number of particles increases linearly with time , so @xmath31    let us define the reduced moments @xmath32 and @xmath33 by @xmath34@xmath35and introduce @xmath36 as @xmath37    as shall be seen these magnitudes will be useful to calculate the characteristics of the network . \n then , following the procedure in @xcite , we can show that @xmath38and @xmath39 which determines @xmath40 and @xmath41 as functions of @xmath0 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      in this representation , \n as we already pointed out , the addition of a vertex means the creation of two energy levels , each corresponding to its fitness . when an edge joining two vertices is created , we add one particle in each corresponding level . \n the distribution of in- and out - degree then corresponds to the distribution of particles in systems 1 and 2    @xmath44    is the number of vertices with in - degree @xmath4 , and    @xmath45    is the number of vertices with out - degree @xmath5 . for large degree \n their asymptotic expressions are @xmath46and @xmath47where we have introduced @xmath48for @xmath49 and @xmath50 as _ chemical potentials_. unlike bb , the chemical potential is introduced here as an exact expression , not as an asymptotic one .      the equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be transformed by introducing the generating function @xmath51where @xmath52with @xmath53}\\]]and @xmath54}.\\]]then the equations for @xmath55 @xmath56 become @xmath57this means that @xmath58unlike bb , this is a new condition generated by the model . \n let us denote it as a _ generalized equilibrium condition_. a _ strong equilibrium _ \n condition implies that @xmath59and @xmath60this condition will be discussed later . in this formalism \n the occupation probability is , then , @xmath61for @xmath62 , representing the probability for a given edge to belong to a given vertex ( probability of a particle to belong to an energy level ) . \n if , now , the fitness distribution is separable then @xmath63and @xmath64separately for each system @xmath62 . in each case , @xmath65 is the solution of this equation , which depends on the density of states @xmath66 .      to illustrate , \n let us start with a particular case , when @xmath67 with @xmath68 . \n the normalisation @xmath69 as in bb .    then the integral in eq.(25 ) , @xmath70    but this integral reaches its maximum value when @xmath71 \n . then if for a given value of @xmath72 we have @xmath73 then we have a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . \n if we calculate the temperature for bec in this particular case , we obtain @xmath74    unlike bb , the factor @xmath75 appears here . if @xmath76 we recover bb result . \n even in this simple example , @xmath77 may be different for the sub - systems 1 and 2 , if the value of @xmath78 is different . in a more general form , we can state the condition for bose einstein condensation . then , as @xmath79for @xmath62 . , if @xmath80 then bec occurs . the conditions for bec depend on @xmath81      below @xmath77 there is bec . \n above it the phase is fit - get - richer as in bb1 , but here both phases must be considered for both systems . \n then , a phase diagram can be drawn with the temperatures @xmath82 = @xmath83 and @xmath84 = @xmath85 characterizing each sub - system ( fig . \n 2 ) .    imposing a given dependence of fitness with energy so that @xmath86means that the equilibrium is broken , ( i.e. in a computer simulation we would impose temperatures that do not satisfy eq . [ 26 ]  ) . then there can be a winner in one of the phases . \n one of the vertices accumulates , say , most of the in - degrees , coming from the other vertices . if both phases are in bec there is a vertex with most of the incoming and another with most of the outgoing edges . then both vertices will be highly correlated . \n though a more complicated situations are possible , let us illustrate the case @xmath87 . \n the point a represents that both sub - systems are in fgr phase . \n if , for example , we make the simulations with the parameters given by a1 then will be an fgr and a bec  phase coexisting , but not _ in equilibrium _ since one of them satisfies eq . \n [ 35 ] but not the other . \n there is a coexistence of phases out of equilibrium \n . we might call this an _ out of equilibrium first order phase transition_. the motion along aa1a2 ... leads to the region in which bec occurs for both phases . here is hard to speak about equilibrium unless a belongs to the line @xmath88 . \n all we know in bec region is that none of the sub - systems satisfies eq . \n 35    the concept of equilibrium in this model is purely formal since the sub - systems are not in contact , but it is a comfortable tool to make a map of directed networks into bose - einstein statistics .      if one of the systems is such that @xmath89 , then eq . ( \n [ 31 ] ) gives @xmath90then @xmath91with a corresponding expression for @xmath92 . \n if @xmath76 the scale free model is recovered with a degree distribution @xmath93 . thus the model with directed edges gives the possibility of a scale free phase for both in the in - degree and the out - degree .      if in fig . \n 3 we move in such a way as to cross into the bec region through the point b then bec occurs simultaneously for both phases . no coexistence of phases will occur , the system goes from fgr to bec or vice - versa instantly . \n this is a _ \n second order phase transition _ since the system as a whole changes its phase . \n then the point b is the _ \n critical point _ for the transition . \n bec is itself a second order phase transition since it effects the system as a whole , so that when sub - system 1 or 2 experiences bec , the sub - system itself suffers a second order phase transition , but our system contains both sub - systems 1 and 2 so that when they are in different phases we consider our whole system as composed of two phases . \n we have studied bose - einstein condensation in a random growing network model . in this model , with a formulation considering incoming and outgoing edges , a formal analogy can be adopted to describe the change in the behaviour of the directed edges in terms of bose statistics .    in this formulation , as in that of bb , the temperature plays the role of a dummy variable . \n real systems are characterised by the functional form of the distribution function of fitness and there is no @xmath94 to consider . \n it only emerges when we translate from the language of fitness to that of energies . \n but the formulation of networks in terms of quantum statistics and the introduction of temperature is an elegant and simple description of the behaviour of networks under different conditions . in this sense , \n the temperature plays its role in the simulations of the networks , determining the strength of the dependence between the fitness and its associated energy , and this dependence is reflected in the behaviour of the network by determining its position in the phase diagram . \n though phase diagrams and phase transitions are not exclusive to thermodynamic formulations ( see , e.g. dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite ) , such a formulation is a very powerful tool to describe different phases of random directed networks , where the presence of directed edges make the description in terms of fitness difficult . \n considering this network as a thermodynamic system , makes it simple to understand , provided we appropriately interpret the thermodynamic parameters . \n we would like to thank the royal society , london and the london mathematical society for their financial support . \n one of us ( o. s ) is greatly indebted to the staff of the department of mathematical sciences at brunel university for their warm hospitality . \n \\1 . correspondence between fitness and energy for directed networks .", "StartTimeOffset": 2659903917468, "RequestID": "27a476e8447778e5066194c42a3c876bb07539f3", "TotalTokens": 3547}
{"ContextTokens": 2431, "GeneratedTokens": 95, "SynthesizedBody": "the general problem of the fully automatic star detecting algorithms on the ccd images is the successful recognition of real star images or star - like sources in general from other types of objects and defects . \n these false objects originate from non - ideal characteristics of the ccd instrument ( noise , bad column and hot pixels ) or from the environment ( nebulae , galaxy or cosmic ray events known as cosmics ) . \n the frequent requirement is to find real star images on a diffuse background or in a crowded star field . \n therefore , the detecting algorithm can not use a simple intensity comparing principle , because the intensity of non - stellar objects can be comparable to star intensities .    a number of different methods for the automatic star detection on astronomical images has been used during the last two decades . for example , \n the method based on wavelet transforms applied to satellite rosat image processing was published by damiani  et  al . \n @xcite . the automatic search and classification \n were implemented in focas routine by valdes  et  al . \n @xcite . the pc  vista by trefers and richmod  @xcite is a package for photometry with a simple algorithm for star detection . the well - known program daophot by stetson  @xcite contains two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 and a highly robust algorithm for star detection . \n the determination of these parameters originates from specific characteristics of the sources on ccd images , but both parameters are not sensitive enough to resolve stars and cosmics on the ccd images exposed in focus of a space telescope and/or camera such as the omc experiment on - board integral ( hermsen and winkler  @xcite ) . \n the large part of the information describing the detected object is included in its intensity profile , but the profile varies widely with weather , telescope focus , etc . changes . \n the intensity distribution can not be described by an analytical function , because it depends on many non - controllable factors . \n fortunately , the real measured profiles are ( in the first approximation ) close to the two - dimensional gaussian profile both for the ground - based ( moffat  @xcite ) and space telescopes .    from this point of view \n , we can easy distinguish between the hot pixel ( a  single pixel with very different intensity compared to surrounding pixels ) and the real star . \n the star image with the gaussian profile is usually spread over several pixels . for illustration , \n the typical 1-dimensional profiles of the star and of the hot pixel are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . \n the maximum intensity of the object @xmath3 is at the pixel @xmath4 . \n the center of the star is at position @xmath5 where summations are evaluated over a small area around the central pixel @xmath4  for example over @xmath6 pixels . \n this notation is also used below . \n approximation of the observed intensity by the two - dimensional gaussian profile is the next step of our algorithm @xmath7/2 h^2 } + \\ , b\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath8 is the estimated maximum of the star profile , @xmath9 is the local sky background . \n the parameter @xmath10 is the width of the typical star and its numerical value must be known _ a priori_. the stars are axis - symmetrical objects according to this formula . \n note , that the @xmath8 parameter is equivalent to , but not quite identical with the stetson s \n parameter @xmath11 ( integer values are used for @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 ) . if we suppose that the statistical distribution of the observed intensity has a normal distribution , we can use the least square method @xmath14 for the estimation of the unknown @xmath8 and ( further unused ) @xmath9 . \n further , we can estimate the central intensity @xmath15 from the maximum intensity @xmath3 by subtracting the local background intensity @xmath16 from @xmath3 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 are arbitrary weights ) and compare its numerical value in parameter @xmath0 : @xmath20 the figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] indicate the typical values of this parameter . \n its value is in agreement with the inequality @xmath21 for the star and with @xmath22 for the hot pixel . \n we can hence deduce the range of the parameter @xmath0 as @xmath23 for the star . \n the cosmic ray events frequency on the ccd images exposed at a ground - based observatory is low and , moreover , its profiles are narrower than the star profiles \n . the image processing algorithm can then easily resolve the images of the stars and those of the cosmic - ray events . \n but ccd images from satellites contain a higher number of the cosmic - ray event tracks and the numerical value of the @xmath0 parameter , computed for the stars , is close to the numerical value for cosmics . \n the construction of the confidentiality test for its distinguishing with only the @xmath0 parameter is not possible . \n the star isophotes of the ideal images have the shape of concentric circles , but the cosmics or the bad columns are represented in general by ellipses with the major semi - axis at some angle to the @xmath24 coordinate . \n the mathematical description of an object in image is derived from this characteristics . \n the most effective way is the description of the object by its 2nd moments @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the summations are evaluated over the same small area around @xmath4 . \n now , we can compute the lengths of the object semi - axes as the eigenvalues problem . \n its lengths satisfy the equation @xmath27 resolving of this equations for @xmath28 gives the sizes of semi - axes as @xmath29\\ ] ] the numerical values of its parameters ( lengths of semi - axes ) are different for elongated object , but approximately the same for stars . \n with respect to their character we define the parameter @xmath30 the limits of this parameter are :    * @xmath31 , the star case * @xmath32 , the cosmics case * @xmath33 , the bad column case , @xmath1 parameter is then equivalent to the @xmath2 parameter of stetson  ( 1987 )    the parameter @xmath1 describes the shape of the object . \n the circular objects are interpreted this way as stars and the very elongated object as cosmic - ray events or bad columns . \n note , that the @xmath1 parameter represents direct generalization of the @xmath2 parameter described in stetson  ( 1987 ) . \n the @xmath2 parameter is capable of measuring elongation only parallel to rows or columns of the image . \n it was intended to identify bad rows or columns , not cosmics . \n = 1.0 cm    ( 8,8 ) ( 8,8 ) \n in this section we describe the use of the parameters mentioned in previous sections to analyze the simulated image of the star field . the image ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) \n is generated as the simulation of the field of view of the omc ( optical monitoring camera ) prepared for the esa satellite integral . \n the psf function of the stars in the image is defined as the two - dimensional gaussian profile with 70% of the light energy in the central pixel , according to the psf of the flight optics . \n this results in @xmath34 for the stars in the simulated image , while their centers are uniformly spread over the unit interval . \n there are also some other sources in the image , namely the bad column , hot pixels and a few cosmics ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] and table  [ tab ] ) . \n the image is critically under - sampled . \n the image left - bottom corner has coordinates @xmath35 and right - top one @xmath36 in pixels . \n the bad column is situated at @xmath37 . \n the hot pixels occupy positions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the centers of the three cosmics appear at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . \n all other sources represent real stars . \n the intensity of the sky is @xmath45 with the gaussian noise @xmath46 ( all intensities in arbitrary units ) . \n object no .  4 ( star ) and object no .  1 ( hot pixel ) were used for construction of the profiles shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] . \n the computed characteristics for the selected sources in the simulated image are listed in table  [ tab ] . \n the center of the object is at coordinates @xmath12 , see formulae ( [ e1 ] ) , the intensity peak at pixel @xmath4 is related to @xmath15 according to ( [ e2 ] ) . \n the moments computed from ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the parameter @xmath8 is obtained by minimization of the sum ( [ e5 ] ) . \n the last three columns contain the values of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath1 . \n the values of the numerical differences of the @xmath0 parameter for star and hot pixel are small because @xmath10 is small , but the upper bound at 1 separates stars and hot pixels to obviously different groups \n . the values of the @xmath2 parameter demonstrate small difference between cosmics and stars . on the contrary the values of the @xmath1 parameter of the stars ( or hot pixels ) and of the cosmics as well as that of the bad columns \n are clearly incompatible . \n .the parameters of objects in the simulated image ( legend : no . 1  hot pixel , no . 2  bad column , no . \n 3  cosmics , no . 4  star ) .

the third tile , located between them , is used to study and to remove the background . \n the distance of the centers of the tiles can be varied from @xmath22 to @xmath27 . \n the scintillators are read by a hamamatsu photo - multiplier coupled to the scintillator by an optical connector . \n the pm has a transit time spread of less than @xmath28 and a low - voltage power supply . \n this choice requires a simple power supply system . to measure horizontal cosmic ray flux we need know the time arrow , i.e. select the muons from the horizon and remove particles from other directions . that requires the measurement of the time of flight between two tiles ( c1,c2 ) . \n the results shown were performed with a setup where the distance between c1 and c2 was @xmath26 and the data were taken at different zenith angles and at ground level . \n one test was performed also with the c3 tile to understand the backgroud . \n the measurement of a cosmic particle passing through two tiles distant @xmath29 is affected by three kinds of background :    * \\a ) a pair of different particles cross at the same time the two tiles ( c1,c2 ) . * \n \\b ) a particle crosses one tile and the noise of second tile gives a coincidence * \\c ) two particles from different mini - showers cross the first ( c1 ) and 3rd ( c2 ) tile at different time .    the background a ) can be removed by a good timing : @xmath30 ; the background b ) can be removed appling a cut on the charge deposited into the scintillators ; the background c ) must be evaluated and it can not be removed . \n that defines our response in term of signal@xmath31noise . \n we calibrated the detector using @xmath32 and @xmath33 radioactive sources and the cosmic rays . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 \n we used the end - point of the spectrum , even for @xmath33 , because of the poor energy resolution ; for cosmic rays we assumed mimimum ionization particles and changed the mean crossing length altering the angle of the central tile with the others , from parallel ( @xmath34 ) to orthogonal ( @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath36 path length in the scintillator ) . \n fig.[fig : calib ] shows the charge deposited into the scintillator as function of the energy lost .    to isolate the particle crossing orthogonal the detector we registered a sample of cosmic rays with the detector positioned at zenith angle equal @xmath37 degrees . analyzing the charge deposited into the scintillator we found a set of cuts to define a particle crossing the detector within a solid angle of @xmath38 . \n the sample of events selected by these cuts is still contaminated by a background of type a ) , described above . \n the time of flight and the information of the energy deposited in c2 will remove this contribution . \n fig.[fig : adc1vs2 ] shows the charge deposited into tile c1 and c2 by a vertical muon of energy greater than 1 @xmath39 . the poor energy resolution is due to the light collection method : to enhance our time resolution we decided to remove any light yield enhancement technique and take only the light that travels on a straight line , from the interaction point to the photocathode ; \n more precisely , we observed that any further reflection is harmful for time resolution , so we decided to loose the energy resolution to make direct light collection dominant . \n the charge of vertical equivalent muon ( cvem ) , as discussed before , is used to define a set of cuts ( @xmath40 2.5 nc around the average deposited charge ) to select horizontal charged tracks . \n it also let us remove events falling in regions of the scintillator affected by a large time spread in light collection , giving us an enhancement in time resolution ; this has been proved by testing the light collection time uniformity of a single tile , by coincidence with a thin plastic scintillator of signals from a @xmath32 source .      to evaluate the time resolution of the apparatus we put the centers of two tiles at a distance of @xmath41 . \n the distribution obtained , shown in fig.[fig : tres ] , has a @xmath42 . \n then an event with @xmath43 is not a single track passing through c1 and c2 . \n fig.[fig : horiz1 ] shows the time response when the detector is at zenith angle equal @xmath37 ( yellow ) . \n being the distance between the centers of the two tiles @xmath26 the time of flight is @xmath44 ns . the distribution with the detector oriented at zenith equal @xmath45 is also plotted ( blue ) . \n the peaks at @xmath46 correspond to horizontal tracks crossing c1 then c2 or viceversa . \n the events at @xmath47 are generated by two tracks that cross at the same instant the two tiles . \n the results of about 400 hours live time recorded at lowest of a four floor building are summarized in table [ tab : meas ] . at that place \n we are screened by most of the direct gamma shower secondaries in open air . \n .[tab : meas ] cosmic ray flux measured by one unit only;@xmath48 the detector is located at @xmath23 of floor level e - w direction ; @xmath49 for these measurements the setup is show in fig . \n [ fig : setup ] and described in the text [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ tab : meas ] is evaluated the intensity of muon as function of zenith angle corrected by detector efficiency . \n the last six raw give the results obtained pointing the detector to a step of concrete as shown in fig.7 . \n the step drawn on right side ( south - west ) of the layout permits to the muons at large zenith angle ( greater than 88 degrees ) cross at least 50 m of concrete . on the left side ( north ) \n muons cross the detector at angle smaller than 85 degrees directly from the atmosphere . \n the measured difference of the muon flux from north and from south corresponds to about 100 m water equivalent . \n fig.[fig : horiz3 ] shows the c1-c2 time difference ( blue histogram ) for zenith angle 88.8@xmath50 - 81.6@xmath50 . \n yellow histogram is obtained with the detector at zenith equal @xmath37 . \n the measured difference of factor 2 in flux is due to the change of acceptance . \n fig.[fig : horiz4]a shows the results with the detector at zenith angle equal to 75.5@xmath50 - 81.8@xmath50 . at this angle the cosmic rays hit before c1 tile than c2 tile hence the time difference defined @xmath51 is negative . the plot in fig . \n [ fig : horiz4]b shows the adc counts of the c3 tile located between c1 and c2 versus the @xmath51 . by this plot \n we estimate an upper limit to background ( type c , cfr .

it gives , for a @xmath73 observer , a corresponding sensitivity of about @xmath74 , obtained by rescaling for the ratio @xmath75 , that estimates a correction for the assumption of frontal showers . \n the assumption that @xmath72 of live surface is enough to achive this level of discrimination is based on phenomenological studies @xcite . \n in conclusion the background measured for a single module is sufficient for a reliable detection of muons from horizontal showers if the distance of the tiles is between @xmath26 to @xmath76 . \n this setup permits also to have a detector sensitivity of @xmath74 , by an array with a live surface of @xmath77 . at this flux level \n the tau - air showers by gzk neutrinos might be already able to pollute above the atmospheric muon fluxes @xcite . \n therefore a small size array at top of the mountains would be able to reach neutrino astronomy at minimal guaranteed gzk fluence . \n m. i. thanks g. boca for many discussions and the authors are indebted for invaluable technical support from f. pulcinella . \n 99 m. tekedat et al . \n agasa collaboration , astropart . \n 19 447 2003 see http://icecube.wisc.edu niessen p. \n amanda collaboration astro - ph/0306209 t. abu - zayyad et al . \n high resolution fly s eye collaboration , astro - ph/0208243 the pierre auger project design report by auger collaboration fermilab - pub-96 - 024 d. demuth et al . \n submitted to phys . \n lett b march 5 2003 ;

strings that exhibits many features known for real senescence @xcite . \n recently stauffer @xcite in a general review of the penna model has suggested a simpler alternative with less parameters . \n this new attempt is based on the postulate of a minimum reproduction age and a maximal genetic lifespan . \n only these two numbers are transmitted from generation to generation , with certain mutations , by asexual reproduction . \n this simple model shows the basic features required for senescence . \n the age distribution shows an increase of mortality with age . \n the model reproduces successfully the catastrophic senescence of salmon @xcite and some specific human aspects like the social structures of technological societies @xcite or a transition between extinction and survival if a minimal population for survival is required @xcite .    in the following we examine the other modification to the basic model . \n the privilege conditions are introduced to earlier and then to late reproduction . by doing this , in case of late reproduction \n , we achieve the exponential growth of mortality in agreement with the gompertz law . \n the increase of fertility with age exists in nature . \n some fish , lobsters and trees share this feature @xcite and therefore this life strategy has been considered by the penna model also @xcite . \n the population consists of @xmath0 individuals @xmath1 @xmath2 initially . \n each individual is characterized by three integers : its age @xmath3 , its minimum reproduction age @xmath4 and its maximal genetic lifespan @xmath5 with @xmath6 . \n the maximal lifetime is restricted to 32 time units ( called years ) , the minimum reproduction age may be chosen between zero and @xmath7 . within these constraints \n the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are randomly mutated for an offspring by @xmath8 , away from the maternal values , and for each child separately . \n after an @xmath1th individual has reached its minimum reproduction age , it gives birth to one offspring with probability @xmath9 , chosen as @xmath10 thus during its whole mature life any individual gives one offspring at the cumulated probability equal to 1 . \n independently of the genetic death , which happens automatically and unavoidably if @xmath11 , at each time interval an individual can also die `` accidentally '' , with the verhulst probability @xmath12 . \n @xmath13 is called the carrying capacity to account for the fact that any given environment can only support populations up to some maximal size @xmath13 . \n otherwise the individuals die because of food and space limitations .    in this paper differently than in the standard model we consider populations in which the cumulated birth rate is not uniformly distributed among years of reproduction : @xmath14 . \n instead we propose to consider :    1 . \n privilege to younger third part of a reproduction period : @xmath15 2 . \n privilege to older third part of a reproduction period : @xmath16    in the following figures we present characteristics of populations developed when three ways of reproduction are considered : standard , ( a ) and ( b ) models . to avoid possible divergence \n we follow the stauffer recipe @xcite and shift the birth rate accordingly : @xmath17 with @xmath18 . in figure 1 \n we show the population volumes in percentage of the @xmath13 capacity . \n the population where the reproduction of older individuals is privileged , i.e. , model ( b ) , is the smallest one and varies in time by @xmath19 . \n figures 2 , 3 compare the distribution of @xmath20 the minimal reproduction age and @xmath21 the maximal genetic lifespan , respectively , in the three models considered . a significant change in the length of life of individuals \n is observed when the reproduction at old age is favorable , see figure 4 for the distribution of age @xmath22 in a stationary population . \n finally figure 5 shows the mortality in the populations simulated . \n the mortality is calculated according to the formula @xmath23 and plotted on log - scale to extract the gompertz law . \n in stauffer s new proposition of a model for biological ageing , by considering the privilege conditions for time of reproduction we can easily manipulate the mortality in a population . \n when reproduction at old age is preferred then the model provides the mortality in agreement with the gompertz law .    in the simple ageing model discussed here the maximal genetic lifespan for each individual is limited to 32 years \n this limitation was introduced to the model to make results better comparable with many penna model results . \n but one could ask if discarding this assumption would help in getting a nice gompertz law within the standard model . \n this useful suggestion pointed out to us by the referee has motivated us for investigations on the simple ageing model . \n specially we were interested in where the model ( b ) would drive a population . \n preliminary studies show that this model simulated without the limitation for the maximal genetic lifespan leads to the stationary state such that the distribution of @xmath21 is concentrated around age of 50 . \n the mortality in this population is presented in figure 6 . \n one can notice that the gompertz law of the exponential increase of mortality holds for adult individuals at age lower than about 35 . \n m.  argollo de menezes , a.  racco and t.  j.  p.  penna , physica a * 233 * 221 ( 1996 ) ; + m.  argollo de menezes , a.  racco and t.  j.  p.  penna , int \n .  j.  mod . \n c * 9 * 787 ( 1998 ) ; + t.  j.  p.  penna , a.  racco and a.  o.  sousa , physica a * 295 * 31 ( 2001 )", "StartTimeOffset": 2686171686102, "RequestID": "959f9d1caf3e1f56c8c733e2866ddd9a19b9d97b", "TotalTokens": 1313}

solar ) origin . \n therefore up to nearly @xmath9 of meteorites , hitting the earth any year , can be of galactic ( extra - solar ) nature . if the corresponding antimeteorites rate follows the same power law , at any given suppressed ratio , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 the total amount of antibaryons ( baryons ) in the galaxy , ( let say a part over a million or a billion or below ) its signal will be anyway power - full enough to be ( in most cases ) observable . \n indeed the amount of energy released during the annihilation follows common special relativity ; for any light ( milligram unit ) anti - meteorites mass @xmath7 the energy ejected is : @xmath13 its corresponding `` galactic '' event rate , following eq.(1 ) is @xmath14 the event of the anti - meteorite annihilation on the earth atmosphere will give life to unexpected upward gamma shower that will mimic mini nuclear atomic test or extreme upward gamma shower . \n even for a large suppression ratio @xmath15 this event rate derived from expression above ( one a year ) should not escape the accurate batse ten - year monitoring . \n actually the atmosphere area below batse detection is nearly 1% of all earth leading to a total probability rate of 0.1 in ten years . \n however the corresponding secondaries gamma flux by consequent nuclei annihilation showering into charged and neutral pion and their decays and degradation in atmosphere should lead to a huge gamma fluence @xmath16 observable in a near orbit satellite as beppo - sax or gro batse : @xmath17 @xmath18 this latter flux is derived assuming a characteristic galactic velocity v= 300 km / sec for the incoming anti - meteorite and a terrestrial atmosphere of nearly 30 km height . \n such a signal is nearly 10 order of magnitude above the sensitive batse detection threshold . \n smaller scale upward gamma flash are indeed known and they are called `` terrestrial gamma flashes '' . \n they are corresponding to just @xmath19 or @xmath20 erg of isotropic fluence energy ( or even much less energy if originated by beamed upward @xmath21 airshowers at @xmath22 up to nearly horizontal ones at @xmath23 @xcite ) released at millisecond up to ten of second timescales . \n therefore such milligram anti - meteorite bang will be already loudly recorded on data , if they were taking place . \n of course so high large event fluence would not escape also other less sensitive astrophysical or military detectors . \n therefore it seem that milligram antimatter meteorite rain should be totally excluded at very low level ( @xmath24 ) . \n even more dramatic and sharp gamma signature should come by their fast moon annihilation ( because of the absence of atmosphere ) , but at a less ( moon surface over earth one ) rate . \n lunar anti - meteorite annihilation in characteristic nano - second signature , would make very strong signals at lunar orbiting gamma detectors . \n they provide a complementary tool to exclude very light ( micro - gram ) antimeteorite rains at the same severe bound ( @xmath24 ) . \n however these results may be alleviated keeping in mind that antimeteorites can be annihilated or `` evaporated '' during their propagation in galactic gas . \n indeed the column density of atoms ( protons ) crossed assuming @xmath25 and a galactic disk height of @xmath26 pc and a total number of crossing 100 is : @xmath27 @xmath28 . \n each crossed matter atom annihilates on the surface of the rigid body of anti - meteorite . putting the total mass of the crossed matter gas equal to the mass of spherical homogeneous antimeteorite of radius @xmath10 and internal density @xmath29 , \n @xmath30 one obtains that the antimeteorite can not escape complete annihilation , if its radius is smaller , than @xmath31 and the corresponding meteorite mass , given by @xmath32 is ( assuming water density ) about @xmath33 g. the actual value of minimal mass of the antimeteorite , surviving annihilation , may be a few orders of magnitude larger . if we take into account the strong ( cubic ) dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath35 , we find important the increase of @xmath35 due to effects of annihilation with the gas above the disc \n . the mass of antimeteorite , which is completely destroyed by annihilation , can be even larger , if we take into account its atomic composition . to destroy the antimeteorite , which consists of anti - atoms with atomic number @xmath36 , it is not necessary to annihilate all the anti - nucleons in all its antinuclei , since even the result of one proton anti - nucleus annihilation not only destroys the anti - nucleus , but also causes the successive destructive effects by its fragments . \n we discuss the effects of energy and momentum transfer due to such processes in the next section , and only estimate here the increase in the minimal mass of anti - meteorite , surviving after annihilation . \n putting the total number of matter gas atoms , annihilating on the surface of anti - meteorite , equal to the total number of anti - atoms with atomic number @xmath36 in antimeteorite , we obtain instead of @xmath34 the magnitude @xmath37 which is the factor of @xmath38 larger , than @xmath34 . \n this imply that milligram ( and even much heavier , up to @xmath39 g for anti - ice meteorite ) antimeteorites might be suppressed and maybe almost absent in solar system ; previous bound by annihilation on the earth may be considered for heavier ( 10 - 100 milligram or above ) anti - meteorites leading to a ratio ( @xmath40 ) of antimatter allowable . \n bounds by microgram anti - meteorite annihilation on moon soil while being very hard and sharp , will be no more effective than the terrestrial bounds \n . moreover , there are other processes that may dilute above antimeteorite presence in our solar system . \n antimeteorite with a mass heavier than milligram may survive annihilation : however while crossing a gas cloud , their lateral annihilation may heat a meteorite side , leading to a rocket ejection able to decelerate and at large matter gas density gradient even divert and bounce the trajectory . \n however , for realistic density gradients the latter case can not be realized and the momentum transfer due to annihilation causes the antimeteorite deceleration in matter gas , which can be described as follows . \n antimetorite of radius @xmath10 , moving with a velocity @xmath41 in the central field of gas , distributed around the central mass @xmath7 isotropically as @xmath42 experiences the friction force due to annihilation    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the effectiveness of momentum transfer near unity ; assuming an initial anti - meteorite velocity @xmath45 and density @xmath46 and a normal galactic - disk mass density @xmath47 one finds the characteristic relaxation time @xmath21 ( for a millimeter anti - meteorite radius ) :    @xmath48    @xmath49    therefore in a short ( in galactic scales ) times any fast anti - meteorite will be slow down to a velocity comparable with common galactic gas . \n therefore lightest anti - meteorite will follow a co - moving pattern with matter in galactic disk . \n heavier ones ( m @xmath50 g ) will not evaporate and might reach the earth . in presence of any radial gravitational force , near stars or star clusters , the gravitational force @xmath51 and \n the friction action leads to a slow - down free fall up to a steady value . \n the equality of the two forces indeed leads to the constant velocity @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the schwarchild radius of any central body . \n the annihilation friction is effective , resulting in the anti - meteorite deceleration and successive slow drift and final annihilation towards the star center .    in nearly horizontal motions \n the fast anti - meteorite may bounce on the star - planet atmosphere and they may escape from the central field . in the case of general motion and matter gas distribution this effect \n may be estimated by assuming that a fraction of antimatter is annihilated leading to a momentum exchange ( see @xcite ) and a velocity loss @xmath54 :    @xmath55    where @xmath44 is the fraction of annihilation energy going into effective anti - asteroid momentum exchange . being necessary to escape from the galactic plane or from solar atmosphere a @xmath56 one finds    @xmath57    this value can not exceed unity otherwise the anti - meteorite will be totally annihilated ; therefore the @xmath44 efficiency can not be below @xmath58 but its value is bounded by the ratio of the interaction length of charged pions on the meteorite volume ; the 300 mev pion crosses nearly 85 cm in water before interacting ; the total amount of matter crossed during meteorite life - time traveling ( comparable to galactic age ) in the galactic disk is nearly @xmath59 g or @xmath59 cm . of water . \n however in the case of atomic antinuclei composition annihilating with hydrogen of galactic gas the main consequence will be a breakdown of antinuclei . \n its fragments will deposit in a very efficient way ( nearly 50% ) the energy of annihilation into linear momentum as well as increasing the temperature of the solid antimatter body . \n our first estimation show that the effective cooling is keeping the temperature below the solid ( rock ) melting point , while the antimeteorite moves in the galaxy and solar system . \n the equilibrium temperature is established , provided that the heating rate @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the fraction of the total energy , released in the annihilation ( @xmath62 ) ) , that heats the spherically symmetric antimeteorite of radius @xmath10 , moving with velocity @xmath41 in the matter gas of density @xmath63 ) is equal to the rate of radiative cooling @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is the stephan - boltzmann constant ) . in the considered approximation \n both heating and cooling are proportional to the surface area , so that the equilibrium temperature is given by @xmath66 for matter gas number density @xmath67 @xmath68 and anti - meteorite velocity v @xmath69 km / s . \n annihilation of matter gas with antinuclei on the antimeteorite surface leads to its erosion , but its effect , which may deserve special analysis for particular antimeteorite composition , does not lead to significant change of the above estimation for sufficiently large antimeteorites . \n nevertheless the `` ice '' anti - comets might be melt efficiently still in the galaxy and very efficiently near solar and terrestial atmosphere . \n the reason is that the estimated value of @xmath70 can easily be factor of 2 larger , but the antimeteorite , moving with the velocity @xmath71 , with the account for all the uncertainties can be hardly heated up to 1000 k due to the annihilation in the low density matter gas ( with the number density @xmath72 . \n the equilibium condition , rewritten for energy density of radiation ( @xmath73 ) and of annihilation products ( @xmath74 ) in the form @xmath75 , is reached at @xmath76k due to the low values of in - flow velocity @xmath71 and matter gas density @xmath77 , what compensates the large value of annihilation energy release @xmath78 . \n the `` galactic anti - asteroid '' rate on sun from ( 1 ) is @xmath79 the consequent event rate for suppressed anti- asteroids one over a billion is 10 events a year . \n the fluence @xmath16 on earth is @xmath80 and comparable to grb fluence , with a time dilution of nearly 10 seconds \n . therefore it may be well be missed or misunderstood as a low energy solar flare . \n the rarest events at 100 g range may mimic observed solar flares . let us remind that present bounds in solar flare activity may be even detectable at a nano - flare intensity . if the above coincidence is not just the hint of the antimatter meteorites in - fall it provides the present most stringent bound on antimatter \n . it may be useful to mention that the two anti - meteorite searches undertaken in ussr in late 1960-s early 1970-s , even with no confirmation , exhibited the positive effect ( [ 13 ] , see review in [ 14 ] ) . \n so not only stringent limits , but even positive discoveries should be in principle considered in future of such searches . \n anti - meteorites annihilations may provide the challenge to search for antimatter in our galaxy at the same level of sensitivity which is planned to be reached in ams - ii experiment ( a part over a billion ) . \n with all the uncertainty in possible relationship between the total mass of antimatter stars and the expected amount of pieces of antimatter to be ejected by antimatter stellar systems and all the possible reservations our first estimate on earth and solar events are showing rather high sensitivity ( @xmath81 ) in antimatter search can or even might be already reached . \n the work was partially performed in the framework of russian state contract @xmath82 , with partial support of cosmion -
