as a consequence , different ways of approaching the thermodynamic limit may give different results in any problem based on the cayley tree . \n a particular manifestation of this for the antiferromagnet is that finite trees may have a large excess of sites belonging to one sublattice over the other . \n our systematic study of the low energy spectrum of the spin half heisenberg hamiltonian on the cayley tree shows that the effect of sublattice imbalance is to create a `` tower of states '' , lower than the anderson tower of states  @xcite . \n a similar result was obtained by wang and sandvik  @xcite from their study of spin half antiferromagnets on diluted square lattices . aided by numerical calculations , \n we propose a framework for understanding this effect . \n we also find that schwinger boson mean field theory  @xcite is a good description of the many body ground state and can reproduce many of its features quantitatively . \n previous studies of this model by otsuka  @xcite and friedman  @xcite focused primarily on ground state properties and excited states were not considered in these studies . \n more recently kumar et al . \n @xcite have significantly extended this analysis to both the spin-1/2 and spin-1 heisenberg model . \n we use all these studies as useful benchmarks for our own numerical calculations .    from a theorist s perspective \n , the cayley tree achieves many simplifications which makes exact solutions possible , e.g. the bose hubbard model on this lattice was recently solved by semerijan , tarzia and zamponi  @xcite . \n it is also the basis of approximations such as the brinkman - rice treatment of the hubbard model  @xcite . \n more recently , it found applications in the treatment of the quantum impurity problem which is at the heart of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . it does not appear that a spin model has been realized on such a topology experimentally ( though there has been interest in the study of dendrimers  @xcite ) .    in our case , the complete absence of loops makes this lattice conducive for the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm  @xcite . with the dmrg method we have an explicit ( yet compact ) representation of ground and excited state many - body wavefunctions which gives us abundant information to understand the low energy properties of these systems . \n in particular , reduced density matrices can be used as tools to understand properties of these states  @xcite . \n the remainder of the paper is divided as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] \n we introduce the model and lattices being investigated and define a measure of sublattice imbalance associated with them . in section  [ sec : dmrg ] , we give a brief overview of our implementation of the dmrg algorithm applied to generic trees . in section  [ sec : gs ] , we discuss the general properties of the ground state and excited states of the bond - centered cayley tree . in section  [ sec : sma ] , we use a variational ansatz given by the single mode approximation , in conjunction with an argument from first order perturbation theory , to explain the finite size scaling of the spin gap . finally , in section  [ \n sec : sbmft ] , we corroborate our observations of the ground state properties , by the use of the schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) . \n we consider the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 heisenberg model with uniform coupling @xmath2 , @xmath3 in this paper , we use the spin rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg_hamiltonian ] ) , to label many body states by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 refers to the spin of the state and @xmath6 is its @xmath7 component .    on a bipartite lattice ( with sublattices _ a _ and _ b _ ) , like the cayley tree , with @xmath8 sites in sublattice _ a _ and @xmath9 sites in sublattice _ \n , it is rigorously known  @xcite that the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian has a net spin @xmath10 . \n the first kind of tree we consider is the `` bond - centered '' cayley tree of the form depicted in fig .  [ \n fig : bond_site_center](a ) . \n the number of sites @xmath11 for such a cluster is related to the `` generation '' @xmath12 by , @xmath13 since the bond centered clusters have no `` global imbalance '' i.e. @xmath14 , the ground state is a singlet ( and the monotonicity of the energy with total spin @xmath5 implies that the first excited state is a triplet ) .        as mentioned before \n , the notion of `` local sublattice imbalance '' will be crucial in understanding the low energy physics . for the bond centered cluster , we define a measure of imbalance ( which we refer to as @xmath15 from here on ) by dividing the cluster at the central bond into two equal parts . \n we count the excess of one sublattice over the other in one half of the cluster and multiply by 1/2 for spin 1/2 . \n it can be easily shown that @xmath16 is related to the generation @xmath12 as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is for @xmath12 odd(even ) . \n [ fig : bond_site_center](b ) is the more usual way of defining a cayley tree and which we refer to as `` site - centered '' . the number of sites is related to the generation @xmath12 by , @xmath19 unlike the bond centered cluster , a global sublattice imbalance exists here which leads to a ground state spin of @xmath20 . \n we measure the imbalance @xmath21 in either of the three symmetrical arms of the site centered cayley tree : specifically , we count the excess sites of one sublattice over the other ( in one arm ) and multiply by 1/2 . \n this definition is particularly convenient as it gives us @xmath22 for all @xmath12 . a recent publication on the study of the heisenberg model on the cayley tree by kumar , ramasesha and soos  @xcite considers the site - centered clusters . \n we confirm their results for the site - centered case , but interestingly find that the bond - centered cluster has significantly different ground and excited state properties . \n we will provide some brief comparisons in section  [ sec : gs ] to illustrate this point . \n how is the situation different if there is no imbalance locally ? to address this , we introduce the `` fibonacci cayley tree '' . the recipe for constructing the generation @xmath23 \n fibonacci - cayley tree is to combine the generation @xmath12 and @xmath24 trees by connecting their roots ( head sites ) to a common site ( which in turn serves as the root ( head site ) of the generation @xmath23 tree ) . \n [ fig : bond_site_center](c ) illustrates this construction . \n the total number of sites @xmath11 at generation @xmath23 is , @xmath28 observe that @xmath29 satisfies the fibonacci recursion , that is , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the @xmath12-th fibonacci number , which justifies the name of the tree . \n the size of this lattice grows as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the golden ratio @xmath34 . also , every 3rd generation is unbalanced by 1 and every other generation is both globally and locally balanced . \n table  [ table : fibonacci ] shows the sizes of the fibonacci - cayley clusters along with the number of sites in the even and odd sublattices for up to @xmath35 generations . \n .number of sites in a fibonacci - cayley tree as a function of generation @xmath12 . \n @xmath36 is number of @xmath37 sublattice sites ; @xmath38 except for the entries marked with @xmath39 , in which case @xmath40 . \n the total count is @xmath41 .

[ \n fig : lne]-[fig : anr ] we present orbital properties extracted from numerical 4-component relativistic hartree - fock calculations@xcite averaging over the valence configuration @xmath1 for the neutral lanthanide and actinide atoms . \n we have chosen this configuration , which is not the ground state configuration for all the @xmath0 elements , since it gives access to information about the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals . from the orbital energies in fig . \n [ fig : lne ] we observe a distinct energetical separation of the @xmath5 orbitals from the @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals of the lanthanides which explains their chemistry dominated by the @xmath8 oxidation state . \n we note that the @xmath6 levels cross the @xmath7 level towards the end of the series , a feature which may induce convergence problems in atomic calculations not exploiting the full atomic symmetry . \n [ fig : ane ] shows a somewhat different situation for the actinides in that the @xmath9 levels are energetically close to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 levels at the beginning of the series , but are then strongly stabilized towards the end of the series . \n these features translate into a rich oxidation chemistry for the early actinides and a restriction to the @xmath8 oxidation state for the late actinides . \n this in turn explains the challenge of separating the minor actinides americium and curium from the lanthanides in the treatment of nuclear waste [ ref ] . \n looking at mean radii @xmath12 , we observe in fig . \n [ fig : lnr ] a distinct spatial separation of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals in the lanthanides , whereas the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals come quite a bit closer in the actinides . \n [ discuss lanthanide contraction ] it is also interesting to observe that whereas the spin - orbit splitting in the @xmath2 shell is considerably stronger than for the @xmath3 shell , any difference in spatial extent is hardly visible for the spin - orbit components of the @xmath2 shell . \n this can be understood from the fact that the @xmath2 orbitals are in general quite contracted and so any deformation of the orbitals is energetically very much more expensive than for the @xmath3 shell . \n with these observations in mind it was all the more surprising when clavagura _ \n @xcite reported a clear example of @xmath5 participation in bonding in luf@xmath13 since lutetium is at the very end of lanthanide series where one would expect the @xmath5 orbitals to be the most inert . \n the conclusion was seriously questioned by roos _ \n @xcite as well as ramakrishnan _ \n _ @xcite . \n the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the possible @xmath5 participation in luf@xmath13 by an independent approach . \n we employ a trick that may be useful for other purposes as well . \n we extend our electronic structure analysis to all trihalides ( x = f , cl , br , i ) of lutetium as well as of lawrencium . \n we thereby provide a comparison of covalency between these two elements , of relevance for the delicate problem of separation of the late actinides from the lanthanides . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] we describe our methodological approach . \n computational details are given in section [ sec : comp ] . in section [ sec : results ] we present and discuss the results of our geometry optimizations and electronic structure analysis , before concluding in section [ sec : conclusion ] . \n the question about the participation of @xmath2 orbitals in bonding in the lanthanides and actinides is very much a leading question :    1 . \n it assumes that one can identify these atomic orbitals in the electronic structure of the molecule . \n it assumes that one can unambiguously distinguish bonding from non - bonding contributions to the electronic structure of the molecule .    in order to tackle the first point we perform 4-component relativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) and kohn - sham ( ks ) calculations of the trihalides of lutetium and lawrencium ( lux@xmath13 and lrx@xmath13 , x = f , cl , br and i ) and investigate their electronic structure by projection analysis@xcite , that is we expand the molecular orbitals ( mos ) in pre - calculated orbitals ( index @xmath14 ) of the constituent atoms ( index @xmath15 ) . \n @xmath16 the fragment orbitals are usually restricted to the occupied orbitals of the selected configurations of the constituent atoms of the molecule . \n the expansion is completed by the polarization contribution @xmath17 which by construction is orthogonal to the fragment orbitals . once the expansion coefficients @xmath18 have been obtained a population analysis may be carried out completely analogous to , but without the basis set sensitivity of a mulliken population analysis . \n the selection of fragment orbitals should be adjusted if the gross population of the polarization contribution is significant . \n the next point is somewhat more difficult due to the invariance of the electronic energy under rotations of the occupied orbitals of these closed - shell molecules . \n this rotational freedom can be exploited to transform from canonical hartree - fock or kohn - sham orbitals to localized orbitals , or , in the terminology of mulliken@xcite , from spectroscopic to chemical mos . \n however , there is an abundance of possible localization criteria and thus perhaps not a clear answer from such an approach . \n the problem would have been simpler for the trihalide of any other lanthanide than lutetium since one would then expect inert @xmath5 orbitals to form an open shell . \n there would accordingly be a _ variance _ of the electronic energy with respect to rotations between the open- and closed - shell orbitals . \n however , this immediately suggests the strategy that we will pursue in this paper : we will place @xmath5 orbitals from an atomic calculation in an artificial open - shell with fractional occupation close to , but not equal to 14 . \n if the @xmath2 atomic orbitals now localize to the open shell , we have unambiguous evidence that they are chemically inert . \n all calculations reported in this paper are based on the 4-component dirac - coulomb hamiltonian with a gaussian charge distribution as the nuclear model using the recommended values of ref . \n the numerical atomic calculations were performed using the grasp code @xcite . \n molecular relativistic 4-component hartree - fock and density functional ( pbe @xcite and b3lyp @xcite ) calculations were carried out using the dirac08 package @xcite . \n we employed the cc - pvtz gaussian basis sets of dunning and co - workers @xcite for f , cl and br and equivalent sets of dyall and co - workers @xcite for i , lu and lr . the small component basis set for the 4-component relativistic calculations has been generated using restricted kinetic balance imposed in the canonical orthonormalization step@xcite . \n all basis sets are used in uncontracted form . \n hf and ks geometry optimizations were carried out using analytic and numerical gradients , respectively . for pyramidal ( @xmath19 ) and planar ( @xmath20 ) structures we employed the lower c@xmath21 and c@xmath22 symmetries , respectively . \n test calculations with cc - pvdz basis sets indicate that the resported structures can be considered converged with respect to the chosen basis sets . for the projection analysis fragment orbitals \n were generated by average - of - configuration hf calculations and ks calculations with fractional occupation , corresponding to ground state electronic configurations of the atoms . \n in table [ tab : lux3 ] , [ tab : lrx3 ] we present hf , b3lyp and pbe calculation for lutetium and lawrencium trihalides lux@xmath13 , lrx@xmath13 ( x = f , cl , br , i ) respectively . for the former trihalides , the lux@xmath13 , \n there exist a large number of theoretical works whereas very limited works concerned the lawrencium trihalides . since we will discuss the two table separately . in table [ tab : \n lux3 ] we summarise our result together with theoretical and experimental values from the literature , given also in the table the method ( or the hamiltonian ) and the basis set used to obtain these values . \n firs of all looking to the bond lengths in table [ tab : lux3 ] on see that our values using b3lyp have the best agreement with experimental ones and second there is a good agreement with the literature for the respective method ( or hamiltonian ) , especially with the hf values of ref . @xcite,@xcite and the pbe of ref . \n + concerning the geometrical shape and the bond angle we see that hf give a planer geometry for all the trihalides whereas b3lyp and pbe gives a pyramidal geometry for the luf@xmath13 only and a planar geometry for the other trihlides . \n increasing of the bond angle towards the heavier trihlides can be understood having in mind that the heaver halides have weaker ability to polarize the metal atom which means less distribution of the electronic density around the metal atom favoring a planar geometry with the highest bond angel of 120 grad and longer bond length towards the heavier halides as seen in table [ tab : lux3 ] . \n +      we have studied the possible @xmath5 orbital participation in bonding in luf@xmath13 by the approach presented in sections [ sec : theory ] and [ sec : comp ] . \n the results are summarized in table [ tab : luf3 ] . \n we first calculated the neutral lutetium atom in @xmath23 with linear supersymmetry . \n the resulting coefficients were exported to @xmath24 symmetry . \n the lu @xmath5 orbitals were next imported into a molecular calculation on luf@xmath13 in the optimized pyramidal geometry and kept frozen in an initial calculation on the neutral molecule . \n starting from the resulting molecular coefficients a series of ks calculations with fractional occupation , that is 14-@xmath25 electrons ( @xmath26 $ ] ) in 14 spinors , were carried out and the resulting molecular orbitals studied by projection analysis . in each calculation vector for each occupied orbital \n was selected based on overlap with the starting molecular coefficients . \n however , it is seen from table [ tab : luf3 ] that the electronic energy goes smoothly into the energy of the fully relaxed neutral molecule as the hole @xmath25 tends towards zero , indicated that we indeed obtained the ground state of the molecule for each value of @xmath25 . \n +   + * conclusions*[sec : conclusion ] the presented four component relativistic result for the trihalides of lutetium and lawrencium , lux3 , lrx3 ( x= f , cl , br , i ) respectively using density functional theory ( dft ) shows that the trend of bonding is from lighter to the heavier halide atoms and between 4f/5f atoms lu and lr .

{"ContextTokens": 3354, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "turbulent motions are commonly observed within several phases of the interstellar medium ( see elmegreen & scalo 2005 ) . within the molecular gas phase , turbulent gas flows are supersonic and possibly , super - alfvenic , and play a dual role in the dynamics and evolution of these regions . \n turbulence can provide a non - thermal , macroscopic pressure that lends support against self - gravity . \n in addition , compressible , supersonic flows may promote star formation by generating density perturbations within the shocks of colliding gas streams that eventually evolve into self - gravitating or collapsing protostellar cores ( padoan & nordlund 2002 ; mac low & klessen 2004 ) . \n spectroscopy of molecular line emission , especially the rotational lines of co , have long been the primary measurement from which turbulence is defined . \n in fact , supersonic motions are inferred from the very first co spectrum observed by wilson , jefferts , & penzias ( 1970 ) in which there is a 5 km / s wide line core in addition to the broad 100 km / s wing component that was later attributed to a luminous protostellar outflow . \n the 5 km / s core is significant broader than the sound speed of molecular hydrogen assuming a temperature of 30 k.    owing to advancing instrumentation at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths , our ability to measure the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas phase of the interstellar medium has greatly expanded since that initial co spectrum . \n sensitive , millimeter wave interferometers routinely probe the circumstellar environments about young stellar objects . \n sensitive bolometer imaging arrays identify the sites of protostellar and pre - protostellar cores ( see andre in these proceedings ) . \n heterodyne focal plane arrays on single dish telescope enable the construction of high spatial dynamic range imaging of molecular line emission ( heyer 1999 ) . \n an example of such imaging is displayed in figure  [ taurus ] . \n it reveals the varying texture of co line emission imprinted by the effects of gravity , turbulence , and magnetic fields . \n a diffuse , low surface brightness component extends across the field and contains localized `` streaks '' of emission that are aligned along the local magnetic field direction . \n the sequence of channel images show low column density material moving toward the dense , highly structured filaments that are more apparent in @xmath0co images and extinction maps . \n the challenge to the astronomer is to synthesize the information that is resident within these data cubes with suitable analysis tools to place these into a physical context in order to test and constrain model descriptions of turbulence within the molecular interstellar medium . \n co j=1 - 0 integrated emission from the taurus molecular cloud observed with the _ five college radio astronomy observatory _ \n 14 m telescope and _ sequoia _ focal plane array . \n the high spatial dynamic range reveals varying textures across the cloud and clues to the prevailing physical processes . ] \n a primary goal in the study of ism physics is to determine the degree of spatial correlation of velocities from observational data . the velocity structure function , @xmath1 ) , defined as @xmath2 provides a statistical measure of the q@xmath3 order of velocity differences of a field as a function of spatial displacement or lag , @xmath4 . for q=2 , @xmath5 , \n the autocorrelation function , @xmath6 , and the power spectrum are equivalent statistical measures of the velocity field . \n @xmath5 is related to the autocorrelation function as @xmath7 and @xmath6 is the fourier transform of the power spectrum .    within the inertial range of a gas flow , the structure function \n is expected to vary as a power law with spatial lag , @xmath8 taking the q@xmath3 root of the structure function , this expression can be recast into an equivalent linear form , @xmath9 where @xmath10 . the power law index , @xmath11 , measures the degree of spatial correlation and is predicted by model descriptions of turbulence ( ex . @xmath12=1/3 for kolmogorov flow ) . \n the normalization , @xmath13 , is the amplitude of velocity fluctuations at a fixed scale and offers a convenient measure of the energy density of a flow .    while the expression for the structure function of a velocity field appears straightforward , the construction of @xmath14 from observational data is , in fact , quite challenging . \n observers do not measure velocity _ fields _ , @xmath15 . \n rather , the basic unit of data is a spectrum of line emission that represents a convolution and line of sight integration of density , velocity , and temperature . \n furthermore , the effects of chemistry , opacity , and noise can mask or hide contributions to the line profile from features along the line of sight . despite these limitations , \n there have been several demonstrated methods to recover the spatial statistics of gmc velocity fields from spectroscopic imaging data . \n + * analysis of velocity centroids * : a spectroscopic data cube can be condensed into a 2 dimensional image of centroid velocities determined from the set of line profiles . \n the spatial statistics of velocity centroids can be formally related to those of the 3 dimensional velocity field ( see ossenkopf etal 2006 ) . with the centroid velocity image , one can assess the power spectrum and hence structure function directly or apply a kernel to calculate the variance of centroid velocities over varying scales ( ossenkopf etal 2006 ) . \n this method works best under uniform density conditions ( brunt & mac low 2004 ) or with an iterative scheme to account for density fluctuations within the measured power of the observed signal . + * velocity channel analysis * : lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) demonstrate a relationship between the power spectra of measured line emission and the respective spectra of the density and velocity fields . \n the relationship depends on the width of the velocity interval . by calculating the power spectra for both thick and thin velocity windows \n , one can estimate the power law indices for both the density and velocity fields . \n + * principal component analysis * : the spectroscopic data cube is re - ordered onto a set of eigenvectors and eigenimages ( heyer & schloerb 1997 ; brunt & heyer 2002 ) . \n the eigenvectors describe the velocity differences in line profiles and the eigenimages convey where those differences occur on the sky . \n the structure function is constructed from the velocity and angular scales determined from the set of respective eigenvectors and eigenimages that are significant with respect to the noise of the data . to date , the results from pca have been empirically linked to the velocity structure function parameters based on models under a broad range of physical and observational conditions ( brunt & heyer 2002 ; brunt etal 2003 ) . \n the three methods described in the previous section provide valuable tools to determine the velocity structure function for a singular interstellar cloud from a set of spectroscopic imaging data \n . however , for most observations , the statistical and systematic errors for the derived power law index for a given cloud is large ( @xmath16 10 - 20% ) and preclude a designation of a turbulent flow type . \n moreover , given the broad diversity of environments and physical conditions within the molecular ism , any single measurement of a cloud is unlikely to characterize the complete population . \n therefore , it is imperative to analyze a large sample of molecular clouds to assess the impact of local effects and to identify trends and differences .    for velocity \n centroid analysis , miesch & bally ( 1994 ) analyzed a set of 12 clouds or sub - regions within giant molecular clouds . \n they determine a mean value of @xmath17 to be 0.43@xmath180.15 . using pca , \n heyer & brunt ( 2004 ) studied 28 clouds in the perseus and local spiral arms and found @xmath17=0.49@xmath180.15 . \n this mean value for @xmath17 is consistent with highly supersonic turbulence in which the velocity field is characterized by ubiquitous shocks from converging gas streams . \n the observed distribution of @xmath17 would exclude a kolmogorov description of incompressible turbulence unless the velocity fields are characterized by strong intermittency . \n moreover , they identified the surprising result that the scaling coefficient , @xmath13 , exhibits little variation from cloud to cloud , despite the large range in cloud sizes and star formation activity . \n effectively , when the individual structure functions are overlayed onto a single plot , they form a nearly co - linear set of points ( see figure  [ uniplot ] ) . \n co j=1 - 0 data cubes ( heyer & brunt 2004 ) . \n the nearly co - linear set of points attest to the near - invariant functional form of structure functions despite the large range in size and star formation activity . \n the filled circles are the upper endpoints for each structure function and are equivalent to the size and global line - width for each cloud . ] \n a necessary consequence of this universality is the larson ( 1981 ) cloud - to - cloud size - linewidth relationship . \n basically , the upper endpoint of each individual structure function corresponds to the global size and line width of a cloud ( filled points in figure  [ uniplot ] ) . \n this set of endpoints are correlated only by the fact that the individual velocity structure functions are described by similar values for @xmath17 and @xmath13 . \n if there were significant variations of these parameters , then the scatter of points on the cloud - to - cloud relationship would be much larger than is observed . \n using monte carlo simulations to model the scatter of line - width and size for gmcs in the inner galaxy , heyer & brunt ( 2004 ) constrain the variation of @xmath17 and @xmath13 to be less than 10 - 15% . \n the measurements of velocity structure functions in the molecular ism point to supersonic turbulent flows in which energy is dissipated in shocks . unless this energy is replenished within a crossing time , the velocity field would evolve into a kolmogorov flow comprised exclusively of solenoidal or eddy - like motions . \n the fact that we observe supersonic turbulence demonstrates that such driving sources must be present in the molecular ism . \n miesch & bally ( 1994 ) summarize candidate sources of energy that could sustain the observed turbulent motions . \n these include sources that may be resident within the molecular cloud such as protostellar outflows and intermediate and external sources such as hii regions , supernova remnants , and galactic shear . while all such sources make some contribution , it is important to assess whether any one process is the dominant source .    as first noted by larson ( 1981 ) , \n the universality of velocity structure functions imply a common , _ external _ source of energy . otherwise , those regions with significant localized sources would exhibit significant departures from the observed universal relationship . \n however , gmcs with rich young clusters , and ob stars show the same amplitude of velocity fluctuations as low mass star forming clouds or even those few clouds with negligible star formation activity ( heyer , williams , & brunt 2006 ) . \n either there are self - regulating processes independent of energy input scales that maintain this amplitude for most interstellar clouds or such internal energy sources contribute only a small fraction of the energy budget of a molecular cloud . \n large scale driving is also implied by the observation that most of the kinetic energy of a cloud is distributed over the largest scales ( brunt 2003 ) . \n this is illustrated in figure  [ drive ] , which displays the first and second pca eigenimages derived from @xmath19co j=1 - 0 emission from the ngc  7538 molecular cloud . \n the first eigenimage is similar to an integrated intensity image over the full velocity range of the cloud . \n the second eigenimage exhibits a dipole - like distribution that identifies the large scale shear across the cloud . \n all clouds studied by heyer & brunt ( 2004 ) exhibit this dipole distribution in the second eigenimage . for comparison , we show the first two eigenimages calculated from simulated observations of velocity and density fields produced by computational models that are driven at small , intermediate , and large scales . using the ratio of characteristic scales determined from each eigenimage \n , one can quantitatively show that the observations are best described by a large scale driving force ( brunt 2003 ) . \n protostellar outflows can have a significant but localized impact on a sub - volume of a cloud and can redistributed energy and momentum to large scales ( see bally in these proceedings ) . \n however , it seems quite unlikely that an ensemble of widely distributed outflows within the cloud s volume , can generate the large scale shear that is observed within all molecular clouds analyzed to date . \n co j=1 - 0 emission from the ngc  7538 molecular cloud and model spectra from computation simulations driven at small , intermediate , and large scales ( mac low 1999 ) . \n most observations of molecular clouds exhibit a dipole distribution in the second eigenimage that places most of the kinetic energy within the largest scales of a cloud . \n the observations are more congruent with computational simulations driven at scales larger than or equal to the size of the cloud . ] \n our understanding of turbulence in the molecular interstellar medium has greatly advanced over the last 10 years owing to more sophisticated computational simulations and ever improving observations . however , there are more critical questions to address to improve these descriptions of turbulence and the role it plays in the star formation process . \n * does the shape of the velocity structure function for a given region change at spatial scales smaller than current resolution limits ? \n * does the universality of velocity structure functions extend to the extreme environment of the galactic center ? * \n are velocity fields of interstellar clouds anisotropic as predicted by the theory of strong , mhd turbulence ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ) ? \n new telescopes , instrumentation , and analysis methods will be required to address these questions . \n alma will provide both sensitivity and angular resolution to investigate velocity structure functions at the smallest scales and for distant gmcs . \n the large millimeter telescope will offer the capability to study the low surface brightness component of the molecular ism to trace the transition from turbulent diffuse material to the dense proto - stellar and proto - cluster cores . \n these instruments , and others , offer exciting , scientific opportunities to advance our knowledge of interstellar turbulence . \n this work was supported by nsf grant ast 05 -

{"ContextTokens": 3631, "GeneratedTokens": 221, "SynthesizedBody": "-5 mm    many problems in biology , chemistry and material science can be formulated as the study of the energy or free energy landscape of the underlying system . \n well - known examples of such problems include the conformational changes of macromolecules , chemical reactions and nucleation in condensed systems . \n very often the dimension of the state space is very large , and the energy landscape exhibits a hierarchy of structures and scales . \n these problems are becoming a major challenge in their respective scientific disciplines and are beginning to receive attention from the mathematics community . in this article , we report recent work in this direction . for a detailed account , we refer to @xcite . \n we begin with a simple example . \n plotted in figure 1 is the solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath0 where the potential @xmath1 and @xmath2 is gaussian white noise , @xmath3 . without the random perturbation , \n the solution would be @xmath4 . \n indeed the deterministic part of dynamics in does nothing but taking the system to local equilibrium states . with the random perturbation , \n the solution , over long time , exhibits completely different behavior . \n it fluctuates around the two local minima of @xmath5 and 1 , with sudden transitions between these two states . \n the time scale of the transition , @xmath6 is much larger than the time scale of the fluctuation around the local minima , @xmath7 . for this reason \n , we refer to @xmath8 and 1 as the metastable states . \n time series of the solution to the stochastic differential equation ( 1.1 ) , with @xmath9 . \n obviously the transition between the metastable states is of more interest than the local fluctuation around them . \n the transition time is much larger since it requires the system to overcome the energy barrier between the two states . \n this is only possible because of the noise . \n when @xmath10 is small , a huge noise term is required to accomplish this . \n for this reason , such events are very rare , and this is the origin of the disparity between the time scales @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n this simple example illustrates one of the major difficulties in modeling such systems , namely the disparity of the time scales . \n it does not , however , illustrate the other major difficulty , namely , the large dimension of the state space and the complexity of the energy landscapes . \n indeed for typical systems of interests the energy landscape can be very complex . \n there can be a huge number of local minima in the state space . \n the usual concept of hopping over barriers via saddle points may not apply ( see @xcite ) .    in applications , \n the noise comes typically from thermal noise . in this case \n , we should note that even though the potential energy landscapes might be rough and contain small scale features , the system itself experiences a much smoother landscape , the free energy landscape , since some of the small scale features on the potential energy landscape are smoothed out by the thermal noise . \n our objective in modeling such systems are the following :    1 .   find the transition mechanism between the metastable states . \n 2 .   find the transition rates . \n 3 .   reduce the original dynamics to the dynamics of a markov chain on the metastable states . \n our discussion will be centered around the following model problems : @xmath11 or @xmath12 @xmath10 is related to the temperature of the system by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant . \n we refer to as type - i gradient flow and as type - ii gradient flow .    before proceeding further , \n let us remark that there is a very well - developed theory , the large - deviation theory , or the wentzell - freidlin theory @xcite , that deals precisely with questions of the type that we discussed above . \n however as was explained in @xcite , this theory is not best suited for numerical purpose . \n therefore we will seek an alternative theoretical framework that is more useful for numerical computations . \n -5 mm    transition state theory ( tst ) @xcite has been the classical framework for addressing the questions we are interested in . \n it assumes the existence and explicit knowledge of a reaction coordinate , denoted by @xmath15 , that connects the two metastable states . \n in addition it assumes that along the reaction coordinate there exists a well - defined transition state , which is typically the saddle point configuration , say at @xmath16 , and the two regions @xmath17 and @xmath18 defines the two metastable regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for these reasons , \n transition state theory is restricted to cases when the system is simple and the energy landscape is smooth , i.e. the energy barriers are larger than the thermal energy @xmath21 .    knowing the transition state \n , tst calculates the transition rates by placing particles at the transition state , and measuring the flux that goes into the two regions . \n for example , the transition rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is given approximately by @xmath22 where @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the surface delta function at @xmath16 , @xmath25 is the heaviside function , @xmath26 is the lebesgue measure restricted to @xmath19 . for a system with a single particle of mass @xmath27 and potential @xmath28 \n , this gives @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy barrier at the transition state , @xmath31 , @xmath32 denotes the location of the local minimum inside @xmath19 . \n formulas such as are the origin of the arrhenius law for chemical reaction rates and boltzmann factor for hopping rates in kinetic monte carlo models . \n -5 mm    for simplicity , we will discuss mainly type - i gradient flows . \n the fokker - planck equation can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the equilibrium distribution @xmath35 @xmath36 is the normalization constant @xmath37 . \n the states of the markov chain consist of the sets @xmath38 , where @xmath38 satisfies    1 . \n the @xmath39 s are mutually disjoint 2 . \n @xmath40    where @xmath41 . \n an illustration of the collection the @xmath38 is given in figure 2 . \n @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 . \n as @xmath43 decreases , the @xmath39 s exhibits a hierarchical structure . \n illustration of the collection of metastable sets @xmath42 at different energies . \n having defined the states of the markov chain , we next compute the transition rates between neighboring states . \n denote by @xmath19 and @xmath20 two such neighboring states . \n we would like to compute the transition rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . without loss of generality \n , we may assume @xmath44 . \n let @xmath45 be the metastable region containing @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , and let @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . applying laplace s method to ( 3.1 ) \n we get @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 is a so - called minimal energy path , to be defined below , @xmath52 is the family of hyperplanes normal to @xmath53 . \n the minimal energy path ( mep ) is defined as follows . if @xmath28 is smooth \n , then @xmath53 is a mep if @xmath54 for all @xmath55 $ ] , i.e. @xmath56 restricted to @xmath53 is parallel to @xmath53 . in general \n there is not a unique @xmath53 that is particularly significant , but rather a collection ( a tube or several tubes ) of paths contribute to the transition rates . \n however , one can define a mep self - consistently via the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 . in the case when @xmath28 has two scales : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is smooth , then @xmath53 can be defined as the mep of @xmath61 .    for type - i gradient systems , if the two metastable sets are separated by a single saddle point , then the mep is the unstable manifold associated with the saddle point . \n mep for type - ii gradient systems is less trivial . in this case \n ( 3.3)-(3.6 ) have to be modified @xcite . \n consider the simple example @xmath62 where @xmath63 . \n it has two local equilibrium states @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n the mep that connects @xmath19 and @xmath20 is plotted in figure 3 . \n it is not a smooth curve . \n the velocity is reversed at the saddle point . to verify that the mep does reflect the true behavior of the transition path \n , we also plot the transition path obtained from direct simulation of the stochastic differential equation . \n mep for type - ii gradient systems . \n the red line is the mep in phase space , the green line is the transition path computed from solving the stochastic differential equation . \n mep is a very important concept since it defines the `` most probable '' transition path from which transition rates can be computed via equation . \n however we should emphasize that from a numerical point of view our task is not that of a conventional optimization or control problem , since there is not an objective function that we can easily work with . \n instead our aim is to perform importance sampling in path space to sample the paths that contribute significantly to the switching . \n finally , if there exists a mep that connects two metastable sets without going through a third one , then we connect these two metastable sets by a link . in this way \n , we form a graph . \n the original dynamics is then reduced to a markov chain on this graph . \n -5 mm    a variety of numerical techniques have been developed , most prominently in chemistry , but also in biology and material science , for computing meps and sometimes transition rates . among the most well - known techniques in the chemistry literature \n are the nudged elastic band method and the transition path sampling technique . \n the nudged elastic band method ( neb ) @xcite aims at computing the mep defined by ( 3.5 ) . \n it represents the mep by a discrete chain of states . \n these states evolve according to the potential forces of the system . \n to prevent the states from all falling to the two local equilibrium states , a spring force is applied to neighboring states to penalize the non - uniformity in the distribution of the states along the chain . \n this by itself may cause convergence to a path which is not a mep . \n hence a nudging technique is used , namely only the normal component of the potential force and the tangential component of the spring force is applied . \n neb is a very effective method for small systems with relatively smooth energy landscapes . \n it has two main drawbacks . \n one is that it is highly inefficient and may not even be applicable to systems with rough energy landscapes . \n the other is the choice of the elastic constant . \n a large elastic constant requires a small time step in the evolution of the states . \n a small elastic constant will not achieve the desired uniformity of the states and hence will not give the required accuracy for the energy barrier . \n a second important technique is transition path sampling ( tps ) @xcite . \n this method aims at complex systems with rough energy landscapes by developing a monte carlo technique that samples the path space . \n its efficiency hinges on the ability to produce new accepted paths from old ones . \n other techniques include the ridge method , blue mooth sampling , etc . @xcite . \n often these methods require knowing beforehand the reaction coordinate . \n al propose to minimize the onsager -

{"ContextTokens": 3739, "GeneratedTokens": 159, "SynthesizedBody": "gravitational lensing is now a well established field of astronomy , with a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications . among the many interesting and important implications of lensing phenomena \n is the possibility of interference effects between lensed images of point - like astrophysical sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n if the angular separation of the images of a point - like source is comparable to the wavelength of the light , interference between the lensed images will lead to a distinctive fringe pattern both in coordinate space and in energy spectrum . \n the interference pattern in the energy spectrum will depend upon the location of the detector . \n since well separated detectors will see different patterns , there is a distinctive signature of the effect . \n if gamma - ray bursters are of cosmological origin they would be small enough to act as point - like sources , and lenses of extremely small masses , @xmath2 , ( @xcite ) . ] \n would produce a frequency - dependent signal in their spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n for source and lens at cosmological distances , the angular separation of the images would be in the femto - arcsec range , so the phenomenon was dubbed `` femtolensing '' by gould ( 1992 ) . \n for source and lens of cosmological distances , the einstein ring radius is @xmath3 cm . \n this means that if two gamma - ray burst detectors are separated by distances larger than @xmath4 , typically one detector will be within the einstein ring and the other will not . \n measurement of different fluxes in two widely separated detectors would extend the detectable range of lens masses to @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , which can be called picolensing . \n thus , femtolensing and picolensing could be a probe of dark matter in a mass range difficult to probe by other means , not to mention settle the issue of the origin of gamma - ray bursters . \n although the phenomenon of femtolensing ( henceforth we omit picolensing for brevity , but everywhere below we mean both phenomena ) is quite intriguing , the possibility has not attracted a great deal of attention because of a lack of attractive femtolens candidates . among the front runners in an admittedly weak field \n are snowballs , black holes , and small molecular clouds . \n snowballs ( lumps of primordial h and he ) are generally believed to evaporate on time scales shorter than the hubble time ( @xcite ) and for this reason they are not very attractive . \n a significant fraction of closure density in black holes in the requisite mass range seems difficult to arrange without a very peculiar spectrum of primordial fluctuations to prevent too many small holes which would be evaporating now . as an unattractive possibility in a field of even more unpalatable choices , small molecular clouds \n are usually considered the best bet for femtolensing . \n even if one thought of a way to arrange baryons into femto - mass objects , it is unlikely that they would contribute a large enough fraction of closure density for a reasonable optical depth for femtolensing . \n even if _ all _ baryonic matter would form femtolenses , their density is constrained by big - bang nucleosynthesis to be less than about 10% of closure density . \n since non - baryonic dark matter is expected to dominate the mass density of the universe , perhaps it is easier to arrange a near critical density of _ non - baryonic _ material into objects capable of femtolensing . \n but most particle dark matter candidates are very weakly interacting , and they would not be expected to clump on the femtolensing mass and density scales .    in this paper \n we shall show that the situation may be different if axions are the dark matter . here \n we outline a scenario where a significant cosmological density of axion miniclusters ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1994a ) form with the necessary properties to be natural candidates both for femto- and picolensing . \n the invisible axion is among the best motivated candidates for cosmic dark matter . \n the axion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is the pseudo - nambu  goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath6 global symmetry known as the peccei \n quinn , or pq , symmetry introduced to explain the apparent smallness of strong cp - violation in qcd ( @xcite ) . \n there are stringent astrophysical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and cosmological ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) constraints on the properties of the axion . in particular , \n the combination of cosmological and astrophysical considerations restrict the axion decay constant @xmath7 and the axion mass @xmath8 to be in the narrow windows @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . \n the contribution to the mean density of the universe from axions in this window is guaranteed to be cosmologically significant . \n thus , if axions exist , they will be dynamically important in the present evolution of the universe . \n the axion is effectively massless well above the qcd confinement temperature of a few hundred mev . at the confinement scale and below \n , qcd effects produce a potential for the axion of the form @xmath11 $ ] , where the axion field was parametrised as a dimensionless angular variable @xmath12 . above the qcd scale \n there is no reason for the axion field to be at its low - temperature potential minimum , so as the axion potential turns on the field must relax to the minimum of the potential . \n thus the energy density in axions corresponds to coherent scalar field oscillations , driven by a displacement of the initial value of the field ( the `` misalignment '' angle ) away from the eventual minimum of the temperature - dependent potential . \n there will be nothing special in the subsequent evolution of the axion field if the initial misalignment angle is constant throughout the universe . \n this may in fact be a reasonable picture if the universe underwent inflation with the `` re - heat '' temperature well below @xmath7 . however , equally plausible early - universe scenarios lead to fluctuations of order unity in the misalignment angle on scales larger than the hubble radius as the potential starts to develop . since the final energy density depends upon the initial misalignment angle , spatial fluctuations in the misalignment angle \n are transformed into spatial fluctuations in the axion density , which later lead to tiny gravitationally bound `` miniclusters . '' \n it is easy to understand that miniclusters will be very dense objects . \n background axion density scales with temperature as @xmath13 for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the entropy density and @xmath16 is the temperature of equal matter and radiation energy densities . \n consider a region with axion over - density , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is larger than unity . \n the matter density in that region will dominate the radiation density at a temperature @xmath19 . at this time the density fluctuation became non - linear , separate out from the cosmological expansion , gravitationally collapse , relax , and form a minicluster with the approximate density it had at @xmath20 . \n a detailed study of this leads to a final minicluster density of ( @xcite ) @xmath21 even a relatively small increase in @xmath18 is important because the final density depends upon @xmath22 for @xmath23 .    in hogan & rees ( 1988 ) \n it was assumed that typical values of @xmath18 corresponding to a minicluster are of order unity . \n the typical mass of a minicluster in hogan & rees ( 1988 ) was assumed to correspond to the mass of all axions inside the horizon at @xmath24 mev , with the result @xmath25 .    in our numerical investigations of the dynamics of the axion field around the qcd epoch ( @xcite , 1994a ) we found that as the oscillations commence , important , previously neglected , non - linear effects of the field self - interaction can result in the formation of transient soliton - like objects we called axitons . \n the non - linear effects result in regions with @xmath18 much larger than unity , possibly as large as several hundred , leading to enormous minicluster densities . \n we also found that the minicluster mass scale is set by the total mass in axions within the hubble radius at a temperature around @xmath26 gev when axion mass is equal to @xmath27 . \n this lowers the minicluster mass from the estimate of hogan and rees to about @xmath28 . \n our previous calculations suggested that miniclusters could be a candidate for femtolensing . \n we have since extended and improved our original calculation of the properties of axion miniclusters using the same approach as in @xcite , but with better numerical resolution and using a different spectrum of initial fluctuations of @xmath12 . \n the new calculation confirmed the basic picture of minicluster formation and sharpened the predictions of the masses , radii , and abundance of miniclusters . in the next section \n we summarize the results relevant for femtolensing . \n the evolution of the axion field in an expanding , spatially flat universe during the epoch when axion mass switches on is governed by a wave - like equation with a non - linear , time - dependent potential ( @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the conformal time ( normalized to @xmath33 when the inverse of the axion mass is equal to the hubble radius  i.e . , \n @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is the laplacian with respect to comoving coordinates . \n the factor of @xmath36 in this equation arises from the way the potential develops due to instanton effects : @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .    as an initial conditions in the new calculation we considered the possibility that the main source of axions is provided by the decay of axion strings prior to @xmath39 \n ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n this might be expected if the reheating temperature after inflation is larger than the temperature of the peccei - quinn phase transition . \n in such a scenario the spectral energy density of axions produced by string decay corresponds to a power law : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( recall that the axion effectively is massless prior to @xmath42 ) . \n this corresponds to @xmath43 for the fourier amplitudes of the axion field . in our latest calculations we used initial conditions at @xmath42 with amplitudes of the fourier modes corresponding to the above spectrum and with random phases . \n overall amplitude was chosen to ensure rms value of @xmath12 to be @xmath44 .    the final density distribution of axions in one of the 2-dimensional slices through the integration volume is shown in figure 1 . \n three high amplide density peaks which are seen on this figure results from non - linear interaction and are absent in the case of the harmonic potential . \n they form miniclusters of interest at @xmath45 . \n the evolution of the axion field with the above initial conditions was qualitatively similar to the evolution using the white - noise initial conditions of our previous calculations . from the results of the numerical calculation we determined the mass , radius , and abundance of axion miniclusters . \n minicluster mass . \n _ the mass of axion minicluster is set by the scale when axion oscillations commence . as mentioned above , \n we have defined @xmath46 as a temperature when the axion mass equals the hubble constant , @xmath47 . using results of turner ( 1986 ) we use @xmath48 gev . in what follows \n we assume @xmath49 gev . as a reference mass scale \n we define the mass of all axions in a cubic volume of length equal to the hubble length at @xmath46 , and density equal to the mean cosmological density : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of an effectively massless degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath46 . using @xmath52 we find @xmath53 . \n our numerical integration of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) shows that there is a spectrum of minicluster masses , but typically the mass of the axion minicluster is a reasonable fraction of @xmath54 , @xmath55 . \n we estimate the average minicluster mass to be of order @xmath56 . \n masses of miniclusters are relatively insensitive to the particular value of @xmath18 associated with the minicluster . \n minicluster radius . \n _ typical axion miniclusters have a large density contrast , @xmath57 ( @xcite ) , see figure 1 . \n equation ( [ rhofl ] ) gives the minicluster radius as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath18 : @xmath59    the radius of a particular minicluster depends upon its associated value of @xmath18 . in the limit @xmath23 the radius of a minicluster scales as @xmath60 . \n minicluster abundance . \n _ from the numerical calculation we have extracted the mass fraction of axions in density peaks of @xmath18 larger than a given value @xmath61 . \n it is plotted for several values of conformal time @xmath62 and @xmath63 in figure 2 . by the time @xmath64 \n we are no longer able reliably to resolve the highest density peaks because density contrasts became too large for our @xmath65 grid . \n although at @xmath66 the evolution has not completely frozen out , ( especially at the large-@xmath18 end ) we can set a lower bound for the density fractions , e.g. , more than 13% are in miniclusters with @xmath67 and 70% of all axionic dark matter are in miniclusters @xmath68 , see figure 2 . \n for axion miniclusters ( or , for that matter , any other possible candidate ) to be detected by femtolensing ( or picolensing ) the following three conditions must be satisfied :      _ ii . ) _ the physical radius of the minicluster has to be smaller than its einstein ring radius \n . for source and lens of cosmological distance the einstein ring radius is , see e.g. press & gunn ( 1973 ) : @xmath71 where as usual @xmath72 km s@xmath73mpc@xmath73 . \n _ iii . ) _ the third condition is that a significant fraction of the total mass density of the universe must be in the form of miniclusters , say @xmath74 , for the lensing rate to be reasonable . \n this condition is independent upon the lens mass ( @xcite ) . \n these conditions are non - trivial , which is why there were no serious candidates for femtolensing . \n but we shall now demonstrate that all three conditions are naturally met for the case of axion miniclusters .    that miniclusters satisfy the mass condition follows from the fact that the minicluster mass is determined by the total mass of axions within the hubble radius at @xmath75 gev . \n of course there will be some spread in minicluster masses , but as discussed in the previous section , the masses should be peaked around @xmath28 , well within the desired range for lensing .    using the radius of miniclusters from equation ( [ r ] ) and the einstein ring radius from equation ( [ re ] ) , we find @xmath76 . \n the requirement that miniclusters be smaller than their einstein ring radius places restrictions on @xmath18 as a function of @xmath58 \n . we see that if @xmath77 , then miniclusters with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( depending upon @xmath80 ) are within their einstein ring radius . \n actually , objects with the radius comparable to their einstein radius have a better chance to be detected as femtolenses ( compared to point mass objects ) if they are in the mass range @xmath81 ( @xcite ) . from figure [ fig2 ] \n we see that more than about 20% of all dark matter axions are in miniclusters with @xmath82 and will be within their ring radius . \n we conclude that if axions are the dark matter with @xmath83 close to unity , then the fraction of @xmath84 in miniclusters capable of femtolensing is 15% - 20% ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) , i. e. will be in excess of 10%large enough to result in a detectable rate . \n since miniclusters in the igm as well as in galactic halos contribute to femtolensing events , questions such as : how are they clustered , do miniclusters survive the epoch of galaxy formation , are they disrupted in their encounters with stars , etc . \n , may be irrelevant here . \n since large-@xmath18 miniclusters are very dense , form early , and are well separated from each other , they should escape mutual disruption and merging . \n we conclude that axion miniclusters are candidates for femtolensing and picolensing . \n we do not believe that the conclusion is sensitive to specific initial conditions , but is generic so long as there are large super - horizon - sized fluctuations in the misalignment angle during the development of the axion potential .", "StartTimeOffset": 69734818608, "RequestID": "b455aa0c7b8e8355bb733efdbe201380f3e44e11", "TotalTokens": 3898}

( 2010 ) ) ( hereafter lhkss ) to study the detailed pulse profiles of some of those pulsars having the largest amounts of timing noise . \n they demonstrated that six of these pulsars exhibited the well - known phenomenon of mode - changing , in which a pulsar switches abruptly between two stable profiles . \n moreover , in all six pulsars , there was a high degree of correlation between the pulse shape and slowdown rate , the pulsars switching rapidly between low- and high - spindown rates . \n two years after the publication of lhkss , we review the observational evidence for switched changes in magnetospheric states , both in intermittent pulsars and in mode - changing pulsars , and discuss the relationship between the two phenomena . \n many pulsars show intermittency in their radio emission , although usually the durations of the `` on '' and `` off '' states are measured in seconds to hundreds of seconds , timescales which are far too short to permit the determination of any change in slowdown rate between the states . \n this is the phenomenon of pulse nulling which has been known since shortly after the discovery of pulsars ( ( * ? ? ? \n * backer 1970 ) ) .    however , the intermittent pulsar b1931 + 24 is typically on for 1 week and off for about 1 month , permitting ( * ? ? ? \n * kramer et al . ( 2006 ) ) to show that the ratio of on- and off- slowdown values @xmath1 , roughly consistent with an absence of all magnetospheric currents during the off phase , in accordance with the calculations of the braking effects of magnetospheric currents by ( * ? ? ? \n * goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) ) .    shortly after that publication \n , a second long - term intermittent pulsar was discovered ( psr  j1832 + 0029 ) and reported to show similar large changes in in slowdown rate ( @xmath2 ; ( * ? ? ? * \n kramer 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * lyne 2009 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * lorimer et al . 2012 ) ) . \n 1 shows the measured values of rotation rate during the 10 years since its discovery . with rather poor statistics , the lengths of the on and off states are typically many hundreds of days , compared with tens of days for b1931 + 24 . \n more recently , a third long - term intermittent object ( psr  j1841@xmath30500 ) , also with timescales measured in hundreds of days , has been reported by ( * ? ? ? \n * camilo et al . \n ( 2012 ) ) . even though the statistics are also poor for this pulsar , it is clear that this has an even greater slowdown rate ratio ( @xmath4 ; see fig . \n lhkss studied those pulsars in the jodrell bank timing database which showed the largest amounts of timing noise , measured as the ratio of maximum to minimum values of slowdown rate . \n seventeen examples are shown in fig . \n pulsars typically have peak - to - peak values of about 1% of the mean , over a 4-orders - of - magnitude range of slowdown rates . \n individual pulsars may have a factor of 10 times more or less than this . \n lhkss found that six of the 17 pulsars showed pulse - shape changes which were correlated with these slowdown rate variations . \n subsequent studies ( lyne et al . , in prep ) have now shown that a further four of these 17 also have significant pulse - shape variations that are correlated with slowdown rate ( psrs b0919 + 06 , b1642@xmath303 , b1826@xmath317 and b1903 + 07 ) as well as two others ( psrs b1740@xmath303 and b0105 + 65 ) .    ) of 17 pulsars ( from lyne et al . \n 2010).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]        a further striking example of correlated changes in pulse shape and slowdown is displayed by psr  j2047 + 5029 , discovered at westerbork in the 8gr8 survey ( ( * ? ? ? \n * janssen et al . 2009 ) ) . at discovery , \n the observed profile showed a main pulse and an interpulse with an associated precursor having about 1/3 of the flux density of the main pulse ( fig .  4 top ) . \n however , when monitoring commenced at jodrell bank , the main pulse had reduced in intensity by a factor of about 10 , so that it was then much weaker than the interpulse ( fig .  4 bottom ) . \n the pulsar has since changed from this `` abnormal mode '' back to the earlier `` normal '' mode . \n these changes were accompanied by changes in slowdown rate , which was larger when in the normal mode than in the abnormal mode , again consistent with the notion that the particles responsible for much of the normal - mode main - pulse radio flux density were also responsible for the increase in braking .    in total \n there are now 16 pulsars with established synchronised changes in the radio emission and the slowdown rate . \n the properties of these pulsars are summarised in table  1 , in decreasing order of the magnitude of the timing noise , measured as the ratio of the maximum and minimum slowdown rates .    .timing noise slowdown rate ratios ( @xmath5 ) and emission changes in 16 pulsars . \n [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the time sequences of slowdown rates shown in fig .  2 are usually bounded by well - defined maximum and minimum levels , each extreme level being identifiable with a characteristic emission profile or flux density . \n as reported by lhkss , each pulsar is usually seen to switch abruptly between these extreme states . \n the fact that the patterns in fig . \n 2 are generally smooth and do not display abrupt switching behaviour was demonstrated to arise from changing statistical properties of the mode - changing phenomenon , and the observed profile shape parameter is determined by the proportion of time spent in the two modes . \n this is most clearly illustrated in fig . \n 5 which shows a number of 8-hour observations of psr  b1828@xmath311 chosen at different phases of the 500-day oscillating pattern displayed by this pulsar in fig .  3 . \n we note that although pulse nulling and profile mode - changing was first observed in 1970 ( ( * ? ? ? \n * backer 1970 ) ; ( * ? ? ? \n * backer 1970a ) ) , the following four decades have seen no study of the stability of the statistics of nulling or mode - changing . \n the processes of nulling and mode - changing are similar in many ways . both are switched phenomena between ( usually ) two discrete emission states . \n they both have similar large ranges of timescales and both have a major synchronisation with the spindown rate of the pulsar . \n they are both understood in terms of changes in magnetospheric particle currents . \n the natural conclusion is that nulling is probably an extreme form of mode - changing . \n this view is supported by a few cases in which an apparently nulling pulsar has been found to have low - level emission in the null state . \n one such example is psr  b0826@xmath334 shown in fig .  6 , in which integration of the data during apparently `` null '' episodes shows pulsed emission at a level of about 2% of the un - nulled pulses . \n perhaps one telescope s nulling pulsar is a larger telescope s mode - changing pulsar ! \n pulsar magnetospheres switch between a small number of discrete states , usually two , each of which corresponds to an apparently quasi - stable magnetospheric configuration . \n it seems that changes in magnetospheric current flows between these states cause variations in both the emission beam snd the slow - down rate . \n this is supported by the general observation that the larger slowdown - rate is nearly always associated with enhanced emission , particularly of the pulsar `` core '' emission . \n i have no understanding of why there are these discrete states , or of the origin of the multi - year quasi - periodicities that modulate the statistical properties of the states . \n free - precession of the neutron star and orbiting asteroids have been proposed , but any links are obscure .    finally , it must be emphasised that these phenomena are widespread . the majority of pulsars of young and intermediate characteristic age display detectable timing noise . \n the studies of profiles described here have mostly been of those pulsars which have the largest fractional changes in slowdown rates and hence may be expected to suffer the greatest magnetospheric changes and corresponding variation in emission properties . \n in fact , 12 of the 19 pulsars with largest timing noise show correlated emission variations . most of the remaining 7 have much poorer signal - to - noise ratio , making the precise determination of pulse shape changes challenging . \n the changes expected in less timing - noisy pulsars are likely to be much more subtle and a challenge to detect . at present \n , there is no reason to doubt that all timing noise has its origin in switched magnetospheric states .", "StartTimeOffset": 76488778986, "RequestID": "c9f23d3eb05c97009de8bd487a122a42d8b8ebb5", "TotalTokens": 2371}

assembly in the last decade has focused on monodisperse  @xcite or polydisperse  @xcite systems of spherical or regularly shaped particles ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) . \n nevertheless , there are several important cases in which the shape of the single components can not be tailored at will ; however , an efficient packing , or an understanding of the physical properties of these densely compressed systems , is highly desirable . \n two examples of outstanding problems in this category are the storage of grains  @xcite and protein crystallization  @xcite . \n both examples can be ideally thought of as two different aspects of the problem of understanding the role of shape in particle packing . in the first case the goal is to efficiently pack a system of randomly - shaped polydisperse grains . in the second case \n the aim is to crystallize non - spherical , yet equally shaped monodisperse components . \n the latter case is the focus of the present paper . \n we want to understand how the ability of particles to form macroscopically ordered crystal structures is affected by their shape . \n specifically , we analyze how random perturbations from the ideal spherical shape affect the crystallizability of a densely packed system of indistinguishable hard particles . \n although a few papers have dealt with the thermodynamic behavior of soft / deformable particles as a model for polymer brushes or polymer - coated colloids ( @xcite and references therein ) , to the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first study where shape distortions , frozen onto the particles , are explicitly and systematically accounted for . \n the problem of crystal formation is poorly understood . from a thermodynamic standpoint , \n classical nucleation theory informs us that a crystal can only be formed via a barrier crossing event . \n the free energy gain to form a nucleus of a stable crystalline structure in a supersaturated solution has to balance out the free energy cost associated with the formation of an interface between the solid and the fluid parent phase . \n the gibbs free energy cost , @xmath0 , associated with this event has a strong dependence on the interfacial free energy , @xmath1 : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the density and the chemical potential difference between solid and fluid phase , respectively . as @xmath1 is very hard to extract from experiments , \n computer simulations are the tool of choice to study and analyze this important process in detail \n .    one way to investigate our problem could be to measure the dependence of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) on the magnitude of the shape perturbations at constant @xmath4 . \n this approach would be appropriate when considering a system that is polydisperse in shape and size ; however , in our case , we have to study a statistically relevant number of systems each containing @xmath5 identical particles with the same shape perturbation . \n such an approach is therefore impractical because ( a ) it would require the computation of a phase diagram for every system with a given particle realization ( about 500 in this study ) and ( b ) for sufficiently large shape deformations the fcc structure that nucleates out of a solution of hard spheres may not necessarily be the most stable one , and this would lead to a meaningless comparison of unrelated @xmath1s .    given these limitations , our strategy will be to generate a large number of particle shapes , sort them in terms of the extent of their asphericity , and simply analyze whether they organize into an ordered and periodic structure ( whatever that might be ) once compressed at large densities . \n we are left with the problem of devising a new model that allows for an effective control of the particle s degree of asphericity . \n unfortunately there is not a unique way of introducing perturbations on the particle shape , so we have opted for a model that , without loss of generality , weds simplicity and numerical efficiency . \n in our model , each particle is built by setting the center of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) spheres of diameter @xmath8 at random positions inside a spherical shell of diameter @xmath9 . \n the overall volume generated from the resulting overlapping aggregate defines our new particle . \n deviations from the ideal spherical shape can be conveniently controlled by varying @xmath10 and @xmath6 . \n values of @xmath10 and @xmath6 were chosen to achieve wide coverage of the range of possible particle geometries . for @xmath11 \n one recovers the spherical limit , and as @xmath10 increases , particles develop larger and larger shape distortions . in a similar fashion , \n large values of @xmath6 result in a bumpy but overall isotropic particle , whereas small values of @xmath6 tend to generate very anisotropic shapes . \n once a particle is built , the center of mass of this cluster of balls is determined , and the entire cluster is scaled so that its total volume equals that of a spherical particle of diameter @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath12 . any two particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 interact via a hard repulsive potential defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 run over all spheres of rescaled diameter @xmath18 constituting particle @xmath13 and particle @xmath14 respectively . \n experimental realizations of colloidal particles similar to ours could be generated using the approach described in reference  @xcite to create uniform nonspherical particles with tunable shapes . \n figure 1 shows a few snapshots of particle shapes obtained for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath10 . \n and @xmath6 built according to the scheme described in the text.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    to analyze the high density behavior of these systems we used monte carlo simulations in the @xmath19 ensemble . \n given the large number of simulations involved in this study , we limited the size of our systems to a total of @xmath20 particles . \n we use a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions . using as a reference the hard -

harmonics based bond order parameter @xmath28  @xcite , ( b ) a careful monitoring of the system volume fraction over time for sudden jumps , and ( c ) visual inspection . \n we investigated a total of 487 different particle shapes . \n we find that at least two order parameters are required to properly characterize the shape of each particle . \n the first is its asphericity @xmath29 ( as opposed to the commonly used sphericity , @xmath30  @xcite ) , defined in terms of the surface to volume ratio of a particle @xmath31 with respect to that of a sphere of diameter @xmath8 , @xmath32 , as @xmath33 given our model setup , @xmath34 , @xmath29 simplifies to @xmath35    the second parameter , @xmath36 , measures the orientational symmetry of the particle . \n it is used to describe the asphericity of random walks  @xcite , and it is obtained by combining invariants of the particle inertia tensor @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the three principal eigenvalues of the inertia tensor of the particle , i.e. , the three principle radii of gyration of the particle . both parameters \n are defined so that they are equal to @xmath42 for a perfectly spherical particle , and approach @xmath43 for extremely aspherical ones . \n note that @xmath29 depends intimately on the value of @xmath10 used to construct the particle , whereas @xmath36 depends only on the angular distribution of spheres about the center of mass  that is , it is completely independent of @xmath10 . \n figure  [ plot ] summarizes the main result of our paper .     and @xmath36 . \n filled circles indicate particles that easily crystallized , while open squares indicate particles that did not . \n data include results for 487 total particle geometries , including 85 using @xmath44 , 200 using @xmath45 , 92 using @xmath46 , and 110 using @xmath47 . \n the solid line is a guide to the eye.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is obtained by collecting the crystallizability of the 487 systems built out of the 487 different particle geometries we have generated across the @xmath29 , @xmath36 spectrum . each point in the @xmath29 \n vs @xmath36 diagram represents the result of a set of simulations at different pressures . \n as would be expected , crystallization is favored when both @xmath29 and @xmath36 are small @xmath48 that is , when the particles are nearly spherical by both measures . \n a roughly inverse relationship is clearly evident ; particles with large @xmath29 must have very small @xmath36 in order to have a hope of crystallization , and vice - versa . but more importantly \n , we find the existence of a clear boundary delineating the crystallizability limit for every possible shape generated with our model ( small deviations at the interface are likely due to finite size effects and or the limited length of our simulations ) . \n this is quite remarkable because it provides a very useful way of predicting whether a particular particle shape can pack into a crystalline structure by simply measuring the experimentally accessible @xmath29 and @xmath36 . \n we find that a good empirical expression to describe the phase boundary is @xmath49 . \n this curve is only meant to serve as a guide to the eye and to give an approximate numerical estimate of the location of the phase boundary for @xmath50 . \n notice that for smaller values of @xmath36 our data seem to indicate a sharp end of the crystal boundary . \n we believe this to be an artifact of our particle model . \n in fact , that region is where the value of @xmath10 becomes sufficiently large ( @xmath51 ) to break the compactness of the particles generated with our method , especially those with smaller values of @xmath6 . \n furthermore , as small values of @xmath36 indicate a large orientational symmetry , we expect this region to be heavily populated by specific geometric arrangements , whose packing properties , at large values of @xmath29 , will be extremely sensitive of the particular value of @xmath6 . \n as our model is intended to describe randomly shaped particles , our diagram does not include the results for particles designed with very specific shapes such as rods , plates or regular polyhedric geometries that are known to crystallize . \n these particular cases would generate sharp peaks around specific values of @xmath36 . \n furthermore , is not clear that our two order parameters , that have after all been selected to describe asphericity , would be the most appropriate to study deviations from an arbitrary non spherical designed shape . \n we therefore limited our study to @xmath52 , to explicitly avoid trivial cases as rod - like ( @xmath53 ) and plate - like particles ( @xmath54 ) . \n two obvious questions present themselves in the face of these data . \n the first is : what is the nature of the crystals formed when particles do easily crystallize ; does the system present translational but not orientational order , as expected for @xmath55 , or does the rotational motion of the particles becomes restricted for large values of @xmath29 ? \n the second is : what sets the boundary between the two phases ; do the particles that fail to easily crystallize do so because they become kinetically trapped or because of the lack of a stable crystal phase ?    to address the first question \n , we measured the rotational diffusion , @xmath56 , for 20 systems that easily crystallize , all at a reduced pressure @xmath57 and near the phase boundary . as a reference we also plotted @xmath56 for nearly spherical particles , obtained by setting @xmath58 , where we know particles are free to rotate at their lattice sites . \n as can be seen in fig . \n [ rot ] , we find no evidence that particles in the crystalline phase become orientationally arrested or manifest an orientationally anomalous behavior . \n the only effect is that of decreasing their diffusion constant , but this is expected from simple geometrical considerations . \n it is obvious that at very large densities , regardless of the specific phase a system selects , particles orientations will manifest a glassy behavior or eventually freeze . \n @xcite it is therefore of interest to also look at the dynamical properties of those particles in systems do not easily crystallize and are located just across the phase boundary from the ones that do easily crystallize . \n these results , obtained at the same reduced pressure @xmath59 , are also shown in fig . \n we find no signature of anomalous dynamics , neither in the rotational ( fig . \n [ rot ] ) , nor in the translational ( fig . \n [ trans ] ) degrees of freedom , i.e. such systems behave as regular fluids . \n this result is by no means conclusive , as a thorough investigation of this last point would require larger system sizes and an event - driven dynamics of the components . \n our results seem to suggest that what sets the location of the phase boundary is not a sudden slowdown of the dynamics of the system , but more likely an increase of the gibbs free energy difference between the crystalline and the fluid phase , analogously to that found for polydisperse spherical particles  @xcite \n . it would be interesting to investigate the equilibrium properties and the stability of candidate crystalline structures for different values of @xmath29 and @xmath36 to investigate whether our boundary line coincides with the onset of crystal instability , but for the reasons given above , we have not attempted to do so . \n apart from the details concerning the dynamics of these systems , our results show that , for aspherical particles , shape and crystallizability can be directly and easily correlated when particles are characterized in terms of their asphericity via @xmath36 and @xmath29 . \n it is possible that for some highly asymmetric particle geometries a non - cubic box would accommodate crystallization whereas a cubic one would not ; however , we believe this is a secondary effect and its relevance is likely within the range of errors due to finite size effects . \n our data suggest precise limits for the manufacture of nanocomponents expected to crystallize , and may have important implications for the problem of protein crystallization . \n the latter system is clearly far more complex than the one we explored , since not only shape , but also interparticle direct interactions ( which are not necessarily isotropic ) , are responsable for the organization of proteins into large macroscopic crystals . \n nevertheless , it would be interesting to systematically explore to what extent a similar correlation exists in this case . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation under career grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 93704599110, "RequestID": "559b8ef46e45a933345624620f43411d8abf3472", "TotalTokens": 3571}
{"ContextTokens": 3098, "GeneratedTokens": 328, "SynthesizedBody": "we have witnessed in the last decade the detection of free - floating substellar objects with increasingly lower masses and cooler temperatures that reach the canonical planetary regime of a few jupiter masses and a few hundred kelvin . \n examples are free - floating planetary mass objects in star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ultracool y dwarfs in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n one of the main open questions in the theory of star formation is : how do these free - floating planetary - like objects - and brown dwarfs in general - form ? \n a high - density phase is necessary for the gravitational fragmentation to create very small jeans - unstable cores . \n proposed scenarios to prevent a substellar core in a dense environment from accreting to stellar mass are ejection of the core through dynamical interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) or photo - evaporation of the gas envelope through radiation of a nearby hot star ( e.g. , ) . also suggested was the formation of brown dwarfs by disk instabilities in the outer regions of massive circumstellar disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n alternatively , brown dwarfs could form in a more isolated mode by direct collapse . \n for example , filament collapse ( e.g. , inutsuka & miyama 1992 ) might form low - mass cores that experience high self - erosion in outflows and become brown dwarfs ( machida et al . \n a key to understanding star and brown dwarf formation is to observationally define the minimum mass that the canonical star - like mode of formation can produce by detecting and exploring the main features characteristic of this process , such as disks , accretion , outflows , and orbiting planets , for the lowest - mass objects . \n the first indications for the existence of free - floating planetary mass objects came from observations in the very young @xmath2 orionis cluster @xcite . while it is difficult to establish the membership to @xmath2 ori and , therefore , the age and mass , some very promising candidates were detected . \n an example is sori60 , for which mid - ir excess indicates a young age @xcite . \n other candidates , however , turned out not to be members of the cluster , such as sori70 ( @xcite ; pea ramirez , this volume ) . \n the coolest known free - floating objects are y dwarfs , of which 17 are spectroscopically confirmed to date @xcite . while we can expect many planetary mass objects among y dwarfs , the age and mass of these nearby field objects are in most cases unknown . the first confirmed y dwarf , wise1828 + 2650 @xcite , was suggested to have a temperature and mass of only about 300k and 3 - 6@xmath3 , respectively , although there are indications that the temperature might be significantly larger @xcite . very recently \n a remarkably cold and low - mass object was detected in the very near vicinity of our sun : wise0855 - 0714 at a distance of 2.2pc has a proposed temperature and mass of 250k and 3 - 10@xmath3 , respectively @xcite . \n nearby objects that do allow constraints on their age and , therefore , mass are members of young moving groups ( see also faherty , this volume ) . \n one of them , psoj318.5 - 22 , was recently detected to be a planetary - mass member of @xmath1 pic . \n depending on the assumed age for @xmath1 pic its mass is estimated to 6.5@xmath3 ( age : 12myr ) and 8.4@xmath3 ( 21myr ) , respectively ( @xcite ; allers , this volume ) .    to address the question how free - floating planets form , we observed ots44 , the lowest mass known member of the chamaeleon  i star - forming region ( chai , @xmath02myr , 160pc ) . \n ots44 was first identified as a brown dwarf candidate in a deep near - ir imaging survey @xcite and later confirmed as very low - mass substellar object of spectral - type m9.5 based on low - resolution near - ir and optical spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n its mass was estimated using near - ir spectra to lie in or very close to the planetary regime ( @xmath06 - 17m@xmath4 , ) with an average rounded value of 12m@xmath4 . \n mid - ir photometry of ots44 by spitzer / irac and mips @xcite indicated the presence of circumstellar material surrounding ots44 . \n recently , the disk of ots44 was detected at far - ir wavelength by herschel / pacs @xcite . \n we re - analyzed the herschel flux measurement @xcite and find a slightly smaller value for ots44 than @xcite . \n we modeled the sed of ots44 based on flux measurements from the optical to the far - ir using the radiative transfer code ` mc3d ` @xcite . \n we employ a passive - disk model consisting of a central substellar source surrounded by a parameterized flared disk in which dust and gas are well mixed and homogeneous throughout the system . \n we assume dust grains of astronomical silicate ( 62.5% ) and graphite ( 37.5% ) with minimum and maximum grain sizes of 0.005@xmath5 and 0.25@xmath5 , respectively . \n as there are model degeneracies between different disk parameters , we conducted a bayesian analysis to estimate the validity range for each parameter . \n see for details . \n fig.[fig : sed ] shows the sed and the best - fit disk model of ots44 based on the re - analysis of the herschel fluxes @xcite . \n we find that ots44 has a highly flared disk ( @xmath61.3 ) with a disk mass of 3.25@xmath7 , i.e. about @xmath8 . \n sed of ots44 . shown \n are photometric measurements ( red diamonds ) an upper limit for the 160@xmath9 flux ( black triangle ) , the best -

ir j - band spectra ( 1.1 - 1.4 @xmath10 m ) of ots44 with sinfoni at the vlt at a medium spectral resolution ( r=@xmath11/@xmath12 , ) . \n we discovered a strong , broad , and variable paschen@xmath1 ( pa@xmath1 ) emission line of ots44 in these spectra , as shown in fig.[fig : pabeta ] ( left , middle ) . \n furthermore , a prominent h@xmath13 emission line is visible in the optical spectrum of @xcite as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : pabeta ] \n . both of these hydrogen emission lines exhibit a broad profile with velocities of @xmath14200kms@xmath15 or more . \n we determined the equivalent width ( ew ) of both lines . \n the h@xmath13 line has a symmetrically shaped profile with an ew of -141 , demonstrating that ots44 is actively accreting . \n the profile of the pa@xmath1 line is significantly variable between the two observing epochs separated by a few days ( ew of -7 and -4 ) . \n we determined the mass accretion rate of ots44 based on the h@xmath13 line by assuming that the h@xmath13 emission is entirely formed by accretion processes . \n we derived an h@xmath13 line luminosity log@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) of -6.16 for ots44 and applied the empirical relation between the h@xmath13 line and accretion luminosity of fang et al . \n ( 2009 ) , which is based on log@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) ranging between -1 and -6 . \n we estimate an mass accretion rate of ots44 of 7.6@xmath18@xmath19 . \n pa@xmath1 emission of ots44 in vlt / sinfoni spectra ( left , middle ) and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum ( right ) . \n the dashed lines are gaussian fits to the profiles . from . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]   pa@xmath1 emission of ots44 in vlt / sinfoni spectra ( left , middle ) and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum ( right ) . \n the dashed lines are gaussian fits to the profiles . from . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]   pa@xmath1 emission of ots44 in vlt / sinfoni spectra ( left , middle ) and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum ( right ) . \n the dashed lines are gaussian fits to the profiles . from . \n , title=\"fig : \" ] \n we have discovered strong , broad , and variable pa@xmath1 emission of the young very low - mass substellar object ots44 ( m9.5 ) in vlt / sinfoni spectra , which is evidence for active accretion of a planetary mass object . \n we determined the properties of the disk that surrounds ots44 through ` mc3d ` radiative transfer modeling of flux measurements from the optical to the far - ir including herschel data . \n we found that ots44 has a highly flared disk ( @xmath61.3 ) with a mass of 3.25@xmath7 , i.e. about @xmath8 . \n we also investigated the h@xmath13 line of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum spectrum and found strong h@xmath13 emission with an ew of -141 indicative of active accretion . \n ots44 will become a y dwarf in @xmath20 years . \n for this illustration of the evolution of the effective temperature of a very low - mass substellar object we used a plot of @xcite . note that the model temperatures are hotter than the observationally determined temperatures , which are 1700k for ots44 , 1200k for psoj318.5 - 22 , and 250k for wise0855 - 0714 . ] \n both the pa@xmath1 and h@xmath13 emission lines of ots44 have broad profiles with the wings extending to velocities of about @xmath14200kms@xmath15 . \n the pa@xmath1 emission is significantly variable on timescales of a few days , indicating variability in accretion - related processes of ots44 . \n we estimated the mass accretion rate of ots44 to 7.6@xmath18@xmath21 by using the h@xmath13 line . \n a mass accretion rate based on the pa@xmath1 line gives a significantly higher value , and we speculate that part of the pa@xmath1 emission might come from other processes related to accretion , such as outflows . \n furthermore , in the course of studying ots44 , we fitted a photospheric bt - settl model to its optical and near - ir sed and derived a lower effective temperature and higher extinction than was previously found @xcite . \n we have presented the first detection of pa@xmath1 emission for a free - floating object below the deuterium - burning limit . \n our analysis of pa@xmath1 and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 demonstrates that free - floating objects of a few jupiter masses can be active accretors . \n ots44 can be seen as free - floating analog of recently detected accreting planetary mass companions that orbit stars ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and it plays a key role in the study of disk evolution and accretion physics in an extremely low - gravity and -temperature environment . furthermore , ots44 ( m9.5 ) is the lowest - mass object to date for which the disk mass is determined based on far - ir data . \n also interesting in this context is the mm - detection of an m9 dwarf @xcite . our detections therefore extend the exploration of disks and accretion during the t  tauri phase down to the planetary mass regime . plotting the relative disk masses of stars and brown dwarfs including ots44 ( fig.[fig : mdisk ] ) \n shows that the ratio of the disk - to - central - mass of about 10@xmath22 found for objects between 0.03@xmath23 and 14@xmath23 is also valid for ots44 at a mass of about 0.01@xmath23 . \n furthermore , the mass accretion rate of ots44 is consistent with a decreasing trend from stars of several solar masses to substellar objects down to 0.01@xmath23 ( fig.[fig : macc ] ) . \n it is also obvious from this figure that ots44 has a relatively high mass accretion rate considering its small mass . \n these observations show that the processes that accompany canonical star formation , disks and accretion , are present down to a central mass of a few jupiter masses . \n this suggests that ots44 is formed like a star and that the increasing number of young free - floating planets and ultra - cool t and y field dwarfs are the low - mass extension of the stellar population . \n figure[fig : teffevol ] illustrates how a very young free - floating planetary mass object of about 10 jupiter masses , such as ots44 , cools down while aging and becomes an l dwarf at about 10myr , similar to psoj318.5 - 22 , and a y dwarf at @xmath241gyr , similar to wise0855 - 0714 . \n this illustration uses a plot of the evolution of the effective temperature by @xcite . \n while this might not be the most sophisticated evolutionary model to date and discrepancies with observations can be seen in the temperature ( see caption of fig.[fig : teffevol ] ) , it nevertheless shows very nicely the general picture of a substellar object shifting through spectral classes during its evolution .", "StartTimeOffset": 101130251532, "RequestID": "ac9b0fe212bc8e9269080ca71a4e54e1c6f222c1", "TotalTokens": 3426}
{"ContextTokens": 3813, "GeneratedTokens": 242, "SynthesizedBody": "magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) has been a promising candidate for spintronic devices applications@xcite such as magnetic random access memory and hard drive read head , and this is due to its large tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) and good switching properties . \n it is well known that tmr properties are extremely sensitive to atomic scale interfacial roughness and interlayer mixing across multilayer interfaces , especially the interfaces with the tunnel barrier . among many techniques to grow mtj structures , \n ion beam deposition ( ibd ) has the advantages of low processing pressures , directional sputtered flux , high energy of the adatom flux , low sputtering rate and independent control of target and substrate environments.@xcite however , conventional ibd methods were not designed for optimal deposition conditions for mtj multilayer structures . for example , the conventional ibd can only be operated using relatively high sputtering ion energies and relatively low pressure with no substantial background gas scattering.@xcite this is because it is harder to focus the sputtering ion beam at low energies , meaning a larger fraction of the ion beam could miss the targets and sputter off undesired materials from the vacuum system hardware , causing overspill contamination.@xcite as a result , the adatoms in ibd can have very high energies when they reach the substrate , causing severe intermixing problems at the interfaces , which is detrimental to high tmr performance . \n the biased target ion beam deposition ( btibd ) system was developed to overcome some problems of the conventional ibd . \n the key advantage of the btibd system is the use of novel low energy ion sources that combine the end - hall ion source@xcite and hollow cathode electron source,@xcite which produce a very high density of inert gas ions with a very low energy ( from several ev ) . by applying a negative bias to the desired target \n , only the biased target materials will be sputtered off for deposition by the accelerated high energy ions , while the portion of ions missing the target will not cause any damage to the environment due to the un - accelerated low energy for which the sputter yield of the typical vacuum system hardware is negligible . \n the broad low energy ion beam combined with the easily controlled target biasing ( 50 - 1200 ev ) gives much freedom in terms of interface engineering , making it a well - suited tool for depositing multilayer structures like mtj .    in this paper , \n the capability of the btibd system is demonstrated by depositing standard mtj with naturally oxidized alo@xmath0 barrier . \n it is well known that for mtj thin film stacks with layer thickness on the order of nanometers , the film surface roughness and intermixing between adjacent layers are among the key problems not only preventing the successful switching of the free layer , but also resulting in reduced tmr and unfavored resistance - area product ( ra ) values . \n others have studied the effects of deposition rate on properties of single film@xcite and multilayers@xcite to understand the dependence of film morphology on deposition rate , in hopes of reducing surface roughness and interlayer mixing for optimized growth conditions . here , with a different approach , the effects of bias voltage ( i.e. different deposition energy ) on mtj properties \n is studied via the investigation of the offset field of the free layer due to the nel coupling and the tmr performance , and an optimization strategy based on the study to reduce both film surface roughness and intermixing is proposed . \n this study also demonstrates the btibd s capability of precise thin film and interface engineering at the atomic level . \n the schematic diagram of the btibd used in this work is shown here in fig . \n [ fig1 ] for the reader s convenience . \n additional details of our btibd system can also be found elsewhere.@xcite there are two identical ion guns installed in the btibd , one for main deposition and the other for ion beam assisted deposition . in this paper , only the main gun was used for mtj deposition to simplify the initial study . \n mtj samples were deposited on clean thermally oxidized si substrates , with the typical structure ta(5)/cofe(3)/femn(6)/cofe(3)/alo@xmath0(2)/cofe(3)/ta(5 ) [ units in nm ] . \n the base pressure of the btibd system was around 5@xmath110@xmath2 torr , and the working pressure was close to 7@xmath110@xmath3 torr during the deposition . \n a 50 oe field was applied during the film deposition of cofe and femn layer to create the magnetic easy axis , and a natural oxidation method was taken to make the alo@xmath0 barrier . \n oxidation was carried out in multiple steps to produce better quality oxide barrier.@xcite for instance , a nominal thickness of 5  al was deposited and naturally oxidized . \n this process was repeated four times to get a 2 nm alo@xmath0 barrier . \n the first 5  al layer was oxidized in 500 mtorr of o@xmath4 for 5 minutes and the the next three al layers were oxidized in 1 torr for 10 minutes . to study the effect of bias voltage on mtj properties , \n different bias voltages are applied when depositing the the top cofe free layer . \n deposition rates were calculated from film thicknesses measured by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , and the deposition time was adjusted to make the top cofe free layer with the same thickness for various target bias voltages . to create unidirectional exchange anisotropy , all the samples were quickly field - cooled from 250 @xmath5c in 3 koe external field in the forming gas environment . \n we measured the magnetic properties using a quantum design ppms-6000 , and obtained the tmr data by current - in - plane tunneling technique ( ciptech)@xcite measurements of the un - patterned blanket films . in this study , two sets of samples were made to investigate the target voltage effect on mtj properties . \n the first set consisted of three samples with the same typical structure mentioned previously . \n all of the layers of the three samples were deposited with 600 v bias voltage except for each of the top cofe free layers , where bias voltages 300 v , 600 v and 900 v were used , respectively . for the second set , \n all conditions were the same as the first except the thickness of the middle cofe layer . instead of 3 nm used in the first set \n , we increased it to be 4 nm for all three samples in the second set . \n fig . [ fig2 ] shows the simulated tmr value from the ciptech measurement of a mtj sample with nominal pre - oxidized al layer thickness of 2 nm , which is the second sample in the second set , with all the layers deposited with a target bias voltage of 600 v and middle cofe layer thickness 4 nm . \n the tmr value of this sample is close to 20% . \n this is not a record high value , since it is not our objective to optimize the tmr value . \n additionally , our cofe target has a composition of co@xmath6fe@xmath7 , which was found not to be the optimal composition for producing high tmr.@xcite    as far as the interlayer magnetic coupling between the two ferromagnetic electrodes of mtj is concerned , previous studies have shown that two separate effects tend to produce extraneous magnetic fields in the plane of free layer : magnetostatic coupling due to uncompensated poles near the sample edges and nel coupling due to interfacial roughness.@xcite for un - patterned samples in our case , the magnetostatic coupling is negligible . another requirement before we can assume that nel coupling is the only magnetic coupling affecting the free layer switching is that the tunnel barrier of the mtj must be pinhole free . without this condition , we can not separate the indirect nel coupling from the direct magnetic coupling through the pinholes . to prove that the mtj is pinhole free , we measured the temperature dependence of the hysteresis loop center shifts of both the free and pinned layers of all the mtj samples , and compared the loop center shifts at different temperatures to the value at 300 k. fig . \n [ fig3 ] shows a representative measurement of the second sample in second set with free layer deposited with 600 v and 4 nm middle cofe layer . in the figure \n , we see the increasing loop center shifts of the pinned layer as the temperature decreases . \n this is because the pinning strength of the antiferromagnetic femn gets larger at lower temperature ( i.e. , the exchange bias of the pinned layer increases as the temperature decreases ) . \n however , the loop center shifts of the free layer remain almost constant according to the temperature change . \n if there were pinholes , the free layer would be directly coupled with the pinned layer . \n then , as the pinned layer loop shifts with temperature , the direct magnetic coupling would force the free layer loop to shift as well . \n this result suggests that , according to pong _ \n _ et al.__@xcite the alo@xmath0 barrier in this sample is free of pinholes . \n similar results indicating pinhole - free - barriers were obtained for the other five samples in our investigation .            according to nel s model,@xcite nel coupling is closely related to the film and interface morphology . in this model , a sinusoidal roughness profile is assumed , and the nel coupling field is given by @xmath8where @xmath9 and _ h _ are the amplitude and wavelength of the roughness profile , _ \n t@xmath10 _ and _ t@xmath11 _ are the thickness of the free layer and that of the barrier , and _ \n m@xmath12 _ is the magnetization of the pinned layer . \n since nel coupling has been proven to be the only effect responsible for the free layer hysteresis loop center shift in our samples , we can extract the information about the interfacial mixing and film surface roughness by studying the nel coupling field of the free layer . \n [ fig4 ] shows the free layer loop center shifts at room temperature for the two sets of samples with details described at the end of section ii . \n first , we examine the results of the loop center shifts between the two sets . \n the second set , with thicker middle cofe layer ( i.e. thicker pinned ferromagnetic layer with larger m@xmath12 ) , always shows higher nel coupling offset field of the free layer when compared to individual samples with the same bias voltage in the first set . \n this is qualitatively consistent with nel s model presented in eq . \n additionally , the figure shows that within each sample set , the nel coupling field is stronger with increased target bias voltage for the free layer deposition . \n there are two possible competing factors when considering the impact of high energy adatoms on film morphology . \n one is that the high energy adatom of the free layer , when hitting the barrier surface , could redistribute the surface clusters and flatten the barrier surface , effectively increasing the barrier thickness , so the coupling field would be reduced according to nel s model . in a opposite way , adatoms with high energy would cause significant interlayer mixing between the top free cofe layer and the barrier layer underneath , which effectively makes a rougher interface compared to the barrier surface before the free layer deposition . \n this leads to a stronger nel coupling and therefore a larger loop center shift of the free layer hysteresis loop . from the above result in fig . \n [ fig4 ] , the stronger nel coupling with increased bias voltage indicates at least the existence of an intermixing effect and it should be dominant even if the barrier surface is flattened during free layer deposition .    to better study the two possible factors mentioned above due to bias voltage effect \n , we also investigated the tmr and ra values dependence on bias voltage . \n [ fig5 ] shows the tmr and ra values of the second sample set with different bias voltages applied for free layer deposition . \n as we just explained , the higher energy causes more interlayer mixing between the tunnel barrier and free layer . \n this intermixing could smear the thin barrier , causing more electron scattering at the interface , so lower tmr value would be expected . \n also such intermixing can effectively make the barrier thinner , so the ra value would decrease with higher bias voltage too . on the other hand \n , the possible barrier surface flattening , due to impact of the same high energy adatom at the beginning stage of deposition , could effectively make the barrier thicker and sharper , so we would expect larger ra and tmr values . as shown in the figure , both ra and tmr values \n are maximized at 600 v compared with the values at 300 v and 900 v. such result indicates that both the factors of intermixing and surface flattening coexist and compete with each other . from 300 v to 600 v , the initial barrier surface flattening due to higher adatom energy helps to get higher ra and tmr values . \n while form 600 v to 900 v , the high adatom energy makes the interlayer mixing the dominant effect , causing both reduced ra and tmr values . \n the strategy based on this study would be as follows : for maximum tmr value , the optimized bias voltage should be some intermediate level depending on the material properties . for applications that require minimized nel coupling , \n a low bias voltage would be preferred . \n this study focuses mainly on the impact of bias voltage on the interfacial properties . as to the film surface morphology \n , previous molecular dynamics simulation work@xcite showed that higher adatom energy would result in a smoother film surface . \n three single cofe film samples were deposited with same thickness but different bias voltages of 300 v , 600 v , and 900 v. the corresponding afm measurement of the surface roughness generated the rms value of 1.269 nm , 0.943 nm and 0.713 nm respectively , indicating the smoother sample surface with higher bias voltage . \n this result is consistent with the conclusion from the simulation work . \n mtjs with alo@xmath0 barrier were deposited using the btibd sputtering tool . \n the application of low energy source and target voltage bias makes it well suited for multilayer film deposition like mtj , which requires atomic level interfacial engineering . \n the study of bias voltage effects on the interfacial and film surface properties via nel coupling facilitated our understanding of the adatom energy impact on the film properties , and the strategy based on our study for the best performance of mtjs would be using high bias voltage for the bottom ferromagnetic electrode deposition to get a smooth seeding surface , and using optimized intermediate bias level for the free layer to get high tmr value . for applications that require minimized nel coupling , \n the low bias voltage would be preferred . \n special thanks to dr . \n w. f. egelhoff , jr . and dr . \n p. j. chen in nist for helpful discussion and the ciptech measurements . \n this

[ maps ] ) . \n the low energy band stretches from 100 mev to 30 gev , while the high energy band covers the energies from 30 gev up to 10 tev . \n the energy division corresponds to the energy bands of fermi gst ( the low energy band ) and h.e.s.s . \n ii ( the high energy band ) . \n photons with energies below 30 gev ( fig . \n [ maps ] , top panel ) are emitted in a range of the viewing angle @xmath27 that is wider in comparison with the range for the high energy band ( fig . \n [ maps ] , bottom panel ) . \n the emission cone of the high energy photons is centred at the pulsar magnetic axis . \n this centring of emission is also traceable in the horizontal cuts made through the photon density maps for chosen observers ( fig . \n [ profile ] ) . in the energies above 30 gev the level of the photon density drops dramatically if the observer moves away from the magnetic axis ( fig . \n [ profile ] , right panel ) . \n the decrease in the photon density level is also present in the lower energy band ( fig . \n [ profile ] , left panel ) ; however , it is not so rapid . \n this behaviour is clearly visible if one compares the light curves for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in different energies . \n the overall photon density level is lower for the high energy photons . \n to have an idea how accurate the estimations of the average power radiated by the pulsar are , we have calculated a pseudo luminosity @xmath2 for both energy ranges . \n @xmath2 emulates the power inferred by an observer viewing the pulsar at an angle @xmath27 . \n the emitted radiation is confined to a solid angle @xmath31  sr . \n the formula for the pseudo luminosity in the energy range from @xmath32 to @xmath33 for a viewing angle @xmath27 is thus given as @xmath34 @xmath2 is a theoretical counterpart of @xmath35 inferred from observations in the given energy range @xmath36 , which can be described with the following formula : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a solid angle chosen arbitrarily ( 1 steradian or sometimes @xmath39 steradians ) , @xmath40 is a distance to the object and @xmath41 is a phase - averaged energy flux within @xmath36 inferred from observations . \n this formula is frequently used to asses the pulsar luminosity from the observed phase - averaged flux and the known distance to the object . \n the modelled pseudo luminosities @xmath2 will therefore test the accuracy of the observed luminosities @xmath35 versus the actual luminosity @xmath1 . \n the theoretical pseudo luminosity spectra are presented in the top panel of fig . \n [ pseudolum ] . in the same figure \n the spectrum of the actual power radiated by the pulsar from one pole is shown with solid line . \n for each observer we can construct _ the bias factor _ \n @xmath42 where @xmath2 is given by eq . \n [ pseudo ] and @xmath1 is defined as @xmath43 both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are calculated within the same energy range ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) . \n the dependence of the bias factor on the viewing angle is presented in the bottom panel of fig . \n [ pseudolum ] . in the low energy range ( solid line ) \n the bias factor equals 1 for @xmath44 . \n the observers with @xmath45 tend to overestimate the pulsar actual luminosity ( eq .  [ actual ] ) using the pseudo luminosity ( eq .  [ pseudo ] ) , while observers with @xmath46 underestimate @xmath1 . in the high energy range ( dot - dashed line ) the situation is different due to the opening angle of radiation being smaller than the inclination angle @xmath11 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . \n viewing the pulsar with @xmath27 in the range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 results in overestimation of @xmath1 . \n however , the overestimation is rather insignificant ( _ b _ is less than 1.5 in maximum ) . on the other hand , \n viewing it with @xmath27 lower than @xmath50 or higher than @xmath51 leads to underestimation of the pulsar actual luminosity . \n finally , we calculate the gamma - ray efficiency factor : @xmath52 here , @xmath1 ( eq .  [ actual ] ) is calculated within the energy range stretching from 100 mev up to 10 tev . \n this factor demonstrates what part of the pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath53 is converted into the gamma radiation . \n the gamma - ray efficiency factor for the modelled millisecond pulsar is @xmath54 . \n this result is in good agreement with @xmath55 estimated by @xcite . \n the preliminary results of the numerical modelling of millisecond pulsars have been presented in this paper . we have calculated the photon density maps in two energy regimes corresponding to the operational energy bands of fermi gst and h.e.s.s . \n we have also computed the pseudo luminosities for different viewing angles and on their basis the plot presenting the behaviour of the bias factor has been constructed . from the comparison of the bias factor - viewing angle dependence in different energy bands \n we may infer information on accuracy of the so - called pseudo luminosity @xmath2 as an estimation of the pulsar actual luminosity @xmath1 in @xmath0-rays . \n it turns out that there are very few favourable @xmath27 for which @xmath2 is a good estimate of @xmath1 . \n most often @xmath1 tends to be under / overestimated . \n the gamma - ray efficiency factor for the modelled millisecond pulsar has been calculated . \n its value @xmath54 is in agreement with the values in @xcite . \n however , further work concerning modelling , especially the inclusion of radiative processes like synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering important for pulsar x - ray emission , has to be done in order to draw accurate conclusions about millisecond pulsars . also simulations for other sets of pulsar parameters , especially for different inclination angles @xmath11 , \n have to be carried out . \n we intend to use the results of modelling as a tool for predicting the detectability of millisecond pulsars with high energy observatories like fermi gst , h.e.s.s . \n ii and even cta @xcite . \n furthermore , we plan to develop the population synthesis studies of high energy pulsars that would incorporate the results of the modelling described briefly in this paper . \n az wants to thank bronek rudak and jarek dyks for many helpful discussions and critical remarks on the paper . \n az is also grateful to the organisers for giving her the opportunity to attend _ the lapis school _ and for financial support . \n this work was supported by the grant n203 017 31/2872 of the ministry of science and higher education and the polish astroparticle network 621/e-78/sn-0068/2007 .", "StartTimeOffset": 119075101782, "RequestID": "db2574e1528fb7f38df3b04647e119be22918c26", "TotalTokens": 2704}

{"ContextTokens": 3103, "GeneratedTokens": 174, "SynthesizedBody": "the underlying principles of many quantum information protocols can be traced back to the concept of quantum random walk ( qrw ) , which since its first description have become a fundamental paradigm in quantum science @xcite . \n the idea of qrws was originally conceived by aharonov _ \n @xcite as an extension of the well - known classical random walk ( crw ) @xcite . \n the main distinguishing feature of a qrw , compare to a crw , is the possibility of interference between the multiple paths that can be simultaneously traversed by a quantum walker , enabling thus a faster spreading of the uncertainty of location of the walker than in the classical case @xcite . \n the temporal evolution of a quantum system , such as a qrw , depends on the presence , and specific characteristics , of the environmental effects ( decoherence ) which can modify it @xcite . in most cases , \n the influence of decoherence during the evolution of a quantum walker transforms an originally pure state into a mixed state , lowering the uncertainty about the location of the walker as it propagates . in the limiting case , when all cross - interference terms between different lattice sites are completely erased , \n the state of pure diffusive classical propagation is reached @xcite . \n qrws have been theoretically explored for the case of one - dimensional lattices @xcite , and experimentally implemented by means of different physical platforms , such as photon - based systems @xcite , optical lattices @xcite and waveguide arrays @xcite . \n also , qrws have been implemented using trapped ions @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite . \n although the implementation of one - dimensional qrws has showed to be useful when describing several quantum information systems , there is a great interest in expanding the concept to multidimensional lattices . along these lines , \n two - dimensional qrws provide a powerful tool for modeling complex quantum information and energy transport systems @xcite . \n notwithstanding , their realization represents a challenge because of the need of a four - level coin operation @xcite . \n one way to overcome this drawback is to make use of different degrees of freedom of photons , such as polarization and orbital angular momentum , as it has been shown in @xcite . \n another approach is to mimic the two - dimensional qrws evolution by performing two subsequent one - dimensional qrws @xcite .    here , we make use of the latter approach to put forward an experimental setup for the realization of two - dimensional qrws . \n we include the environmental effects ( decoherence ) as pure dephasing by means of the introduction of random phase patterns , generated by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , which can be different from site to site ( _ spatial disorder _ ) . by controlling the degree of decoherence \n , we study the transition from the quantum ballistic spreading to the diffusive classical walk . \n also , by adding static disorder , we show the possibility of observing anderson localization @xcite . \n importantly , our proposal provides a versatile , highly - scalable experimental setup , which may be used as a tool for understanding quantum processes whose underlying physics can be somehow traced to the concept of random walks , such as energy transport in photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes @xcite and material band gap structures @xcite . \n the structure of the article is as follows . in sec . \n ii , we introduce the qrw model system , including dephasing , considered here \n . the proposed experimental setup is described in sec . \n numerical results are discussed in sec . \n finally , we summarize our results in the conclusion . \n a typical discrete quantum random walk comprises two operations : a coin - tossing operation and a shift operation . here \n , the coin - tossing operation is performed in the hilbert space @xmath0 spanned by vectors @xmath1 , corresponding to the photon polarization . \n the random walk is performed in the hilbert space @xmath2 , corresponding to the position of the photon in the transverse plane , spanned by vectors @xmath3 ( @xmath4 integers ) , which indicate sites ( @xmath4 ) in the transverse plane ( @xmath5 . the global quantum system thus evolve in the hilbert space @xmath6    the state of the system is described by the density matrix @xmath7 , which is transformed to a new density matrix each step @xmath8 via the map @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the hadamard operator @xmath11 which acts on the polarization degree of freedom . \n the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which describe the walker s shift in the transverse dimensions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , independently , read as @xmath16 and @xmath17    the coupling of the quantum walker with the environment is described by pure dephasing @xcite . \n the form of the unitary dephasing operator considered here can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a random phase matrix and @xmath20 is the pauli operator . \n inspection of eq . \n ( [ eq:6 ] ) shows that @xmath19 represents a newly introduced phase difference between the horizontal and vertical polarizations at each site . \n concerning this , we will consider three physically relevant scenarios , that can be easily implemented in the set - up proposed here ( see sec . \n iii ) . in the general case , \n the phase differences @xmath19 are independent random variables , but with the same probability distribution . \n moreover , the ensemble of phase differences @xmath19 can change from step @xmath8 to step @xmath21 . in the following \n , we will refer to this case as a qrw influenced by _ \n dynamical spatial disorder_.        the easiest probability distribution that we can consider is an uniform probability distribution . if phases can be chosen arbitrarily between the extreme values @xmath22 and @xmath23 , \n there is a constant probability @xmath24 to obtain any phase in this interval . \n @xmath25 is the maximal phase which we can have between the two orthogonal polarizations . \n @xmath26 corresponds to the absence of any spatial disorder . if phases do not change during propagation , \n even though they might differ from site to site , i.e. @xmath27 , then we have _ static spatial disorder_. finally , if all phase differences are the same for all sites , but they can still change from one step to the following , we have _ dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder_.    the probability of detecting a photon in the site ( @xmath4 ) is @xmath28| i , j\\rangle , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where the density matrix that describes the whole system is traced out over the polarization degree of freedom @xmath29 . \n the spreading of the uncertainty of photon location is characterized by dependence of the variance on the step index n    @xmath30    where @xmath31 represents the lattice site with indexes ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath32 is the mean position , i.e. , @xmath33 . \n the main building block of the qrw setup is the multi - path mach - zehnder - like configuration shown in fig . \n 1 . it allows to make several runs of the qrw without the necessity of using a large amount of optical components , as it is the case , for instance , of the experiment described in @xcite . \n a similar scheme , based on a single - path mach - zehnder - like configuration has been used @xcite . however in these cases , the walker moves in time , whereas in our proposal the walker moves in the two - dimensional transverse plane , offering a way to simplify the experimental implementation of the two - dimensional qrw . \n as source of photons one can use a highly attenuated short coherent pulse , prepared by the combination of a photon source and attenuator ( at ) , generating the initial state @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the central site . \n the duration of the pulse has to be sufficiently smaller than the time - of - fly through the setup in one cycle . \n the transverse size of the gaussian beam profile of the pulse has to be carefully chosen , so that two adjacent sites are not overlapping in the space due to diffraction . \n for instance , by making use of a gaussian beam of 2 mm beam waist , corresponding to a rayleigh range of 23.6 m ( for a wavelength @xmath36 = 532 nm ) , along with typical - sized optical components , we could in principle perform a qrw of approximately more than 20 steps . \n the number of steps can be further improved by applying smaller beams together with a re - focusing system placed along the walker s path . \n alternatively , a spontaneous parametric down - conversion source can be used , provided each down - converted photon is generated in a pure state . \n then , the photon is transmitted via the beam splitter ( bs ) to the system .    to get a clearer picture of the working of the quantum random \n walk , let us consider in detail the quantum state of the photon in its first passage through the system . first , the polarization state of the photon is changed by the half - wave plate ( hwp1 ) to @xmath37 $ ] , i.e. , the hadamard ( @xmath10 ) operation is applied . after this transformation , the photon is displaced by the horizontal beam displacer ( hbd ) along the @xmath14 axis according to its polarization , as described by the shift operator @xmath12 . \n the photon is now in the state @xmath38.$ ] a second half - wave plate ( hwp2 ) implements a new hadamard transformation , which transforms the quantum state to @xmath39 . \n the vertical beam displacer ( vbd ) shifts the position of the photon along the @xmath15 axis . after this \n , the quantum state of the photon reads    @xmath40 . \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the spatial light modulator ( slm ) is used to introduce random phases , given by the phase - matrix @xmath19 . after the photon passes through the slm , the whole cycle is repeated with high probability . \n if not , the photon escapes through the other output port of the beam - splitter , which directs it towards a highly sensitive ( single - photon sensitivity ) intensified ccd camera with integrated photo - multipliers , which allows to spatially resolve a weak signal with a high efficiency ( @xmath4190% ) @xcite . \n moreover , losses in the setup can be compensated by an increase of the amplitude of pulse . \n the size of whole array of beams can be reduced by an auxiliary imaging system in order to fit on the limited size of sensitive area of ccd .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig:5 ]    the photon position is less dramatic than in the case with dynamical spatial disorder . for the dynamical spatial disorder , @xmath42 for @xmath25 after 20 steps . on the contrary , for dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder , we have @xmath43 under the same conditions . \n indeed , the @xmath8-dependence of the typical deviation , characteristic of the classical regime , it is not yet reached after @xmath44 steps , as is readily observed in fig . \n 4(b ) .      in the context of our discussion \n , the anderson localization is the reduction of spreading of the uncertainty of the photon position @xcite . we will demonstrate that this effect can also be observed in the set - up considered here . in @xcite , anderson localization was observed in the transverse plane of a light beam passing through a crystal with random static fluctuations of the index of refraction . since the randomness in the index of refraction is affecting only the phase of the propagating beam , it is possible to imitate these phase - fluctuations with a slm , under the consideration of static spatial disorder , since anderson localization does not appear with dynamical spatial disorder .    in fig . \n 5(a ) we present a typical profile of the phase - matrix @xmath19 , independent of n , which leads to beam localization . \n 5(b ) shows the corresponding probability distribution of the photon position for this specific phase profile . \n notice that it contains a strong peak located in the middle of the lattice . \n the presence of anderson localization is confirmed in fig . \n 5(c ) , where we show the averaged probability distribution function for @xmath25 , exhibiting an exponential suppression of probabilities for sites distant from the center . for the sake of clarity , we also plotted in fig . \n 5(d ) two cuts of the averaged probability distribution along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes , to highlight this feature . \n we have put forward a new , highly scalable and easily implemented experimental configuration to observe spatial two - dimensional random walks under a great variety of circumstances , by means of the implementation of two consecutive one - dimensional random walks . \n the proposal makes use of only a small amount of simple optics components , and allows us to simulate many different quantum systems and protocols based on the quantum random walk concept . additionally , by carefully controlling the amount and type of disorder present in the system \n , we have shown the effects of different environmental effects : dynamical spatial disorder , dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder and static spatial disorder . \n the last case drove us to the observation of anderson localization . \n the control of environmental effects is paramount importance in nearly all quantum systems . in some cases , it is even crucial to understand the dynamics experimentally observe . \n for instance , in light harvesting complexes @xcite , the interplay between coherent evolution and noise is a critical ingredient , which allows to obtain a high efficiency energy transport . \n the authors thank to dr . \n jan soubusta for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by project nos . \n fis2010 - 14831 and fet - open 255914 ( phorbitech ) . \n thanks the project fi - dgr 2011 of the catalan government . \n this work has also supported in part and by projects cost oc 09026 , cz.1.05/2.1.00/03.0058 of the ministry of education , youth and sports of the czech republic and by project prf-2012 - 003 of palack university . \n a.  peruzzo , m.  lobino , j.  c.  f.  matthews , n.  matsuda , a.  politi , k.  poulios , x.  zhou , y.  lahini , n.  ismail , k.  wrhoff , y.  bromberg , y.  silberberg , m.  g.  thompson , and j.  l.  obrien , science * 329 * , 1500 ( 2010 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 147010381836, "RequestID": "d98e6f7ff8b80be49c1a1280c0da1aa6569dab6e", "TotalTokens": 3277}

the only difference with the free - field case used in high - energy physics is that electronic creation and annihilation operators create and destroy atomic states instead of free particles . \n a few methods allow one to extract energy levels from the bound - state qed hamiltonian : the two - time green s function method  @xcite , the method being developed by lindgren ( based on relativistic many - body perturbation theory merged with qed )  @xcite , the adiabatic @xmath4-matrix formalism of gell - mann , low and sucher  @xcite , and the evolution operator method  @xcite . \n some other methods yield atomic energy levels , but they include qed effects only _ partly _ or approximately ( such as the multiconfiguration dirac - fock method  @xcite , configuration interaction calculations  @xcite and relativistic many - body perturbation theory  @xcite ) .    however , \n only _ two _ methods can in principle be employed in order to calculate energy levels of _ quasidegenerate _ atomic states [ e.g. , the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 levels in heliumlike ions , which are experimentally important ] : the two - time green s function method and the method being elaborated by lindgren . \n we present in this talk a non - technical introduction to the first method . \n the two - time green s function method has also the advantage of yielding a _ simpler renormalization procedure _ than the gell - mann  low  sucher method in the case of _ degenerate _ levels  @xcite . \n all the methods that extract atomic energy levels from the bound - state qed hamiltonian study the _ propagation _ of electrons between two different times . \n the methods differ in the number of _ infinite _ times used :    ( a )  in the gell - mann  low  sucher method , the atomic state under consideration evolves from time @xmath7 to time @xmath8 with an adiabatic switching of the interaction ;

the procedure handles degenerate and quasidegenerate atomic levels without any special difficulty  @xcite . \n one of the basic ideas behind the pole extraction is found in the following mathematical device , which uses _ any _ contour @xmath12 that encloses the pole in order to find its exact position : if the function @xmath13 has a simple pole at @xmath14 , then we have from complex analysis @xmath15 the contour @xmath12 is only required to encircle the pole and to be positively oriented , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : contourint ] . since the green s function has simple poles at the atomic energy levels  @xcite , eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) is a way of obtaining them . \n when qed shifts of degenerate of quasidegenerate levels are calculated , the _ scalar _ green s function @xmath0 of eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) is simply replaced by a finite - size _ matrix _ defined on the space of levels under consideration  @xcite . \n obviously , _ analytic _ properties of the green s function  @xcite are important in the evaluation of eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) . \n we have developed a set of _ graphical _ techniques that allow one to obtain the laurent series of the green s function @xmath11 by a _ \n systematic _ procedure . \n the idea behind these techniques consists in displaying the analytic structure of the green s function step by step ; each step explicitly extracts _ \n one _ singularity , and we proceed until we have exhausted all the singularities of the green s function ; at this point , contour integrals such as eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) can be calculated quite simply . \n it is impossible to give here a full account of the method we use for deriving the effective , finite - size qed hamiltonian . \n however , we can mention a particular feature of our calculational strategy : a very special `` particle '' appears in our algorithm ; this particle is quite simple since it `` disintegrates '' immediately ( zero life time ) and can not move ( zero probability for going from one position to a different one ) . in mathematical terms , the coordinate - space propagator of this particle is a four - dimensional delta function @xmath16 $ ] that we represent by a special line in feynman diagrams . \n the experimental accuracy on transition energies is so high that second - order ( i.e. , two - photon ) effects must be taken into account in order to compare experiments with theory . \n we thus have very recently calculated the contribution of the self - energy screening  @xcite to the qed effective hamiltonian ; this contribution corresponds to the following physical processes : @xmath17 our result is part of the current theoretical effort developed with the aim of matching experimental precisions .", "StartTimeOffset": 185541573318, "RequestID": "ebd141ded97e434a41465a6802f47dcd9d19b21e", "TotalTokens": 2167}

driven galactic winds . \n ( for a recent review , see smecker - hane 1997 . ) \n we have undertaken as series of studies involving photometry and spectroscopy of stars in the carina and fornax dsphs to determine their star - formation and chemical evolution histories . \n here we report on our spectroscopy of carina dsphs stars and their derived metallicities . \n we used our photometric survey of bright stars centered on the carina dsph ( smecker - hane , et al . \n 1994 ) to identify red giants that were probable members of the galaxy . at a galactic latitude of @xmath5 , \n the carina fields are contaminated with a significant number of galactic foreground stars . \n although members can not be positively identified by their location in the cmd , they are easily identified by their large radial velocities ( 223 km / sec ) . for our spectroscopic sample , we randomly chose stars from the cmd that had magnitudes within 1.5 mag of the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , ( b - i ) colors within @xmath6 of the mean color of the rgb , and distances @xmath7 arcmin ( 1 core radius ) from the center of the galaxy . \n we obtained spectra of these stars with the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 4.0-meter telescope and the argus multi - fiber system in november , 1997 . \n the argus system allows simultaneous observation of 24 stars and 24 sky positions . \n total exposure times were 3.5 to 5 hours . \n images were reduced using the standard ccd reduction package in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) , and the spectra were extracted and calibrated with the argus package . \n the most difficult part of the data reduction was the sky subtraction because the ca ii lines fall among bright night sky emission lines . \n the fluxes in the sky lines were typically 5 times higher than the stellar continuum fluxes in the region of the the ca ii lines . \n the final stellar spectra have a dispersion of 0.83  / pix , and a typical signal - to - noise ratio of 17 per pixel . \n examples are shown in figure  1 . \n we derived metallicities , [ fe / h ] , from the reduced equivalent width , @xmath8 , of the ca ii infrared triplet lines in each spectrum . \n this technique has been empirically calibrated by rutledge , et al . \n ( 1997 ) using observations of numerous galactic globular cluster stars , and interested readers are referred to it for details . in brief , the sum of the equivalent widths of the two strongest lines of the ca ii triplet at 8542 and 8662  , @xmath9 , shows a linear dependence with [ fe / h ] when the effect of effective temperature and gravity are removed to first order . \n the later is effectively done by forming the reduced equivalent width for each star , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the star and @xmath12 is the magnitude of the horizontal branch . the equivalent width for each ca \n ii line was determined by fitting a linear continuum plus gaussian - shaped absorption feature in the standard wavelength regions defined by armandroff & da costa ( 1991 ) . the adopted calibration equation , [ fe / h ] @xmath13 , from rutledge , et al . \n ( 1997 ) gives metallicities based on the scale defined by the high - dispersion spectroscopic work of carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) . \n figure 2 shows a histogram of the derived metallicities for 52 radial velocity members of carina and a gaussian fit to the histogram . \n the average metallicity is [ fe / h ] @xmath14 ( including the calibration zeropoint error in the uncertainty ) and the observed dispersion is @xmath15 dex . \n the error in each derived metallicity is set primarily by the sky flux and random fiber - star positioning errors . \n thus the [ fe / h ] measurement errors are , to first order , independent of the magnitude and metallicity of the stars in the limited magnitude range over which we are observing . \n subtracting in quadrature the average measurement error of 0.15 dex and 0.02 dex uncertainty in the slope of the calibration from the observed dispersion reveals an intrinsic metallicity dispersion of @xmath16 dex ( 1.0 dex full width ) for the carina dsph . \n two notable calibration issues deserve discussion . \n first , the @xmath8[fe / h ] calibration is strictly valid for old stars although armandroff & da costa ( 1991 ) note no strong age dependence . \n second , the calibrating galactic globular clusters exhibit a relatively well - defined relationship in [ ca / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] that reflects the history of enrichment from type  ia and type  ii supernovae in the galaxy . \n however dwarf galaxies may have entirely different star - formation histories and may not share the same [ ca / fe]-[fe / h ] relationship ( see smecker - hane & mcwilliam in these proceedings for a discussion of abundance ratios in the sagittarius dsph ) . \n therefore , we are embarking on a series of observations to calibrate @xmath8 to yield [ ca / h ] and to explore its sensitivity to age . \n the derived mean metallicity and intrinsic metallicity dispersion roughly agree with our initial analysis of the carina cmd ( smecker - hane 1997 ) although the metallicity dispersion derived from spectroscopy is larger . \n a full analysis of the cmd is underway to determine carina s star - formation history . \n carina s rgb is very narrow in color because of the degeneracy of age and metallicity . \n a wide range in age ( @xmath17 2 to 14 gyr ) counteracts a 1.0 dex spread in metallicity in such a way that the younger rgb stars are more metal rich and hence have approximately the same colors as the older , more metal - poor , rgb stars . \n thus a galaxy with a narrow rgb may indeed have a complex stellar population . \n an interesting contrast to the carina dsph is the leo i dsph . from analysis of its cmd , \n gallart , et al . \n ( 1999 ) conclude that its wide rgb may be a result of its wide range in age ( @xmath17 1 to 10  15 gyr ) and its internal metallicity dispersion may be very small . in conclusion , \n the dsphs exhibit a very wide variety of star - formation and chemical evolution histories , and we can learn much about the physical mechanisms that control their evolution by studying them in detail . \n armandroff , t. e. & da costa , g. s. 1991 , aj , 101 , 1329 carretta , e. & gratton , r. g. 1997 , a&as , 121 , 95 gallart , c. , et al . 1999 , \n apj , 514 , 665 rutledge , g. a. , hesser , j. e. , stetson , p. b. 1997,pasp , 109 , 907 smecker , t. a. 1997 , in _ star formation near and far . \n seventh astrophysics conference at college park maryland _ , ed . \n s. s. holt and l. g. mundy ( aip press : new york ) , 571 smecker -

entropy model selects the limiting distribution _ \n , in the sense of the dwsl , within a class of models for the transfer matrices of the individual scattering units .    a class of limiting distributions wider than that of ref . \n @xcite was studied by one of the present authors ( pam ) and s. tomsovic in ref . \n @xcite , in which the isotropy assumption of ref . \n @xcite was relaxed to a large extent . in ref . \n @xcite the dwsl plays again an essential role and the result is a more general clt than that of ref . \n @xcite . the evolution with @xmath0 \n is described by a generalized diffusion equation , in which the diffusion coefficients are the inverse mfp s for the various scattering processes that may occur in the problem . \n when the various mfp s can be represented by a single one , one encounters the dmpk equation that was described above . \n thus the model of ref . \n @xcite appears as a possible candidate to study the influence of the specific scattering properties of the various modes , which seem to be relevant , for instance , for the problem of waveguides with surface disorder , where dmpk does not give a proper description . \n we first present a general way of expressing the expectation value of an observable when we add a bb to an already existing waveguide of length @xmath0 , as shown in fig . \n the transfer matrix of the two pieces is combined as in eq . \n ( [ m = mm  ] ) , which can also be written as @xmath43 where we have expressed the transfer matrix of the bb as @xmath44 consider now a function @xmath45 of the transfer matrix @xmath13 , whose statistical properties we want to study : it might be , for instance , the conductance @xmath46 studied earlier , the transmission coefficient @xmath47 , or any other quantity of physical interest . \n its average for the enlarged piece can be written in terms of that for the original one as @xmath48 to simplify the notation , we have indicated symbolically with dots the relevant summations over channel and block indices ( see ref . \n @xcite for more details ) . \n it is clear that we now need an expression for the various moments of the quantities @xmath49 associated with the bb . \n recently @xcite , such an expression has been obtained from a potential model , which we now outline . \n we construct the bb as a sequence of @xmath50 random @xmath51-potential slices , such that @xmath52 as shown schematically in fig . \n [ random_slices ] .    the @xmath53-th @xmath51-slice potential , defined as @xmath54 has matrix elements with respect to channels given by @xmath55_{ab } = { ( u_r)}_{ab}\\delta ( x -

( \n [ < > l+dl ] ) to the l.h.s . , \n divide both sides by @xmath19 and take the limit @xmath65 . \n the result is the fokker - planck equation : @xmath66 the fact that cumulants of the potential higher than the second are irrelevant in the end signals the existence of a _ \n generalized clt _ : once the mfp s are specified , the limiting equation ( [ general_diff_eqn ] ) is _ universal _ , i.e. , independent of other details of the microscopic statistics . \n one of the main difficulties in solving eq . \n ( [ general_diff_eqn ] ) , both analytically and numerically , is that it involves averages of different quantities on the l.h.s . and on the r.h.s . \n so far , that equation has been solved analytically for the one - open - channel case ( @xmath67 ) and a restricted number of  observables \" only : the results thus obtained are in excellent agreement with microscopic calculations @xcite . \n numerically , we have found no  direct \" way of solving eq . \n ( [ general_diff_eqn ] ) . \n recently , a numerical algorithm which was called  random walk in transfer - matrix space \" has been implemented @xcite , in which a bb is constructed with the property given in eq . \n ( [ general_diff_coeff ] ) , and then combined with successive bb s to construct a waveguide of finite length @xmath0 . \n the results have been compared with those arising from microscopic calculations , in which the entities that are combined are , literally , individual potential slices . for situations in which we have bulk disorder , \n the comparison is excellent , even for quantities which are not described properly by dmpk . for surface disorder , \n preliminary results indicate a reasonable agreement for the observables examined so far . \n in this paper we have first revisited some earlier results which seem to indicate that a maximum - entropy approach to the problem of transport in disordered waveguides works well when there is a central - limit theorem ( clt )  behind the scenes \" . \n recently , we have shown that a clt arises in a model consisting of a random distribution of @xmath51-potential slices . \n the parameters on which the result depends are the mfp s \n @xmath63 which depend on the variances of the potential - slices matrix elements and the correlation coefficient of these matrix elements . \n other details of the potential distribution are  washed out \" in the dense - weak - scattering limit ( dwsl ) . \n the result is expressed in terms of a generalized diffusion equation for the evolution with length of expectation values of physical observables . \n numerical results based on the  random walk in transfer - matrix space \" method indicate an excellent agreement with microscopic calculations with bulk disorder , and a reasonable one for the problem with surface disorder . \n p.a.m . and m.y . \n acknowledge financial support by conacyt , mexico , the former through grant no . \n l.s.f . and j.j.s . \n have been supported by the spanish mcyt ( ref . \n bfm2003 - 01167 ) and the eu integrated project `` molecular imaging '' ( eu contract lshg - ct-2003 - 503259 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 215279748168, "RequestID": "09951bf6cf85f6a0b34a3e6bb8dc6611232349e5", "TotalTokens": 4000}

20 sec in @xmath3 and 5 - 15 sec in @xmath4 , with time resolution of 135 sec . \n for the observations collected in the white light mode for both stars , the exposure time was set to 5 sec which resulted in a time resolution of 8 sec . \n the level of accuracy of our measurements was 0.01 mag . in order to phase our data , we adopted the following ephemeris from the literature : + su uma : @xmath5 = 2446143.6627 + 0.076351 @xmath6 @xmath7 ( thorstensen 1986 ) + u gem : @xmath8 = 2437638.8270 + 0.17690619 @xmath6 @xmath7 ( krzemiski 1965 , marsh 1990 ) . + where @xmath5 concerns the spectroscopic inferior conjunction of emission lines source for su uma , and @xmath8 is the mideclipse moment for u gem . \n light curves of su uma obtained without filter and in @xmath1 and @xmath4 bands as well as @xmath9 colour indicies are shown in figure  1 . the corresponding light and \n colour curves of @xmath10 gem are presented in figure 2 . \n we do not show our observations during outburst of u gem because they do not cover the whole orbital period . \n we noticed fast flickering and orbital changes of the brightness during the quiescence phase in su uma and u gem systems ( figure 1 and 2 ) . \n especially both unfiltered light curves show almost identical pattern of these variations during whole orbital period , if we neglect the eclipses in u gem . the higher amplitude of such variations in the case of su uma is a result of the dominant influence of hot spot over the accretion disk and the other components of the system on the light curve . \n moreover , the unfiltered observations during the quiescence and the @xmath4 observations during the outburst phase , indicate an additional slow pattern of changes on timescales compatible with the orbital period .    during the superoutburst phase , characteristic superhumps are apparent in the light curves of su uma . \n @xmath9 color index is constant for both superoutburst and outburst phases , which suggests that the changes of the system geometry are responsible for the observed superhumps . \n it was discussed by udalski ( 1990 ) that the superhumps are the result of disk precession . \n the maxima of superhamps during superoutburst occur in different phases than orbital maxima during quiescence . \n the preccesion in the orbital motion direction causes their period of changes to be longer than orbital period . \n highly time resolved observations in a non - filter mode in the quiescence show flickering variability on timescales of minutes and amplitudes of 0.05 - 0.1 mag in u gem ( figure 2a ) and even 0.7 mag in su uma ( figure 1a ) . \n the flickering amplitude in both stars increases toward the shorter wavelenghts during the quiescence and almost disappear during the outburst and the superoutburst phases in su uma . \n the maximum amplitude corresponds to the best visibility of the hot spot ( face - on ) near phase 0.6 . on the other hand , in the case of u gem flickering \n is well visible not only when the hot spot is well seen ( figure  2a ) . \n the flickering is most pronounced near phase 0.4 when the hot spot does not face the observer . \n thus , the influence of intrinsic accretion disk instabilities seem to be a very important source of flickering in u gem \n . +   * acknowledgements : * this work was supported by the polish mnisw grant n203 018 32/2338 . \n krzemiski w. , 1965 , _ apj _ , * 142 * , 1051 -

de vaucouleurs & buta 1980 ; buta & combes 1996 ) . \n these rings are often characterized by intense starbirth activity . \n uv imaging neatly isolates such rings from the older disk and bulge components . \n uit images of m100 ( ngc 4321 ) , ngc 1317 , and m94 ( ngc 4736 ) provide textbook examples of the starburst ring phenomenon ( see http://trifle.gsfc.nasa.gov/uit/astro1/astro1_pictures.html ) . \n as the closest early - type spiral galaxy of low inclination , m94 ( ngc 4736 ) has received concentrated attention from both observers and theorists . \n this ( r)sa(r)ab galaxy is noted for its inner ring of ongoing starburst activity ( r @xmath1 1.0 kpc ) , oval stellar distribution at intermediate radius ( r @xmath1 4.9 kpc ) , and outer stellar ring near its holmberg radius ( r @xmath1 7.3 kpc ) . \n the uv images obtained by uit and hst reveal hitherto unrecognized patterns of recent star formation , whose presence lends further support to the hypothesis of galaxy evolution via bar - mediated resonances . \n the uit s fuv image shows the _ starburst ring _ in high contrast against a mostly dark disk ( waller et al . \n 1997 ; see also http://trifle.gsfc.nasa.gov/uit/astro2/ngc4736_pr.gif ) . \n exterior to the ring are two 500-pc size _ bi - symmetric knots _ on diametrically opposite sides of the nucleus . \n the hst s nuv image of the central 20 arcsecs shows a 500-pc long _ mini - bar _ that had been previously inferred from photometric analyses of optical - band images . by comparison , \n a groundbased r - band image shows the underlying bulge and _ oval disk _ made up of cooler and typically older stars . \n taken together , the nuclear minibar , starburst ring , bi - symmetric knots , oval disk , and outer pseudo - ring provide compelling evidence for resonant dynamics operating in the disk of m94 . \n more specifically , the radii of these various features match those of important orbital resonances , given a pattern speed of 35 km s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 and our adopted distance and inclination ( see figure  [ fig-1 ] ) . \n this pattern of orbital resonances is most likely driven by some combination of the nuclear mini - bar and oval distortion in the disk . \n note in figure 1 that our fit places the starburst ring between the two inner lindblad resonances rather than aligned with the outer ilr as modeled by gerin et al . \n ( 1991 ) and mulder & combes ( 1996 ) . \n it is worth noting that at redshifts of 15 , the 2-kpc diameter starburst ring in m94 would subtend angles of only ( 0.7@xmath3  1.0@xmath3)h@xmath4/75 in an einstein - de sitter universe ( q@xmath4 = 1/2 ) and ( 0.3@xmath3  0.2@xmath3)h@xmath4/75 in an open ( milne ) universe ( q@xmath4 = 0 ) . \n therefore , many of the `` core - halo '' morphologies that are evident at high - redshift in the restframe fuv ( cf . \n giavalisco 1997 ) may , in fact be marginally - resolved representations of galaxies with starburst rings in their centers . \n gravitationally - lensed galaxies are fortuitously magnified , enabling resolution of their structure at high s / n . \n an important precedent in this regard is the gravitationally - lensed `` pretzel galaxy '' which lies behind the galaxy cluster 0024 + 1654 at an estimated redshift of 1.2  1.8 ( colley et al . \n 1996 ; tyson et al . \n detailed reconstructions of the multiply - lensed galaxy show a clear annular morphology on a scale of several kpc . if m94 and other nearby ringed galaxies can be used as current - epoch analogues , the `` pretzel galaxy '' and perhaps other marginally - resolved `` core - halo '' galaxies at high redshift may represent youthful inner disks evolving under the influence of oval or bar asymmetries . \n conversely , if evidence for starburst rings at high redshift proves to be sparse , then massive inner disks featuring ring - bar dynamics have yet to form in most systems , or starbursting bulges are masking their presence . \n buta , r. , & combes , f. 1996 , fund . \n cosmic phys . , 17 , 95 colley , w. , tyson , j. a. , & turner , e. l. 1996 , , 461 , l83 de vaucouleurs , g. , & buta , r. 1980 , , 44 , 451 giavalisco , m. , et al . \n 1997 , in the ultraviolet universe at low and high redshift : probing the progress of galaxy evolution , eds . \n w. h. waller , m. n. fanelli , j. e. hollis , & a. c. danks ( new york : aip press ) , p. 221 gerin , m. , casoli , f. , & combes , f. 1991 , a&a , 251 , 32 kormendy , j. 1979 , , 227 , 714 mulder , p. s. & van driel , w. 1993 , a&a , 272 , 63 mulder , p. s. & combes , f. 1996 , a&a , 313 , 723 tyson , j. a. , kochanski , g. , & dellantonio , i. 1997 , in the ultraviolet universe at low and high redshift : ... , p. 204 \n waller , w. h. , et al . \n 1997 , in the ultraviolet universe at low and high redshift : ... , p. 39", "StartTimeOffset": 237187133766, "RequestID": "2dbae4eb433df35c228d6ee93b71dfb0201d0a58", "TotalTokens": 1578}

ray sources was limited to our galaxy and the nearby magellanic clouds . \n the advanced capabilities of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories opened the possibility to study spectral and timing properties of individual bright x -

ray properties and positional coincidence with one of the major spiral arms in m 33 ( fig . \n [ image_general ] ) imply that it is not a galactic foreground object and almost certainly belongs to m33 . \n the x - ray pulsations and spectra of the source are consistent with an accreting highly magnetized neutron star in a binary system .    in the high - mass system scenario , \n the 285.4 s pulse period places xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 squarely among be systems or underfilled roche lobe supergiant systems on the corbet diagram @xcite \n . the transient behavior of the source strongly favors the be x - ray binary interpretation , in which the x - ray outbursts are attributed to either periastron passages of the compact companion ( type i outbursts ) or changes in the be star circumstellar disk that might occur at any binary phase ( type ii outbursts ) @xcite . \n possible optical counterparts to xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 are all fainter than 20 mag in the v band ( table [ lgs_counterparts ] ) , with absolute @xmath17 magnitudes between @xmath18 and @xmath19 at 817 kpc , supporting the be system identification , but not ruling out a supergiant system with a luminosity class ii companion . \n in addition , the brightest optical object located within the error circle of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 has properties consistent with being an early b v star and possibly belonging to the be class . assuming the distance of 817 kpc , the absorption - corrected @xmath8 kev x - ray luminosity of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 measured in the jul . \n 9 - 12 observations ( @xmath20 ergs s@xmath4 ) also falls within the range observed for be x - ray binary pulsars and exceeds typical luminosities observed in the wind - fed supergiant systems @xcite .    if xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 is indeed a be system , its binary period , @xmath21 estimated from the corbet diagram falls in the @xmath22 day range . the observed time span between _ xmm - newton _ \n observations when the source was detected allows to put an additional limit on the orbital period . assuming that a single type i outburst was observed and that it was lasting less than one orbital cycle requires @xmath23 days . \n another possibility is that xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 is a transient low - mass binary system @xcite . in that scenario , \n the transient outbursts could be explained as a result of a viscous - thermal instability of the quiescent accretion disk . \n the relatively long pulsation period of the source almost certainly excludes low - mass short orbital period systems . on the other hand , \n the possibility of a very long period system with red giant companion similar to the galactic source gx 1 + 4 @xcite can not be completely ruled out , since the expected brightness of the red giant companion ( @xmath24 mag ) does not exceed the brightness of the individual optical objects detected within the error circle of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 . \n although most of the observed properties of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 favor a be / x - ray binary identification , a proper optical identification is essential to determine the actual nature of the system . to facilitate it , deeper high - resolution optical observations of the source region \n are needed along with an improved x - ray position measurement . \n regular monitoring x - ray observations of the central region of m33 have a potential to detect new outbursts from xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 , improve source localization and put constraints on its orbital parameters . \n the number of x - ray pulsar candidates with non - supersoft spectra located outside our own galaxy and magellanic clouds is still very small with only four such systems known so far , including xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 . \n all of them were discovered as transient sources with x - ray luminosities in the @xmath25 ergs s@xmath4 range , and probably belong to a luminous be / x - ray binary class . because of their higher mass transfer rates , luminous x - ray pulsars are ideal laboratories to study effects of angular momentum transfer and interaction between pulsar magnetosphere and the accretion flow through the evolution of their pulsation periods @xcite . \n analysis of the pulse profiles and spectral properties of these objects can provide extremely valuable information on the accretion flow and magnetic field geometry , neutron star compactness and emission properties @xcite . \n the discovery of xmmu j013359.5 + 303634 is yet another demonstration that monitoring observations with current x - ray missions can detect these and similar pulsating sources ( both transient and persistent ) in the galaxies located up to a few mpc away . \n observations of nearby galaxies allow us to monitor a significantly bigger x - ray source population when compared to just our own galaxy and its immediate neighbors . in the galaxies with recent and ongoing star formation \n , x - ray pulsars should constitute a sizable fraction of the total x - ray source population , with some of them expected to be bright enough ( @xmath26 ergs s@xmath4 ) for detection by current instruments , opening a way to significantly increase the statistics of luminous x - ray pulsars . \n the author would like to thank the referee for comments and suggestions that helped to improve the paper . \n this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center . \n xmm -

order expansions on grape . in p@xmath0m@xmath0 \n , multipole expansions are represented by a small number of pseudoparticles . \n the masses and positions of pseudoparticles are determined so that they have the same expansion coefficients as the corresponding physical particles up to the specified order . with the p@xmath0m@xmath0 , \n we can use grape to evaluate high order terms , since they are expressed by particles .    in this letter , we first describe the procedure to express quadrupole moment using three particles (   2 ) . \n then we briefly describe the generalization to higher order expansion (   3 ) . \n finally we give the result of numerical tests on grape-4 (   4 ,   5 ) . \n in p@xmath0m@xmath0 , we distribute the pseudoparticles so that they exactly reproduce the coefficients of the multipole expansion of real ( physical ) particles up to a given order . conceptually , in order to obtain such a distribution , first we calculate the expansion coefficients from the distribution of physical particles . \n we then solve the inverse problem to obtain the masses and positions of pseudoparticles . in the following , \n we describe a practical procedure to obtain the distribution of the pseudoparticles which can be used up to quadrupoles \n .    in cartesian coordinates , the multipole expansion up to quadrupoles of the potential due to @xmath1 particles is expressed as @xmath4 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the mass @xmath5 and the position @xmath6 of pseudoparticles must be determined so that they give the same @xmath7 up to a given order @xmath8 . \n in general , the expansion up to the @xmath8-th order has @xmath9 independent terms . \n since each pseudoparticle has four degrees of freedom ( one for mass and three for position ) , theoretically we can reproduce the expansion using @xmath10 pseudoparticles . here \n @xmath11 denotes the minimum integer not smaller than @xmath12 .    in order to express multipole expansion of order @xmath13 \n , we need @xmath14 pseudoparticle . \n we must put the particle so that @xmath15 and @xmath16 reproduce the first term ( monopole term ) of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : mpicart ] ) . for this purpose \n we can set the mass @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total mass of physical particles . \n at least formally , the position of the pseudoparticle can be anywhere . in figure \n [ fig : p012 ] we place them at the origin as example . in practice , we would never use zeroth order expansion since we can achieve the first order accuracy with one particle , as we will see below . \n , width=302 ]    for @xmath19 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 must reproduce the first and the second term ( dipole term ) of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : mpicart ] ) . we can satisfy this condition by placing a single pseudoparticle with mass @xmath18 at the center of mass of physical particles , @xmath20 ( see figure [ fig : p012]b ) , as is done with the original barnes - hut treecode .    for @xmath21 , \n the minimum number of pseudoparticles necessary is @xmath22 . in the following \n , we ll see whether we can actually construct the distribution of three pseudoparticles which reproduces the multipole expansion up to quadrupole .    in order to reproduce the first and the second terms , the total mass of the pseudoparticles should be @xmath18 , and their center of mass \n should be located at @xmath20 . \n this is achieved by making their total mass @xmath18 and center of mass to be the same as that of physical particles . in the following , \n we use a coordinate system shifted so that @xmath23 . \n pseudoparticles should have the same quadrupole tensor @xmath24 - { \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{${r}$}}}}_i^2}\\ ] ] as physical particles to reproduce the third term in equation ( [ eq : mpicart ] ) .    by definition , @xmath25 is symmetric and traceless \n . therefore we can choose the coordinate axe so that @xmath25 is diagonalized . \n in this coordinate system , @xmath25 is expressed as : @xmath26.\\ ] ] we can choose @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that the relation @xmath29 is satisfied . \n obviously , all three pseudoparticles should be on the x - y plane . \n now our problem is reduced to determining the masses and positions of three particles on the x - y plane so that they give the quadrupole moment tensor of the form ( [ eq : qmat ] ) . \n there are a variety of ways to satisfy this requirement . here \n we give just one example . \n we still have three extra degrees of freedom , since we can change masses and positions of two particles on the x - y plane freely , and we have only three constraint . in our procedure \n , we set the masses as @xmath30 these masses reproduce the first term of the equation ( [ eq : mpicart ] ) . \n now we have only one extra degree of freedom left . \n we use it by setting @xmath12 component of @xmath31 to 0 . \n now we can determine the position vectors as follows : @xmath32 , { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{${r_2}$ } } } } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\alpha \\\\ -\\beta \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] , { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{${r_3}$ } } } } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } -\\alpha \\\\ -\\beta \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined as @xmath35 note that both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are guaranteed to be real numbers . as we have already mentioned , this solution is not unique . \n for example , if we set @xmath36 , instead of @xmath12 , component of @xmath31 to 0 , we obtain another solution that attains the same order of accuracy . \n here we describe the generalization of p@xmath0m@xmath0  for multipole expansion of higher order . using the procedure we described in the previous section \n , we can express multipole expansion up to quadrupole , with the minimum number of pseudoparticles theoretically required . \n however , the described procedure depends closely on the nature of quadrupole - moment tensor , and it is difficult to extend this procedure to higher orders . \n @xcite proposed a different approach based on the orthogonality of spherical harmonics . \n his approach gives a systematic procedure to obtain the distribution for an arbitrary order . \n since his procedure needs rather large number of pseudoparticles , it is not efficient when the required accuracy is modest . \n but it may be useful for calculations that require very high accuracy . in the following , \n we briefly describe his procedure . here \n we use spherical coordinates for mathematical convenience . \n the multipole expansion of the potential @xmath37 is expressed as @xmath38 in spherical coordinates @xmath39 . here \n @xmath40 is the spherical harmonics and @xmath41 are the expansion coefficients . in order to approximate the potential field due to the distribution of @xmath1 particles \n , the coefficients should satisfy @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the masses and positions of the particles , and @xmath45 denotes the complex conjugate . in order to express the expansion @xmath37 up to the @xmath8-th order \n , @xmath46 pseudoparticles must give the same coefficients @xmath41 for all @xmath9 combinations of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the range of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . \n thus , their masses @xmath5 and the positions @xmath51 should satisfy @xmath52 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the mass @xmath5 and the position @xmath6 are obtained as the solution of this equation .    as we have seen in the previous section , \n it is possible to directly solve this equation for relatively small @xmath8 , say , @xmath53 . for large @xmath8 \n , it is difficult because the equation is nonlinear . in addition \n , it is not clear whether or not an acceptable solution exists for arbitrary distribution of physical particles . \n the key idea of makino s approach is to fix the positions of pseudoparticles . \n equation ( [ eq : coeffij ] ) is nonlinear for the positions @xmath6 , but is linear for the masses @xmath5 . \n thus , if we fix the positions , the equation becomes linear . on the other hand , \n the necessary number of pseudoparticles increases , since we can adjust only the masses of pseudoparticles , and the degree of freedom assigned to each particle is reduced from four to one . \n we restrict the distribution of pseudoparticles to the surface of a sphere centered at the origin , so that the the mathematics are further simplified . with this restriction , \n the coefficients of multipole expansion are expressed as the spherical harmonic expansion of the masses of pseudoparticles . if we choose the positions of pseudoparticles so that the numerical integration over their positions retains the orthogonality of spherical harmonics up to the @xmath8-th order , the mass of pseudoparticles are obtained as the inverse transform of the expansion through numerical integration .    in makino s procedure , \n the spherical @xmath54-design @xcite is used as the distribution of pseudoparticles . \n the spherical @xmath54-design is defined as a set of points on a unit sphere with the following characteristics . \n the summation of an arbitrary polynomial of a degree at most @xmath54 over the points exactly match the integration over the sphere ( except for a constant coefficient ) . using spherical @xmath54-design \n , we can achieve expansion order @xmath55 . here \n @xmath56 denotes the maximum integer not larger than @xmath12 . \n for example , multipole expansion of order @xmath57 and @xmath58 are expressed with number of points @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . \n see @xcite for the number of points for higher @xmath8 , and the position coordinates of the points . \n using p@xmath0m@xmath0 , we implemented an arbitrary - order treecode ( hereafter p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode ) on grape-4 @xcite and a unix workstation . \n the source code for these implementations are available upon request . in the following \n we show the results of numerical tests for the accuracy and the performance . for the measurement \n , we used one grape-4 processor board ( 47 processors , 15 gflops ) . \n the host computer for grape-4 is a compaq alphastation xp1000 with alpha 21264 processor , running at 500 mhz . \n we uniformly distributed 262144 equal - mass particles within a unit sphere . \n then we calculated the force on each particle with p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode , and measured relative error @xmath61 and calculation time @xmath62 for various values of the opening angle @xmath63 . \n the error @xmath61 is defined as r.m.s . \n relative difference from the exact force . \n as the exact force , we used the force calculated with direct summation algorithm on the host computer using ieee-754 standard 64-bit arithmetic . \n figures [ fig : err ] and [ fig : time ] show the results . in figure \n [ fig : err ] , the errors for p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode  of orders @xmath19 through 4 are plotted as functions of @xmath63 . \n we can see that the error roughly scales as @xmath64 . \n this behavior agrees well with the theoretical estimate given by @xcite . \n the saturation of the accuracy at @xmath65 is due to the hardware limitation of grape-4 . \n plotted against the opening angle @xmath63 . \n solid curve with filled squares shows the result of p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode  of order @xmath21 . \n four long - dashed curves with open triangle , square , pentagon , and hexagon are for generalized p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode  of @xmath66 , and @xmath58 , respectively . \n solid curve with filled triangles is for treecode of order @xmath19 . \n [ fig : err],width=302 ]        in figure [ fig : time ] , the force error @xmath61 is plotted as functions of the calculation time @xmath62 . \n we can see that p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode  of order @xmath21 is the fastest for a wide range of accuracy ( @xmath67 ) . for low accuracy ( @xmath68 ) , the treecode of order @xmath19 is the fastest . for extremely high accuracy ( @xmath69 ) , \n p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode  of order @xmath70 is likely to be the fastest , if the accuracy is not limited by the hardware . \n we performed the same test without grape-4 , and found that grape-4 accelerates the calculation by a factor of 10 ( for @xmath71 ) to 150 ( for @xmath72 ) . \n here we discuss the overall accuracy of the simulation with p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode  on grape-4 . \n we have already seen our code attain high accuracy in calculation of instantaneous force , but this high accuracy does not necessarily guarantee the accuracy of the total simulation . \n for example , if the force errors in consecutive timesteps are strongly correlated , they accumulate . as a result , overall accuracy of the orbits of stars \n might be worse , compared to the case with weaker correlation . \n we performed a simulation of the collision of two identical galaxies . \n we chose the system of units so that the total mass of each galaxy and the gravitational constant are both unity and the total energy of each galaxy is @xmath73 . \n galaxy model we used is the hernquist model @xcite with 65536 equal - mass particles . \n we cut off the distribution at radius 20 . \n we place the galaxies at initial separation 3.0 , and gave initial velocities so that they would follow a parabolic head on collision . \n we integrated this system up to @xmath74 with time step @xmath75 and softening parameter @xmath76 . \n we performed the same simulation using three different codes , namely , p@xmath0m@xmath0  treecode of order @xmath21 , the treecode of order @xmath19 , and the direct summation algorithm . \n for treecode simulations , the opening angle @xmath63 is @xmath77 . \n figure [ fig : dyn ] shows the results . \n the relative error of the total energy , @xmath78 , is plotted as a function of time @xmath54 . \n for all runs , we can see three bumps around @xmath79 , and 8 , which correspond to close encounters of two galaxies . \n these bumps comes from the time - integration error , since they can be seen in the result of the direct summation algorithm with highly accurate force calculation . \n we can regard the deviation from the result of the direct summation as being caused by the error of the force calculated with the treecodes . \n for the treecode with @xmath21 , the maximum deviation from the direct summation is @xmath80 , while for @xmath19 it is @xmath81 . \n this a factor of 10 difference is consistent with the difference of the accuracy of the instantaneous force shown in figure [ fig : err ] . \n thus , we can conclude that the high accuracy in the instantaneous force offered by our new p@xmath0m@xmath0  does improve the overall accuracy of the time integration . \n we thank piet hut , yoko funato , toshiyuki fukushige and toshikazu ebisuzaki for invaluable discussions concerning the subject of this paper . \n this work is supported by the research for the future program of japan society for the promotion of science , jsps -

{"ContextTokens": 3420, "GeneratedTokens": 245, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of the dynamic behavior of elastic media in the presence of different static potentials has been center of attention in the recent years . \n superconducting vortices are almost ideal systems for the study of the phenomenology of these systems because relevant properties such as density , interactions and external force can be easily controlled . \n much work has been done on the problem of moving vortex systems . \n depending on the velocity and type of static potential it is expected to arise different dynamical phases . in the elastic regime , \n giarmarchi and le doussal@xcite have predicted the existence of a moving - bragg - glass phase for high driving currents and a weak disordered static potential . this is a phase free of dislocations , with a power law decay of the positional correlations which are anisotropic with respect to flow direction . on another hand , balents , marchetti and radzihovsky@xcite \n have argued for the existence of a smectic phase . in this phase , vortices move along well defined static channels , holding correlation perpendicular to the channels , but uncorrelated along them . on increasing disorder plastic motion \n is expected close to the depinning force showing a mixture of moving and fixed vortices@xcite . in the later case \n the vortex motion is also through meandered static flow patterns . \n a common expected feature of all these dynamical states is the anisotropic response of the moving structure to perturbations parallel or perpendicular to the vortex motion . \n a number of experimental works have been done investigating these phenomena . \n transport measurements report changes in the dynamical properties of the vortex matter close to the peak effect @xcite that were attributed to a crossover from plastic to ordered motion . \n more recently kokubo and coworkers@xcite have proven this dynamical ordering from mode locking experiments . \n snapshots of moving vortex structures have been obtained in decoration experiments@xcite that have shown evidence for these smectic and moving glass phases of vortices . \n however one of the most striking properties of these quasi - ordered driven phases is the existence of barriers to a small force transverse to the direction of motion . \n these barriers would originate an effective transverse critical current@xcite or a change in the hall noise spectrum@xcite . \n although the numerical results present a clear evidence of these effects the experimental confirmation is evasive . \n recently lefebvre , hilke and altounian@xcite have shown transport measurements in superconducting metallic amorphous tapes that reveal the existence of a transverse critical current although these results show big quantitative discrepancies with numerical simulations . \n mutual inductance techniques have proven to be a valuable tool for measuring superconducting characteristics of two dimensional systems@xcite . in previous works \n it was shown that a variation of this technique based in special shaped coils is capable of detecting the anisotropic character of dynamical phases@xcite . in this work \n we extend these susceptibility measurements to mo@xmath2ge@xmath1 amorphous films that reveal the anisotropic characteristic of dynamical vortex phases . \n this technique allows the measurement of susceptibility and transport at the same time obtaining susceptibility information with applied current to the sample . \n mutual inductance measurements were performed using planar serpentine coils of geometry similar to those described in a previous paper@xcite . \n it was showed that the implementation of rectangular coils with high aspect ratio allow the direct measurement of the anisotropy . \n shielding currents are induced in the sample by the primary coils and therefore they are predominantly parallel to the long side of the coil , as it is shown in figure  1d . as a consequence \n the voltage generated in the reception coil is originated by the sample currents flowing in that direction . \n for the experiments reported in this work the coils were batch fabricated on silicon substrates and later the superconducting film was deposited on top of them . \n coils with different geometries have been build using 0.5 micron thick aluminum as conducting material and sio@xmath3 as insulator . \n the fabrication process started from a 8 \" silicon wafer covered with 650 nm of low stress silicon nitrate . \n aluminum wiring of the primary coil was defined by optical lithography and lift - off . \n deposition of sio@xmath3 by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) with a nominal thickness of @xmath4 m was used as a first isolation layer . a second lithography step , with the same mask used previously but rotated 180 degrees defined the secondary coil . \n a final sio@xmath3 @xmath4 m layer was deposited to provide a second isolation layer between the coils and the superconducting film . \n a planarization with a chemical mechanical polishing ( cpm ) was performed afterward . \n finally vias in the sio@xmath3 were defined by lithography and hf etching to allow direct bonding of au wires to each coil . in figure  1a \n we show a photograph of one of the microfabricated coils . \n all the results presented in this work correspond to coils with al wires of @xmath5 m in width separated by @xmath6 m and with 30 turns .    on top of the coils the superconducting mo@xmath2ge@xmath1 500 \n nm amorphous films were deposited by rf \n sputtering at room temperature by water cooling of the sample holder . \n a cross shaped geometry was defined in the superconducting film by lithography and lift - off which allow the dc current injection in the film parallel and perpendicular to the coil direction . in figure  1b we show photograph of the sample and a scheme of the electrical contacts . \n figure  1c presents a sketch of the experimental configuration . \n the critical temperature of the films determined as the onset of resistance at zero magnetic field was @xmath7 . \n the field and temperature dependence of the susceptibility were acquired for different applied currents to the sample for both directions : current parallel ( @xmath8 direction ) and perpendicular ( @xmath9 direction ) to the long strips of the coils . the voltage drop in the film \n was simultaneously measured using a nanovoltmeter that allows the detection of the vortex motion induced by the external current . \n the protocol utilized was the following : for a fixed external applied field the temperature of the sample was varied and regulated at fixed setpoints . \n for each of these temperature steps the current in the sample was swept in magnitude and orientation while the susceptibility and voltage drop in the sample were acquired . \n all measurements presented here were performed in the linear regime of the susceptibility and for a driving frequency and amplitude of @xmath10 khz and @xmath11 ma , respectively . \n the principal result of this paper is represented in figure  2 where the susceptibility of the sample is plotted as a function of temperature , on measuring it with an electrical current through the sample for the two current orientations and an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the film . in the following \n we define @xmath12 as the susceptibility data taken where the bias current is parallel to the long side of the coils ( * @xmath13 * , @xmath8 direction ) , and @xmath14 where the bias current on the sample is perpendicular to them ( * @xmath15 * , @xmath9 direction).the data indicate that once the vortex motion is induced by the external current the response obtained for currents parallel and perpendicular to the coils are notably different . at currents lower than \n 0.1 ma the magnetic response is the same to both currents orientation . \n thus , this magnetic response can be taken as the reference response , @xmath16 . at currents greater than 0.1 ma \n the shielding capability , @xmath17 , is lower in the case where the external current is parallel to the long side of the coils respect to the perpendicular configuration . a lower value of the @xmath17 data is an indication of an increase in the vortex mobility . \n taking into account that the shielding currents induced in the sample basically mimic the geometry of the primary coil @xcite , the parallel configuration corresponds to the case that these shielding and external currents are collinear . \n this means that when the bias current is parallel to the long side of the coils the _ dc _ force and the alternate testing force generated by the currents induced in the sample by the primary coil are almost collinear . as a consequence \n , the results of these experiments are evidencing that the vortex mobility is greater along the vortex motion direction than perpendicular to it . \n an isotropic response is recovered at high temperatures where the data for both current orientations merge together and with that taken at zero current on the sample . \n the observed anisotropy occurs in a region where the susceptibility of reference @xmath16 indicates an increase in the shielding capability . in figure 2 \n we can see this increment from t@xmath187.73k , which is an evidence of the peak effect@xcite where the vortex ensemble softens to accommodate to the weak pinning potential increasing the critical current . \n and @xmath14 fits to the reference @xmath19 fit ( green and purple line respectively ) showing the first three phases found . ]    in figure 3 we plot the susceptibility data for fixed temperature and magnetic field as a function of applied external current in the sample for both current orientations . \n the temperature , @xmath20 was chosen as that where the susceptibility of reference ( @xmath21 ) is minimum ( peak of the peak effect ) , see figure 2 . \n it is clear that the anisotropic response persists in the whole range of currents investigated . at this temperature and field the longitudinal response ( or parallel configuration ) reaches a steady state for current values around 3.5 ma . \n we were nt able to detect this saturation in the perpendicular configuration up to 5 ma , the maximum current up to which we were able to measure without overheating the sample . \n this effect ( difference between parallel and perpendicular directions ) could be in principle explained by an intrinsic anisotropy of the sample . \n however this can be discarded after observing that i \n v characteristics coincide for both current directions .    , indicated with an arrow in figure  2 . ] \n more insight of the anisotropic behavior can be extracted from the analysis of the data through a subtraction of the susceptibility at a given current to a reference measurement at zero current for both current orientations , see top panel of figure  2 . based on this figure ( and equivalent for other biasing currents ) \n , we were able to construct the i \n t phase diagram shown in figure  4 . at low temperatures the susceptibility for both current directions coincides with the measurement at zero applied current . \n this region i corresponds to the response of a fully pinned vortex lattice . at certain value of the external current we observe that the susceptibility measured when the current direction is along the coils long direction starts to deviate from the zero current behavior but not for the measurement in the perpendicular configuration . \n this result indicates that the sample is in a regime ( region ii ) that the vortex ensemble started to move and is locked to move in the perpendicular direction proving the existence of a finite transverse critical current . \n rising temperature the perpendicular susceptibility becomes different from the zero current measurement but with greater shielding capability than in the parallel measurement ( region iii ) . \n these results imply that this is a region of the phase diagram where the dynamical vortex structure has an anisotropic mobility . at even higher temperatures and currents an isotropic response \n is recovered where all susceptibilities coincide ( region iv ) before reaching the normal state region ( v ) . \n region iv could be assigned as a moving vortex liquid phase where pinning becomes negligible on the vortex dynamics .    , @xmath22 . \n region ii : transversally pinned state , @xmath23 . \n region iii : anisotropic dynamical state , @xmath24 . \n region iv : isotropic moving phase : @xmath25 , @xmath26 . \n region v : normal state . \n the phase diagram is relevant only for currents above @xmath27 ma , the minimum applied current for which anisotropy is detected . ] \n our results clearly indicate that the response of the moving vortex lattice in @xmath28-moge have an anisotropic characteristic in the region close to the depinning transition . \n our results show the existence of two different regimes of anisotropic behavior . at lower temperatures \n there is a finite response in the @xmath8 direction and the response in the perpendicular direction is current independent . \n this is a region where there is a transverse critical current . \n rising temperature and/or the magnitude of the current , the perpendicular component _ becomes depinned _ but the response is still anisotropic . \n this anisotropic behavior coincides in the phase diagram where the peak effect in the critical current is observed . \n we are very grateful to m. hesselberth and p. h. kes for helping us with the deposition of the moge films on the planar coils . \n this project was

{"ContextTokens": 3843, "GeneratedTokens": 187, "SynthesizedBody": "static and dynamic aspects of wetting and spreading are well studied classical text book problems . however , forced spreading of a fluid under an impressed load is not widely discussed , though the physics involved is challenging and the problem has important applications in technology as well . in real life many fluids are non - newtonian , adding further complexity to the problem . \n general reviews concerning related problems are available @xcite , but there is scope for more experimental and analytical studies .    in the present work we report studies on spreading of non - newtonian fluids between two glass plates , when the upper plate is loaded by a weight . \n we vary the weights , the fluids and the manner of loading . \n we observe an interesting oscillation in the area of contact between the fluid and glass plate as a function of time . \n earlier study of newtonian fluids @xcite did not show such behavior . \n based on the experimental results we try to explain this phenomenon using fractional calculus , which is known to be an appropriate technique to study non - newtonian , visco - elastic materials @xcite . \n another remarkable observation is the appearance of a surface instability similar to viscous fingering . \n viscous fingering under the condition of lifting , i.e. separating the plates is a well studied phenomenon @xcite . in this case \n the pressure is lower within the fluid , compared to the air pressure outside , satisfying the saffman - taylor condition for instability @xcite . \n however , in the present case the fingering develops during _ \n the fluids under study are two non - newtonian fluids - arrowroot and potato starch gel and a newtonian fluid ethylene glycol ( gr ) is also studied for comparison .    in order to get a homogenous gel of the starch in water the suspension has to be heated to temperature @xmath0 . \n a preliminary set of experiments was done with arrowroot starch ( indo moulders , india ) available commercially for stiffening fabrics . \n 2.5gm of the starch is dissolved in 100ml of distilled water and it is heated up for 20 minutes and boiled for 2 minutes to get a clear gel . \n a pinch of dye is added to enhance the contrast and the solution is allowed to cool . \n continuous stirring is necessary so that lumps are not formed and a smooth homogenous fluid is obtained . \n the second set of experiments was done on a well characterized sample of potato starch ( @xmath1 ) manufactured by lobachemie pvt . ltd . \n ( mumbai ) , the procedure for preparing the gel is the same above but it has to be heated for 10 minutes . \n the newtonian fluid that we use is ethylene glycol gr,(e.merck , india ) . here \n also a little food colouring is added for enhancing contrast . \n a droplet of the non - newtonian fluid is placed on a smooth glass plate using a micro - pipette . \n the mass of the droplet varies from 0.04 gm to 0.06 gm .    the fluid drop is compressed by two different loading processes .    1 .   a load of w kg . \n is placed on another glass plate ( identical to the bottom plate and weighing 570 gm).then the plate and load are placed together on the drop . \n the upper glass plate is first placed on the droplet . then the weight w is placed on top of the upper plate after an interval of 2 seconds . \n each of the non - newtonian fluids is subjected to the two loading processes described above . \n ethylene glycol is compressed by the second process . the change in area of contact between the fluid and plate is video recorded from below . \n the area is measured using image pro plus software and plotted as a function of time . \n the strain is defined as the fractional change in area per unit area at @xmath2 . \n @xmath3    @xmath4 and @xmath5 being respectively the area at time @xmath6 and at the initial time @xmath7 . \n time @xmath7 is taken differently for the different loading processes . \n the results for the different sets of experiments are described below . \n 1 tp 5 kg by process ( i ) ( black right triangle - 1 kg , red cross - 2 kg , green up triangle - 3 kg , blue square - 4 kg , magenta square - 5 kg ) . \n the inset shows the erratic variations magnified for 4 and 5 kg respectively . \n , width=298 ]    * loading process ( i ) here the initial time is the instant when the total load - ( plate + w ) is placed in position . the variation in strain for the arrowroot gel \n is shown in figure([arr_tog ] ) for different weights @xmath8 . \n the area shows erratic noisy oscillations , more prominently displayed in the magnified inset . * \n loading process ( ii ) here the initial time @xmath7 refers to the instant when the weight @xmath8 is placed , the upper plate already being in position . \n figure([arr_sep ] ) shows the variation in strain . here \n the variation is less erratic , but all sets show that the area initially overshoots the final equilibrium value @xmath9 , then approaches @xmath9 after one or two cycles of oscillation . \n this video is taken at 4 frames / sec . \n though the oscillations are apparent , clearly , recording at higher speed is required . instead of proceeding with the commercial arrowroot sample , \n which is not well characterized , we continued the experiments with potato starch . \n all the subsequent results show videos taken at 10 frames / sec . \n * loading process ( i ) here again noisy variations , which may be superposed on oscillations are seen in the results ( figure([pot_tog ] ) ) . * \n loading process ( ii ) in this case , the erratic noise is much reduced and clear oscillations are observed in figure([all_in_one ] ) . \n the oscillations die down after a few cycles to the equilibrium value @xmath9 . \n the amplitude of the oscillations increases with load @xmath8 . \n the experiments are repeated for reproducibility and four such data sets for @xmath10 kg are shown in figure([all_5 kg ] ) . \n ethylene glycol has been studied earlier , together with other newtonian fluids @xcite . \n we have repeated the experiments , recording the video at 10 frames / sec and show the results here(figure([newtonian ] ) ) for comparison with the gels . \n loading process ( ii ) is employed here . \n the results are very clearly different from the previous sets for the non - newtonian fluids . here \n , the area increases smoothly and saturates to the equilibrium value for all loads @xmath8 \n .     1 tp 5 kg by process ( ii ) . \n clear oscillations are seen , though not very sharp . \n , width=298 ]    the results show convincingly that these non - newtonian fluids show an oscillatory spreading , when compressed in a hele - shaw cell , unlike newtonian fluids . \n it is to be noted that this is not a simple stick slip behavior , where the strain ( here this is equivalent to area ) would always increase , but in jumps . here for the gels , the strain , i.e the area , actually decreases after a short time interval during loading and again increases . to establish \n that the film _ does _ shrink and expand in an oscillatory manner , we superpose two snapshots taken at an interval of 2 seconds , and show their difference in figure([merged ] ) . the weight on the upper plate is 5 kg . here the outer boundary corresponds to an instant of time _ earlier _ than the inner . \n so the oscillations in strain are genuine and not due to measuremental error . \n further , the corrugated appearance of the boundary , demonstrates the saffman - taylor like instability developed .    in the subsequent sections we suggest a visco - elastic model to explain our experiments . \n at present , we focus on the less noisy data for loading process ( ii ) . presumably , loading process ( i ) needs a more complicated theory , because the weights are placed on the hemispherical drop directly . \n so change in shape i.e. flattening of the drop as well as change in area are to be considered in this case . \n it is well known that starch solutions are non - newtonian @xcite . \n it is interesting that the suspension in water made without heating is shear thickening @xcite , whereas the gel made by boiling the solution is shear thinning . \n rheological studies of the arrowroot gel and potato starch gel , were done at central glass and ceramic research institute(cgcri , csir ) by a bohlin rotational rheometer at @xmath11 temperature . \n both show strongly shear thinning nature of the fluids with a yield stress . \n the apparent viscosity of potato starch gel is somewhat smaller than arrowroot for all strain rates . \n a log - log plot of strain against shear rate shows a power law relation for both fluids over a wide range ( figure([log - log ] ) ) . \n an exponent 1.7 is obtained for arrowroot , while 1.5 is obtained for potato starch , as shown in the best fit power - law straight lines shown in figure([log - log ] ) \n .     1 tp 5 kg by process ( i ) . \n the insets on the right and left show the erratic variations magnified for 4 and 5 kg respectively . \n , width=298 ] \n to analyze the stress - strain behavior we use a basic kelvin - voigt model @xcite of a spring and dash pot in parallel as a basic unit . \n the viscous behavior is represented by the dash pot and the elastic nature by the spring . \n the model is further generalized by taking the @xmath12th derivative of the strain , thus introducing non - newtonian rheology through fractional calculus@xcite . here \n @xmath12 may be a fraction , for case @xmath12 = 1 we have a newtonian viscosity . \n the elastic term is assumed to be hookean at present . \n the stress is then given by    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the strain , @xmath15 the elastic modulus and @xmath16 a parameter characterizing the effective viscosity of the non - newtonian fluid and @xmath17 a characteristic time of the system . \n we assume a step function to represent the loading @xmath18 . \n the initial condition for strain is @xmath19 for @xmath20 . \n the laplace transform of equation([basic ] ) gives    @xmath21   \\label{lap}\\ ] ]    the inverse laplace transform of equation([lap ] ) gives @xmath22 \\label{strain}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath23 is the one parameter mittag - leffler function defined by @xmath24 @xmath25    visco - elastic systems typically have a ` memory ' , the strain at time @xmath6 is determined by its previous loading history starting from @xmath26 . \n the markovian system withour memory is a special case of general non - markovian systems exhibiting correlation or anti - correlation . the general case can be treated naturally using generalized calculus methods , as follows . \n one has to consider the green s function for a general relaxation in equation([basic ] ) , so we write the homogeneous equation with rhs equal to zero . \n the strain built up for any relaxation , as a function of a scaled dimensionless time @xmath27 . \n may be treated as convolution integral of a strain variable with integral kernel @xmath28 , as @xcite . \n we use henceforth this reduced dimensionless time @xmath27 , which is the time scaled by some characteristic time of the sytem . \n @xmath29    we first consider two special cases , with no memory and infinite memory . \n are shown for clarity . \n amplitude of the oscillations increases with load . \n , width=298 ]      if the memory kernel is @xmath30 , we have the above system [ basic ] without memory @xcite and the green s function will be    @xmath31 that is the impulse response quickly decays to zero . here \n @xmath32 is initial strain of the system at @xmath33 . \n this can be derived as follows :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath31    the homogeneous strain relaxation equation for no - memory case is a first order ordinary differential equation i.e.    @xmath36      if the memory kernel is a constant say @xmath37 , then we will have oscillatory green s function , which never decays to zero . \n @xmath38    @xmath39      if a generalized memory integral of the following form is taken    @xmath40    one has @xmath41 \\label{gen}\\ ] ] where , @xmath42^{-1}\\ ] ]    integrating the equation([gen ] ) , we have    @xmath43\\ ] ]    differentiating this to order q , we get the corresponding generalized differential equation . \n @xmath44    using the fact that the differentigral of order @xmath12 of the constant @xmath32 gives @xmath45 . \n this is the equation for the system with the memory index entering as fractional order @xmath12 of the fractional differential equation with , @xmath46 . \n @xmath47 corresponds to no memory and @xmath48 corresponds to infinite memory with anti - correlation , or anti - persistence .    in equation([fr ] ) above , if the initial stress be @xmath32 , assuming heaviside s step function as the stress input , it modifies to equation([basic ] ) , for @xmath49 . \n the non - newtonian fluids without oscillatory behavior will have @xmath50 , which leads to an equation also of fractional order , and the step - response will have monotonically increasing strain response , given by one argument mittag - leffler function . \n its impulse response will be a function having a long tailed decay . \n in other words , the response will have long - range temporal correlation i.e. persistence . in equation([gen ] ) @xmath12 = 0 , 1 and 2 represent cases with respectively memory with complete correlation , no memory and memory with complete anti - correlation . \n these situations are analogous to a random walk with persistent memory , no memory and anti - persistent memory repectively .     by process ( ii ) . \n the inset shows that the increase is monotonic even on magnification . \n , width=298 ]    the visco - elastic system with newtonian viscous behavior can be modeled with a discrete ideal spring and a ideal dashpot . whereas the more complicated case with non - newtonian viscosity requires a different representation like a fractal chain of the ideal spring and ideal dashpot combination , or equivalently , a description using generalized calculus @xcite . \n our experiment clearly shows oscillatory strain and thus we infer the fractional order @xmath12 of our system to lie between 1 and 2 . \n neccessity for the use of a non - trivial memory kernel clearly demonstrates that results for strain at @xmath6 should depend on earlier loading history , rather than the instantaneous load at @xmath6 . \n we now plot the strain as a function of time using equation([strain ] ) . for @xmath12 \n = 1 , the strain increases smoothly and saturates to the value @xmath51 , @xmath52 represents the load @xmath8 in our experiment . for @xmath53 , a similar behavior \n is observed , with a slower variation in strain . for @xmath54 \n however , we see an initial increase in strain overshooting @xmath9 followed by oscillations before saturating to @xmath9 . the oscillations are more pronounced as @xmath12 increases . these results are shown in figure([qvar ] ) . \n the amplitude depends on @xmath12 and of course the magnitude of the strain changes proportionately to the load @xmath52 , also affecting the amplitude of oscillation . \n considering the parameter @xmath55 to represent the relative strengths of the elastic and viscous terms in equation([basic ] ) , we may see how the system responds to changes in @xmath56 . \n we find that variation of @xmath56 changes the time period of the oscillations in strain , without affecting the amplitude . \n variation of strain with @xmath8 and @xmath56 are shown in figure([load_b_var ] ) . \n the time period is smaller when elasticity dominates .    if we assume that the fractional change in area is equivalent to the strain in the system , the results for the starch solutions are reproduced qualitatively by the visco - elastic model with non - newtonian rheology . here the qth order derivative takes care of the non - linearity in the complex fluid . in the earlier paper @xcite \n the newtonian fluids were assumed incompressible and the change in film thickness was calculated from the constant volume of the fluid . here \n the fluid may have a finite compressibility , so we refer only to the area which is measured directly . \n determination of the exact value of @xmath12 for our systems requires a more detailed analysis , with more information on the rheological properties . from the present study \n we may say @xmath12 lies between approximately 1.5 and 1.8 . \n to conclude , this work demonstrates the interesting phenomenon of oscillatory spreading of starch solutions on glass and illustrates how the approach of generalized calculus may be used to analyze it . \n we plan to carry out a quantitative comparison of the theory and experiments involving the detailed rheological properties of the fluids .     from equation([strain ] ) . \n an oscillatory behavior is seen , which dies down to the equilibrium value.,width=298 ]    tapati dutta and prof . \n moulik are gratefully acknowledged for helpful discussion . \n the authors thank ugc , govt . \n of india for supporting this work and for providing a research grant to mdc .     and different values of b from equation([strain ] ) . \n @xmath12 = 1.7 in all cases . \n , width=298 ]", "StartTimeOffset": 260334739188, "RequestID": "136ea44e054c47ccdccf127e9fa0013cda422f8e", "TotalTokens": 4030}
{"ContextTokens": 2080, "GeneratedTokens": 205, "SynthesizedBody": "it is now relatively well - established that @xmath650% of the present - day stellar mass has been formed since z=1 . \n most of this stellar mass has been formed in intermediate - mass galaxies ( 3@xmath7 to 3@xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath6l@xmath9 galaxies ) , as a result of strong star formation episodes during which galaxies take the appearance of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , see @xcite ) . \n however , it is still unclear what physical processes have driven this evolution . to this respect , \n internal kinematics of distant galaxies is a powerful tracer of the major processes governing star - formation and galaxy evolution in the early universe such as merging , accretion , and feedback related to star - formation and agn . robustly measuring the internal kinematics of distant galaxies \n is thus crucial for understanding how galaxies formed and evolved . \n a large program at vlt entitled images ( intermediate mass galaxy evolution sequence ) is aiming to derive both resolved kinematics and integrated properties from vlt / giraffe and fors2 for galaxies selected in the chandra deep field ( cdfs ) , and to combine these observations with deep and high quality images from hst / acs as well as with deep mid - ir photometry from spitzer / mips . \n this large program has now reached about 2/3 of its completion , and recently , 39 additional galaxies observed with giraffe have been analyzed @xcite . \n combined with previous observations during the gto @xcite , it leads to a sample of 74 galaxies , which represents so far the largest existing sample of resolved kinematics for distant galaxies . because in images we have deliberately selected @xmath10@xmath11 galaxies ( i.e. , with stellar masses larger than 1.5@xmath210@xmath3m@xmath4 ) , \n we assume a similar limit for the combined sample . it let us with a sample of 63 galaxies which is well representative of the luminosity function at z=0.4 - 0.75 . \n notice that the combined sample includes galaxies from 4 independent fields of view @xcite and is then unaffected by field - to - field variations within poisson statistics . within this redshift range , \n giraffe is able to recover the kinematics of almost all galaxies with @xmath12}})\\ge15$] . \n at large distances the spatial resolution is not sufficient to resolve the central regions of the galaxies . \n it implies that the observed velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 ) of a rotational body is the convolution of the actual random motions with the rotation . for a rotationally supported galaxy \n , it unavoidably leads to a well defined peak in the centre ( see fig . \n 1 ) . we have developed a classification scheme which allows us to compare any dispersion map to what it could be if it was a rotational disk @xcite . \n discrepancy from a rotational body can be measured from differences in amplitude and in position of the @xmath13 peak between the pseudo rotational @xmath13 map and the observed one , which leads to a very robust diagnostic diagram for the 63 observed galaxies @xcite .    among the 63 galaxies of the representative sample , we find 20 rotating disks ( 32% ) , \n 16 rotating disks with perturbations ( 25% ) and 27 galaxies with complex kinematics ( 43% , see fig . 1 and @xcite ) . \n within this classification , perturbed rotations correspond to a discrepant @xmath13 peak from expectations for a pure rotation . \n the complex kinematics class corresponds to objects for which the large scale motions are not aligned to the optical major axis , and show @xmath13 map very discrepant from expectations for a rotation ( see fig . \n among these 63 galaxies , 52 have multi - band hst / acs imaging . \n neichel et al . \n ( in prep . ) have constructed a new procedure to classify the morphology of distant galaxies . \n this procedure relies on two important ingredients which are the used of color maps ( which helps to overcome limitations due to k - morphological corrections ) and the use of a visual decision tree . \n this last ingredient is particularly important , as they have shown that automatic methods can overestimate the fraction of spirals by a factor of @xmath62 . \n they find a relatively good agreement between the two classifications : most of rotating disks are classified as spirals , while most of galaxies having complex kinematics show a peculiar morphology . \n combining morphology with spacially resolved kinematics allows us to study distant galaxies in very fine details : for the first time , we have recently detected a minor merger with a mass ratio of @xmath61:18 in a z@xmath60.6 galaxy classified as a perturbed rotator @xcite ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] ) . \n such processes , which are predicted to be much more numerous than major mergers by numerical models , could provide us with a very plausible mecanism for explaining the kinematics of perturbed rotators . \n let us now consider a representative sample of intermediate mass galaxies : at z=0.6 , 60% of galaxies have @xmath14)\\ge15$]@xcite . \n let us assume that quiescent ( @xmath14)<15$] ) galaxy are either rotationally or dispersion supported , thus minimising the fraction of galaxies with anomalous kinematics . \n then our results imply that 42@xmath157% of z=0.4 - 0.75 galaxies have anomalous kinematics , including 26@xmath157% possessing complex kinematics . because up to 97% of local intermediate mass galaxies are \n either e , s0 or spirals @xcite , it is likely that the fraction of anomalous kinematics is close to a few percents today . \n this leads to an extremely rapid evolution of kinematical properties of galaxies , with about 10 times more complex kinematics about 6 gyr ago . \n the observed evolution of the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) provides us with a strong and independent confirmation . \n it has been suggested that galaxies with non - relaxed kinematics ( pr and ck ) are responsible for the very large dispersions of the tfr at high redshift @xcite . \n this result is confirmed by puech et al . \n ( in prep ) using the new sample of 63 galaxies : all the dispersion of the distant tfr can be accounted for by galaxies having non - relaxed kinematics . \n so it is beyond doubt that kinematics is among the most rapidly evolving properties of galaxies . \n which physical process could explain such a dramatic evolution ? \n anomalous kinematics are linked with strong variations of the specific angular momentum consistent with a random walk evolution due to merging between galaxies , as predicted by the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation @xcite . indeed , during a merger , and especially a major merger , galaxies pass through various stages during which the disk may be destroyed , generating significant discrepancies to the general behaviour of isolated rotating disks . \n we do find a strong evolution of the galaxy kinematics since z=0.6 , with a significant fraction of galaxies with complex kinematics . \n observations presented here tell us that major mergers could have played an important role in shaping galaxies as we observe them today . \n indeed many estimates of the merger rate found that a typical intermediate mass galaxy should have experienced 0.5 to 0.75 major merger since z= 1 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and most of them since z=2 - 3 . \n a scenario in which merging is the dominant physical process explains many evolutionary features since z=1 , including the number density evolution of lirgs and the emergence of galaxies with complex morphologies and with blue cores at z@xmath16 0.4 @xcite . \n it is moreover particularly in agreement with the fact that the milky way has had an exceptionally quiet merger history @xcite . \n present - day @xmath17 galaxies being mostly spiral galaxies , it is unlikely that they have all escaped a major merging since z=2 - 3 . \n 99 flores , h. , hammer , f. , puech , m. , amram , p. , & balkowski , c.  2006 , a&a , 455 , 107 hammer , f. , et al . \n 1997 , apj , 481 , 49 hammer , f. , flores , h. , elbaz , d. , zheng , x.  z. , liang , y.  c. , & cesarsky , c.  2005 , a&a , 430 , 115 hammer , f. , puech , m. , chemin , l. , flores , h. , & lehnert , m.  2007 , apj , 662 , 322 kartaltepe , j. s. , sanders , d. b. , et al . \n 2007 , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3172, "GeneratedTokens": 313, "SynthesizedBody": "ngc  4833 is a southern globular cluster lying near the galactic plane in the constellation musca . \n its variable stars have not been studied in detail for nearly 35 years since observations by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) . \n the first survey of variable stars in the cluster s vicinity was done by bailey ( 1924 ) who found two variables , both of which are likely not cluster members . later studies revealed a total of 16 variables in the vicinity of the cluster ( wright 1941 ; sawyer - hogg 1973 ) . among these \n were the two variables found by bailey with most of the remaining being cluster variables , known today as rr lyrae variables . \n using photographic plates demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) did b and v photometry of the cluster identifying 24 variables and determined accurate periods for 15 rr lyrae variables . \n they concluded that the cluster was oosterhoff type ii ( oosterhoff 1939 ) . \n the most recent study was melbourne et al . \n they investigated extinction near ngc  4833 and determined the positions of the rr lyrae variables on a color - magnitude diagram but did not do time - series photometry . \n ngc  4833 is 6.6 kpc from the sun , has a core radius of 1.0 , and a half light radius of 2.41 which make it a relatively easy target for searching for and investigating its variable stars ( harris 1996 ) . \n given the lack of recent detailed study of the variables in ngc  4833 we added the cluster to our continuing program to study in detail a number of southern globular star clusters ( conroy et al . \n 2012 , toddy et al . \n 2012 ) . with the combination of ccd images , an observation window spanning more than 4 months , and an image subtraction package developed by alard ( 2000 ) \n , we are able to detect , analyze variable stars , and produce unprecedented high - quality light curves and periods for each variable . in this study \n we present the preliminary results of our observations of ngc  4833 including a color - magnitude diagram , as well as a bailey diagram , complete light curves , and periods for 27 variables , with 10 of them being newly identified . \n images of ngc 4833 were obtained during 14 nights between 30 january and 25 june , 2011 , using the southeastern association for research in astronomy ( sara ) 0.6 meter telescope located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory . in all , nearly 1700 images were obtained in the v - band . also , multicolor sequences were done on 9 march , 1 , 3 , and 6 may , 2011 , as a vri sequence on 9 march , and a bvri sequence on 1 , 3 , and 6 may . \n an apogee alta e6 camera was used for the observations with a 1024@xmath01024 pixel kodak kaf1001e chip , a gain of 1.5 electron per adu count , and an rms noise of 8.9 electrons . \n we used 1@xmath01 binning resulting in an image scale of 0.61/px resulting in a 10@xmath010 arcmin@xmath1 field of view . on all nights of observation \n , 120 second exposures were taken using a bessel v filter . \n the exposure time allowed us to detect dimmer variables but caused many of the brighter stars in the field to be overexposed . \n typical seeing ranged between 1.2 and 1.7 in the v - band . \n all images were debiased , flat - fielded , dark subtracted , and cleaned of hot , cold , and bad pixels . \n images were then analyzed using the isis2.2 package ( alard & lupton 1998 , alard 2000 ) . \n the package works by convolving the reference image shown in figure 1 , composed of a combination of the highest quality images obtained , to the point spread function of each individual image , then subtracting each image from the reference image to determine if any change in intensity has occurred . \n a resulting variable image identifies possible variables and is shown in figure 2 . \n a more detailed discussion of the method and how we used it is given elsewhere in this volume by toddy et al . \n ( 2012 ) .    . \n note that brightest stars in the image are overexposed . ] \n due to the more than 4-month observation span , we were able to determine the periods of most of the variables with periods less than 1 day to an accuracy of @xmath2 days . \n those variables exhibiting the blahko effect were less accurate due to modulation of their light curves ( blahko 1907 , smith 2004 ) . \n demers & wehlau s ( 1977 ) variables were identified visually and astrometrically and then confirmed by comparing their periods with our own . \n several of the variables identified by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) were outside the field of view of our images thus were not be observed . \n these include their variables v1 , v2 , v8 and v10 . \n we were not able to produce time - series photometry of two other variables , v9 and v16 . \n though they were in our field of view they were overexposed giants . \n lrc rrab & 10 & 0.69591 + rrc & 7 & 0.39555 + rre & 2 & 0.30950 + eclipsing & 2 & 0.32431 + sx phe & 6 & 0.05847                table 1 summarizes the results of our study . in total we detected 27 variables with 10 of them being newly identified . of the variables that were in our field of view and listed by demers & welhau ( 1977 ) we were able to identify all but two . \n the two that we did not detect happened to be overexposed . of the total we detected 6 \n were newly discovered sx phoenicis variables , 19 rr lyrae variables , and 2 eclipsing variables . \n table 2 gives the properties of each of the variables . \n the sx phoenicis variables are characterized by short periods and relatively low amplitudes . \n the mean period of the sx phoenicis variables is 0.05847 days , with a minimum of 0.04425 days and a maximum of 0.07191 days along with v amplitudes ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 magnitudes . \n these amplitudes are only estimates given that many of the sx phoenicis variables appear to be modulated and blended with other stars . \n nv5 was detected by isis only on 5 april . \n the others were detected on all of the nights . \n all of the sx phoenicis stars were within the half - mass radius ( 2.4 ) of the cluster as listed by harris ( 1996 ) . \n the phased light curves for the sx phoenicis stars are shown in figure 3 .        of the rr lyrae variables identified in the cluster 10 were rrab variables , with a mean period of 0.69591 days , 7 were rrc variables , with a mean period of 0.39555 days , and variable v20 which may be a second overtone ( rre ) variable previously noted by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) . but given v20 s modulated light curve it may be a type rrd double - mode variable ( alcock et al . \n 1996 , bono et al . \n our newly discovered variable stars include a w ursae majoris star ( period of 0.3629 days ) , an rrab star ( period of 0.8740 days ) , another second overtone ( rre ) variable ( period of 0.3179 days ) , and an algol type binary star ( period of 0.7231 days ) . \n in total we identified 10 new variables in the cluster . \n the phased light curves for these variables are shown in figure 4 . \n in addition to the ratio of rrab to rrc lyrae variables the bailey diagram presented in figure 5 shows the cluster is of the oosterhoff type ii cluster . in this diagram \n the fitting formulae are from zorotovic et al . \n figure 5 also shows the two outlying rre variables , indicated by the open triangles . \n color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) are useful in determining cluster membership . to verify cluster membership we produced a color - magnitude diagram for ngc 4833 shown in figure 6 with the various types of variable stars indicated . to construct this diagram we combined 165 v band images , with an exposure of 120 seconds , and 175 r band images , with an exposure of 45 seconds . \n the images were obtained as part of a bvri color sequence on 9 march , 1 , 3 , and 6 may , 2011 . \n daophot was used to determine v and r magnitudes of the stars ( stetson 1987 ) . in the cmd shown in figure \n 6 rrab and rrc variables are indicated by the red and blue colored points , respectively . \n rrc variables tend to lie on the warmer ( left ) side of the instability strip whereas rrab variables are to the cooler ( right ) of the instability strip . \n scatter in the variables is partly due to blending of the variables with other stars , our averaging of several hundred images before using daophot , and possible variable reddening in the direction of the cluster . \n we assumed fixed atmospheric extinction coefficients for each color and for all nights . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of the rr lyrae variables only one , v15 , appears to be a blend . \n v15 is shown in figure 6 as the hollow red square to the right of the instability strip . \n other than this errant variable the remainder appear near the instability strip . \n in addition to blending there is significant extinction across the cluster . \n the e(b - v ) is listed as 0.32 and melbourne et al . \n ( 2000 ) found that this varies depending on location . \n because of this variable interstellar extinction some scatter is introduced into our mean magnitudes of the rr lyrae variables . \n the sx phoenicis variables all lie to the left of the giant branch . \n after close inspection of the images all but one of our sx phoenicis variables appeared to be blended with stars of equal or greater brightness . further inspection of hubble space telescope images confirmed this . \n variables nv4 and nv5 appear to be blended with giant stars whereas nv7 , nv8 , and nv9 are blended with stars of similar brightness to themselves . \n nv6 is the only sx phoenicis variable that does not appear to be blended with a relatively bright or comparable bright star . \n for nearly 5 months from late january through june of 2011 we observed the globular cluster ngc  4833 using the sara 0.6 meter telescope at ctio . \n using the image subtraction software isis we were able to find precise periods of 17 previously known variables and 10 newly discovered variables stars . of these new discoveries we found 6 sx phoenicis variables . \n the other 4 newly discovered variables were 2 eclipsing , one rrab , and one apparent rre . in total , we classified 10 of the variables as type rrab , with a mean period of 0.69591 days , 7 as type rrc with a mean period of 0.39555 days , perhaps 2 lower amplitude type rre , with a mean period of 0.30950 days , and 2 eclipsing binaries , with a mean period of 0.3243 days . both the bailey diagram and ratio of @xmath3 are consistent with the cluster being of type oosterhoff type ii . \n we thank c. alard for making isis 2.2 publicly available . \n this project was funded in part by the butler institute for research and scholarship . \n the authors also thank f. levinson for a generous gift enabling butler university s membership in the sara consortium . \n alard , c. , & lupton , r.  h.  1998 , , 503 , 325 alard , c.  2000 , , 144 , 363 alcock , c. , allsman , r.  a. , axelrod , t.  s. , et al . \n 1996 , , 111 , 1146 bailey , s.  i.  1924 , harvard college observatory bulletin 801 , pp.7 -

{"ContextTokens": 2416, "GeneratedTokens": 87, "SynthesizedBody": "cellular automata ( cas ) are discrete dynamical systems that have been studied for years due to their architectural simplicity and the wide spectrum of behaviors they are capable of @xcite . here \n we study cas that can be said to perform a simple `` computational '' task . \n one such task is the so - called _ majority _ or _ density _ \n task in which a two - state ca is to decide whether the initial state contains more zeros than ones or vice versa . in spite of its apparent simplicity , \n it is a difficult problem for a ca as it requires a coordination among the automata . as such \n , it is a perfect paradigm of the phenomenon of _ emergence _ in complex systems . \n that is , the task solution is an emergent global property of a system of locally interacting agents . \n indeed , it has been proved that no ca can perform the task perfectly i.e. , for any possible initial binary configuration of states @xcite . \n however , several efficient cas for the density task have been found either by hand or by using heuristic methods , especially evolutionary computation @xcite . \n for a recent review see @xcite . \n all previous investigations have empirically shown that finding good cas for the majority task is very hard . \n however , there have been no investigations , to our knowledge , of the reasons that make this particular fitness landscape a difficult one . in this paper \n we statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of searching the majority ca landscape . \n the paper proceeds as follows . \n the next section summarizes some known facts about cas for the density task . \n a description of its fitness landscape follows , focusing on the hardness and neutrality aspects . \n next we identify and analyze a particular subspace of the problem search space called the olympus . \n finally , we present our conclusions and hints to further works and open questions . \n the density task is a prototypical distributed computational problem for cas . for a finite ca of size \n @xmath0 it is defined as follows . \n let @xmath1 be the fraction of 1s in the _ initial configuration _ \n ( ic ) @xmath2 . \n the task is to determine whether @xmath1 is greater than or less than @xmath3 . in this version , \n the problem is also known as the _ majority _ problem . \n if @xmath4 then the ca must relax to a fixed - point configuration of all 1 s that we indicate as @xmath5 ; otherwise it must relax to a fixed - point configuration of all 0 s , noted @xmath6 , after a number of time steps of the order of the grid size @xmath0 . here \n @xmath0 is set to 149 , the value that has been customarily used in research on the density task ( if @xmath0 is odd one avoids the case @xmath7 for which the problem is undefined ) . \n this computation is trivial for a computer having a central control . \n indeed , just scanning the array and adding up the number of , say , 1 bits will provide the answer in @xmath8 time . \n however , it is nontrivial for a small radius one - dimensional ca since such a ca can only transfer information at finite speed relying on local information exclusively , while density is a global property of the configuration of states . \n it has been shown that the density task can not be solved perfectly by a uniform , two - state ca with finite radius @xcite . \n the lack of a perfect solution does not prevent one from searching for imperfect solutions of as good a quality as possible . in general , given a desired global behavior for a ca ( e.g. , the density task ) , it is extremely difficult to infer the local ca rule that will give rise to the emergence of the computation sought . \n this is because of the possible nonlinearities and large - scale collective effects that can not in general be predicted from the sole local ca updating rule , even if it is deterministic . since exhaustive evaluation of all possible rules is out of the question except for elementary ( @xmath9 ) and perhaps radius - two automata , one possible solution consists in using evolutionary algorithms , as first proposed by packard in @xcite and further developed by mitchell et al . \n + the _ standard performance _ of the best rules ( with @xmath10 ) found at the end of the evolution is defined as the fraction of correct classifications over @xmath11 randomly chosen ics . \n the ics are sampled according to a binomial distribution ( i.e. , each bit is independently drawn with probability @xmath3 of being 0 ) . \n + mitchell and coworkers performed a number of studies on the emergence of synchronous ca strategies for the density task ( with @xmath12 ) during evolution @xcite . \n their results are significant since they represent one of the few instances where the dynamics of emergent computation in complex , spatially extended systems can be understood . as for the evolved cas , it was noted that , in most runs , the ga found unsophisticated strategies that consisted in expanding sufficiently large blocks of adjacent 1s or 0s . \n this `` block - expanding '' strategy is unsophisticated in that it mainly uses local information to reach a conclusion . as a consequence , \n only those ic that have low or high density are classified correctly since they are more likely to have extended blocks of 1s or 0s . \n these cas have a performance around @xmath13 . \n a few runs yielded more sophisticated cas with performance ( around @xmath14 ) on a wide distribution of ics . \n however , high - performance automata have evolved only nine times out of @xmath15 runs of the genetic algorithm . \n this clearly shows that the search space is a very difficult one , even there exists some recent works on coevolutionary algorithm @xcite which able to find a number of `` block expanding '' strategies . \n these sophisticated strategies rely on traveling signals ( `` particles '' ) that transfer spatial and temporal information about the density in local regions through the lattice , and have been quantitatively described with a framework known as `` computational mechanics '' @xcite . \n the gkl rule @xcite is hand -

{"ContextTokens": 3407, "GeneratedTokens": 72, "SynthesizedBody": "in the past few years , quantum theory on a cone has attracted much attention . \n one of the motivations , besides theoretical interest in @xmath0 dimensional field theory , is the application to quantum field theory around cosmic strings . \n an idealized cosmic string , which is infinitely thin , can be represented by a conical singularity of space - time . \n quantum effect around cosmic strings has been studied by many authors including dowker @xcite , frolov @xcite , linet @xcite and smith.@xcite    the scattering by a cosmic string or a conical singularity has also been investigated recently.@xcite this non - trivial scattering is often dubbed as the gravitational aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .    it is interesting to consider `` radiative '' corrections to the gravitational ab scattering , which arise due to quantum fluctuations of all interacting field around cosmic strings .    in the present paper , \n we consider vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . \n then , charged particles scattered by a cosmic string undergo quatum corrections even if the cosmic string has no charge and no classical field strength . \n the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , the vacuum polarization of gauge field is obtained . in section 3 , we derive the quantum - mechanically corrected klein - gordon equation for a charged scalar field . the scattering amplitude is calculated in section 4 . \n section 5 is devoted to conclusion . \n in this section , we compute the vacuum value of @xmath1 around a infinite straight cosmic string , where @xmath2 is the electromagnetic field . \n connection to an effective wave equation for a charged scalar field is presented in the succeeding section . \n we first anticipate that @xmath3 , since there is no dimensional quantity other than the distance from the string . \n a comment on gauge invariance is in order . \n classically the presence of the cosmic string does not break the gauge invariance . at the one - loop level , however , one can see the breakdown of gauge symmetry near the cosmic string , due to the mass - like term @xmath4 in the scalar qed ; here the vacuum expectation value @xmath5 depends on the distance from the cosmic string . \n thus the non - zero expectation value of @xmath6 does not give rise to a real conflict . \n note also that we often encounter the expression @xmath7 in the discussion on the coleman - weinberg potential ( or radiative gauge - symmetry breaking ) in scalar qed at zero and finite temperature.@xcite    we assume the following line element around the idealized cosmic string which lies along the @xmath8 axis : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is related to the mass density of the string @xmath11 by @xmath12 . \n working in the coulomb gauge , we can denote the gauge field in the form of normal - mode expansion , such as @xmath13 mode functions @xmath14 are the solutions for the maxwell equations . in the coordinate system represented by eq . \n ( [ 2.1 ] ) , we find the following set of mode functions : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bessel function , @xmath17 is positive integer and @xmath18 .    using the mode functions \n , we can perform the calculation of @xmath19 by mode - summation . \n after regularization , we find that a finite portion of @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    the quantity has been regularized so as to become zero if @xmath21 . \n ( note that this is twice of the real - scalar contribution.@xcite ) the mode expansion is also useful to investigale properties of charged fields around a cosmic string.@xcite    in the next section , we consider the modification of field equation due to the vacuum field @xmath19 . \n suppose that a minimally - coupled scalar field @xmath22 is governed by klein - gordon equation , where the space - time derivative is replaced by the covariant derivative including the gauge field .    in this paper , we assume that the cosmic string has no classical electromagnetic field . \n although general cosmic strings in guts have fluxes in their core , their fluxes are not magnetic fluxes we know , but are associated with gauge fields of broken symmetry . for a superconducting cosmic string @xcite \n the analysis ought to be done by some other ways , since the metric is more or less deformed by electric currents . \n therefore , we treat the case with normal cosmic strings throughout this paper .    however , we take into account the vacuum expcctation value of the electromagnetic field . \n only the second moment @xmath23 appears and the field equation is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling constant and @xmath26 is the mass . \n the term @xmath27 behaves as a potential term .    if we use the metric ( [ 2.1 ] ) and substitute ( [ 2.2 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ 3.1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    a solution for the modified equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is written in the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in the following section \n , we study the scattering problem by use of this solution . \n we set @xmath33 in the following analysis in this paper . \n to treat the scattering by an infinite string , we consider two - dimensional scattering , taking the @xmath8-component of the momentum ( @xmath34 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) ) to be zero . we have set @xmath33 . \n we first review the scattering in two dimensions.@xcite the wave function behaves asymptotically , @xmath35 when a target sits at the origin . here \n @xmath36 is a scattering amplitude , and a differential cross section ( for a cosmic string , per unit length ) is given by @xmath37 . \n the phase in front of @xmath36 is chosen to simplify the expression of the optical theorem in two dimensions @xcite ( see later ) . in order to find the scattering amplitude , we compare the asymptotic form of the solution of the wave equation with ( [ 4.1 ] ) . \n we determine @xmath38 by matching the coefficient of the in - going `` spherical '' wave ( @xmath39 ) . \n the asymptotic form of the plane wave going in the @xmath40-direction is given by @xmath41 further if we assume that we can take the following asymptotic behavior of the solution for the wave equation : @xmath42 then we find @xmath43 where @xmath44 is called as a phase shift . \n now , we will turn back to the present problem . the wave equation to be considered \n ( [ 3.2 ] ) with @xmath33 . \n we regard @xmath45 as an independent parameter of @xmath10 for a later use . \n the mode solution ( [ 3.3 ] ) behaves asymptotically as @xmath46 where @xmath47 . \n thus one can find @xmath48    if @xmath49 is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath44 is negative when @xmath21 and @xmath50 . \n therefore we can say that the `` potential '' @xmath51 gives rise to a repulsive force . as studied and stated in ref . \n @xcite , the scattering amplitude for @xmath52 contains delta functions . \n namely , for @xmath53 , one can find @xcite @xmath54 this peculiarity originates from the conical space generates `` long - range force '' in some naive sense . \n we discuss the amplitude in which such divergences are removed.@xcite    we will calculate @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath17 : integer ) . \n we first compute the scattering amplitude for @xmath21 and @xmath58 ( we take @xmath45 as an independent parameter . ) . \n this is used for a check of general results . \n the result obtained by numerical calculation is shown in fig .  1 . \n we examine some approximation schemes .     and \n @xmath58 .

{"ContextTokens": 3619, "GeneratedTokens": 212, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spatial anisotropy at intermediate angular scales provide critical information on conditions in the early universe at redshifts @xmath5 , and put strong constraints on cosmological scenarios . \n in particular , measurements at degree angular scales provide a sensitive test of scale free fluctuations below the so called doppler peak ( @xcite ) .    on an angular scale of 10 , the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) \n satellite has detected anisotropy of @xmath6 @xmath3k ( @xcite ) . \n cross correlation with firs , an independent observation at much shorter wavelengths ( @xcite ) , confirms the cobe observation and its interpretation as cosmic in origin . \n white , scott , & silk ( 1994 ) provides a recent summary of measurements in this field . \n we report here the first results from a new instrument , bam ( balloon - borne anisotropy measurement ) , which measures at angular scales from to several degrees , angles just larger than typically predicted for the location the first doppler peak . measurements at this scale will determine the angular spectral index of primordial inhomogeneities . \n bam consists of a cryogenic differential fourier transform spectrometer coupled to an off - axis prime focus telescope . \n the advantages of the bam approach to measuring cmb anisotropy , consisting of a clean optical system and good spectral coverage , have been described elsewhere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the spectrometer ( @xcite ) was previously used for a measurement of the cmb spectrum ( @xcite ) . for this experiment , the spectrometer is fitted with new input optics and passband - limiting filters , a new long duration @xmath7he refrigerator ( tucker et al . \n 1996 ) and is housed in a new cryostat . \n the telescope is pointed with a three - axis servo system locked to guide stars . \n the electronic and electromechanical components of a pointing system used previously with other balloon - borne instruments ( @xcite ) were incorporated into a new lightweight balloon gondola . \n the two input collimators of the differential spectrometer view the same portion of the aluminum primary mirror , resulting in two input beams on the sky which are @xmath8 fwhm separated by @xmath9 . \n the optical arrangement is sketched in figure 1 . \n particular attention is paid to the suppression of spurious radiation entering the instrument . \n a diffraction control horn surrounds the two spectrometer entrance windows so that neither window is visible from anywhere except in reflection off the primary mirror . \n a reflective ground shield surrounds the entire lower portion of the instrument so that no part of the diffraction control horn , input collimators , or primary mirror is directly illuminated by radiation from the earth . \n the interferometer has two independent bolometric detectors , one for each output port . \n each bolometer yields a double sided interferogram proportional to the brightness difference between the two input beams . \n the scanning time for one interferogram is 0.67 s , and the optical path length difference runs from 1.44 to @xmath10 cm . \n spectra are obtained _ a posteriori _ by fourier transforming these interferograms . \n bam was launched from the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas at 00:45 ut ( at sunset ) on 8 july 1995 and reached a float altitude of 41.5 km at 05:00 ut . \n observations ended at 09:00 ut , in darkness , when the payload was near the end of telemetry range and the flight was terminated . \n the payload was recovered with only minor damage .    to calibrate the instrument and measure the beam profile , three scans of the telescope beams across the planet jupiter \n were made just prior to reaching a stable float altitude . \n the scans were made in azimuth at three fixed elevation angles , so that jupiter passed through both beams of the telescope . \n unfortunately , the elevation angles were not chosen optimally so jupiter was scanned only with the lower half of the telescope beams . as a result the maximum possible signal from jupiter was never realized . using data about the beam shape obtained on the ground prior to flight , along with the flight data \n , it is estimated that the maximum observable signal is @xmath11 times larger than the measured response . \n the data of griffin et al . \n ( 1986 ) for jupiter have been used as an absolute reference to calibrate the power sensitivity of the instrument . \n the total calibration uncertainty is 20% .    soon after reaching float altitude , \n an integrated circuit on board the telescope pointing system failed . \n this caused disruption of commands controlling the telescope orientation . \n the telescope remained locked to guide stars , but slewing the telescope to new orientations could not be carried out on the planned schedule . \n after diagnosing the problem , a switch was made to a redundant telemetry channel not originally intended to be used for in - flight control ; and a software patch was also developed . \n thus , reliable operation of the pointing system was re - established for the last half hour of flight . \n the instrument performed well despite these problems , but the reduction of observing time reduced the sensitivity , and the disruption of the planned observing pattern limited the ability to check for atmospheric effects .    as this was the first flight of bam , a conservative observation strategy was adopted to allow the instrument performance to be understood . \n the telescope observes near the meridian above the north celestial pole . \n the left telescope beam is moved to a target spot east of the meridian and the telescope is locked with reference to a guide star within 5@xmath12 of the beam . \n a series of single difference interferograms , @xmath13 , are obtained while tracking the guide star . \n after a period of observation , called a stare , the telescope is slewed so that the right beam is on the target spot and a second series of interferograms , @xmath14 , is accumulated . \n the series @xmath15 is called a wobble . \n the difference signal @xmath16 is an interferogram of the difference in brightness between the target spot and the average of the two spots to either side of it . \n wobbling is repeated while tracking the target spot to west of the meridian after which a new target spot east of the meridian is acquired . \n it had been intended to initiate a new stare every three minutes , but the command intermittency resulted in not wobbling for periods of up to fifteen minutes in duration . \n the data set consists of a series of three - minute long data files containing the bolometer and optical path length difference signals sampled uniformly in time along with 50 channels of auxiliary data . \n each file contains approximately 263 interferograms . about 10% of the data in each interferogram \n is deleted corresponding to the time that the interferometer mirror is slowing and reversing direction at the ends of the scan . because the bolometer signals are sampled uniformly in time and the interferometer speed is not constant , it is necessary to perform an interpolation of the data to acquire interferogram samples uniformly spaced in optical delay . \n these interpolated interferograms are edited as follows . \n those interferograms corresponding to periods in which the telescope was slewing are deleted ( 23.2% ) . \n data contaminated by the effects of cosmic rays striking the bolometers are removed from the remaining data using the following algorithm . for each stare , a mean and variance are computed at each value of optical delay in the interferogram . \n any individual interferogram containing a point more than @xmath17 from the mean is excluded from further analysis ; a total of 6.7% of the data are deleted this way . to exclude smaller cosmic ray events which are hidden in the variance caused by the events removed above \n , the process is repeated on the remaining interferograms , and a further 2.0% of the data are deleted . after the above editing 61.4% of all the data remain for analysis . \n spectra are calculated using an fft routine to find the fourier transform of each interferogram . \n interferograms obtained during ascent contain an appreciable atmospheric signal . \n these data are used to provide a reference for phase correcting the interferograms , that is , removing the effects of phase shifts in the bolometers and amplifiers . \n thus , optical signals appear only in the fourier cosine transform . \n the sine component of the phase corrected fourier transform contains no optical data at any frequency but provides a monitor of systematic errors . \n signals from the atmosphere at float altitude are too weak to provide a phase correction reference . \n an independent and consistent phase correction is obtained from the jupiter data . \n we had intended to analyze the data using a double difference technique taking data from temporally adjacent stares in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 positions . however , the unreliable wobbling achieved during flight precludes such an analysis . therefore only single differences are analyzed . \n each stare is divided into two half - stares . \n for each half - stare the difference spectrum @xmath20 ) is calculated where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 subscripts on the symbol @xmath21 have been dropped since only single differences are being considered . \n the symbol @xmath22 indicates a fourier transform , and @xmath23 is a known constant offset interferogram due to radiation internal to the instrument . \n the magnitude of the offset is about 20 mk . \n the variances of the @xmath24 s , @xmath25 , are also computed and are an error estimate unbiased by sky signal ; these error estimates are propagated through the remainder of the analysis .    during the flight , a gap in the anisotropy data of about an hour occurred while the software patch was being developed . during this time \n the telescope observed another part of the sky , at a different elevation angle than for the data reported here . \n ( unfortunately , because wobbling was absent conclusions about anisotropies could not be drawn at this different elevation angle ; the data were used , however , to help check for systematic errors . ) \n the data taken before and after the gap are analyzed separately but identically . \n for each frequency channel the data are simultaneously fitted to a model of the sky , a constant offset , a linear drift in time , payload altitude , and the temperature of the torque motor which drives the spectrometer scan mechanism . \n the fits are done independently for the cosine and sine transforms and a full covariance matrix is propagated . \n the reduced @xmath26 for the fits range between 0.37 and 1.20 . in the worst frequency channel \n the total drift during the flight is 2.5 mk while in the best channel the drift is 500 @xmath3k . \n the torque motor just referred to is located in an ambient temperature region of the cryostat vacuum space . \n approximately every 30 minutes by operator choice , a heater on the torque motor was turned on or off in order to maintain the motor temperature in a useful range . \n this power variation caused the motor temperature to vary by 4 k during the flight . \n apparently heat conducted from the motor through the shaft to the mirror scanning mechanism differentially heated the interferometer housing . a significant drift ( up to 600 @xmath3k ) correlated with the torque motor temperature is observed in the sine transforms but is not apparent in the cosine transforms . since light emitted from the interferometer walls is modulated differently from light entering the interferometer through the input collimators , it is plausible that such a signal would only appear in one phase of the transforms , as observed . \n in addition to the torque motor temperature , a number of other temperatures and differential temperatures are measured both inside the cryostat and elsewhere on the gondola . with the exception of the torque motor temperature , no correlation between @xmath27 and any temperature or differential temperature is observed . \n in particular , a 2 k temperature gradient was induced across the primary mirror near the end of the flight by heating one side of the mirror . \n no correlation is observed between @xmath27 and the temperature of the primary mirror or temperature gradient across the mirror .    due to the limited integration time and failure to obtain a sufficient number of _ \n double _ differences , the sensitivity achieved in each frequency channel is modest and inadequate to accurately constrain the spectral index of any observed signal ; therefore we present only band average data . \n the final single differences are shown in figure 2 .    if each stare is divided instead into thirds , the analysis yields consistent results . \n however with finer subdivision , the final differences are discrepant indicating the presence of a non - stationary noise source . \n the cross elevation of the telescope oscillates with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 04 and a period of 12 s. this may be the source of the non - stationary noise . however , the sensitivity on these very long time scales is low and it has been impossible to find and remove any correlation . \n another problem which gave concern is that there is increased noise in the detectors when the interferometer mirror is scanning ; however , there is no evidence that this has introduced systematic effects that could mimic a detected signal . \n there is strong evidence that the observed signals are from optical sources external to the instrument . \n significant power is detected only in the cosine component of the spectrum , which contains optical signals , while the sine component , which does not contain optical signals , is consistent with noise . \n given the limited integration time , we can not reliably dismiss the possibility that the signal is from the atmosphere . \n it is also difficult to rule out definitively earthshine and moonshine entering the instrument differentially although much care has been exercised in designing the ground shield . \n there appears to be a mild correlation between the cosine and sine single differences ( consisting of a monotonic drift in offset during the flight ) . \n the cause of this possible correlation is unknown . \n because the power in the correlated part of the signal does not exceed the power in the sine component , and the power in the sine component is negligible , it can be concluded that the small correlated component has minimal effect on the detected power in the cosine component . \n the structure in figure 2 does not correlate with the iras 100 @xmath3 m maps ( wheelock et al . \n 1993 ) .    assuming that cmb anisotropy is gaussian correlated with a correlation angle @xmath28 , a likelihood analysis ( @xcite ) has been performed on the full frequency band data . for a given @xmath28 , the 90% confidence interval on @xmath29 \n is computed by integrating the resulting likelihood curve . \n the results are shown in figure  3 . \n a value @xmath30 at a coherence angle of @xmath31 is derived ; the calibration uncertainty is not included in this number . \n for the sine component of the spectrum a null signal is expected . applying the same analysis to the sine component , \n a signal consistent with zero is found ; a 95% upper limit of @xmath32 is found for @xmath31 . \n this is a measure of the instrumental sensitivity . in particular , the signal associated with any correlation between the sine and cosine components shown in figure 2 is not larger than the full sine amplitude , and thus is consistent with zero and not consistent with the power detected in the cosine component .    using the approximations of steinhardt ( 1995 ) and white & scott ( 1994 ) , \n the detected cosine amplitude can be expressed as @xmath2 @xmath3k where the effective spherical harmonic of the observation geometry is @xmath33 . \n statistically significant fluctuations in the microwave sky have been observed . \n however , the spectrum has not been measured with sufficient sensitivity to attribute these fluctuations definitively to cosmic origin . on the other hand \n the new results are similar to those of others measuring anisotropies ; that is , there are scattered regions of the sky whose temperatures are unexpectedly high . clearly , it is becoming urgent to establish whether these regions pertain to the cosmic background . \n this new instrument , bam , is potentially capable of doing this in a full flight , since it measures the spectrum of the anisotropies .    without pointing system problems and a longer balloon flight , \n an increase of 48 in integration time is easily achievable . \n in addition another factor of 24 in reduced detector noise is easily realizable with a new mirror scanning mechanism . \n we expect to adopt a more optimal observing strategy and spectral resolution for the next flight . \n we would like to emphasize that the modest sensitivity obtained in this flight is the result of a series of mechanical and electrical malfunctions and is not the result of any fundamental limit of the instrument . \n in addition all of the malfunctions have readily identifiable causes . \n preventing a recurrence of these malfunctions provides no serious technical challenges . \n we would like to acknowledge the expert flight support provided by the united states national scientific balloon facility , palestine , texas . \n caitlin davis , miranda jackson and chris padwick helped prepare for and assisted with the flight . \n the undergraduate students gill bakker , jamie borisoff , kevin driedger , dan griggs and chris trautman helped build parts of the instrument . \n we would like to thank ed wishnow for his extremely valuable help in palestine , texas during his vacation . \n we thank the ubc mechanical and electrical shops . \n this research was supported by the canadian space agency , the natural science and engineering research council of canada and the particle physics and astronomy research council of the united kingdom .", "StartTimeOffset": 308388802170, "RequestID": "f4e4be3990c1025e0672b693ee2117538f815777", "TotalTokens": 3831}

stage cancer @xcite . \n axial resolution in oct is ultimately limited by the coherence length of the light source and can be less than 1  @xmath0 m for very broadband sources @xcite . \n this resolution is hindered by material dispersion which both broadens the features in the interferograms and reduces the contrast . \n exciting developments in quantum interferometry led to the proposal and demonstration of quantum - optical coherence tomography ( q - oct ) @xcite . \n this technique replaces white - light interferometry ( wli ) with hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometry @xcite utilizing frequency - entangled photon pairs . \n this device automatically cancels all even orders of dispersion in the resulting interferogram , including group - velocity dispersion , the most significant contribution @xcite . dispersion cancellation in hom interference \n is `` blind '' , requiring no _ a priori _ knowledge of the material properties , in contrast with dispersion compensation methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) . \n in addition to dispersion cancellation , the hom interferometer is phase insensitive , has better resolution than wli with the same bandwidth , and the interference visibility is insensitive to unbalanced loss . \n unfortunately , this technique is based on entangled photon pairs and the costs , in terms of speed and expense , have limited its widespread adoption . \n other techniques for blind dispersion compensation without entanglement have been proposed @xcite or demonstrated @xcite , but they require unavailable technology @xcite or significant numerical post - processing @xcite and do not have the other advantageous properties of q - oct . \n we have recently demonstrated a completely classical technique , based on oppositely - chirped laser pulses , for producing an interferogram with _ all _ the advantages of hom interference with vastly higher signal  @xcite .    in the present work , \n we use chirped - pulse interferometry ( cpi ) for axial profiling a sample with two optical interfaces . \n q - oct interferograms have been shown to contain artifacts @xcite , signals that do not correspond to real features of the sample . due to the strong analogy , these artifacts also appear in cpi - based axial imaging . \n we experimentally demonstrate a straightforward method for controlling these artifacts . \n although it is possible to control these artifacts in q - oct as well  @xcite , it is technically challenging and has not been demonstrated . \n our interferometer is shown in fig .  1 and described in the caption . \n it relies on pairs of oppositely - chirped laser pulses that have been stretched to several hundred times their initial , transform - limited , pulse duration . in this large - chirp limit , at any given time the two frequency - anticorrelated pulses have frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . here , @xmath3 is the average of the instantaneous frequencies of these pulses . if the chirped pulses are coincident at the input beam splitter , @xmath3 is equal to the centre frequency of the laser , but it can be tuned by changing the relative delay between the pulses . \n we refer to @xmath3 as the _ operating frequency _ to distinguish it from the centre frequency of the laser . following the theoretical framework from @xcite , we assume that the effect of the sample is modelled by a linear transfer function , @xmath4 . \n the reference arm contains an adjustable path delay , @xmath5 . \n after propagation in each arm , the beams undergo sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) in a nonlinear medium . \n we detect sfg light in a very narrow frequency band near @xmath6 ensuring that the output signal is almost exclusively due to cross - correlations between the chirped and anti - chirped pulses . under these conditions , \n the signal integrated over all frequencies in the chirped pulses and measured by a square - law detector , @xmath7 , is @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the intensity spectrum of both laser pulses . \n the cpi signal is identical to that in q - oct when @xmath10 is equal to the spectrum of the entangled photons ( see @xcite , eqns . \n ( 6)-(8 ) ) .    a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( center wavelength 790  nm , average power 2.7  w , repetition rate 80 mhz ) was used to create a pair of horizontally - polarized beams of oppositely - chirped pulses using a grating - based stretcher and compressor @xcite . \n these stretched the initial pulses from 100  fs to 54  ps ( 48  ps ) with 11  nm ( 10  nm ) bandwidth for the chirped ( anti - chirped ) pulses . \n note that the difference in the pulse duration is due to slightly different bandwidths , not different chirp rates . \n details on the stretcher and compressor can be found in @xcite . \n we used a borosilicate microscope coverglass as the sample . \n the cpi ( wli ) data was taken by recording the signal of detector d1 ( d2 ) over the delay @xmath5 . in each scan data \n was accumulated for 0.5  s over a range of 0.5  mm . \n the data without and with the calcite blocks are shown in fig . \n 2(a ) and fig . \n 2(b ) , respectively , where the upper ( lower ) plots are cpi ( wli ) scans . without additional dispersion ( fig \n .  2(a ) ) , the cpi interference dips have widths of 20.1@xmath110.3  @xmath0 m and 20.6@xmath110.4  @xmath0 m fwhm and corresponding visibilities of 39.0% and 40.9% for the front and the back surface of the coverglass , respectively . \n the wli patterns have widths 30.4@xmath110.3 @xmath0 m and 29.9@xmath110.3 @xmath0 m fwhm and corresponding visibilities of 12.9% and 14.0% . \n the errors in these measurements are mainly due to positioning uncertainty of the motor . even without the addition of calcite blocks \n , we see that the cpi signal has enhanced resolution by a factor of 1.5 compared to wli . \n this enhancement factor is slightly larger than the theoretically expected value of @xmath12 ( assuming gaussian spectra ) , due to uncompensated dispersion caused by the additional pbs in the sample arm .    the average optical power in the wli scans in figs . \n 2(a )  &  2(b ) was . in the cpi scans , \n the normalized intensity of 1.0 corresponds to 0.3  @xmath0w of measured optical power . \n this corresponds to approximately @xmath13  photons / s . \n it is difficult to directly compare this rate with the performance of q - oct demonstrated in @xcite since only normalized rates are presented ; however , the highest measured coincidence - counting rate from an entangled photon source to date is @xmath14 photons / s @xcite . given a total sample reflectivity of @xmath15 our measured power is 7 orders of magnitude larger than what could be achieved in q - oct with the best available technology . \n the path delay between the two cpi interference dips is 286.1@xmath110.4  @xmath0 m . \n the operating frequency was measured by taking the spectrum of the light after the first beam splitter ; it is the frequency at which the chirped and antichirped pulses interfere . \n the observed delay can be converted to the thickness of the coverslip by dividing by the group index , @xmath16 , of borosilicate glass at the operating wavelength @xmath17  nm , @xmath18 @xcite . the optical measurement of the coverglass thickness is @xmath19 \n @xmath0 m which is in good agreement with a direct measurement , using a micrometer , yielding @xmath20  @xmath0 m . \n to investigate the effects of material dispersion on the interference , we added a pair of calcite beam displacers into the setup . \n the sum of their lengths is 80.58@xmath110.01  mm and the light propagates through them with ordinary polarization . \n the widths of the cpi dips are unchanged at 19.4@xmath110.6  @xmath0 m and 20.7@xmath110.4  @xmath0 m fwhm ; the wli envelopes are significantly broadened by 74% to 53.0@xmath110.3 @xmath0 m and 53.4@xmath110.3 @xmath0 m . under these conditions , cpi has a factor of 2.65 better resolution than wli . \n both cpi and q - oct signals contain artifacts , additional features in the interferograms that do not correspond to real interfaces . \n these can be seen in the data in fig .  2 in between the interference dips . \n to illuminate the origin of these features in cpi we measured the full sfg spectrum as a function of delay using a high - resolution spectrometer ( acton sp-2758 ) . \n the results are shown in fig . \n 3 . on this scale , \n the only features visible are due to cross - correlations ; the autocorrelations form a weak , broadband background . \n when the paths are unbalanced , the signal contains two doublets of narrow spectral lines . \n one of these doublets is due to the chirped pulse traversing the sample arm and the anti - chirped pulse traversing the reference . \n the two peaks of the doublet are separated in frequency due to the difference in optical delay reflecting from the front and back surface of the sample . \n when the chirped pulse is reflected from the front surface the frequency of the cross - correlation will be slightly higher than upon reflection from the back surface . \n the other doublet can be understood by swapping the roles of the chirped and anti - chirped pulses . \n changing the path delay changes the spacing between the two doublets . \n an interference dip occurs when the delay in the reference path is equal to a delay in the sample path . \n the interference results from two different processes ( chirp in one of the two arms and anti - chirp in the other ) each producing light at the same frequency , but out of phase . in fig .  3 the four lines , formed by the two doublets for varying path delay , cross at four distinct points . \n two of these points occur at the same wavelength but at different path delays ; they correspond to the dips in the cpi scans indicating real features of the sample . \n the other two crossing points occur at the same path delay but different wavelengths ; these give rise to the artifacts .    as in q - oct , \n the interference giving rise to the artifacts can be constructive or destructive whereas for real features it is always destructive . if the interference is constructive , as in fig .  2 , \n the artifact is easy to identify . if instead it is destructive , artifacts \n can easily be confused with real features . in q - oct \n it was predicted that this could be adjusted by changing the sum - frequency of the entangled photon pair  @xcite . in practice , however , this is difficult as most uv narrow - band pump sources for spdc are not tunable . \n cpi has the intrinsic advantage that the operating frequency is tunable by changing the relative delay between the chirped and anti - chirped pulses at the input beam splitter . in figs . \n 4(a ) and 4(b ) , we show two examples of cpi interferograms taken at different operating wavelengths 792.10  nm and 791.54  nm illustrating constructive and destructive interference in the artifact , respectively . \n the operating frequency is half the sfg frequency measured near zero delay . in these scans \n the path delay was not varied continuously but in discrete steps , accounting for fewer data points . \n we employ the model transfer function for the coverslip , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the reflection amplitude from the front ( back ) surface , @xmath24 is the wavevector in the glass , and @xmath25 is the thickness . inserting this expression into eq . \n ( 1 ) , one finds that the term describing the artifact is modulated by @xmath26 . if the operating frequency changes from @xmath3 to @xmath27 , then @xmath28 and the expected change in wavelength required to flip the sign of the artifact is @xmath29 . \n figure  4(c ) shows the visibility of the artifact as a function of the operating wavelength . \n visibility is defined as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the intensities at the centre of the dip and at the shoulder , respectively . \n a fit to this data yields a period of ( 1.13@xmath110.02 )  nm in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of 1.09  nm . \n changing the operating wavelength in this straightforward way allows identification and removal of artifacts from axial scans . \n there is a difference between q - oct and cpi . even in the absence of dispersion , \n the resolution in q - oct is a factor of @xmath33 better than in wli  @xcite while , assuming gaussian spectra , cpi has a factor of @xmath12 better resolution than wli . \n the difference originates from the effective bandwidths used in the comparison . assuming a source of entangled photons with spectrum @xmath34 ( the modulus squared of @xmath35 in eq . \n ( 5 ) in @xcite ) , the effective bandwidths for hom interference ( see @xcite , eq . \n ( 8) ) and wli ( see @xcite , eq . \n ( 4 ) ) are the same because their spectra , @xmath34 , are identical @xcite . for chirped pulses with spectra @xmath9 , the bandwidth for cpi \n is determined by @xmath10 ( see eq . \n ( 1 ) ) while that for wli is determined by @xmath9 . for gaussian \n spectra the effective bandwidth for cpi is @xmath12 narrower than that for the wli , accounting for the resolution advantage of q - oct . \n is this a fundamental feature of entanglement ? \n surprisingly no . \n the same difference in resolution could be achieved using purely classical correlations . in cpi , \n time - correlations , but not intensity correlations are created between anticorrelated frequencies . in the same setup , \n one replaces the chirped pulses with two cw lasers tuned to frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath37 . during the integration time of the detection \n the laser frequencies are swept in an anticorrelated way according to the distribution @xmath38 . in this case , the effective spectrum in eq . \n ( 1 ) is @xmath39 , while the wli bandwidth is determined by the marginal @xmath40 . \n the effective bandwidths are identical in both cases and thus this classical scheme achieves the same factor of @xmath33 higher resolution as q - oct . in practice , however , chirped pulses offer dramatically higher nonlinear conversion efficiency compared to cw lasers far outweighing this rather small difference . \n we have shown that chirped - pulse interferometry accrues the benefits of quantum - oct , but with a dramatic increase in signal , direct optical detection , and a straightforward means of identifying artifacts . \n we have experimentally demonstrated improved resolution in cpi over wli with and without mismatched dispersion by up to a factor of 2.65 . \n increasing the bandwidth of the light source is required for the resolution in cpi - based oct to compete with established techniques . \n broadband ( 148 nm ) three - wave mixing of anticorrelated frequencies has been demonstrated in 1.5mm - thick nonlinear materials @xcite . \n for safe _ in vivo _ imaging , the optical power can be attenuated before the sample without loss of signal visibility @xcite . \n we have demonstrated sfg detection of reflected signals as low as 5mw @xcite . based on the results of @xcite \n , efficient sfg should be measureable with much lower reflected powers . \n incorporating better nonlinear materials , such as ppktp , and more sensitive detectors will further allow operation at lower power levels . \n cpi achieves the benefits of quantum interferometry at macroscopic power levels and represents a powerful new technique for optical imaging . \n more generally , we have clarified the role of entanglement versus correlation in axial imaging . \n we acknowledge financial support from nserc and cfi . we thank g. weihs and c. couteau for the use of their spectrometer and technical assistance . \n we thank d. biggerstaff , k. bizheva , d. strickland , and g. weihs for valuable discussions . \n j.l . acknowledges financial support from the bell family fund and r.k . acknowledges financial support from iqc and ordcf . \n j. g. fujimoto , m. e. brezinski , g. j. tearney , s. a. boppart , b. bouma , m. r. hee , j. f. southern , and e. a. swanson , `` optical biopsy and imaging using optical coherence tomography , '' nature med . \n * 1 * , 970 -

consequently , in these temperature conditions a ( ga , mn)as sample will include a ferromagnetic phase confined to a very thin surface region . \n the above - mentioned finding can be a precious contribution to the ongoing debate @xcite on the essential mechanisms increasing the curie temperature in ( ga , mn)as , since in the light of the cited paper @xcite in - depth studies of the nature of the surface ferromagnetism in this material could bring us closer to the understanding of the processes that might increase its curie temperature even to the room temperature range . \n the present study is devoted to spin - wave resonance ( swr ) , a very effective experimental method for the study of ferromagnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as thin films , and their surface in particular . it allows full characterization of the _ surface magnetic anisotropy _ , which , as we demonstrate here , provides the basis for the determination of the existence conditions of magnetic ( spin - wave ) modes localized at the _ surface _ of a ( ga , mn)as sample . we believe that this result is a step forward in exploring the differences in ferromagnetic properties between the surface and bulk of this material . \n the existence of surface spin - wave modes ( sswms ) in ( ga , mn)as thin films was first reported by liu _ et al . _ \n @xcite , which observed sswms in both the out - of - plane configuration , with variable polar angle  @xmath3 between the magnetization of the film and its surface normal , and the in - plane configuration , with variable azimuth angle  @xmath0 between the in - plane magnetization of the film and the [ 100 ] crystal axis . in the former case sswms only exist when the polar angle  @xmath3 is larger than a certain angle    the _ out - of - plane critical angle _    while in the in - plane configuration sswms are observed in the azimuth angle range _ between _ two _ in - plane critical angle_s . \n these experimental findings are interpreted theoretically in our recent papers @xcite , in which we propose an appropriate model of surface anisotropy that both explains the existence of critical angles and allows to determine the conditions of existence of sswms in full agreement with the experimental data . in our model of surface \n anisotropy we use the concept of surface pinning parameter  @xmath4 , which describes the freedom of precessing surface spins in relation to the freedom of precessing bulk spins . we have determined the functions  @xmath5 and @xmath6 describing the configuration dependence of the surface parameter in the out - of - plane and in - plane configurations , respectively . the explicit formula for the in - plane surface parameter reads@xcite : @xmath7 . \n \\label{a_surf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a satisfactory interpretation of the experimental swr spectra obtained in the in - plane configuration @xcite is achieved with the surface parameter described by the series presented above in equation  ( [ a_surf ] ) ( found in an investigation discussed in detail in @xcite ) with the following values of the series coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 and  @xmath10 : @xmath11 the series coefficients in equation  ( [ a_surf ] ) describe the contributions of different surface anisotropy components to the surface spin pinning in ( ga , mn)as thin films : @xmath8 is the isotropic contribution to the pinning , @xmath9 is related to the uniaxial component , and @xmath10 describes the pinning due to the cubic anisotropy .    in our model \n the critical angles are determined by the condition , and the configuration angles for which sswms exist by the condition . \n based on these conditions , in the present paper we will discuss the impact of each of the surface anisotropy components appearing in eq . \n ( [ a_surf ] ) , and provide a physical interpretation of their respective roles in the generation of sswms . to this end we will use a surface pinning diagram built in the polar coordinate system ; using this pinning diagram we will obtain a graphical representation of the configuration dependence of the pinning felt by the surface spins . \n the surface pinning diagram is a planar map showing how the dynamics of surface spins in a ( ga , mn)as thin film changes with their orientation with respect to specific crystal axes that characterize the surface structure . the pinning diagram is based on a polar coordinate system lying in the plane of the film surface ( see  fig . \n [ rys1 ] ) .    in this coordinate system \n the azimuth angle  @xmath0 describes the orientation of the magnetization of the sample with respect to a reference axis , which is the [ 100 ] crystal axis ; the distance between a point in the diagram and the pole of the coordinate system measures the value of the surface pinning parameter  @xmath12 corresponding to a given azimuth angle . against the pinning diagram in fig . \n [ rys1 ] we have added the crystal axes characterizing the magnetic anisotropy in the ( ga , mn)as sample used in the spin - wave resonance  ( swr ) study@xcite ( in which the swr measurements were performed in the ( 001 ) in - plane configuration ) .    introduced in papers @xcite , the concept of surface pinning parameter  @xmath13 was proposed to describe the degree of freedom of surface spins in their precession . by definition \n the surface pinning parameter value  @xmath14 corresponds to the natural freedom of the surface spins resulting from breaking their bonds with neighbors eliminated from the system by surface cut . \n this particular value of  @xmath13 divides the ( @xmath15 ) plane into two different regions : within the circle of radius  @xmath16 , where only bulk spin - wave modes exist , and region beyond this circle , in which sswms exist in the spectrum of allowed modes ( see also @xcite ) . \n the pinning diagram in fig .  [ rys2 ] presents the configuration dependence of the surface parameter resulting from our formula ( 1 ) against the experimental data obtained by liu  _ et  al . _ \n @xcite ; squares indicate the experimental surface parameter values corresponding to different configurations . \n the theory proves to fit very well the experiment . \n moreover , as we will see below in fig . \n [ rys3 ] , the theory reproduces faithfully the experimentally observed evolution of the swr spectrum with the azimuth angle  @xmath0 . \n figure  [ rys3 ] shows spin - wave mode profiles resulting from our theory and the corresponding swr spectra for five representative in - plane configurations that correspond to azimuth angles  @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( these configurations are also indicated in fig \n .  [ rys2 ] , where they are marked with red circles ) . \n the most important feature of the configuration evolution that the experimental swr spectrum undergoes as the azimuth angle increases to reach the consecutive values mentioned above is that from a multi - peak swr spectrum at  @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) consisting exclusively of bulk modes , it becomes a single - peak fmr spectrum at the critical angle  @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) , and then , as the azimuth angle continues to grow above this critical value , regains its previous multi - peak form in the azimuth angle range @xmath23 , in which , however , it now includes a resonance peak corresponding to a surface mode ( see the case with @xmath24 ; @xmath25 . \n this result is a strong evidence that the swr spectra measured in the in - plane configuration by liu  _ et  al . _ \n @xcite fulfill perfectly the assumptions of the surface inhomogeneity model , in which a key role is played by the surface magnetic anisotropy , constituting the source of the above - discussed effects . \n figure  [ rys4]a shows two curves , each representing the azimuth angle dependence of a part of surface pinning resulting from selected anisotropies  the total contribution of the isotropic and uniaxial anisotropies is analyzed independently of the pinning related to the cubic anisotropy . \n the first two contributions consonantly introduce the pinning to that region of the diagram in which sswms exist for any azimuth orientation ( green ring in the diagram ) . \n in contrast , the pinning resulting from the cubic anisotropy , represented by a quadrifolium - like curve , is completely embedded in the region within the circle of radius  @xmath16 ; however , since the circle  @xmath16 corresponds to the natural pinning , this implies that the cubic anisotropy alone will not induce sswms in any azimuth orientation . \n thus , already at this point , before proceeding to the analysis of the full pinning diagram presented in fig . \n [ rys4]b , we must realize that it will result from two above - mentioned opposite tendencies .    as a result of the summation of the above - mentioned pinning contributions with different effects on the spins \n one increasing their freedom , the other reducing it    in the full pinning diagram ( fig . \n [ rys4]b ) the green ring is reduced to four islands that still remain within the region of surface mode existence . \n each of these islands is associated with one hard cubic anisotropy axis , as indicated in fig . \n [ rys1 ] . also , each island corresponds to an azimuth angle range between the two critical angles for which @xmath16 ; each of these angle ranges surrounds symmetrically the cubic anisotropy axis . \n _ it is in these azimuth angle ranges that sswms exist_. beyond them the cubic anisotropy has a destructive effect on the surface modes ; this destruction is apparent in regions symmetric with respect to the _ easy cubic anisotropy axes_.    now we can provide physical grounds to these observations . \n a hard magnetic axis is a direction in which spins are reluctant to align , and setting them in an equilibrium direction involves a high energy cost to the system . \n thus , the opposite tendency    divergence from the hard axis    must be more favorable energetically . \n this implies that a _ hard cubic anisotropy axis _ plays the role of an _ easy axis _ for the _ spin pinning _ ; we can refer to it as an _ \n easy pinning axis _ , i.e. , an axis from which spins diverge easily , since their pinning along its direction is weaker . and vice versa : an _ easy cubic anisotropy axis _ defines a direction that spins are reluctant to quit     a _ hard surface pinning axis _ that hampers the occurrence of sswms . \n thus , the following final conclusion can be drawn from our considerations based on the pinning diagram : _ in a ( ga , mn)as thin film conditions favorable for the occurrence of surface spin - wave modes in the in - plane configuration are fulfilled first of all for those azimuth orientations of the magnetization of the sample that lie around the hard axes of cubic magnetic anisotropy_. \n this study is a part of a project financed by narodowe centrum nauki ( national science centre of poland ) , grant no . \n dec-2013/08/m / st3/00967 . \n j.  kanski , l.  ilver , k.  karlsson , m.  leandersson , i.  ulfat and j.  sadowski , _ electronic structure of ( ga , mn)as revisited : an alternative view on the `` battle of the bands '' _ , arxive : 1410.8842v2 [ cond-mat.mtrl-sci ] . \n m.  dobrowolska , k.  tivakornsasithorn , x.  liu , j.  k.  furdyna , m.  berciu , k.  m.  yu and w.  walukiewicz , _ controlling the curie temperature in ( ga , mn)as through location of the fermi level within the impurity band _ , nature  materials * 11 * , 444 ( 2012 ) \n . n.  samarth , _ battle of bands _ , nature  materials * 11 * , 360 ( 2012 ) . \n x.  liu , y .- y . \n zhou , and j.  k.  furdyna , _ angular dependence of spin - wave resonances and surface spin pinning in ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as films _ , phys . \n b  * 75 * , 195220 ( 2007 ) . \n h.  puszkarski and p.  tomczak , _ spin - wave resonancphys . \n status solidi b , e model of surface pinning in ferromagnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as thin films _ , sci .  rep . \n * 4 * , 6135 ( 2014 ) . \n h.  puszkarski and p.  tomczak , _ spin - wave resonance in ( ga , mn)as thin films : probing in - plane surface magnetic anisotropy _ , phys . \n rev .  b  * 91*. 195437 ( 2015 ) . h.  puszkarski and p.  tomczak , _ \n model for the surface anisotropy field observed in spin - wave resonance in ( ga , mn)as thin films _ , acta  phys . \n polon .  a  * 127 * , 508 ( 2015 ) . h.  puszkarski , _ quantum theory of spin wave resonance in thin ferromagnetic films . \n part i : spin waves in thin films , part ii : spin - wave resonance spectrum _ , acta  phys . \n polon .  a  * 38 * , 217 and 899 ( 1970 ) . h.  puszkarski , _ theory of surface states in spin wave resonance _ , progr .  surf . \n * 9 * , 191 ( 1979 ) . \n l.  wojtczak , _ magnetic  thin  films  ( in  polish ) _ \n , wydawnictwo uniwersytetu dzkiego , d 2009 . \n a.  urbaniak - kucharczyk , _ the coherent potential approximation in the description of spin wave resonance _ , \n status solidi b ,  * 189 * , 239 ( 1995 ) . \n diep - the - hung and j.  c.  s.  lvy , _ critical angle of external magnetic field for surface spin waves in thin ferromagnetic films _ , surface science  * 80 * , 512 ( 1979 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 329308850370, "RequestID": "ec80df227dd28395e7cc05dd9662f1ef8cce769c", "TotalTokens": 3462}

{"ContextTokens": 3589, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "galaxy interactions have been known for a long time to trigger star formation , although both observations and numerical simulations have shown that the enhancement of star formation depends , among other factors , on the orbital geometry of the encounter . in some situations interactions \n might even suppress star formation . \n hence , the star formation properties of interacting systems may serve as a clue to their interaction history .    here \n we analyse the star formation properties of three nearby galaxy systems in differing evolutionary phases : the weakly interacting triplet am 1238 - 362 @xcite , the strongly interacting compact galaxy group scg 0018 - 4854 @xcite , and the merging compact group cg j1720 - 67.8 @xcite . \n the first two systems are at comparable distances ( 48 and 45.5 mpc , respectively , assuming h@xmath1 = 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) , close enough to allow us to study the luminosity and size distribution of the hii regions in the individual galaxies . \n the third system , at a distance of 180 mpc , does not offer us the possibility to study the properties of individual hii regions . \n however , the general distribution of the ionized gas across the whole group and its velocity field can be used to guess the evolutionary status of the group . \n we interpret our ( in some cases still preliminary ) results taking into account star formation properties of other nearby galaxies @xcite and numerical simulations from the literature ( e.g. mihos , bothun , & richstone 1993 ) . \n am 1238 - 362 is a fairly tight triple system composed by two nearly face - on ( eso 381-g009 and tol 1238 - 36.4 ) and an edge - on ( eso 381-g006 ) spiral galaxies ( fig . \n [ am_a ] ) . a detailed study of the morphological and spectrophotometric properties of the two face - on galaxies has been presented in temporin et al . \n ( 2003a ) , where the interaction signatures and star formation properties have been discussed in the framework of the evolutionary history of the system . \n the two galaxies exhibit enhanced star formation activity , and the radial and azimuthal distribution of their h@xmath0 emission show a tendency for both disks to concentrate the star formation activity on the side facing the companion ( see temporin et al . \n 2003a , fig . \n 20 ) . here \n we make use of h@xmath0 narrow - band imaging obtained at the eso - mpia 2.2 m telescope ( see the above cited work for details on observations and data reduction ) to further investigate the star formation properties of these mildly interacting galaxies . in particular we measured the h@xmath0 luminosities and the sizes of the individual hii regions in order to analyse their luminosity functions ( lfs ) and size distributions . \n the regions were identified and measured in automated way with the hiiphot algorithm @xcite , choosing as a detection threshold a signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath3 5@xmath4 . the lfs are shown in fig . \n weighted least square fits to the regions in the luminosity range where lfs were believed to be complete were obtained assuming a standard power - law distribution with index @xmath0 . \n similarly we obtained power - law fits to the size distributions of the hii regions . \n the slope @xmath5 of the size distribution is expected to be related to that of the lf by the relation @xmath6 @xcite . for tol 1238 - 36.4 , a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) classified as an sb(rs)bc \n , we obtained @xmath0 = @xmath7 2.36@xmath80.16 , in good agreement with expectations for its morphological type @xcite , and @xmath5 = @xmath7 4.61@xmath80.62 , in agreement ( within errors ) with the above relation . \n however , we observe a uniform shift of the lf towards higher luminosities by about one order of magnitude with respect to other nearby star - forming spiral galaxies ( e.g. thilker et al . 2002 ) . \n this feature of the lf is typical of lirgs ( see also alonso - herrero , these proceedings ) . in this particular case \n , the high luminosity of the hii regions could be a consequence of the increased star formation activity triggered by the interaction . \n since the influence of the agn is mostly confined within the central kpc @xcite , we rule out the possibility of a significant cotribution to the ionization by the central agn . for eso 381-g009 \n , the slope of the lf strongly depends on the choice of the fitted luminosity range . \n the steeper slope ( @xmath0 = @xmath72.17@xmath80.34 ) shown in fig . \n [ am_b ] , obtained for regions with @xmath9(l@xmath10 ) @xmath3 39.5 , is in good agreement with the slope of the size distribution . \n the h@xmath0 image revealed also the presence of 12 emission - line point - like sources in the intergalactic space . \n their projected distances to the nearest galaxy range between 12 and 68 kpc and their h@xmath0 luminosities are in the range 0.6 - 7.4 @xmath11 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath2 . \n these could be intergalactic hii regions similar to those recently found in other interacting systems or around cluster galaxies @xcite . \n this strongly interacting galaxy group is composed by a tight quartet @xcite and a concordant redshift spiral galaxy ( eso 194-g13 ) @xmath13 12 arcmin apart . all members exhibit strong signs of disturbances , the most outstanding being the @xmath13 30 kpc -

band images were used for the continuum subtraction .    in three of the galaxies , \n individual hii regions were detected in sufficient number to allow us the construction of lfs and size distributions ( fig . \n [ lf_scg0018 ] ) . the same method described in section  2 was adopted . \n a more detailed analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper . \n the lf of ngc 92 exhibit a considerable flattening at the high luminosity end . \n this effect is not shared by the companion galaxies , so it might be a real feature , rather than an artificial effect due to source blending . \n when the highest luminosity hii regions are excluded from the fit of the lf , we obtain a slope @xmath0 = @xmath71.73@xmath80.11 consistent with the morphological type and in agreement , within errors , with the observed size distribution ( @xmath5 = @xmath73.71@xmath80.54 ) . \n some excess of relatively high luminosity hii regions is observed also in eso 194-g13 , but we can not exclude that this smaller effect is due to source blending , especially in the central part of the galaxy , where the spatial density of hii regions appears higher . the observed size distribution is steeper than expected ( @xmath5 = @xmath75.46@xmath80.40 ) , if the slope of the lf , @xmath0 = @xmath71.90@xmath80.37 , is considered . \n the lf of ngc 87 is based on the only 56 hii regions detected with s / n @xmath3 5@xmath4 . also in this case the lf slope ( @xmath0 = @xmath71.55@xmath80.11 ) , \n although consistent with the late morphological type of the galaxy ( ibm pec ) , does not agree with the slope of the size distribution ( @xmath5 = @xmath73.57@xmath80.73 ) . \n for the two remaining galaxies no hii region lf could be built . \n none the less , the h@xmath0 images show interesting features . \n ngc 88 , apart from the bulk of emission stemming from its central part , shows h@xmath0 emission in two plume - like features . \n ngc 89 , besides hosting a seyfert 2 nucleus , shows a ring of circumnuclear hii regions and two - sided extraplanar h@xmath0 emitting features , including a jet - like structure with a projected length of @xmath13 4 kpc whose nature is yet to be established ( fig . \n [ lf_scg0018 ] ) . \n this extremely dense , low velocity dispersion compact group is composed by two actively star - forming spirals and one lenticular galaxy with a small amount of central star formation @xcite . \n a @xmath13 29 kpc - long tidal tail hosts a number of candidate proto - tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite . as shown in the h@xmath0 map ( fig . \n [ hamap ] ) reconstructed from integral field spectra obtained at the aat 3.9 m telescope ( see temporin , staveley - smith , &  kerber 2004 for a detailed description and analysis of the data set ) , the star formation activity is spread all across the group , with as much as 31 per cent of the entire h@xmath0 emission stemming from the long tidal tail . \n such an activity is clearly related to the undergoing merging process . \n the velocity field of the ionized gas ( fig . \n [ vfield ] ) helps constraining the group dynamics and favours the idea of a prograde - retrograde @xmath15 200 myr - old encounter between the two spiral galaxies . while the estimated age of the tidal tail well agrees with the burst age of the two spiral galaxies , the knots in the tidal tail show evidence of more recent star formation events ( < 10 myr ) , supporting the idea that the condensations of gas and stars have formed under the action of self - gravity within the tail \n all three systems , although in different phases of interaction , present a clear enhancement of star formation , which appears related to the interaction process . \n this suggests encounter geometries favouring the onset of bursts of star formation @xcite . \n the slopes of the hii region lfs mostly agree with the expectations for the relevant morphological types ( kennicutt et al . \n 1989 ) , although some peculiarities are present . \n our main results on the individual systems are listed below .    _ \n am 1238 - 362 . \n _ the distribution of hii regions across the disks of the two face - on members seems related to the interaction . \n their hii region lfs , presented here for the first time , considerably differ from one another , although the size distributions do not . \n the shift of the lf of tol 1238 - 36.4 towards high luminosities is possibly a consequence of the interaction process . in this system \n we do not observe the tendency suggested by frattare , keel , &  laurikainen ( 1993 ) for interacting galaxies to have flatter hii region lfs than normal galaxies . \n candidate intergalactic hii regions have been identified in the space between the galaxies , however , spectroscopic confirmation is needed . \n no obvious correlation is found between the position of these sources and the distribution of hi @xcite . \n _ scg 0018 - 4854 . _ \n all five galaxies show active star formation . a preliminary analysis of the hii region lfs of three members of this compact group \n do show some peculiarities , especially a considerable flattening of the lf of ngc 92 at the high luminosity end . \n a certain amount of flattening could be caused by blending of hii regions , an effect that might become important at a distance of 45 mpc . \n however , since such an effect was not observed in the other galaxies of the group , nor in am 1238 - 362 ( located at similar distance ) , we exclude this as the only reason for the observed flattening . \n we plan to investigate separately the lfs of the regions located in the tidal tail and in the galaxy body , where they are organized in circumnuclear rings . \n two of the galaxies appear to have hii region size distributions steeper than expected , given the observed lfs . \n possible reasons for this effect are yet to be investigated . \n _ cg j1720 - 67.8 . \n _ in this dense system , the merging process is undoubtedly responsible for the ubiquitous star formation and the formation of ( candidate ) proto - tidal dwarf galaxies . \n the velocity field of the ionized gas , besides helping to constrain the interaction history of the group , shows an interesting feature , i.e. a @xmath13 5 kpc offset of kinematic center with respect to the photometric center of the central spiral galaxy , in north - west direction along its kinematic minor axis ( temporin et al . 2004 ) . \n we speculate that this might hint at the presence of a common dark matter halo in the system .    in this work we made use of the hiiphot algorithm available at the ftp site : ftp://ftp.aoc.nrao.edu / staff / dthilker / hiiphot_code/. st acknowledges financial support by the european southern observatory and is grateful for hospitality at the eso -

canonical khler potential was introduced in ref . \n we would like to briefly review essential points of our model . here \n we focus on the quark sector . \n @xcite for the successful extensions to the lepton sector , including neutrino masses and mixing .    in the quark sector \n , there are a product of permutation symmetry groups @xmath1 . under @xmath2 , the doublet quarks @xmath3 ( @xmath4 2 , 3 ) transform as 3 dimensional representation , @xmath5 , which is decomposed into two irreducible representations : @xmath6 . \n here @xmath7 is a trivial representation and @xmath8 is two dimensional one . \n in fact , @xmath9 does not change under the permutation . \n the other two combinations will constitute a basis of @xmath8 . \n similar arguments can apply for @xmath10 singlet quarks @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in the following \n we consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to illustrate our points , and use the terminology of supersymmetry , such as khler potential and superpotential . \n supersymmetry is , however , not essential for our subsequent argument .    to begin with \n we will develop some formalism . \n let us introduce a @xmath5 representation , @xmath13 , which will be identified with three families of the mssm matter fields later . \n the @xmath0 invariant khler potential is written @xmath14_{ij } x^\\dag_i x_j ,     \\label{eq : kahler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 reflecting the fact that the above khler potential is a bilinear function of @xmath13 , there arise two invariants : the universal matrix @xmath16 and the democratic matrix @xmath17 . here \n @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of fields in general and we omit terms which have no relation to mass matrices . \n we assume that some dynamics fixes vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , @xmath20 existence of the democratic part @xmath21 plays an essential role in our arguments . \n in fact , the non -

handed quark doublets @xmath60 , the charge - conjugated right - handed up - type quarks @xmath61 and the charge - conjugated right - handed down - type quarks @xmath62 exist . \n the up - type yukawa coupling matrix and the down - type one are diagonalized as @xmath63 respectively . \n the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 one finds that the small @xmath0 breaking parameters induce small mixing angles . notice that our model naturally includes the model discussed in ref . \n @xcite , where non - universal kinetic terms are absent . \n we can express the ckm matrix elements in terms of the mass eigenvalues . \n the cabibbo angle is determined solely by the observed values as @xmath66 this fritzsch relation have been known to be successful @xcite . \n @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 notice that in eq . \n ( [ eq : ckm ] ) values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are almost fixed by the empirical masses as @xmath73 ( see eqs . \n ( [ eq : masses ] ) and ( [ eq : ulr ] ) ) . \n thus , parameters determined from @xmath67 and @xmath74 are @xmath75 and @xmath76 . \n @xmath77 does not play an essential role . \n let us perform crude estimation before making numerical analysis , elucidating the importance of unusual structure of kinetic terms . for the present , we adopt the following representative values : @xmath78 taking into account that @xmath79 the area where @xmath80 itself is close to @xmath81 is preferable . from the constraint @xmath82 \n one finds that the most favorable range is @xmath83 and @xmath84 we discard the case where @xmath85 since rather large @xmath80 is demanded . combining this inequality ( eq . \n ( [ eq : x ] ) ) with the constraint @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n thus , we conclude that considerably suppressed @xmath76 is necessary in order that our @xmath0 model with the diagonal breaking matrices explains the empirical masses and mixings . recalling that @xmath90 this conclusion highlights a possibility that extremely large top mass is attributed to singular structure of normalization of the fields in the case of small @xmath91 . \n put another way , we draw a plot of the allowed value of the top quark mass @xmath92 as a function of @xmath76 when the other quantities are fit with their experimental values as above . \n the allowed region is depicted in fig . [ \n fig : mt ] . \n one finds that the allowed top mass is rather sensitive to the choice of @xmath76 . \n it is interesting to observe that the case of universal kinetic terms examined in ref . \n @xcite is completely ruled out and thus the inclusion of the singular normalization with extremely small @xmath76 is essential to make the model realistic . \n we now exhibit numerical analysis based on the diagonal breaking matrices . for simplicity we set @xmath93 , which does not alter our conclusion . \n the following parameter set , @xmath94 reproduces mass eigenvalues @xmath95 and magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements @xmath96 which should be compared with the experimental data evaluated at the @xmath97-boson mass scale @xcite . \n we have made the comparison at the @xmath97-boson mass scale . \n the same conclusion that extremely small @xmath76 is required holds even if we made this comparison at the gut scale in the mssm , though the value @xmath76 itself is different . \n this is because the effect of running comes from the top yukawa coupling , which appears in the wave - function renormalization of the top quark in supersymmetry . \n although we have so far supposed that the parameters which are responsible for quark masses and mixing angles are real , the observed @xmath98 asymmetry can be also explained in this framework by taking complex @xmath53 and @xmath52 . \n in this paper , we have pointed out the possibility that the wave function normalization of the top quark can be singular , which makes it very heavy . \n we have illustrated this in the framework of the democratic fermion ansatz . there \n the fermion mass structure is controlled by the @xmath0 permutation symmetries , with diagonal breaking introduced . in this case \n , we can make even a stronger statement : the singular normalization is essential to reproduce the top quark mass and the other quark masses as well as their mixing . \n this investigation presented here is indeed based on a particular form of the @xmath0 breaking . however , we emphasize that the large top quark mass can be realized by invoking singular structure of the corresponding kinetic terms . \n this argument is irrespective of the form of the @xmath0 breaking matrices . \n this new idea of highly different normalization of fields can save theories in which yukawa couplings would otherwise be suppressed and thus would fail to reproduce the large top mass . \n examples include    * brane - world scenarios in which quark and/or higgs fields propagate in the bulk . in this case \n yukawa coupling constants in four dimensions are volume - suppressed by some powers of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the compactification scale and @xmath101 the fundamental one ; * @xmath102 guts . \n an attractive feature of the @xmath102 guts is that the mssm higgs doublets can arise as pseudo - goldstone multiplets @xcite . \n a natural extension to @xmath102 from @xmath103 suggests to introduce @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 as quarks and leptons , and @xmath107 and @xmath105 as higgs multiplets . \n however with these matter contents one can not write down @xmath102 invariant yukawa couplings for up - quark masses at the renormalizable level . \n up - type yukawa couplings arise from non - renormalizable operators and are suppressed by powers of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 represents the gut scale . \n thus one conventionally introduce * 20 * to obtain the large top yukawa coupling . \n our mechanism of the yukawa enhancement due to the singular wave - function normalization , however , may allow us to construct a simpler model without introducing the * 20 * multiplet .    throughout this paper \n , we have assumed that the singular normalization for the top quark is realized by some means , but we have not specified a possible mechanism . \n a particularly interesting possibility is that the singular normalization is realized dynamically associated with , for example , the electroweak symmetry breaking . \n although a naive inspection suggests that one needs a very flat potential for a field responsible for the wave - function normalization , which is thus unlikely , further study along this line is interesting and should be encouraged . \n this work was supported in part by the grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan , no.12047201 . \n mk thanks the japan society for the promotion of science for financial support .", "StartTimeOffset": 365730927990, "RequestID": "62c47232314a8f8cb84ba8deac88286748e27f01", "TotalTokens": 3139}

scale mfv - scenario . on the technical side \n the analysis of the effective field theory boils down to the classification of invariants of discrete su(3 ) subgroups . \n replacing the continuous flavour symmetry with a discrete flavour symmetry requires the following additional information or assumptions : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a discrete groups . \n the three families transform under a 3d irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath19 , which has to be specified since some groups have more than one ( modulo the complex conjugate ) . \n the yukawa expansion linear mfv versus @xmath20 non - linear mfv where resummation ( non - linear @xmath21-model techniques ) become imperative . ] allows higher dimensional operators to be controlled , which otherwise give rise to rather anarchic flavour transitions @xcite . \n the effective lagrangian , in the absence of the knowledge of the dynamics of the underlying model , is parametrized as , @xmath22 the sum of all combinations invariant under @xmath23 . \n the dimension of the operator ( invariant ) brings in a certain hierarchy in the infinite sum above with the scale of new physics is generally obscured by loop factors , mixing angles and renormalization group effects as in any bottom - up effective field theory approach . ] . \n the crucial technical point is that _ finding the invariants is equivalent to finding the constant tensors of the symmetry group_. let us here introduce the following ( standard ) notation for tensors : an index transforming under a @xmath24 or @xmath25 representation shall be denoted by lower and upper indices respectively @xmath26 non - constant tensors will be denoted by @xmath27 . in principle this tensor classification is not sufficient for our general problem since there are three different group factors . \n it will though prove sufficient here to contract the other indices invariants and those groups are not of interest to us anyway . ] . \n we therefore contract the @xmath28 index and directly write @xmath29 the subscript @xmath30 shall be dropped when there is no reason for confusion . in the reminder we shall use the following notation : @xmath31 the following operator classification @xmath32 directly connects to the mfv operators @xcite @xmath33 before entering into the realm of invariants \n let us briefly discuss the discrete su(3 ) subgroups . \n the discrete su(3 ) subgroups were classified a long time ago @xcite and further analysed as alternatives to su(3)@xmath34 in the context of the eightfold way @xcite . \n explicit representations and clebsch - gordan coefficients were systematically worked out in a series of papers around 1980 @xcite , partly motivated as alternatives to @xmath35 for lattice qcd ; and further elaborated very recently @xcite in the context of family symmetries . \n the discrete su(3 ) subgroups are of two kinds . \n the analogues of crystal groups , of which we list here the maximal subgroups : @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 . \n the factor @xmath36 can in general either be one or three depending on whether the center of su(3 ) is divided out or not . \n for the maximal subgroups it is three . \n the second kind are the infinite sequence of groups , sometimes called `` dihedral like '' or `` trihedral '' , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 . \n the symbol `` @xmath40 '' denotes a semidirect product . \n the largest irreps of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are 3- , respectively 6-dimensional ; independent of @xmath43 .    that the catalogue of @xcite as compared to @xcite is not complete already surfaced in the 1980 @xcite and it has recently been reemphasized @xcite that the so - called @xmath44-groups @xcite have not been discussed systematically in the literature . in appendix \n @xcite we argue that the @xmath44-groups , or more precisely the six - parameter @xmath45 matrix groups , are subgroups of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the lowest common multiple of @xmath43 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . \n this is sufficient for our consideration .      in discussing invariants \n we are going to use the fact , based on the orthogonality theorem , that the number of times the identity appears in a kronecker product @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath51 , is equal to the number of invariants that can be formed out of the irreps @xmath52@xcite . \n + * new invariants @xmath53-level  no @xmath54 : * the problem of finding all invariants of the @xmath4 operator is equivalent to finding the invariants of the following kronecker product : @xmath55 . \n the symbol @xmath56 stands for the symmetric part . \n the restriction to the symmetric part can be justified by first considering the tensor products of the yukawas and the quarks separately . \n the logic that we shall employ is that if the kronecker product of the @xmath57 decomposes any different from su(3 ) then there are necessarily further invariants . \n the following kronecker products will prove sufficient to convey our argument : @xmath58 the two equations above make it evident that a necessary condition for an identical decomposition is that the discrete group contains a 27d irrep . \n the trihedral groups @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not in this category since their largest irreducible representations ( irreps ) are at most 3- , respectively 6-dimensional . going through the character tables in @xcite and \n the more recent work @xcite we realize that there is _ no _ discrete subgroup of su(3 ) which has a 27d irrep ! note , on even more general grounds that @xmath59 almost saturates the relation between the order of the group and the sum of the dimension of its irreps squared @xcite and leaves @xmath60 as the only hypothetical candidate among the crystal - like groups . \n + * no new invariants @xmath61-level for four groups : * the good news is though that the four crystal - like groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 do have representations that decompose as and are going to be interesting under the technical assumption of `` family irreducibility '' to be discussed below . here \n we shall give an overview of the number of complex conjugate 3d irreps and the number of invariants ( under certain symmetrizations ) :    .__number of invariants for tensors of type @xmath62 , whose definition can be inferred from eq .  . \n the subscripts @xmath63 indicate symmetrizations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 pairs of @xmath66 indices . @xmath67 and \n @xmath68 correspond to the ( symmetric ) contractions of @xmath5 and @xmath69 in . \n _ _ [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that we implicitly stated that there are groups where @xmath69 operators are possible with @xmath61 solely ; without any yukawa transitions . \n the group @xmath70 is an example which is discussed in appendix a of reference @xcite . \n it is argued , with concrete examples , that new invariants necessarily upset the flavour hierarchy of mfv @xcite . in particular \n the breaking of the continuous flavour group down to a discrete group implies that the mass - flavour basis transformation become observable and deprive the approach of its predictivity . to conclude , that the necessity of new invariants at the @xmath53-level and its connection with the well - tested @xmath4 transitions , imply that no discrete flavour group is suitable appears too hasty . \n the generation mechanism of @xmath4 operators has to be reflected upon . \n we distinguish the two cases where the @xmath69 process is generated via two subsequent @xmath5 parts and where this is not the case . \n we shall call the former `` family irreducible '' and the latter `` family reducible '' , c.f . fig . \n [ fig : deltaf12 ] . \n the sm and the r - parity conserving mssm are examples of the `` family reducible''-type whereas the r - parity violating mssm is of the `` family irreducible''-type . \n the composite technicolor model @xcite , in the absence of the knowledge of its non - perturbative dynamics , have to be counted into the latter class as well . \n `` family reducability '' essentially implies @xmath71 factorization of the invariant and proves to be a _ sufficient _ condition for a discrete tev - scale scenario for the four crystal - like groups listed in tab . \n [ tab : candidates ] . to this end \n we would like to discuss two further points :    * @xmath72 model - independent : the most suitable candidate , for a tev - scale dmfv scenario is @xmath72 , since the first new invariants appear only at the @xmath53-level c.f . \n tab  [ tab : candidates ] . yet : _ how small does @xmath73 need to be in order for @xmath74 to satisfy the same kind of experimental bounds as for @xmath75 found in reference @xcite ? _ the discussion in section 5.1 @xcite suggests that @xmath76 could be induced at first order in @xmath77 for new invariants , as compared to order @xmath78 in mfv . \n a @xmath79 transition could therefore be @xmath80 as compared to @xmath81 in mfv . according to our reflection above we have to balence : @xmath82 . \n * it has to be kept in mind that even when a model is in the `` family irreducible''-class , the fact that the vertices are @xmath23-invariant prevents the generation of non factorizable @xmath53-invariants . \n we argue that this is indeed the case for the r - parity violating mssm ( at least to leading order ) @xcite . \n our aim , in this work , was to point out general issues of implementing mfv via a discrete group . \n we would hope that this work would be of some help for further investigations towards more specific models . \n it also has to be said that although mfv has very attractive features , e.g. a sufficiently stable proton in the r - parity violating mssm @xcite , so far no explicit model for mfv has appeared in the literature . \n moreover the formulation could be refined by constructing a discrete subgroup of @xmath11 which does not factor into direct products of su(3 ) subgroups @xcite . \n one might wonder what the consequences are , of such a non - trivial embedding , for the invariants . \n * acknowledgements : * rz would like to thank many colleagues for inspiring discussions and remarks and at last i would like to thank the organizers if the kazimierz workshop for the organization and a very pleasant atmosphere . \n rz acknowledges the support of an advanced stfc fellowship . \n s.  dimopoulos , h.  georgi and s.  raby , phys . \n b * 127 * ( 1983 ) 101 . \n g.  dambrosio , g.  f.  giudice , g.  isidori and a.  strumia , nucl . \n b * 645 * ( 2002 ) 155 [ arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 2744, "GeneratedTokens": 151, "SynthesizedBody": "the extreme universe space observatory on board the jem exposure facility of the iss ( jem  euso ) is a detector concept for the study of uhecrs @xcite . \n this mission focuses on the spectrum above 5 @xmath0 ev where the flux is extremely low and the required detector areas are extremely large . \n the detector consists of a wide fov ( @xmath1 30 deg ) downward  looking uv camera orbiting at 400 km altitude which monitors a @xmath2 @xmath3 km@xmath4 area of atmosphere . \n euso aims at the detection of the fluorescence light emitted by eas in the atmosphere ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . \n in such a way we can reconstruct the direction , energy and x@xmath5 of the showers at the most extreme energies . \n the identification of the direction of arrival jointly with a proper energy reconstruction is mandatory for anisotropy studies , while the possibility to measure the longitudinal profile of the shower is needed to constrain the average mass at 10@xmath6 ev . \n another big advantage of this technique with respect to ground based detectors is the uniformity of the sky coverage : jem  euso at 400 km can orbit every 90 minutes the entire earth covering both hemispheres with good uniformity . \n the main scientific objectives of the project are : the study of the anisotropies at the extreme energies with unprecedented statistics , the identification of the sources ( and possibly the reconstruction of their spectra ) and the high statistics measurement of the trans  gzk spectrum @xcite . \n we define moreover several other exploratory objectives : the search of uhe neutrinos , the search of uhe gamma photons and the study of the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields through the measurement of the magnetic point spread function of a source . \n the nature of the detector allows also to study other phenomena like tles , lightnings , the airglow , auroras , meteors , space debris , bioluminescence in the oceans and to search ( or put limits on the flux of ) hypothetical phenomena like nuclearites . \n jem  euso is a refractor consisting of a system of 3 fresnel lenses focusing the light on the focal surface @xcite . \n the focal surface is made by @xmath2 5000 multi anode photomultipliers ( mapmt ) produced by hamamatsu ( r11265m64 ) capable of single photon counting with a double pulse resolution of the order of @xmath2 10 ns . \n the chosen pmt is 2.7 cm side and has 64 pixels each of 3 @xmath7 3 mm . \n four mapmts are organized in the so called elementary cells ( ec ) while 2 ecs ie . \n a block of 6@xmath76 mapmts is making a photo detection module ( pdm ) . \n the electronics is modular in order to guarantee high redundancy and organized in several levels : the spaciroc asic for the front end electronics , an fpga for the pdm  level electronics , the cluster control board and the central cpu . \n the front end electronics counts the photoelectrons within a gate time unit ( gtu ) window of 2.5 microseconds \n . the trigger is organized hierarchically and has the challenging task to reduce the trigger rate from @xmath2 100 gb / s down to the 3 gb / day allowed by the telemetry , still keeping the physical events . \n the high complexity and risk of this mission demands the development of several pathfinders . \n we will present here all of them : euso  ta \n which is taking data at the black rock mesa ( brm ) site of the telescope array ( ta ) observatory , the euso  balloon ( operated by cnes ) which flew in august 2014 , euso  spb which is foreseen to fly in spring 2017 on a nasa super pressure balloon ( spb ) to detect crs and finally mini  euso , the first space prototype to be launched on the iss within 2017 , whose main goal is to measure the airglow and several atmospheric phenomena visible from space . to conclude \n , we will present the k  euso detector , which is capable of doing uhecr science from space and is foreseen to fly on the iss by the year 2020 . \n euso  ta is a pathfinder of the jem \n euso detector @xcite which is taking data at the brm site of the ta observatory in utah ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] ) . \n this detector consists of two square fresnel lenses which measure @xmath2 1 m side and a single pdm of @xmath2 16 cm side . \n the detector is pointing to the sky , overlapping with the ta field of view . \n each of the 2304 pixels is covering @xmath2 0.18@xmath70.18 degrees@xmath8 . \n the elevation of the telescope can be changed from 0 to 25 degrees . \n the purpose of this pathfinder is the detection of crs in coincidence with ta . \n the trigger signal of ta is therefore used as an external trigger and the acquisition of a packet of 128 gtus is started in coincidence with the ta trigger . \n ta is detecting in this way several cr events ( one example in fig . \n [ fig4 ] ) . \n another purpose was the calibration of the detector , also relative to ta . \n we used the ta central laser facility ( clf ) and other dedicated mobile laser sources to test the technology with events reproducing the kinematics of cr events . \n the laser is shot up in the sky and the scattered light was detected by euso \n ta in such a way as to mimic the signal of a cosmic ray shower . \n we also used flashers , flat screens , leds to perform a complete characterization of the instrument . \n ev . the event is falling 2.6 km away and euso \n ta sees with magnified resolution a part of the shower.,width=245 ]    we also detected meteors , lightnings , planes and clouds and therefore we tested the detection and the analysis of such events for jem  euso . \n ta detector could be also used to develop the jem \n euso autonomous trigger . \n indeed euso \n ta data have been used offline to test and optimize the trigger algorithms . as a further step , \n the pdm board with the autonomous trigger was installed on the euso \n ta detector and the trigger has been tested online on laser events . \n the trigger performances are compliant with the expectations . \n euso  balloon is a cnes stratospheric balloon pathfinder of the jem \n euso mission , which flew on august 25@xmath9 2014 from timmins canada ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) . \n the purpose of this pathfinder was to test the jem \n euso technology in space environment and to test the response of the detector with respect to several artificial cr events @xcite . \n the detector consisted of a system of two square , 1 m side fresnel lenses and of a single pdm . \n the flight lasted one night and has successfully proven the capability of the detector to operate in stratospheric conditions ( 38 km altitude ) . \n unexpectedly the detector landed in water also proving the water tightness of the instrument . \n the fov was 8 @xmath7 8 km@xmath8 and each single pixel covered a projected area 120 @xmath7 120 m@xmath8 on the ground . \n the balloon covered the distance of roughly 100 km passing over different landscapes including forest lakes , cities , clear and cloudy sky . \n 2014 . in the box : the integrated image of a laser shot together with the flasher and led.,width=321 ]    during the flight the balloon was followed at 3,000 m altitude by an helicopter which was equipped with a flasher , a led and a laser to generate artificial light events ( see one example in fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . \n we could therefore detect several hundreds artificial events which were used to test the electronics . \n we used such data to test the algorithms for the reconstruction of the direction of the laser events @xcite . \n the rms of the angular reconstruction was estimated in @xcite to be few degrees . a map of the background in the uv range has been produced and is shown in fig . \n thanks to the present study we could give a preliminary estimate ( except the direct airglow component ) of the uv background which will be seen by jem  euso on orbit both in clear sky and cloudy conditions .          in spring 2017 the euso  spb prototype will be launched from wanaka , new zealand @xcite . \n the detector will consist of a system of two fresnel lenses of 1 m side and one single pdm . \n the balloon flight will make use of a super pressure balloon ( spb ) , a new technology currently developed by nasa . \n the test flights performed by nasa in 2015 and 2016 achieved a 32 and 45 days duration . \n the detector is assembled and currently ( feb . \n 2017 ) in new zealand in the launch preparatory phase . \n the detector has now to be fully autonomous and must therefore be provided with solar panels , rechargeable batteries , antennas for data and command transfer . \n the main objective of euso \n spb is the autonomous detection of cr events for the first time from above using the fluorescence technique . \n the electronics is therefore equipped with a fully autonomous trigger which has been already tested on the ta site in october 2016 . \n we show in fig . \n [ fig9 ] the image of a laser shot which autonomously triggered euso \n the collaboration estimated the expected rate of cr to be of the order of few events during the entire flight . \n mini  euso will be launched in 2017 and consists of a system of circular fresnel lenses and one single pdm to be accommodated inside the iss @xcite . \n the detector will be placed in the russian segment of the iss behind a uv  transparent downward  looking window and will monitor the atmosphere from 400 km height in the same condition as jem  euso \n . the main objective of this prototype is the measurement of the atmospheric uv emission from space . \n given the small diameter of the lens ( 25 cm ) , no detection of crs can be expected . despite that , \n the collaboration plans to use artificial sources ( with a luminosity equivalent to a 10@xmath10 ev cr ) as in the balloon missions in order to mimic a cr signal . \n other targets of the missions are the study of tles , meteors and auroras . \n we see in fig . \n [ fig10 ] the image of a simulated meteor . an interesting application of this prototype is the detection of space debris during twilight , which will fly on a lower orbit with respect to the iss . \n k  euso is the first large size detector being developed in the framework of the jem  euso project @xcite . \n the optical design follows a so  called schmitt optics , namely a combination of a mirror and of a corrector lens . \n the detector is exploiting the experience gathered in the jem  euso and the klypve collaborations . \n the detector is planned to fly in the early 2020s and to be attached to the russian section of the iss . \n the detector will be the first one capable of doing full scale uhecr science from space through fluorescence . \n we see in fig . \n [ fig11 ] the comparison between the exposure curves of several existing and planned detectors compared to k  euso . the main goal of this detector is the study of both small and large scale anisotropies , in particular the investigation of the ta hot spot , and of the differences between north and south hemisphere , thanks to its roughly uniform full sky coverage . \n this represents a major issue and challenge of the current research in the field of uhecrs . \n we gave a brief introduction to the jem \n euso program . \n all the pathfinders were presented and for the already existing ones a brief summary of their main results has been given . \n the collaboration is on its path for the development of space  based uhecr detectors . \n the capability of the jem  euso electronics to trigger cr  like events has been proven together with the technological readiness of the detector . \n the triggered events are used to develop the reconstruction of their direction . \n the response of the jem \n euso detector with respect to the background is being studied . \n the instrument is being calibrated with respect to ground based observatories . within 2017 \n the collaboration will perform autonomous fluorescence cr detection from balloon and a complete mapping of the uv background from space . \n such achievements will be useful to build a detector capable of detecting cr from space . \n k  euso should mark the first significant step , providing for the first time a full  sky coverage with a single instrument , with auger  like statistics in the gzk energy range .", "StartTimeOffset":

high granularity tracking system of 5 stations each with two detection planes ; a large warm dipole magnet ; a passive muon filter wall , followed by four planes of trigger chambers and a inner beam shield surrounding the beam pipe to protect the chambers from high particle flux at large rapidities . \n each tracking chamber provides two dimensional hit information by measuring the charge distributions on two segmented cathode planes . \n the cathode which has higher resolution in the direction ( y - direction ) perpendicular to the plane containing the magnetic field ( x - direction ) and beam axis ( z - direction ) is referred to as the bending cathode , while the other along the magnetic field is referred to as non - bending cathode . \n two tracking stations are placed before , one inside and two after the dipole magnet . \n the total number of readout pads is about 1.1 million and covers an area of about 100 m@xmath12 . \n the trigger system consists of four resistive plate chamber ( rpc ) planes arranged in two stations which are placed behind the muon filter . \n the trigger system has to select events containing a muon pair coming from the decay of j/@xmath3 or @xmath5 resonances from all possible background contaminations . \n the main background comes from low-@xmath13   muons of pion and kaon decays . \n thus , the l0 trigger is generated if at least two tracks with opposite charge ( or the same charge used in this case for background subtraction ) , both above a predefined @xmath13   cut are detected in an event . \n two different @xmath13   thresholds of 1 gev / c and 2 gev / c have been chosen for j/@xmath3 and @xmath5 measurement , respectively , according to simulation studies . \n however , the coarse grained segmentation of the rpcs and the presence of the iron wall before the trigger stations , do not allow a sharp @xmath13   cut . \n this is demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency ] ( bottom ) , through a simulation study carried out using the aliroot framework  @xcite . \n it is evident that the l0 trigger passes a substantial number of events which are below the @xmath13-threshold . \n in addition , the trigger efficiency is around 60% near the threshold value of 1 gev / c and 2 gev / c . \n thus , the primary task of the dimuon high level trigger ( dhlt ) is to refine the @xmath13   cut in order to increase its selectivity . for this purpose , in the addition to the trigger chambers , the slower but more accurate tracking chambers have been used and a real - time event reconstruction scheme for the entire muon spectrometer has been developed . \n this scheme should satisfy the following criteria :    \\(a ) the event processing should be done at a rate of 1 khz for pb - pb collisions ; ( b ) the real - time reconstruction should produce results of appreciable quality without losing any signal event ; ( c ) it should be robust and should not stop processing due to any data corruption in the input buffer . \n the event reconstruction in tracking chambers is a two step process , which involves the reconstruction of charge clusters and the track formation using the reconstructed hit points . in offline reconstruction , \n these two steps are implemented by mathieson fitting of the charge clusters which are defined by the nearest neighbour algorithm and kalman filtering , respectively . however \n , none of them can be applied for real - time reconstruction due to the time constrain set by the expected event rate of 1 khz . \n thus , new algorithms for fast reconstruction have been developed for dhlt  @xcite . \n these are described below . \n * hit - reconstruction : * : :    this new algorithm does not identify the charge clusters by nearest    neighbour search . instead , \n it searches for pads with maximum charge    whose immediate neighbours have nonzero charge . \n the two schemes are    equivalent since every cluster has an unique central pad whose charge    is greater than other members . once the central pads are identified ,    the hit positions along the bending and non - bending directions are    given by the centre of gravity of the charges measured on the central    pad and the two pads around it in y and x directions , respectively .    finally the information on bending ( y - direction ) and non - bending    ( x - direction ) cathodes are merged to generate hit position . \n * partial tracking : * : :    in the first attempt to improve the accuracy of the l0 trigger , the    trigger track segments are extended upto the fourth tracking    station  @xcite . \n the straight line tracks in the two tracking    stations after the magnetic field give a better    @xmath13   estimation than the value obtained from    the trigger tracks . \n the result of this improvement is shown in    fig . \n [ fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency ] ( bottom ) , by the solid lines which are    marked by ` hlt partial tracker ' . \n it is evident that there is a marked    improvement in accuracy over the l0 trigger , but the trigger    efficiencies at @xmath13   = 1 gev / c and 2 gev / c    are about 20% and the desired efficiency ( @xmath1490% ) is    achieved only around 1.5 gev and 2.5 gev , respectively . \n thus , this    method is not suitable for dhlt and the full tracking through the    magnetic field is essential . \n * full tracking : * : :    the full tracking formalism creates tracks from the last trigger    station to the first tracking station . \n various tracking stages has    been shown in fig . \n [ fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency](top ) . \n these are    described below . \n +    _ tracking in station 4,5 : _ ;

;      once the track segments are formed before and after the dipole      magnet , they are matched through the magnetic field using      @xmath15 test of kalman filtering  @xcite . \n if the track      segments are not matched , the @xmath13   of the      track is estimated as in the case of partial tracking . \n this ensures      that no physics event is lost in the full tracking scheme . \n _ track extrapolation : _ ; ;      in case of complete tracks , the @xmath13       estimation is further improved by incorporating the corrections due      to energy loss and multiple coulomb scattering in the front      absorber . \n the accuracy and efficiency of the @xmath13-cut for the full tracker is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency ] ( bottom ) , by the solid line marked as ` hlt full tracker ' and have been compared with the offline reconstruction . \n it can be observed from this simulation study that the estimated @xmath13 s of the muon tracks match closely with the offline analysis and the desired improvement of the l0 can be achieved . \n the framework of the full tracker was successfully implemented on the hlt computing farm and all the validation tests were completed before the pp collisions at @xmath0  tev data taking in march , 2010 .    in fig . \n [ fig : offline_hlt_trigger_cut ] , the effect of the @xmath13-cut from the offline analysis and from the real - time full tracker has been compared for pp ( `` real data '' ) collisions . \n the top and bottom panels of the figure show the invariant mass plot around the j/@xmath3 peak when the @xmath13   of one muon was found to be greater than 1 gev / c by the offline and online reconstruction , respectively . \n the invariant spectra are fitted with a gaussian signal and a double exponential functions . \n the width of the j/@xmath3 peak was found to be 93.8 and 95.5 mev / c@xmath12 for offline and hlt triggers , respectively . \n this shows that a sufficient accuracy of the @xmath16-cut for the full tracker is achieved . \n however , the counts in the j/@xmath3 peak for the offline reconstruction is higher by 7% with respect to the online reconstruction . \n this indicate a small inefficiency of the online trigger . \n studies are ongoing to correct this effect . \n it has been demonstrated both from simulation and data , that the hlt for the muon spectrometer is capable to improve the trigger momentum resolution of the tracks and validate the l0 muon candidates by a sharp @xmath13   cut . in the coming years of lhc operation , \n when the luminosity of the beams will reach its nominal values , the dhlt will play a crucial role in background rejection and allow the muon spectrometer to run at higher l0 trigger rates . \n in addition , it is estimated that the use of dhlt , with a loosening of the l0 @xmath13   cut , will allow recovering about 20% of the low-@xmath13   muon events .", "StartTimeOffset": 386255417046, "RequestID": "37fa68cb782631cc8b0bb164080a891018d35368", "TotalTokens": 2572}
{"ContextTokens": 3177, "GeneratedTokens": 272, "SynthesizedBody": "astronomy is basically an observational science , and the development and advancement of the subject has relied heavily on surveys of the sky at optical wavelengths to expand our knowledge of the observable universe . \n however despite the considerable advances in optical detector technology very little improvement has been made in large scale surveys beyond those available in the 1950 s when the palomar sky survey was carried out . \n a photographic plate taken on a 1.2-m schmidt telescope is sky limited in about 1 hour but is only 1 - 2% efficient . \n thus our current best wide field optical sky surveys are equivalent to no more that a @xmath060 second glance at the universe with modern ccds using a 1 m telescope . in spite of the inherent limitations of photographic plates , \n they are still used for major scientific programs . in recent years , this has been primarily due to the availability of online digital atlas images and catalogues based on these photographic material eg http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~apmcat , http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/.    in an effort to rectify this apparently dismal situation , and to provide necessary underpinning imaging requirements for the 8 m telescope era , the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope on lapalma is being used to carry out a series of wide field imaging programs under the generic title of the int wide field survey(wfs ) project . \n the wfs project consists of a series of independent survey programs with distinct aims as we outline below . \n the wfs project takes into account both surveys like sdss ( gunn & weinberg 1995 ) which also uses a 2.5 m telescope and has an exposure time of @xmath060 seconds , and other ccd based surveys such as those that are being carried out by noao ( http://www.noao.edu/ ) and eso ( http://www.eso.org/ , nonino etal 1999 ) . \n the unique elements of the int survey are : ( i ) optimal choice of fields so that most are easily visible from telescopes in both hemispheres ; ( ii ) inclusion of u band ; ( iii ) large area ( iv ) temporal information ; ( iv ) good overlapping coverage with existing deep radio surveys ie first , wenss ; ( v ) wide ra coverage optimised for efficient follow - up ; ( vi ) choice of sdss bandpasses for longevity . \n this article briefly describes the wide field survey ( wfs ) program . \n this is a peer reviewed survey program that aims to provide deep high quality ccd data to the community both quickly and in a convenient form . \n the concept of the wfs originated in 1991 within the context of the science case for a ccd mosaic for the isaac newton telescope . \n formal approval for the survey program began with a proposal to the ing board in october 1997 . \n the primary goal was to exploit the excellent capabilities of a recently completed ccd based mosaic that effectively filled the unvignetted focal plane of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( see figure  [ fig_wfc_geometry ] ) . \n the immediate aim was to carry out a major ccd based multi - colour survey in a timely fashion over a period of 45 years and allow instant and easy access to the processed data to facilitate its rapid scientific exploitation    the wfs proposal was approved by the ing board in october 1997 with a subsequent ` announcement of opportunity ' closing in march 1998 . \n conditions of solicitation included that the survey data is available to all uk and nl based astronomers in near real - time . \n raw data is typically available as taken , whilst the pipeline reduced data is available after one month . \n subsequently the raw and processed data is available to the rest of the astronomical community after one year . \n pipeline processing of the data is the responsibility of the cambridge astronomical survey unit(http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/ ) . \n a wfs international review panel approved three main programmes in the first year , allocating five \n six ` dark / grey ' weeks per semester to the wfs . in june 1999 a first year review carried out by patt and the international review panel confirmed the continuation of the first year wfs programmes into 2000 . \n the int wide field camera ( ives , tulloch & churchill 1996 , see also paper in these proceedings ) is mounted at the prime focus(f/3 ) of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope on la palma , canary islands . \n the camera consists of a close packed mosaic of 4 thinned eev42 2kx4k ccds . \n the layout is shown in figure  [ fig_wfc_geometry ] . \n the ccds have a pixel size of 13.5 microns corresponding to 0.33  /pixel . the edge to edge limit of the mosaic neglecting \n the @xmath01 inter - chip spacing is 34.2. in normal survey mode we use a step size in ra and dec of 30 and 20 respectively . \n this provides @xmath010% overlap on all edges and means that the partially vignetted chip is overlapped completely to aid photometric calibration . \n .nominal photometric limits in 1 arcsec seeing for int wide angle survey [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes : the exposure times per band vary between these field see the wfs www page for further details . \n also , in some fields the was program has added wavebands to those obtained by the original pis . @xmath2 the actual filters may be different eg kpno b or harris v etc . \n the main science programmes chosen include a ` wide shallow ' programme , a smaller deep area programme , and a programme to address temporal variability . \n the specific programs are described briefly below :      this is the largest approved programme approved and includes sub - projects ranging from determination of cosmological parameters ( via sn type ia ) to searches for solar system objects . \n the underlying philosophy of the was survey is encompassed in table  [ table_was_science_themes ] where we summarise the time requirements of over 20 topical scientific programs . \n if all these programs were carried out under the normal pi s based time allocation procedures the total on - sky time required is almost 600 nights . \n however , if the programs are combined they can be executed in around 100 nights . by merging the requirements of the various programs we end up with a highly efficient observing strategy . \n an important aspect of the reduced time requirements is that the projects will also be executed quickly . \n the limiting magnitudes and wavebands being used are summarised in table  [ table_was_nominal_limits ] . \n figure  [ fig_int_ao_gal_mags ] shows how these limits transform onto the observational plane for extragalactic studies . \n the main survey region are listed in table  [ table_was_major_survey_regions ] . \n a number of smaller regions are also being surveyed as determined by calibration requirements and the observing schedule . \n in addition , we are adding bands to other programs so that we can increase the areal coverage of multi - colour data at low cost . \n these fields are listed in table  [ table_was_supplemental_survey_regions ] . \n the was program is the umbrella programme for the wfs project and leads the coordination efforts with the other programmes on , for instance , field and filter selection , to maximise scientific return of the wfs project . \n all programs remain autonomous during this procedure so that the peer reviewed science goals are protected . \n some of the science goals of the was are outlined below :    @xmath3 * galactic studies : * including both halo and disk white dwarf luminosity function which are relevant to both dm models and to independent calibrations of the hubble time ; stellar density distributions towards the ngp , to improve extant k@xmath4 determinations of the local dm ; stellar counts towards the anti - centre and other widely spaced directions , to determine the stellar warp and refine models of galactic structure    @xmath3 * clusters of galaxies : * the aim is to determine the space density and cluster - cluster correlation function over the range 0.5@xmath5z@xmath51.0 . \n galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally - bound structures in the universe , and the study of their abundance and evolutionary history with look - back - time places strong constraints on cosmological parameters and the primordial power spectrum that gave rise to the observed large scale structure . \n @xmath3 * radio sources & radio galaxies : * deep optical identification of radio sources allows : accurate counts of different types of host along mjy tracks in the p - z plane , studies of radio source luminosity evolution ; multi - band investigation of giant - e standard candles ; the largest known sample of low - luminosity rgs with good photometry ; large - scale structure from photometric redshifts and cell counts in redshift slices ; accurate optical positions of first sources for wyffos/2df followup . \n @xmath3 * intermediate redshift type 1a supernovae : * whilst dramatic progress has been made in the determination of the fundamental cosmological parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in the last two years , the analysis is now limited by systematic errors . \n identifying @xmath020 type 1a supernovae in the critical range 0.1@xmath5z@xmath50.4 will allow a detailed treatment of these systematic errors . \n the was also incorporates two independent distinct science programmes in the spring semester centred on virgo and the north galactic pole . \n in fact , in the proposal submission procedure many co - i s of the was program submitted discrete proposals .    * * a multicolour survey of the virgo cluster : pi , davies * this aims to obtain the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) of the virgo cluster as a function of colour and position in the cluster . * * the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) : pi , driver * the mgc will provide a complete and local galaxy catalogue . \n this survey is being carried out in the b band and lies in a region of sky covered by the 2df redshift survey \n .      this programme is carrying out deep imaging of 10 deg@xmath1 to a limiting magnitude of b=26 and i=24.5 . \n it will enable the study of the evolution of galaxy clustering as a function of colour at faint magnitudes and provide a catalogue of rich galaxy clusters at intermediate red shifts . \n this programme is searching an area of @xmath010 deg@xmath1 , studying photometric and astrometric variability on scales of one hour to a year to a magnitude of v=25 . \n example areas of investigation include : the evolution of specific galactic populations ( e.g. cv s , rr lyraes , halo agb stars , brown & white dwarfs , kuiper - edgeworth belt objects , sdb stars ) , the structure of the galactic halo , statistics of optical transients related to @xmath8-ray bursts , and deep proper motion studies . \n in order to maximise the scientific value of the wfs data the was survey is concentrating on fields that are equatorial and hence follow - up can be carried out from telescopes on both hemispheres . \n this simple consideration doubles the scientific return of the survey . \n we also deliberately centred some of the fields on landolt photometric calibration fields ie sa95 and sa114 . \n the choice of photometric wavebands was relatively straight forward . \n we decided to use bands similar to the sdss bands(fukugita etal , 1996 ) . \n note our u and z bands are not identical to the sdss bands . \n see the wfs www pages for further details . \n the choice of the sdss bands means that the int surveys will be directly comparable with work carried out as part of the sdss . \n interestingly , the sdss g band is very close to the ukst @xmath9 band . \n however , manufacturing delays have meant that we had to start the survey using the standard int filter set . \n survey data is being obtained on a monthly basis and thus a summary of the data obtained will soon be out of date . \n a complete summary of observations obtained is kept on - line at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~wfcsur/status . \n the situation at the end of may 1999 was that @xmath060 deg@xmath1 had been observed in the first ten months of the survey . \n the data products currently available for access include :    * observing logs built from the fits headers * a sybase www user interface to access the raw and processed data * library bias frames , flatfield frames , defringing frames and non - linearity corrections * colour equations for all filters * processed 2d image maps , with a full record of processing steps in the fits headers * astrometric calibration , with the world coordinate system in the fits headers * photometric calibration  zero points and extinction    in the coming months the data products provided will be expanded after some quality control to include :    * object catalogues , generated using apm based routines ( irwin , 1985 ) and sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . \n further information about the int wide field imaging survey can be obtained at the isaac newton groups www page ( www.ing.iac.es/wfs ) or the uk mirror(www.ast.cam.ac.uk / ing / wfs ) . \n in addition , the wide angle survey has as a www page at www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rgm / int_sur/. further details of the pipeline processing are contained in a paper by irwin and lewis(these proceedings ) . \n the authors would like to acknowledge the unsung builders of the int wide field camera , the various peer review committee members who have guided the project since it inception in 1991 and the encouragement of their many colleagues during the long gestation period of the int wide field survey project . \n 999 bertin , e. , & arnouts , s . \n 1996 , a&a supp , 117 , 393 . \n fukugita , m. , ichikawa , t. , gunn , j. e. , doi , m. , shimasaku , k. , & schneider , d. p. 1996 , aj , 111 , 1748 . \n gunn , j.e . \n weinberg , d.h . \n , 1995 , ( astro -

order based calculation . improving the calculation with the next - leading evolution \n has yet to be done . while the suppression was predicted in the cgc approach , other postdictions later offered alternative descriptions . \n the idea is that the value of @xmath0 probed in the deuteron is so high that large-@xmath0 effects could be responsible for the suppression @xcite . \n this would not happen in @xmath27 collisions at the lhc , with a smaller @xmath28    while the cgc framework was quite successful in describing single inclusive particle production at forward rapidities , the focus should now shift towards more exclusive observables like two - particle production @xmath29 in particular the correlations in azimuthal angle between the produced hadrons should be suppressed compared to pp collisions @xcite . by contrast with single particle production , in two - particle production \n the cgc can not be described only by its unintegrated gluon distribution , the so - called @xmath30-factorization framework is not applicable . \n this means that more tests could be done , probing the cgc structure deeper . \n the second d+au run at rhic gives the opportunity to carry out such measurements . \n mueller -

to - back peak . \n finally , predictions for the total charged - particle multiplicity in aa collisions at the lhc are shown in fig.4 . \n two approaches are compared : in the first , @xmath30-factorization is assumed but the evolution of the unintegrated gluon densities is accurately obtained from the next - leading bk equation @xcite ; in the second , the x evolution is only parametrized but multiple scatterings are correctly taken into account by solving classical yang - mills equation @xcite . while full next - leading treatment of both multiple scatterings and small-@xmath0 evolution is desirable , the numbers obtained are similar , which indicates that the uncertainties in both approaches are under control .", "StartTimeOffset": 411954800058, "RequestID": "4300949209decd4725a3a0a7e3d8e894faa6fa99", "TotalTokens": 1937}

of - equilibrium caloric curve calculated using molecular dynamics and with the absolute minimum temperature curve . \n at variance with usual statistical models , the hmf model has also a kinetic term . thus in order to use the standard metropolis algorithm and calculate the caloric curve of the hmf model , we fixed the parameter @xmath38 , in this way the kinetic energy @xmath39 of the system of n rotators is fixed as well and remains constant for all the simulation . \n we started from initial conditions with all the angles equal to zero , i.e. @xmath40 . \n then , in the configuration @xmath24 , we changed the angle @xmath41 of a given small quantity ( choosen properly in order to satisfy the detailed balance condition ) , so that , in the new configuration @xmath26 , we have @xmath42 . \n we computed the corresponding variation @xmath43 in the potential energy and since @xmath44 we have @xmath45 . following the rule of eq . \n ( [ delta ] ) we finally accepted or not the new configuration . \n after a termalization transient , we started to compute the average energy density @xmath46 by means of eq.([identity ] ) . \n let us discuss in the following the numerical results obtained with this standard monte carlo algorithm . in fig.1,panels ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) , we plot metropolis simulations performed for a system of n=1000 rotators and three different values of temperatures . \n we considered in particular the values @xmath47 which are , respectively , below , near and above the phase transition crtitical temperature @xmath16 . \n after a transient time , the simulations converge to a plateau and fluctuate around an average value . \n we report in panels ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) the relative histograms with the average monte carlo values @xmath48 obtained . \n as expected , fluctuations are larger for temperatures close to the critical one .    in order to study finite size effects and fluctuations \n we discuss the evolution for different system sizes at a temperature just below @xmath49 . \n we considered the case @xmath50 which should correspond to the well known energy density @xmath51 . in fig.2 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we show the monte carlo evolution for this case for different sizes of the system . while fluctuations are quite consistent for @xmath52 , they diminish as expected with the size of the system . \n also the value to which the simulation finally converges gets closer to the theoretical prediction the bigger the size of the system . \n this is evident in panel ( d ) of the same figure where the values obtained for different numbers of rotators together with the relative standard deviations are plotted in comparison with the theoretical expected one .    finally , in fig.3 \n , we plot the average energy densities obtained with the monte carlo simulations for a wide range of temperature values . \n the monte carlo points are compared with the analytical canonical curve ( full curve ) corresponding to the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium @xcite . \n the agreement is very good for this energy size ( n=1000 ) . \n as expected at equilibrium , where ergodicity should be satisfied no anamalies are found . \n a similar results was obtained for microcanonical monte carlo simulations @xcite . on the other hand , as discussed in refs . \n @xcite , the origin of the anomalies is in the dynamics which induces frustration and nonergodicity for a transient time - before complete equilibration - which diverges with @xmath1 . in order to try to shed more light on these metastable states we modified the standard monte carlo algorithm as explained in the next section . \n we mentioned in the introduction that the so - called qss , i.e. the out - of - equilibrium metastable states that emerge from the microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations , become stationary in the thermodynamic limit and lie at temperature lower than the canonical equilibrium one . \n more precisely , up to @xmath0 , the qss points lie on the extension , in the condensed phase , of the high temperature line of the caloric curve ( this line is the geometric place of states with m=0 , maximum potential energy and minimum kinetic one ) . \n this means that the homogeneous quasi - stationary non - equilibrium states with zero magnetization should be stable only up to those limiting values , but not below . in a recent paper on the hmf model @xcite \n , the authors apply a nonlinear stability criterion ( a modification of that one originally proposed in ref . \n @xcite ) to a selected set of spatially homogeneous solutions of the vlasov equation , which describes the continuum limit of the hamiltonian mean field model . \n actually these solutions are qualitatively very similar to the zero magnetization qss arising from the microcanonical simulations with m1 initial conditions and also the results of the stability test found in @xcite were consistent with the numerical evidence of the disappearance of the homogeneous qss family below @xmath0 . + with the aim to study these anamalous states without using molecular dynamics tecniques , but only performing a sampling over the constant energy density hypersurface in phase space , we modified the standard mc metropolis algorithm adopted in section [ metropolis ] . \n our purpose was not that one of finding boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium configurations , on the other hand we wanted to select those out - of - equilibrium configurations which minimize the temperature ( i.e. the kinetic energy ) of the system at constant total energy , in order to look for homogeneous qss s close to the critical point and study their eventual stability . \n the problem is an optimization - like one , i.e. using a monte carlo procedure , one wants to find the states at minimal temperature with the constraint of total energy conservation . \n the new algorithm we have adopted obeys the following rules :    1 . \n it starts from initial conditions with fixed magnetization and momenta uniformly distributed . \n then randomly changes the momentum @xmath53 in the configuration @xmath24 so that @xmath54 ; thus , in the new configuration @xmath26 , one has @xmath55 2 . \n it computes the corresponding variation in the kinetic energy @xmath56= k+\\frac{1}{2 } \\pi^2 - \\frac{1}{2 } p_k^2~ \\longrightarrow\\ ] ] @xmath57 3 . \n then the @xmath58 configuration is @xmath59<r\\ ] ] @xmath60>r\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the usual random number chosen uniformly in the interval [ 0,1 ] ; 4 . \n finally , if the new configuration @xmath26 is accepted , it calculates the new value @xmath61 of the angle @xmath41 by means of the variation of the potential energy @xmath62 , knowing that @xmath63 \\label{v'}\\ ] ] and @xmath64 after some algebra , one finally obtains the following equation for @xmath61 @xmath65 where @xmath66 + the solutions of eq.([eq_theta ] ) are @xmath67 with @xmath68 thus , from eq.([theta ] ) , one can calculate the new value of the @xmath69th angle , taking into account the new constraints ( [ constr ] ) . \n then one can repeat the algorithm for the new configuration @xmath26 and so on , until the system reaches a stationary state . at this point , the desired expectation values ( in this case the temperature of the system at fixed energy density ) can be calculated by means of eq.([identity ] ) .      with this new monte carlo algorithm , we calculated a new out - of equilibrium caloric curve for the hmf model , which corresponds to those states with minimal temperature at constant total energy density . \n + in our simulations we consider n=1000 rotators and different initial conditions with uniform distribution of momenta and different initial magnetization varying from @xmath70 to @xmath11 @xcite ] . \n then we follow the system evolution until a stationary value of temperature has been reached for each energy density value considered . \n in fig.4 we show for example the temperature evolution in phase space for @xmath51 . \n the plot shows that , using this new optimization algorithm , the boltzmann - gibbs equibrium temperature @xmath71 is not a stable minimum , the curve for @xmath72 stays there for a while and then escapes to reach a deeper minimum . \n instead , as expected for this energy density , the most stable solution is always the temperature corresponding to the homogeneous qss @xmath73 , also reported in the figure . \n in fig.5 we plot the caloric curve obtained with this new monte carlo optimization approach ( full points ) . \n the bars reported indicate the size of the fluctuations . in comparison \n we show also the boltzmann - gibbs canonical equilibrium prediction ( full line ) and the metastable caloric curve found by means of molecular dynamics microcanonical simulations , performed for n=100000 with m1 initial conditions , in the qss regime ( open squares ) @xcite . \n it is helpful to divide the graph in three regions . \n + in region ( i ) , i.e. in the homogeneous high temperature phase , the three curves coincide . \n this means that in this phase the monte carlo optimization method is able to recover the expected canonical equilibrium curve . \n this is in agreement with the fact that here the total energy is essentially kinetic : the potential energy is constant and equal to its maximum value v / n=0.5 . \n + on the contrary , in region ( ii ) - i.e. between @xmath74 and @xmath0 - the monte carlo curve deviates from the canonical prediction , but coincides with the results of the molecular dynamics simulations in the qss regime . \n as in the previous region , here also the monte carlo temperature takes its minimum allowed value , consistently with the total energy constraint . \n this fact is interesting in order to understand the nature of the qss regime , which here corresponds to a stable attractor of the system when the magnetization ( and the force acting on the single spin ) is zero . \n we have checked that this result does not change with the number of spins considered . \n + below the value @xmath75 - just lower than the value ( @xmath51 ) where the qss dynamical anomalies and the disagreement with the canonical prediction are more evident - the monte carlo curve starts to disagree also with the molecular dynamics simulations . in fact , in the region ( iii ) , while the qss anomalies tend to disappear and the molecular dynamics curve slowly rejoins ( below @xmath76 ) the canonical boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium prediction , the monte carlo curve stays below the other two curves . \n however the monte carlo result does not correspond to the absolute minimum value of temperature . \n in fig.5 we report , for comparison , the curve ( dot - dashed ) corresponding to the a - priori absolute minimum value of kinetic energy . \n the monte carlo curve differs from such a minimal kinetic energy - which corresponds to @xmath11 - around the limiting value @xmath0 . \n this is a numerical confirmation of the instability of the homogeneous quasi - stationary states below this value as found in the nonlinear stability test of ref . \n + finally , it is interesting to observe that below the value @xmath76 , where the kinetic energy - and therefore the temperature - could also be null , the monte carlo curve lies roughly in the middle between zero and the equilibrium temperature values . \n this result is not fully understood and could be originated by a competition between the two unstable attractors in phase space . \n further investigations in this respect is required . \n in this paper we have presented a monte carlo study of the hmf model . in the first part of the paper by means of a standard metropolis procedure \n , we were able to reproduce the canonical caloric curve of the hmf model at equilibrium and study finite size effects close to the critical point where dynamical anomalies exist in the out - of - equilibrium regime . in the second part of the paper we studied out - of - equilibrium states by means of a monte carlo optimization technique . to this end , we have modified the standard metropolis algorithm , in order to obtain a temperature minimization at constant energy density and look for those states with minimal temperature , which are not boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium states . \n however in this way we could study those metastable homogeneous quasi stationary states found dinamically below the phase transition point . \n we found that these states are stable for energy densities greater than @xmath0 . for energy densities smaller than this value , the zero magnetization quasi - stationary states are not reached and a different caloric curve is obtained . \n these results confirm what found in @xcite by means of a nonlinear stability analysis where the authors suggest that this fact is due to the loose of stability of the spatially homogeneous solutions of vlasov equation . \n we hope that this work , supplying a non - dynamical point of view and adding new numerical results to the study of the hmf model , will be of help in sheding further light on the nature of the several intriguing aspects of this model . \n 0.25truecm we thank c. anteneodo , f. baldovin , v. latora and c. tsallis for stimulating discussions . \n we would like to dedicate this paper to constantino tsallis for his 60th birthday wishing him a still very long and fruitful research activity . \n for a recent review on this model see also : t. dauxois , v. latora , a. rapisarda , s. ruffo , a. torcini , in _ dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with long -

{"ContextTokens": 3498, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "rocks , especially igneous rocks , behave as semiconductors under certain conditions @xcite . \n although the magnetic fields produced by small semiconductors are often negligible , semiconductors on geophysical scales may produce significant magnetic fields . \n this is of particular interest since these fields can be observed at the earth s surface and they seem to indicate that rock is being stressed deep in the crust . \n ultra - low frequency ( ulf ) electromagnetic emissions have been observed prior to earthquakes @xcite , possibly resulting from electric currents flowing deep in the crust @xcite . \n low frequency fluctuations in the earth s magnetic field have been reported in the literature since at least 1635 @xcite . increased levels of magnetic fluctuations \n have been repeatedly observed prior to earthquakes since at least 1964 @xcite , but these transient phenomena have received relatively little attention and , as such , they are not yet fully understood \n .    observed pre - earthquake electromagnetic waves typically have frequencies between 0.01hz and 20hz , possibly owing to the fact that only low - frequency components may traverse tens of kilometers through the rock column . \n they have been independently observed prior to many earthquakes over the past 50 years @xcite . during the weeks leading up to the m=5.4 alum rock earthquake of oct . \n 30 , 2007 , a magnetometer located about 2 km from the epicenter recorded unusual non - alternating magnetic pulses , reaching amplitudes up to 30 nt @xcite . \n the incidence of these pulses increased as the day of the earthquake approached . \n a pair of magnetometer stations in peru recently recorded similar unipolar pulses prior to several medium - sized earthquakes , and triangulating the source of these pulses revealed the location of subsequent earthquake epicenters @xcite . \n the unipolar magnetic pulses observed prior to earthquakes have a characteristic shape similar to a gaussian that is attenuated over time . \n the unipolar nature of the magnetic pulses is somewhat unusual and bears resemblance to pulses produced by lightning and other electrical breakdown phenomena . \n however , the duration of many pre - earthquake pulses exceeds several seconds , much longer than any lightning strike . \n moreover , triangulation of such pulses near lima , peru revealed that strong pulses originated almost exclusively from locations within a few kilometers of future earthquake epicenters @xcite .    to model the electromagnetic phenomena associated with volumes of rock , we solve a three - dimensional drift - diffusion model of a semiconductor and calculate the magnetic fields induced by its electric currents . \n the model is seen to describe transient low - frequency unipolar magnetic pulses . \n we will show that unipolar pulses can emerge simply from the electrical drift and random diffusion of charge carriers in a semiconducting volume of rock . \n there are several reasons why this is a plausible mechanism for the observed pulses . \n large electrical currents are known to accompany earthquakes , occasionally so large that luminous effects known as earthquake lights@xcite become apparent . \n there is experimental evidence @xcite indicating that , during stressing , electrons and holes become activated in igneous rocks that subsequently behave as semiconductors . \n one proposed source of charge carriers in rock is the break - up of peroxy defects @xcite as a result of the increase in tectonic stresses . \n the oxygen sublattice of a wide variety of silicate minerals can form peroxy defects that act as sources of electron / hole pairs @xcite , causing these minerals to exhibit semiconductivity . once activated , highly mobile electronic charge carriers diffuse through the minerals . \n peroxy defects are point defects , typically introduced through the incorporation of @xmath0 into nominally anhydrous minerals that crystallize in @xmath0-laden magmas or recrystallize in high - temperature @xmath0-laden environments@xcite . \n the incorporation of @xmath0 into oxides and silicates leads to @xmath1 pairs that subsequently undergo redox conversion . \n the two @xmath2 of the @xmath1 pairs combine to form @xmath3 , and the @xmath4 ions bind to form a peroxy bond . \n the formation of these peroxy bonds has been extensively studied in laboratory experiments @xcite and treated by computational chemistry @xcite .    when peroxy bonds are energized via stresses in the rock or by heat \n , they may produce electron - hole pairs . \n the peroxy bond breaks , forming a transient state with two unpaired electrons . \n this is followed by a fully dissociated state in which a hole is free to move through the crystal structure . \n a neighboring oxygen atom donates an electron and becomes a hole , as its valence shell becomes deficient by one electron . \n the donated electron becomes trapped near the broken peroxy bond@xcite in a new state whose energy level is slightly below the upper edge of the valence band . in terms of the valence state , \n the neighboring oxygen atom , which was previously in an @xmath5 state , becomes @xmath6 . \n this oxygen anion in the 1- state is effectively a positive hole with an incomplete valence shell and could also be regarded as an unstable oxygen radical @xcite . \n holes are capable of propagating through the oxygen lattice , exchanging valence electrons by a phonon - assisted vacancy hopping mechanism @xcite . \n this process effectively constitutes a diffusion of @xmath6 holes through a lattice of @xmath5 atoms . \n the trapped electrons are immobile but participate through recombination and electrostatic interactions . \n the drift - diffusion equations are the most frequently used model for semiconductor physics , and perform well on scales greater than about 0.5 micrometers @xcite . \n they describe current in terms of charge carrier concentrations and an electrostatic field , and this determines the change in charge carrier concentrations via continuity of the current density . \n the drift - diffusion equations are : @xmath7    here , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are defined on a domain @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a subset of a 3-dimensional space . \n the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are concentrations of electron and hole charges , respectively , and @xmath12 is the charge of any dopant ions that are present . \n @xmath15 is the recombination / generation rate of electrons and holes . \n the third equation is poisson s law of electrostatics whose solution describes the electric potential @xmath11 . \n @xmath16 is the electric permittivity . \n the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mobilities of electrons and holes , respectively , ( not to be confused with the magnetic permeability @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding diffusion coefficients . in the particular instance of the model under consideration , \n @xmath17 and @xmath21 are approximately zero due to electrons becoming trapped in the valence band . \n maxwell s equations describe propagation at the speed of light , much faster than the charge carriers diffusing in a typical semiconductor . rather than modeling propagation on two very different time scales , we make use of the quasi - static ( magnetostatic ) approximation@xcite , assuming that currents do not alternate rapidly or approach the speed of light . \n specifically , the maxwell displacement current appearing in ampere s law is assumed to be negligible : @xmath23 . \n this assumption is implicit in the drift - diffusion model due to its use of poisson s equation for the static electrical potential . \n the electric current density @xmath24 acts as the source of a magnetic field . \n it may be expressed as the sum of a drift term , involving the electric field , and a diffusive term , involving the concentration gradient . \n the rate of change of the concentration then becomes a continuity equation that is a function of current density . explicitly separating the current and continuity equations facilitates coupling to the magnetic field . in this form , \n the current densities are : @xmath25    the continuity equations that describe the change in electron and hole concentrations are , then : @xmath26    the current densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are summed to obtain the total current density @xmath29 that acts as a source for the magnetic field . in a magnetostatic approximation , the solution to the magnetic field on a domain may be efficiently computed by solving a set of poisson equations for the magnetic vector potential . in this case , however , we calculate the field at an arbitrary point in space , which could be outside the domain . \n we apply the biot - savart law to obtain the magnetic field at the point @xmath30 : @xmath31    here , @xmath32 is the magnitude of the vector from @xmath30 to @xmath33 and @xmath19 is the magnetic permeability . \n the velocities of the holes are not sufficiently large for the lorentz force to be significantly influenced by magnetic fields so we do not conisder the effect of the magnetic field on the charge carriers . \n the drift - diffusion equations are solved by expressing the partial differential equations as a system of ordinary differential equations for the time derivatives @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a finite - difference approximation to this system \n is then integrated using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme ( rk4 ) . \n poisson s equation is solved separately at each timestep using successive over - relaxation@xcite ( sor ) with an adaptive relaxation parameter and open boundary conditions . for the other pdes , \n the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are applied to the boundary of a grid of uniformly spaced points representing the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 coordinates over which functions are evaluated . \n all spatial partial derivatives ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) of the current and continuity equations are approximated using a fourth - order central difference approximation .    at each timestep , \n the electric potential is determined by solving poisson s equation , starting the sor iteration with the electric potential from the previous timestep . using the electric potential and the charge carrier concentrations , the components of the current vector fields @xmath27 and \n @xmath28 are evaluated . from @xmath27 and @xmath28 , \n the continuity equations are integrated , yielding the concentrations of the charge carriers at the next timestep . \n the magnetic field @xmath45 is evaluated by applying a discretized biot - savart law to the currents . \n @xmath45 is calculated at each timestep but since the result does not affect the dynamics , it may be evaluated at a single point . \n since holes are mobile and electrons are immobile , diffusion separates the two species , creating an electric current that acts as an electromagnet . the boundary of a region of activated charge behaves , essentially , like the p - n junction of a diode . \n since only holes may flow out of this volume , the initial current diffusing across the boundary is unidirectional , corresponding to forward bias in the diode . \n however , after a delay period during which recombination reduces the diffusive current , the diode switches to reverse bias . \n the p - n junction capacitance generates a reverse recovery current and potentially a reverse - bias electrical breakdown . \n this current of holes flows back into the source volume , producing a magnetic pulse that is opposite in polarity and potentially much stronger than the initial magnetic field . \n we use the semiconductor model to calculate an example of a unipolar magnetic pulse . \n the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are estimated based on the static properties of mgo@xcite ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and a temperature of @xmath48k . since electrons are trapped and immobile in broken peroxy bonds , @xmath17 and @xmath21 are set to @xmath49 . \n the mobility and diffusion constant of holes were roughly estimated based on experimental data from a haynes - shockley - style experiment whereby a rapid pressure impulse to the center of a gabbro tile injected holes that diffused and drifted away from their source . \n the parameters used are @xmath50 m@xmath51 ( vs)@xmath52 and @xmath53 m@xmath51 s@xmath52 , comparable to their values in pure undoped silicon . \n charge generation is not explicitly considered in this calculation , and a pre - existing excess concentration of @xmath54 c m@xmath55 of both electrons and holes exists as an initial condition . \n these dissociated charges are initially present only at points within a ball of radius @xmath56 m. their recombination rate is proportional to the product of electron and hole concentrations , @xmath57 . the attenuation of the magnetic field as it passes through the earth is not considered , nor are effects associated with the surface of the earth . \n calculated and observed magnetic pulses are illustrated in figure 1 . \n the first figure shows the value of the x - component of the magnetic field as a function of time , measured 10 km directly above the center of the simulated volume . \n the amplitude , frequency , and shape of the pulse are similar to pulses that have been observed before earthquakes . for comparison \n , the second figure shows several magnetic pulses observed prior to an earthquake near lima , peru . \n these pulses were measured over a period of several days by a pair of magnetometers approximately 25 km away , and the locations of their sources were triangulated . \n the sources were clustered within a few kilometers of the epicenter of an earthquake that occurred two weeks after the onset of the pulses @xcite . \n this analysis has been performed prior to several moderate earthquakes near lima , with similar results . \n when a volume of rock is stressed , excess holes and electrons are injected . \n the mobile holes begin to diffuse out of the source volume , while electrons are trapped within the source volume and undergo recombination with the holes that have not diffused out . \n the flux of holes leaving the source effectively creates a p - n diode : the source volume becomes an n - type semiconductor and the surrounding rock becomes p - type . \n a depletion region forms between the two layers of the p - n junction and the p - n double layer screens electric fields outside its immediate vicinity . \n after charge injection , a diffusive current of holes flows as a result of the concentration gradient across the source boundary . \n this corresponds to a forward bias state of the diode , dominated by diffusion capacitance rather than junction capacitance . \n this current creates a transient magnetic field . as the hole concentration gradient decreases , the diffusive current and the magnetic field decay . \n after holes have diffused outward , creating p - type and n - type regions , a junction capacitance results from layers of positive and negative charge separated by a depletion region at the junction . \n after a delay period , the diode effectively switches to a reverse bias state . \n electron - hole recombination consumes the holes remaining within the source volume , leaving mostly electrons inside . \n the junction capacitance causes a transient reverse recovery current , and , if the potential drop across the depletion region is sufficiently strong , reverse - bias electrical breakdown may occur . \n coulomb attraction pulls the holes back into the source volume , and this reverse current of holes can create transient magnetic pulses similar to those observed before earthquakes .    a distinctive form and the ability to pass through the earth at ultra - low frequencies make magnetic pulses a compelling tool for the observation of pre - seismic shifts in the stress level of rocks that are otherwise inaccessible due to depth . by triangulating the source of these magnetic pulses , the increased buildup of stress around future earthquake epicenters may be identified weeks in advance of seismicity . \n in addition to unipolar pulses , other types of electromagnetic precursors might be predicted from the semiconductor model . \n oscillatory ulf fields , for example , have been observed immediately preceding earthquake activity @xcite . \n the positive hole semiconductor theory modeled here seeks to unify a wide range of electromagnetic phenomena associated with seismic activity . \n the direct coupling of semiconductor drift -

fglr : kudritzki  2003 ) .    in order to exploit the full potential , a few complications have to be overcome in model atmosphere analyses . \n the high luminosities drive stellar winds , to be solved in a hydrodynamical approach , and low atmospheric densities facilitate departures from lte , which require a simultaneous solution of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium ( e.g. kubt & korkov ; krtika & kubt , these proceedings ) . in the following , \n we will concentrate on the latter aspect , as this allows us to draw important conclusions for studies of ` normal ' a - stars as well , before discussing recent highlights from the quantitative spectroscopy of extragalactic a - type supergiants . \n @xmath4411 transition ( thick line ) in two supergiants is well reproduced by the recommended hi non - lte model atom of przybilla & butler ( 2004 , thin line ) , which accounts for accurate electron collision data from quantum - mechanical _ ab - initio _ \n computations for excitation processes . for comparison , synthetic spectra from computations using the @xcite approximation ( dashed ) and assuming lte ( dashed - dotted line ) are also shown . \n the computations are performed for stellar parameters derived from the analysis of the visual spectra ( @xmath5leo : @xmath6@xmath49600k , @xmath7=2.00 ; @xmath8ori : @xmath6@xmath412000k , @xmath7=1.75 ) . an analogous comparison in main sequence stars like vega indicates that non - lte departures are underestimated when using the @xcite approximation for electron collision rates . ] \n a - type supergiants were rediscovered as tools for astrophysics in the seminal work of @xcite , where modern lte model atmosphere techniques were shown to suffice for their quantitative analysis , using spectroscopic indicators  ionization equilibria and stark - broadened hydrogen lines  for the stellar parameter determination ( cf . \n yce ; tanriverdi these proceedings ) . in the following , \n the focus shifted from bright , though typically less luminous ( lc ib and iab ) galactic objects towards supergiants in other galaxies of the local group , where only the more luminous stars are accessible to high - resolution spectroscopy using the currently available telescopes . \n finally , when meeting the challenge of quantitative spectroscopy of supergiants beyond the local group only objects near the the eddington limit are accessible with present - day  instrumentation . \n the progress on the observational side initiated a reinvestigation of the analyses techniques . \n classical line - blanketed lte atmospheres still turn out to be the best choice for studies of high - luminosity objects at present , however only in combination with massive non - lte line - formation for the modelling of the photospheric spectrum , i.e. a hybrid non - lte approach ( przybilla 2002 ) . \n this is facilitated by the fact that the main atmospheric constituents ( h , he ) and the important metal opacities stay close to detailed equilibrium . in the following we discuss the major results from these investigations . \n we begin with the most basic element , hydrogen , for which the effects of non - lte departures in early - type stars were investigated more than three decades ago ( e.g. auer & mihalas 1969a , b ) . \n surprisingly , present - day modelling of the hydrogen spectrum fails in reproducing the observed paschen , brackett and pfund lines , both in lte and non - lte , though good agreement is obtained for the balmer lines . \n all early - type stars are affected , with the discrepancies reaching a maximum in the a - type supergiants , where a mismatch in the line strengths by factors up to 23 are found , see fig .  [ brackett ] . \n the spectral features in the visual and ir are consistently reproduced only when commonly - used approximation formulae for the evaluation of electron - collision excitation rates are dropped in favour of exact data from quantum - mechanical _ ab - initio _ computations ( przybilla & butler  2004 ) . \n this is because of a strong sensitivity of the line source - function to non - lte departures in the rayleigh - jeans limit , resulting in an amplification of non - lte effects in the ir . \n -uncertainty ranges around the mean values : proper non - lte calculations reduce the line - to - line scatter and remove systematic trends . \n note that even weak lines can show considerable departures from lte . ] \n carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are the most abundant metals . all the observed spectral lines in the visual / near - ir originate from high - excitation , ( quasi-)metastable levels that favour departures from lte . \n comprehensive non - lte model atoms , accounting for more sophisticated atomic data than previously possible ( przybilla  2000 , 2001 ; przybilla & butler  2001 ) allow us to reproduce the entire observed cno spectra to an unprecedented degree of accuracy , see fig . \n [ cnoabus ] . \n in particular , non - lte abundance analyses remove systematic trends that trouble the lte approach , and help to reduce the statistical uncertainties from the line - to - line scatter of typically @xmath00.2dex in the literature down to better than 0.1dex . \n contrary to common assumptions , significant non - lte abundance corrections by @xmath00.3dex can occur even in the weak line limit .    , with the addition of double - ionized species ( diamonds ) . \n the symbol size codes the number of spectral lines analysed . \n error bars represent 1@xmath9-uncertainties from the line - to - line scatter and the grey shaded areas mark the deduced stellar metallicity within 1@xmath9-errors . \n the non - lte computations reveal a striking similarity to the solar abundance distribution , except for the light elements which have been affected by mixing with nuclear - processed matter . ] \n the next step is to broaden our discussion towards a comprehensive study of the entire spectra of ba - type supergiants . \n examples are shown in fig . \n [ abus ] , where results from non - lte and lte abundance analyses of primarily weak lines are compared to the solar standard . from this we conclude that the non - lte analysis reveals a striking similarity of the galactic supergiant abundance patterns to the solar abundance distribution . \n this is also found for the m31 object , at slightly higher average metallicity . \n fewer chemical species are accessible in this case because of a more restricted spectral coverage and lower s / n of the observations . \n the light elements he , c and n show marked deviations which are interpreted as mixing of the atmospheric layers with nuclear - processed matter , qualitatively in good agreement with the predictions of the most recent models of massive star evolution ( e.g. maeder & meynet  2000 ) . \n note in particular that non - lte calculations can bring several ionization equilibria simultaneously into agreement , thus putting very tight constraints on the stellar parameters . \n lte analyses on the other hand produce a large scatter of the individual elemental abundances , and result in increased uncertainties for the different species . \n they can even suggest @xmath10-enhancement for the more luminous objects , i.e. apparent overabundances of the @xmath10-elements , in coincidence with underabundant iron - group elements . \n this occurs because of selective non - lte effects , which favour non - lte line - strengthening in the @xmath10-elements in analogy to cno . on the other hand , \n iron - group elements experience non - lte line - weakening , because they are characterised by a plethora of energetically - close levels easily coupled via collisions that are collectively subject to non - lte overionization . ignoring these non - lte effects \n can introduce systematic errors to abundance analyses of more luminous supergiants of typically @xmath00.3dex . though the astrophysically most important elements are covered by our non - lte computations , \n an extension to other chemical species is desirable . \n however , in many cases a lack of the required atomic data prevents such efforts at present . \n finally , we like to emphasise that using a - type supergiants as testbeds for the study of non - lte effects offers a unique opportunity to improve stellar analysis techniques for other classes of stars in general . due to the universality of atomic properties , sets of reference atomic data \n should be compiled and verified under the most extreme conditions . \n ' '' ''     +    the different galactic environments of the individual local group members offer unique opportunities to study the influence of metallicity on the evolution of massive stars . a comparison of galactic and smc a - type supergiant abundances ( venn  1999 ; venn & przybilla  2003 ) suggests that most of the objects have undergone substantial mixing with cn - cycled material , see fig .  [ mixing ] . \n the efficiency of rotational mixing appears to correlate with metallicity since the smc stars ( at 0.2@xmath11solar metallicity ) show larger nitrogen enrichments . \n this is again in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of the latest models of stellar evolution . \n the effect is a consequence of the reduced metal - line opacity which gives more compact objects and lower mass - loss rates , such that angular momentum losses are considerably reduced , which enables the mixing mechanisms ( meridional circulation , shear instabilities ) to retain their efficiency . \n a predicted correlation of mixing efficiency with stellar mass is not verified in this study . \n note however , that the sample objects in the smc are on average more massive than the galactic supergiants .

2.8  kpc . \n however , recent measurements based on the light echo  @xcite suggest that a larger distance of 3.8  kpc could also be possible . \n vhe gamma - ray emission from tycho is predicted by the non linear kinetic theory of cosmic ray acceleration in snrs  @xcite  @xcite . in such models , \n the dominating mechanism for gamma -

{"ContextTokens": 2690, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "the brazilian government classifies the goods it buys according to a particular taxonomy : the catmat ( catalog of materials ) . \n when the government purchases a new good , the person in charge of classifying it must choose one of the 560 catmat classes . \n the cognitive load is heavy , especially if the person is new to catmat . \n the result is misclassification . \n for instance , of the 30,774 goods classified as wheeled vehicles ( catmat class # 2320 ) between 1999 - 04 - 01 and 2015 - 04 - 02 , 17,469 cost less than r$ 1,000 ( us$ 250 as of 2015 - 12 - 01 ) . \n that price seems too low for a wheeled vehicle . \n when we inspect the product descriptions we see that the problem is misclassification : spare parts ( catmat classes # 2510 , # 2520 , # 2530 , and # 2590 ) are often misclassified as wheeled vehicles ( catmat class # 2320 ) .    when the misclassification rate is so high it is hard to audit government expenditures . \n in particular , it is hard to know whether the price paid for a given item was reasonable ( i.e. , similar to the prices paid for the same item before ) or not . auditing authorities waste resources investigating legitimate purchases , on the one hand , and fail to investigate fraudulent purchases , on the other hand . \n to reduce misclassification i trained a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier that takes a product description as input and returns the three most likely catmat classes as output . \n the idea is to semi - automate the process : we want to suggest likely classes to the person classifying the good ( the user of our app ) . \n he or she may choose among the suggested classes or ignore them and choose a different class . \n for instance , say some public hospital is buying insulin syringes . \n the hospital will describe the product in detail on the invitation to bid - say , as  disposable insulin syringes with 0.5ml and ultra - thin ( 6 mm ) needle , 50 units \" . \n the user feeds that description to the svm classifier , which then suggests three catmat classes : # 6515 ( medical and surgical equipment and supplies ) , # 6550 ( supplies for medical diagnostic and testing ) , and # 6640 ( laboratory equipment and supplies ) . \n the user chooses one of these three classes or , alternatively , discards them and chooses a different class \n .    we can not fully automate the process ( i.e. , substitute the svm classifier for the human classifier ) , for two reasons . first , in about 16.7% of the cases none of the svm - suggested classes is the correct one ( more on this later ) . hence a human must remain in charge of the final decision . \n but in the remaining 83.3% of the cases the svm classifier will be correct , which should reduce classification error . and perhaps this is a foundation upon which a fully automated classifier can be created in the future . \n second , after the user has chosen a catmat class he or she must also choose a subclass and an item . \n the catmat is a hierarchical taxonomy : it comprises 79 groups , 560 classes , 18,380 subclasses , and 217,907 items ( as of 2015 - 04 - 02 ) . \n but the svm classifier can not offer any suggestions when it comes to subclasses or items : with 18,380 or 217,907 categories there is just not enough data to train the classifier ; its accuracy would be too low . but \n reducing misclassification at the catmat level already improves the quality of the data , even if the user chooses the wrong subclass or item - research and auditing done at the class level will be more reliable . and perhaps the user is more likely to choose the correct subclass and item when the catmat class is correct . \n svm is a well - known classification algorithm first introduced by vapnik and lerner ( 1963 ) and later popularized by boser , guyon and vapnik ( 1992 ) and by cortes and vapnik ( 1995 ) . \n it learns from manually classified samples ( the training samples ) and then uses that knowledge to classify new samples . \n here we have a total of 28,420,761 samples , which are all the goods the brazilian government purchased between 1999 - 04 - 01 and 2015 - 04 - 02 . \n i split the samples into 70% training , 15% validation , and 15% testing . \n the classifier  sees \" the description _ and _ the catmat class of each of the training samples and thus learns how to map descriptions onto catmat classes . \n for instance , the classifier learns that when  stapler \" appears in the description the good is usually classified under catmat class # 7520 . \n it learns that when  tea \" appears in the description the good is usually classified under catmat class # 8955 . \n and so on . \n once the classifier is trained we use the validation samples to assess its performance . for each validation sample and each catmat class \n the classifier estimates the probability that the sample belongs to that class . \n hence for each validation sample the classifier estimates 560 probabilities . \n the estimation is word - based . \n for instance , having the word  stapler \" in the description increases the probability that the sample belongs to catmat class # 7520 and decreases the probability that it belongs to catmat class # 8955 . \n when all estimations are done we check how often the catmat class of highest probability is the correct one . \n we then go back to the training phase , changing one or more model parameters ( like the learning rate or the regularization term ) . \n we assess the classifier s performance once more . \n we train the model again , with new changes in the parameters . \n and so on and so forth until we are satisfied with the results . \n when the classifier performs well enough with the validation samples we check how well it performs with the testing samples . \n that is the final result - once the testing samples are used we can not go back and adjust the parameters again , lest we overfit the classifier ( i.e. , lest we make the classifier too responsive to the idiosyncrasies of our data and thus non - generalizable ) . \n before we can train the svm classifier we need to collect , clean , and process the data . \n all the data are in the comprasnet database . \n the descriptions are in the d_itcp_item_compra table . \n the catmat classes are in the f_item_compra table . \n a common key allows joins between these two tables . \n i discarded the cases whose description and/or class was empty or null we are left . \n i also discarded the cases that corresponded to services ( about 10% of the total ) , as services are too unique and idiosyncratic for algorithmic classification . \n the result was a total of 28,420,761 samples ; as mentioned above , they correspond to all the goods the brazilian government purchased between 1999 - 04 - 01 and 2015 - 04 - 02 . \n i lower - cased all the descriptions and removed all special characters , numbers , and one - character words . \n i also converted plural words to singular words , using the first step of a portuguese stemmer algorithm ( the rslp algorithm , created by orengo and huyck [ 2001 ] ) . \n finally , i removed all words that only appeared once in the entire dataset . \n i transformed each document ( description ) into a vector of word counts and merged all vectors . \n this resulted in a term - frequency matrix - a matrix whose rows represent words , columns represent documents , and each entry is the frequency of word _ \n i _ on document _ j _ ( i.e. , the term - frequency , @xmath0 ) . \n next i apply the @xmath1 transformation . \n the @xmath1 of each entry is given by its term - frequency ( @xmath0 ) multiplied by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total number of documents and @xmath4 is the number of documents in which word @xmath5 appears ( i.e. , the word s document frequency  @xmath6 ; the @xmath2 ratio thus gives us the inverse document frequency \n @xmath7 ) . \n what the @xmath1 transformation does is increase the importance of the word the more it appears in the document but the less it appears in the whole corpus . \n hence it helps us reduce the weights of inane words like ` the ' ( ` o ' , in portuguese ) , ` of ' ( ` de ' ) , etc and increase the weights of discriminant words ( i.e. , words that appear a lot but only in a few documents ) . for more details on @xmath1 \n see manning , raghavan , and schtze ( 2008 ) . \n the next step is normalization . \n here we have documents of widely different sizes , ranging from two or three words to dozens of words . \n longer documents contain more unique words and have larger @xmath8 values , which may skew the results ( manning , raghavan , and schtze 2008 ) . to avoid that we normalize the columns of the @xmath1 matrix , transforming them into unit vectors . \n the resulting @xmath1 matrix has dimensions 28,420,761 ( descriptions ) by 505,938 ( unique words ) . \n it is this matrix that we use to train , validate , and test the svm classifier . \n our svm classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.3% . \n the errors seem to have two main causes . first , misclassification in the training data \n . the svm classifier is learning from imperfect examples . \n as we discussed before , half the goods currently classified as wheeled vehicles ( catmat class # 2320 ) are actually spare parts ( catmat classes # 2510 , # 2520 , # 2530 , and # 2590 ) . \n second , class frequency . \n catmat classes that are bought more often tend to be more accurately classified by the svm classifier . \n this is expected : for these classes there are more training samples , so the classifier has a larger set of descriptions from which to learn . \n in fact , there is a negative linear correlation between class frequency and misclassification rate ( -0.36 , with p @xmath9 0.0001 ) . \n i used the trained classifier to build an open source web app . \n its interface is very simple : there is a single input form , wherein the user writes or pastes the description of the good being purchased ( as it appears on the invitation to bid , for example ) . \n the user then clicks submit and is shown the three most likely catmat classes .    in the example below we inputed the description of an air conditioning unit and \n got back three catmat classes : # 4120 ( air conditioning equipment ) , with probability 58% ; # 4130 ( air conditioning and cooling components ) , with probability 22% ; and # 6550 ( supplies for medical diagnostic and testing ) , with probability 4% . here \n the first class - the one with the highest probability - is the correct one . \n initially the idea was to put the app up online but the cost was prohibitive . \n the trained classifier is heavy ( the coefficients take up over 4 gb on disk ) and requires a computer with large ram - at least 16 gb but ideally more . on cloud providers like amazon web services and \n google compute engine that would cost around us$ 200 per month ( r$ 800 as of 2015 - 12 - 01 ) . \n the code for the app is available on github though : https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/catmatfinder . \n i made the code open source so that anyone can use and modify it . \n bird , steven , edward loper , and ewan klein . \n 2009 .  natural language processing with python . \" \n oreilly media inc . \n boser , bernhard , isabelle guyon and vladimir vapnik . \n 1992 .  a training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers . \" in d. haussler , editor , _ proceedings of the annual conference on computational learning theory _ , 144 - 152 . \n platt , john . 2000 . \n probabilistic outputs for support vector machines and comparison to regularized likelihood methods . in a.j . \n smola , p.l . \n bartlett , b. schlkopf , and d. schuurmans , editors , _ advances in large margin classifiers_. mit press .", "StartTimeOffset": 457957560246, "RequestID": "2c5350459cacb7bcf65251c3b0367364c9625c83", "TotalTokens": 2904}

body association , galaxy etc ) . \n we assume that a free object is made of either matter or antimatter . \n hence , an object is characterized by its mass at rest and baryonic type , its internal evolution being ignored . for the purpose of this work it seems sufficient to consider object - object interaction in general terms of a random collision followed by a formation of a compound system , which may disintegrate into new objects with channel probabilities of fragmentation , annihilation , and merge processes . \n we assume that matter - antimatter annihilation results in gamma radiation being a source of a following pair production . \n it means that annihilated matter is regenerated in the `` first group '' of a mass distribution . \n the `` first group '' may be referred , in principle , to elementary particles as a `` seed matter '' and plays a role of a source term in a kinetic equation . \n next comments concern relativistic properties of an open system . \n first of all , we need to explain the term `` relativistic material system '' . \n a uniform isotropic matter distribution in a flat space is characterized by a uniform coordinate - momentum distribution function ( 1 ) . \n it is lorentz - invariant , that is unchanged if measured in any inertial reference frame . \n such a state of matter can be treated as a `` maximal chaos '' in terms of bayesian approach for description of relativistic gas @xcite . \n actually , this is an approximation of non - interacting particles . \n it is worth noting that the relativistic gas model has nothing in common with friedmann - lemaitre expanding universe model @xcite , which treats matter like dust - like matter - made particles with small relative velocities in an observer s vicinity . \n the expanding universe itself plays a role of the absolute reference frame . in our approach \n an opportunity of introducing the absolute reference frame is denied . \n however , the above approximation of non - interacting particles leads to an infinite energy density . in a more rigorous relativistic gas model one has to take into account that physical processes locally observed under conditions of an open system should be characterized by retarded casual connections with the rest of the space , and inertial systems must be referred to a limited space - time volume depending on how precise they are needed to be defined . \n hence , a `` realistic '' coordinate - momentum distribution must be characterized by some space - energy correlation and must have a smooth cut - off at however high energy range , or an effective temperature parameter . now any local energy density will be found limited and invariant in a broad set of inertial systems ( the higher temperature , the broader set ) . \n we assume that the temperature is well above the threshold needed for pair production process being effective . \n under above conditions annihilation and pair production processes have to be balanced , for there is no energy dissipation in the open system . in other words , \n the system is expected to be in a self - sustained baryon symmetric state . \n if a mass distribution function is not degenerated into the `` first source group '' one can state that a matter - antimatter space separation takes place . \n the mass distribution function should be found from a material balance ( kinetic ) equation . \n let a mass distribution function for like matter objects ( in a unit volume ) be given in a mass group form for matter @xmath4 or antimatter @xmath5 : @xmath6 with a total mass conserved : @xmath7    next we use so called _ one velocity approximation _ , that is an equation being averaged over momentum distribution . \n let us introduce a generation rate @xmath8 of matter -

function is normalized to ensure a correct mass balance , annihilated mass in a form of gamma - radiation being taken into account .    choosing a proper summation rule we come to expressions for a removal rate @xmath20 and @xmath21 in matter - matter and matter - antimatter types of collision , correspondingly . \n @xmath22\\rightarrow m_k)>\\ ] ] @xmath23\\rightarrow m_k)>\\ ] ]    as is said above , an annihilation rate @xmath24 is followed by a matter recreation in the first group , @xmath25 , masses of radiation @xmath26 and recreated matter @xmath27 being in balance : @xmath28\\rightarrow m_\\gamma ) > ~.\\ ] ]    finally , we have a stationary kinetic equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    due to a symmetry of physical properties of matter and antimatter \n one can get the same equation starting considering generation / removal rates for antimatter - made objects . \n the equation ( 9 ) may be written in an integral form . \n it is easy to see that the equation has a non - trivial solution if a merge channel providing a transfer from a mass group @xmath9 to a mass group @xmath34 is open . \n since microscopic and macroscopic merging processes are known from conventional physics we may conclude that the above equation has a physical meaning . \n to demonstrate a solution we realized the monte carlo method for k - functions reduced to delta - functions . \n in other words , the fragmentation process has been ignored . \n we checked that it does not appreciably influence the form of solution though a computing time significantly increases . \n obviously , a solution depends on a collision cross - section as a function of an object mass . \n four variants were studied : constant cross - section , cross - section , proportional to the mass of a target object , cross - section proportional to both the mass of target and the mass of incident object , finally cross - section proportional to the squared mass of the target object . \n the last two variants were expected to have only slightly different solutions . \n the variants seem to include typical types of mass - dependent cross - sections of body - body physical interactions . however , concrete energy - dependent cross - sections for specific interactions may differ significantly in magnitude in different mass intervals . \n we do not know to what extent the solutions are influenced by `` one velocity approximation '' . \n this important question needs a special study on open relativistic matter system properties , their dependence on energy density , in particular . besides \n , taking into account an object internal evolution might be important also if the results were used for their speculative applications concerning astrophysical problems @xcite . \n all these questions are out of the scope of the present work . \n the main conclusion we would like to emphasize is that an open steady - state isotropic system consisted of baryon symmetric uniformly distributed matter should be characterized by a relativistic momentum distribution with an effective high temperature parameter . \n subsequently , a space matter - antimatter separation takes place resulted from random interactions within the system . \n the possible scale of separation may be seen from the statistical assessments of stationary mass distribution functions in fig .  1 . \n the picture gives us the idea of a solution of a simple model kinetic equation describing the above system : the solution may be approximated by a function @xmath35 with @xmath36 ranging between 2 and 3.5 , depending on model parameters . \n apparently , there might be a trend of decreasing @xmath36 for asymptotic solution . \n the latter should be found by analytical method . \n the result shows that an open baryon symmetric matter system reveals a structure containing matter or antimatter - made objects of any size . \n there is no material limit for their construction because of the system being unlimited in space . \n the bigger size ( age ) objects have , the less their population is . \n further computer simulations with more sophisticated models might show more physically meaningful features of the baryon symmetric open system . \n 99 r.omnes . \n * 23 * , 38 ( 1969 ) . \n science , * 171 * , 339 ( 1971 ) . \n f.m.stecker ,  d.l.morgan ,  j.bredekamp . phys.rev.lett . \n * 27 * , 1469 ( 1971 ) . \n c.e.fichtel  and  p.sreekumar . \n proc . of the fourth compton conf . \n , 436 , aip ( 1997 ) . \n j.l.synge . the relativistic gas . north -

{"ContextTokens": 3807, "GeneratedTokens": 217, "SynthesizedBody": "binary radio pulsars provide a rich laboratory for a wide range of physical inquiry , including neutron star masses and the evolution of binary systems . \n the pulsars with the best - determined masses all have eccentric relativistic orbits , spin periods of tens of milliseconds , and masses clustered very tightly around 1.35m@xmath5 @xcite . \n it is generally thought that millisecond pulsars ( @xmath6ms ) should have greater mass than these longer - period pulsars due to a larger accreted mass . \n there is indeed a statistical suggestion that this is the case , but to date no precise millisecond pulsar mass measurements exist . \n the best - determined millisecond pulsar masses are @xmath7 for psr  b1855 + 09 @xcite and @xmath8 for psr  j0437@xmath04715 @xcite . \n psr  j1909@xmath03744  was discovered during the swinburne high latitude pulsar survey , a recently - completed pulsar search using the 13-beam multibeam receiver on the 64-m parkes radio telescope ( jacoby 2003 ; jacoby et al . in preparation ) . \n this survey is similar to , and an extension of , the highly - successful swinburne intermediate latitude pulsar survey @xcite . \n the pulsar was discovered in three adjacent survey beams observed on 2001 january 25 and confirmed on 2001 may 26 . due to the pulsar s strong broad - band scintillation , the initial position inferred from the discovery data was in error by nearly a full beamwidth ; it was not until we obtained a phase - connected timing solution that we realized the correct position .    among the properties that can make a pulsar useful for precision timing experiments \n are a bright , narrow pulse profile , extremely stable rotation , proximity to the earth , and a companion star which can be detected and studied . \n psr  j1909@xmath03744  appears to possess all of these desirable traits . \n nearly all of the pulsar s flux comes in a single narrow , sharp peak with full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of only 43@xmath1s , less than 1.5% of the 2.95ms pulse period ( fig . \n [ fig:1909_profile ] ) . \n the brightness of the pulsar varies by at least a factor of 30 in the 21-cm band . \n the mean flux density of our observations is 3mjy , but this is biased by the fact that we tend to observe longer when the pulsar is bright . \n extremely high precision timing observations are possible during episodes of favorable scintillation . \n following the confirmation of psr  j1909@xmath03744 , we began timing observations with the @xmath9mhz parkes filterbank centered on 1390mhz . \n as a result of our incorrect discovery position , few observations taken before february 2002 yielded data useful for high - precision timing . \n integration times ranged from three to 100 minutes , with the longer observations broken into 10-minute sub - integrations . \n we followed standard pulsar timing procedures : folded pulse profiles from individual observations were cross - correlated with a high signal - to - noise template profile to determine an average pulse time of arrival ( toa ) , corrected to utc(nist ) . \n the standard pulsar timing package tempo , along with the jet propulsion laboratory s de405 ephemeris , was used for all timing analysis . all 1.4ghz toas with uncertainty less than 1@xmath1s \n were included . \n toa uncertainties were multiplied by 1.25 to achieve reduced @xmath10 . \n several observations were also obtained in the 50-cm band with the @xmath11mhz parkes filterbank centered on 660mhz . as these observations did not yield toa uncertainties less than 1@xmath1s they were used only to determine the dispersion measure ( @xmath12 ) , which was then held fixed . \n because of the system s low eccentricity ( @xmath13 ) , we used the ell1 binary model which replaces the familiar longitude of periastron ( @xmath14 ) , time of periastron ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath13 with the time of ascending node ( @xmath16 ) and the laplace - lagrange parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . \n we give the results of our timing analysis in table  [ tab : par ] and show residuals relative to this best - fit model in figure  [ fig:1909_residuals ] . \n the weighted rms residual is only 330ns , among the best obtained for any pulsar over @xmath192 year timespans . \n we have begun regular observations of psr  j1909@xmath03744  with the caltech - parkes - swinburne recorder ii ( cpsr2 ; * ? ? ? \n cpsr2 is a baseband recorder and real - time coherent dedispersion system with two dual - polarization bands , each 64mhz wide . \n the cpsr2 pulse profile shown in figure  [ fig:1909_profile ] is smeared by only 2@xmath1s , compared with the 82@xmath1s time resolution of the 512-channel filterbank . \n initial results from cpsr2 data show great promise for high precision timing , and will be reported in a future paper . \n though our current data set suffers from poor orbital phase coverage ( specifically a lack of high - quality observations near inferior conjunction ) , we find strong evidence of shapiro delay . \n if we remove shapiro delay ( i.e. companion mass , @xmath20 , and sine of orbital inclination , @xmath21 ) from the timing model and allow tempo to optimize the remaining parameters , @xmath22 increases from 98.8 to 128.1 ( for 102 and 104 degrees of freedom respectively ) , indicating a highly significant detection . \n the peak - to - peak residual is essentially the same in either case ( 3.4@xmath1s ) as much of the shapiro delay signal is absorbed into an erroneously large roemer delay ; however , the weighted rms residual increases to 370ns when the model excludes @xmath20 and @xmath21 . holding the astrometric , orbital , and spin parameters fixed at the values in table  [ tab : par ] but neglecting shapiro delay increases the peak - to - peak residual to 8.1@xmath1s , with pulses observed nearest inferior conjunction arriving later than predicted by the model .    given its large uncertainty , we are not concerned by the most likely value of @xmath23 found by tempo s linear least - squares fit . to confirm that the shapiro delay is physically meaningful \n , we constructed a @xmath22 map as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while optimizing the remaining parameters . \n our sparse data set is consistent with a large range of allowed parameter space , constraining the system to have @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( 95% confidence ) . \n the covariance of the poorly - determined @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the projected semimajor axis ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath13 means that the uncertainties in these parameters given in table  [ tab : par ] are likely to be underestimated .    currently , the strongest constraint on the companion mass is the minimum mass of 0.195m@xmath5 obtained from the mass function by assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28m@xmath5 ; the fact that shapiro delay is detected at all suggests that we are likely viewing the system roughly edge - on . \n future pulsar timing observations near inferior conjunction will significantly improve the shapiro delay - derived companion mass . \n we have measured the parallax , @xmath29mas , and hence can estimate the distance to psr  j1909@xmath03744 , @xmath30kpc . \n combined with the proper motion , this distance corresponds to a transverse velocity of @xmath3kms@xmath4 . \n the @xmath12-derived distance estimate is 0.46kpc @xcite .    the pulsar s proper motion induces an apparent radial acceleration equal to @xmath31 @xcite . \n this secular acceleration will allow an entirely independent distance estimate from precise measurement of the orbital period derivative , @xmath32 @xcite . for circular binaries such as psr  j1909@xmath03744 , the intrinsic @xmath32 due to general relativity is negligible . \n however , the secular acceleration will eventually produce a measurable @xmath32 which can be used to determine the distance . \n the peak - to - peak timing signal due to parallax is @xmath33s , while the @xmath32 signal increases with the observing baseline , @xmath34 , as @xmath35 . \n thus , after only a few years of timing @xmath32 will give the more precise distance . \n we note that the acceleration induced by differential galactic rotation is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the secular acceleration . \n the secular acceleration also corrupts the observed period derivative ( @xmath36 ) . \n since the pulsar s intrinsic spindown rate ( @xmath37 ) is non - negative , we can obtain an upper distance limit of 1.4kpc , consistent with the measured parallax . \n conversely , the measured proper motion and parallax - derived distance allow us to correct @xmath36 for the secular acceleration and hence determine @xmath37 . \n at the position of the pulsar , the digitized sky survey plates showed a possible counterpart . to verify this \n , we obtained images on the night of 2003 june 4 with the magellan instant camera ( magic ) at the 6.5-m clay telescope on las campanas . \n we took a 10-min exposure in @xmath38 and a 5-min exposure in @xmath39 . \n the conditions were poor , with thin clouds and @xmath40 seeing . \n the images were reduced using the munich image data analysis system ( midas ) , following the usual steps of bias subtraction ( separately for the four amplifiers ) and flat - fielding using dome flats . for the astrometric calibration , we selected 58 usno - b1.0 @xcite objects that overlapped with our images , were not overexposed , and appeared stellar . for these objects \n , we measured centroids and fitted for zero - point position , plate scale , and position angle . rejecting 23 outliers with residuals larger than @xmath41 , the inferred single - star measurement error in both bands is @xmath42 in each coordinate , which is consistent with expectations for the usno - b1.0 measurements . hence our astrometry \n should be tied to the usno - b1.0 system at the @xmath43 level .    in both images , we found an object near the position of the pulsar which is blue relative to other stars in the field ; see fig . \n [ fig : image ] . \n the position inferred from our astrometry is @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which is consistent with the timing position listed in table  [ tab : par ] within the uncertainty with which the usno - b1.0 system is tied to the international celestial reference frame ( @xmath46 in each coordinate ) . \n the identification of this object with the pulsar s companion was confirmed by spectra , taken on the night of 2003 june 6 , using the low dispersion survey spectrograph  2 ( ldss2 ) at the clay telescope . \n we took two 30-min exposures with the high resolution grism and a @xmath40 slit , which gives a resolution of @xmath47 . \n the conditions were mediocre , with thin cirrus and @xmath48 seeing . \n we used midas to reduce the spectra . \n they were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using normalized dome flats ( in which the noisy blue part was set to unity ) . \n after sky subtraction , the two spectra were extracted using optimal weighting , and added together . to derive the response \n , we used spectra of feige  110 , taken during the same night , and fluxes from calibrated stis spectra . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] . \n we stress that since cirrus was present , the absolute flux calibration is not reliable , although both from the spectrum and from a rough photometric calibration using usno - b1.0 magnitudes , it follows that the companion has @xmath49 .    the spectrum ( fig . \n [ fig : spectrum ] ) shows only the balmer lines of hydrogen , from h@xmath50 up to h10 , consistent with a da white dwarf of low surface gravity ( and thus low mass ) . \n the strength of the lines and the slope of the spectrum are similar to what is seen for psr j1012 + 5307 @xcite and psr j0218 + 4232 @xcite , indicating a similar temperature of @xmath51k .    assuming a mass of @xmath52 \n , the white dwarf should have a radius of approximately @xmath53 and a luminosity of @xmath54 @xcite . \n the corresponding absolute magnitude is @xmath55 , which implies @xmath56 at a distance of 0.8kpc , consistent with the rough photometry quoted above . \n pulse timing precision is often limited by systematic errors that distort the shape of pulsar profiles due to the interstellar medium and imperfect polarimetric and instrumental response . \n intrinsically narrow pulses are less susceptible to these errors , as are pulsars with small dispersion measures . \n psr  j1909@xmath03744  is likely to become a cornerstone of future timing array experiments to detect low - frequency gravitational waves . \n it is noteworthy that psr  j1909@xmath03744  is far from other high - precision pulsars on the sky and therefore probes a unique line of sight .    in the shorter run , \n further timing of the pulsar , especially with cpsr2 , should yield an accurate inclination and a reasonably precise companion mass . \n furthermore , in a modest spectroscopic observing campaign on an 8-m class telescope , the radial velocity orbit of the companion can be measured precisely . \n these combined results should allow a very reliable pulsar mass measurement , and advance our understanding of binary pulsar evolution and recycling . \n we thank r. edwards for invaluable help with pulsar search software , h. knight for assistance with parkes observations , and m. hamuy , v. mario , and m. roth for help with the magellan observations . \n baj and srk thank nsf and nasa for supporting their research . \n mhvk acknowledges support by the national sciences and engineering research council of canada . \n the parkes telescope is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro . \n ll right ascension , @xmath57 & @xmath58 + declination , @xmath59 & @xmath60 + proper motion in @xmath50 , @xmath61 ( mas yr@xmath4 ) & @xmath09.6(2 ) + proper motion in @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( mas yr@xmath4 ) & @xmath035.6(7 ) + annual parallax , @xmath64 ( mas ) & 1.22(44 ) + pulse period , @xmath65 ( ms ) & 2.9471080205034(1 ) + period derivative , @xmath36 ( 10@xmath66 ) & 1.4026(3 ) + reference epoch ( mjd ) & 52055.8704 + dispersion measure , @xmath12 ( pc @xmath67 ) & 10.394(1 ) + binary period , @xmath68 ( d ) & 1.5334494503(1 ) + projected semimajor axis , @xmath26 ( lt - s ) & 1.897992(4 ) + @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) & 0.1(90 ) + @xmath18 ( @xmath70 ) & @xmath02.6(17 ) + time of ascending node , @xmath16 ( mjd ) & 52055.87046667(6 ) + @xmath21 & 1.1(4 ) + companion mass @xmath20 ( m@xmath5 ) & 0.13(37 ) + mass function , @xmath71 & 0.00312196(2 ) + orbital eccentricity , @xmath13 ( @xmath70 ) & 2.6(18 ) + longitude of periastron , @xmath14 ( deg ) & @xmath72 + time of periastron , @xmath15 & @xmath73 + parallax distance , @xmath74 ( kpc ) & @xmath75 + transverse velocity , @xmath76 ( km s@xmath4 ) & @xmath3 + intrinsic period derivative , @xmath37 ( 10@xmath66 ) & @xmath77 + surface magnetic field , @xmath78 @xmath79 & @xmath80 + characteristic age , @xmath81 ( gyr ) & @xmath82 + galactic longitude , @xmath83 ( deg ) & 359.73 + galactic latitude , @xmath84 ( deg ) & @xmath019.60 + distance from galactic plane , @xmath85 ( kpc ) & @xmath86 + pulse fwhm , @xmath87 ( @xmath1s ) & 43 + pulse width at 10% peak , @xmath88 ( @xmath1s ) & 89 +", "StartTimeOffset": 488301815928, "RequestID": "e5d3d01aa8d0eec73f5d7a95e0ee3d2767d68eab", "TotalTokens": 4024}
{"ContextTokens": 3794, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "understanding ordered states on curved surfaces like the sphere requires dealing with `` geometrical frustration . '' \n order parameters which describe crystalline or hexatic order in the centers of mass of the microscopic degrees of freedom , or the projections of tilted molecules onto a local tangent plane , often minimize their energy by aligning in neighboring regions . \n it is natural to assume that this alignment can be achieved by parallel transport of the vector or tensor order parameter which represents the local order [ 1 , 2 ] . in a continuum description \n , the required parallel transport can be described by connection coefficients which couple to the displacement or phase angle much like a vector potential couples to the phase of a type ii superconductor [ 3 ] . \n however , such alignment can not be achieved everywhere when a nonzero gaussian curvature is present . in particular , an attempt to produce a vector field aligned by parallel transport fails on a loop which contains a net integrated gaussian curvature [ 4 ] . \n the gaussian curvature embodied in the line integral of the connection coefficients around the loop resembles the frustration in a superconducting order parameter produced by a nonzero magnetic field [ 5 ] . \n consider @xmath3 particles with a repulsive hard core interaction closed - packed on the surface of a sphere . if @xmath1 is the radius of sphere , @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the hard core diameter . \n now imagine `` triangulating '' this sphere by connecting nearest neighbor particles using the spherical analogue of the familiar wigner - seitz construction of solid state physics . \n the geometric frustration discussed above appears on a more microscopic level in euler s theorem [ 6 ] on a sphere , which states the number of triangles @xmath5 , edges @xmath6 and vertices @xmath3 of such a tesselation are related , @xmath7 each edge is shared with two triangles , but a single triangle has three edges , so @xmath8 and eq . \n ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath9 . \n if the coordination numbers at each node in this triangulation are denoted @xmath10 , then @xmath11 and euler s theorem constrains the deviations of the @xmath12 from 6 on any surface with the topology of a sphere , @xmath13 although identical particles with a hard core repulsion in a plane typically pack into a triangular lattice with six - fold coordination , on a sphere eq . \n ( 2 ) shows that there must be at least 12 five - fold disclinations as well as an arbitrary number of six - coordinated sites . \n the 12 extra disclination defects ( each representing a rotational discontinuity of @xmath14 ) can be viewed as a consequence of the geometrical frustration associated with the gaussian curvature of a sphere , which integrates to @xmath15 . \n one plausible candidate for the ground state of an array of particles on the sphere is a `` superlattice '' of these disclinations ( rather like the abrikosov flux lattice of a type ii superconductor ) arrayed at the vertices of a regular icosahedron . \n although this hypothesis is likely to be approximately correct for the ground state of @xmath3 interacting particles on a sphere for moderate values of @xmath16 , the very large energy associated with the twelve isolated disclinations makes this guess questionable when @xmath16 becomes large . \n in fact , the extra energy due to the disclinations ( relative to a perfect triangular lattice in flat space ) grows like @xmath17 ( see sec . \n 2 ) , where @xmath18 is a two - dimensional young s modulus . in this review , \n we briefly sketch two ways of reducing this energy . the first , relevant to hollow spherical shells which can be used to model viruses , invokes a buckling transition of the 12 disclinations and leads to a _ faceted _ icosahedral shape [ 7 ] . \n if @xmath19 is bending rigidity of the spherical shell , the @xmath17 behavior of the disclination energies is replaced by @xmath20 for large @xmath1 . \n another mechanism takes over for particles packed on a large spherical droplet , where surface tension limits significant buckling of disclinations out the local tangent plane.even in this case , the energy can still be reduced by introducing grain boundaries which radiate from the 12 disclinations [ 8 ] . \n the energy now grows like @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a dislocation core energy . this energy is larger than if buckling of the disclinations were allowed , but still smaller than the amount @xmath23 characteristic of isolated disclinations when @xmath1 is large ..    in sec . \n 2 , we review virus buckling , while sec . 3 presents a brief discussion of grain boundary `` scars '' which have now been observed experimentally [ 9 ] . \n understanding virus structures is a rich and challenging problem [ 10 ] , with a wealth of new information now becoming available . \n although traditional x - ray crystallography still allows the most detailed analysis [ 11 ] , three - dimensional reconstructions of icosahedral viruses from cryo - electron micrographs are now becoming routine [ 12 ] . \n electron microscope images of many identical viruses in a variety of orientations are used to reconstruct a three - dimensional image on a computer , similar to ct ( computed tomography ) scans in medical imaging . \n there are now , in addition , beautiful single molecule experiments which measure the work needed to load a virus ( bacteriophage @xmath2429 ) with its dna package [ 13 ] . \n it is of some interest to explore the elastic parameters and physical ideas which determine the shapes of viruses with an icosahedral symmetry . \n the analysis of approximately spherical viruses dates back to pioneering work by crick and watson in 1956 [ 14 ] , who argued that the small size of the viral genome requires identical structural units packed together with an icosahedral symmetry . \n these principles were put on a firm basis by don caspar and aaron klug in 1962 [ 15 ] , who showed how the proteins in a viral shell ( the `` capsid '' ) could be viewed as icosadeltahedral triangulations of the sphere by a set of pentavalent and hexavalent morphological units ( `` capsomers '' ) . the viral shells ( there can also be an outer envelope composed of membrane elements from the host cell ) are characterized by a pair of integers @xmath25 such that the number of morphological units is @xmath26 . to get from one pentavalent capsomer to another , \n one moves @xmath27 capsomers along a row of near - neighbor bonds on the sphere , turns 60 degrees and moves another @xmath28 steps . \n the euler theorem discussed in the introduction insures that the number of capsomers in five - fold environments is exactly 12 . \n a simple icosahedron of 12 morphological units corresponds to ( 1,0 ) while soccer balls and c@xmath29 fullerene molecules are ( 1,1 ) structures with 32 polygons . \n an icosadeltahedron with symmetry indices ( 3,1 ) is shown in fig . \n 1 . the polyoma virus ( sv40 ) is a ( 2,1 ) structure with 72 capsomeres , while the much larger adenovirus and herpes simplex virus are ( 5,0 ) and ( 4,0 ) structures with 252 and 162 morphological units , respectively . \n structures like that in fig \n . 1 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 nonzero and @xmath30 are chiral . \n note that the relatively small polyoma virus ( diameter 440 angstroms ) is round ( see fig . \n 2a ) , while the much larger herpes simplex virus ( diameter 1450 angstroms ) has a more angular or faceted shape [ 16 ] ( see fig . \n faceting of large viruses is in fact a common phenomenon ; the protein subunits of different viruses , moreover , have approximately the same molecular weight [ 17 ] . if these protein assemblies are characterized by elastic constants and a bending rigidity [ 18 ] , it is interesting to ask how deviations from a spherical shape develop with increasing virus size .    . ] \n the faceting of large viruses may in fact be caused by a buckling transition associated with the 12 isolated points of 5-fold symmetry . \n these singularities can be viewed as disclinations in an otherwise 6-coordinated medium . \n it is well known that the large strains associated with an isolated disclination in a _ flat _ disk of triangular lattice leads to buckling into a conical shape for [ 1 , 19 ] @xmath31 where @xmath18 is the two - dimensional young s modulus , @xmath19 is the bending rigidity and @xmath1 is the disk radius . \n the energy of a single 5-fold disclination with `` charge '' @xmath32 centered in a flat array of proteins of size @xmath1 is approximately @xmath33 however , above a critical buckling radius @xmath34 , is there a conical deformation with [ 19 ] @xmath35 one might expect a similar phenomenon for 12 disclinations confined to a surface with a spherical topology . indeed , the elastic energy for 12 disclinations on an undeformed sphere of radius @xmath1 is has a form similar to eq . \n ( 4 ) , namely [ 8 ] @xmath36 where the sphere radius @xmath1 now plays the role of the system size . \n although it seems highly likely that these 12 disclinations can lower their energy by buckling for large @xmath1 , the nonlinear nature of the underlying elastic theory [ 18 ] leads to complex interactions between the resulting conical deformations . \n a boundary layer analysis of the von karman equations for bent plates predicts anomalous scaling for the mean curvature in the vicinity of the ridges connecting conical singularities [ 20 ] . \n interesting scaling behavior also arises in the vicinity of the apexes of the cones themselves [ 21 ] . \n another intriguing physical realization of the buckling problem ( with @xmath37 so that boundary layers near ridges are important ) lies in the faceting of lecithin vesicles at temperatures sufficiently low so that the lipid constituents have crystallized [ 22 ] .    to search for a buckling transition in viral capsids or crystalline vesicles \n , one must study the strains and ground states of crystalline particle arrays with 12 disclinations in a spherical geometry [ 7 ] . \n the nonlinear foppl - von karman equations for thin shells with elasticity and a bending energy can be treated using a floating mesh discretization developed and studied extensively in the context of `` tethered surface '' models of polymerized membranes [ 23 ] . by taking the nodes of the mesh to coincide with the capsomers , \n even small viruses can be handled in this way , although any buckling transition will surely be smeared out unless @xmath38 is large , where @xmath2 is the spacing between morphological units . \n ideas from continuum elastic theory will , of course , be most applicable for vesicles composed of many lipids and for large viruses  viruses with as many as 1692 morphological units have been reported [ 24 ] .    there may be inherent limitations on the size of viral capsids that follow from the elastic properties of thin shells . because larger viruses can accommodate more genetic material \n , larger sizes could confer an evolutionary advantage . \n if , however , large viruses buckle away from a spherical shape , the resistance of the capsid to mechanical deformation will degrade . \n a theory of buckled crystalline order on spheres allows estimates of important elastic parameters of the capsid shell from structural data on the shape anisotropy [ 7 ] . \n although some aspects of virus structure could be accounted for by the physics of shell theory , other features could be more relevant to cell recognition , avoidance of immune response , etc . \n estimates of quantities such as the bending rigidity and young s modulus of a empty viral shell might allow an understanding of deformations due to loading with dna or rna [ 13 ] . \n the results of recent investigations of buckling transitions in a spherical geometry using the methods of refs . [ 19 ] and [ 23 ] are illustrated in fig . \n spherical shells do indeed become aspherical as the `` von karman number '' @xmath39 increases from values of order unity to @xmath40 . \n the mean square `` asphericity '' ( deviation from a perfect spherical shape ) departs significantly from zero when @xmath39 exceeds 154 , the location of the buckling transition in flat space . \n note that fits of buckled viruses or crystalline vesicles to this universal curve would allow an experimental estimate of the ratio @xmath41 . \n more quantitative information on the buckled shape can be extracted by expanding the radius @xmath42 in spherical harmonics , @xmath43 and studying the rotationally invarient quadratic invariants allowed for icosahedral viruses or vesicles , namely @xmath44 with @xmath45 [ 25 ] . \n although _ any _ parameter set of the form @xmath46 could be consistent with an icosahedral symmetry , all buckled objects describable by the theory of elastic shells should in fact lie on a universal curve parametrized by the value of @xmath39 . \n deviations from this curve are presumably be of some biological interest . \n in addition to exploring shape changes induced by an internal pressure ( a virus loaded with 6 @xmath47 m of dna can have an internal pressure as large as 6 mpa ! [ 13 ] ) , it would interesting to study the spontaneous membrane curvature produced by an asymmetric conical shape of the constituent proteins [ 26 ] . \n see ref . [ 7 ] for more details and quantitative fits to the shapes of the hk97 virus and a yeast virus .     for many different icosadeltahedra . \n the inset shows a ( 6,6 ) structure with yr@xmath48 . ] \n when particles are packed on a surface where the restoring force is a surface tension , instead of a bending rigidity , buckling is suppressed . for example , water droplets in oil coated with colloidal particles remain spherical even in the presence of disclinations in the colloidal array . remarkably , the classical ground state of interacting particles confined to a frozen surface like a sphere is still a matter of debate [ 27 ] , especially in the limit of large sphere radius @xmath1 compared to the particle spacing @xmath2 . \n this problem was first posed for interacting electrons by j. j. thomson in 1904 [ 28 ] . \n physical realizations include multi - electron bubbles in superfluid helium [ 29 ] , and `` colloidosomes '' [ 30 ] , which are lipid bilayers or droplets coated with colloidal particles . \n colloidosomes are potential delivery vehicles for drugs , flavors and fragrances . to study the ground states of such systems \n , one can analyze an effective free energy describing the physics of disclination arrays constrained to lie on an arbitrary two - dimensional surface . \n for spherical surfaces , the ground state for moderate @xmath16 can be approximated by a triangular lattice with twelve 5-fold disclinations at the vertices of an icosahedron . \n building on work by alar toomre [ 31 ] and by michael moore and collaborators [ 32 ] , it is possible to construct a detailed theory of interacting defects on a frozen , spherical topography [ 8 ] . \n although the buckling found in viruses is not allowed , the ground state for large @xmath16 includes unusual finite length grain boundaries . \n the methods of ref . [ \n 8 ] allow the direct minimization of the energy of , say , 26,000 interacting particles to be replaced by the much easier problem of finding the ground state of 132 interacting disclination defects , [ see fig . \n 4 ] with interactions determined by continuum elastic theory on the sphere . \n excellent results can be obtained using the young s modulus and the dislocation core energy of particles in flat space as input parameters . \n work by bausch _ \n [ 9 ] on colloidal particles absorbed onto water droplets in oil indicates a conventional ground state with just 12 disclination defects for small @xmath16 , but with extra dislocations associated with grain boundaries for @xmath49 , corresponding to particle numbers @xmath50 . \n both this critical value of @xmath3 and the number of excess dislocations in the grain boundary arms for @xmath51 can be estimated using the theory of ref . [ 8 ] , with good agreement with experiment . \n the work described here was carried out in collaboration with m. bowick , j. lidmar , l. mirny and a. travesset . \n it is a pleasure to acknowledge these fruitful collaborations , as well as discussions with s. harrison and a. toomre . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation , through grant dmr-0231631 and in part through the harvard materials research laboratory , via grant dmr-0213805 . \n 0 . in , edited by ( world scientific , singapore ) 1989 . \n ( mcgraw - hill , new york ) 1996 . \n ( pergamon , new york ) 1971 , chapter 11 . \n see , e.g. , . \n ( wiley , new york ) 1969 . \n _ cond - mat/030674 , phys . \n ( in press ) . . \n , edited by , ( oxford university press , new york ) 1997 . . . . . . \n ( pergamon , new york ) 1975 . . . . . . . \n for an analogous exploration of the shapes of _ liquid _ membranes with a spherical topology , see ; for a discussion of viral shells , see . . . \n . unpublished work . ; . .", "StartTimeOffset": 490120370268, "RequestID": "44f521984f5db3f7f7363f25d4ebc7842dec745c", "TotalTokens": 3943}
{"ContextTokens": 3271, "GeneratedTokens": 193, "SynthesizedBody": "surface plasmon polaritons have been used for a long time as sensitive detectors e.g. for biomolecules . \n this is mainly done in the so - called kretschmann configuration by internal reflection of a laser beam from a surface that is coated with a thin metal film kretschmann_radiative_1968 . \n particles that are close to or stick to the metal film can be detected via their optical properties which shift the surface plasmon angle @xmath1 under which a spp can be excited . in principle \n , such shifts can be detected very sensitively by measuring the phase of the reflected light beam which , at the plasmon angle , changes dramatically . \n however , the fact that the reflectivity is zero at the plasmon angle , i.e the power of the laser beam is completely transferred into a plasmonic excitation , broadens the detectable phase shift and limits the sensitivity @xcite . \n recently , a new excitation scheme has been introduced which avoids this problem by an electronic feedback on the phase of the incident laser field @xcite . in the work presented here , \n this scheme is used for the first time to actually measure the optical properties of a sample . the work is mainly motivated by recent progress in the field of surface quantum optics , atom chips and hybrid quantum systems . \n such tailored quantum systems made of cold atoms near nanostructured surfaces are expected to open up new opportunities for the construction of quantum sensors and for quantum information . in this context , we recently studied clouds of ultracold atoms coupled to evanescent waves near solid surfaces @xcite . \n the enhancement of such optial near - fields by the excitation of surface plasmons is already known for some time @xcite , but only recently , proposals have been put forward to generate plasmonic nanopotentials for the manipulation and trapping of cold atoms chang_trapping_2009 , murphy_electro - optical_2009 . for the design of such traps , surface potentials such as casimir - polder potentials casimir_influence_1948 have to be taken into account and some effort has been invested by the cold atoms community for studying dissipative forces @xcite . however , \n additional potentials from particles adsorbed at the surface are only little considered . as has been shown experimentally mcguirk_alkali - metal_2004 , such potentials can dramatically influence atom traps near surfaces . thus it is crucial to understand and control atomic adsoption , e.g. by laser - induced atomic desorption ( liad ) meucci_light - induced_1994 . \n furthermore , fascinating ideas have been proposed that rely on the controlled adsorption of atoms on semiconductor surfaces , which might prove as an important technological step towards the manipulation of electronic nano devices @xcite .    here \n , we report on adsorption of thermal rubidium atoms on a gold nanofilm . \n the rubidium coverage is monitored by the phase shift in the excitation spectrum of surface plasmon polaritons . by rapidly changing the rubidium vapor pressure , \n the balance between adsorption and thermally induced desorption is perturbed and reequilibration is monitored in real time . \n the observations are compared to a simple langmuir type model and the parameters of the model are extracted from the data . \n the ad- and desorption of rubidium atoms is observed by phase sensitive detection of the surface plasmon resonance . \n the experimental setup is shown in figure  [ fig : opt_el_aufbau ] . \n the beam from a grating stabilized diode laser ( laser 1 , wavelength near the d2-line of @xmath2 at @xmath3  nm , laser power @xmath4  mw , laser bandwith @xmath5  mhz ) is internally reflected from the gold - coated surface of a dielectric prism . the incident angle @xmath6 at which the laser hits the prism surface can be adjusted with a mirror mounted onto a mechanically driven translation stage ( ts ) . \n it shifts the beam relative to a lens which guides the beam to the prism surface . \n the position of the translation stage is monitored with an auxiliary laser beam and a position - sensitive diode ( psd ) . \n the guiding lens is the second lens in a @xmath7 telescope with the first lens being attached to the translation stage . by \n that the incident beam is collimated at the prism surface . at a characteristic plasmon angle @xmath8 surface plasmons \n are excited by the p - polarized fraction of the incoming light . \n the incident light is absorbed by the plasmon excitation and the reflectivity for p - polarized light @xmath9 drops to a minimum ( figure  fig : refl_phase ) . \n if rubidium atoms are adsorbed , the value of the plasmon angle shifts and the phase of the p - polarized fraction of the reflected light field @xmath10 changes . \n this phase change is monitored with a standard hnsch couillaud ( hc ) setup hansch_laser_1980 . \n a pi - servo electronics feeds the signal to an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) that controls the phase of the incident laser light @xcite . \n this locks the hnsch couillaud signal to zero such that the control - voltage at the eom is directly proportional to @xmath10 . \n the gold film on the prism surface has been fabricated by e - beam evaporation and has a thickness of approximately @xmath11 . \n below the gold film a very thin layer of titanium has been added for improving adhesion of the gold to the glass substrate . \n the prism is placed inside a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of @xmath12 and is mounted to a temperature controlled heating . \n the partial pressure of rb in the chamber is controlled by a resistively heated dispenser and can be raised within a few seconds up to several @xmath13 . \n laser induced desorption of rb atoms can be investigated with an additional blue laser beam at a wavelength near 406 nm and a maximum power of 20 mw ( laser 2)@xcite . \n the interpretation of our experiment is based on the observation that , according to brunauer , emmet and teller ( bet ) , only fractions of a monolayer can be adsorbed if the vapor pressure of an adsorbant is smaller than the saturation vapor pressure @xmath14 @xcite . \n thus the surface coverage @xmath15 only takes values between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 . \n we model the temporal change of the surface coverage by the rate equation @xmath19with a desorption constant @xmath20 , an inpinging flux of atoms on the surface @xmath21 , a typical area per adsorbed atom of @xmath22 and a sticking probability @xmath23 . \n the atomic flux hitting the surface is given by @xmath24 with the factor @xmath25 following from integrating the knudsen cosine law over a half sphere , the ideal gas vapor density @xmath26 and the thermal velocity of the atoms @xmath27 . \n for simplicity we define the flux per pressure @xmath28 in units of adsorbed monolayers via @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 . the sticking probability is taken from the langmuir model @xmath31 , with the initial sticking probability @xmath32 @xcite . \n note that @xmath23 vanishes for full coverage ( @xmath33 ) . \n this guaranties that only fractions of a monolayer can be adsorbed . with these definitions ( [ eq : rate_eq_1 ] ) reads @xmath34 in equilibrium ( @xmath35 ) the surface coverage is given by @xmath36the equilibrium coverage depends on the pressure in the chamber . \n if the pressure is rapidly changed the new equilibrium is exponentially reached within an @xmath37-timescale @xmath38as can be deduced from ( [ eq : rate_eq_2 ] ) . \n we measure the adsorption of rubidium with the above mentioned setup by two different methods . in the first method \n the incidence angle is scanned and from the obtained signal the position of the plasmon angle is determined . \n this method is applicable for a plasmon angle which changes only little during the scan time of approximately one minute . \n figure  [ fig : scans ] shows an example . \n the relation between the shift of the plasmon angle @xmath39 and the thickness of the adsorbed layer @xmath40 is taken from a four - layer matrix model ( layer 1 : glass substrate , layer 2 : gold film , layer 3 : rb adsorbate , layer 4 : vacuum ) which takes multiple reflections at the boundaries into account @xcite . with the dielectric constant of gold @xmath41 and rb @xmath42 @xcite \n the result is @xmath43 . \n the observed shift of the plasmon angle in figure  [ fig : scans ] of @xmath44 thus corresponds to an adsorbed rb layer thickness of @xmath45  nm . \n the second , more sensitive method records the phase @xmath10 with the incidence angle held fixed at the plasmon angle . \n adsorption and desorption of atoms can now be observed in real time by looking at the temporal change of the phase @xmath10 . for not too large variations of @xmath46 \n the relation between plasmon angle and phase is linear with a slope of @xmath47rad@xmath48 that is taken from the left curve in figure  [ fig : scans ] . \n note that after adsorption of rb ( right curve ) the slope is with @xmath49 slightly smaller . for large changes of the plasmon angle the working point \n is shifted from the linear regime to a regime where the phase change saturates . \n thus the second method can only be applied for small changes of the plasmon angle , unless the incidence angle is recalibrated . \n typical data are shown in figure  [ fig : adsorption_phase ] . in ( a ) \n the rb vapor pressure is quickly increased by activating the dispenser for about 80s ( curve ( ii ) ) . \n the pressure is determined with a standard ion - gauge . curve ( i ) shows the resulting change of the phase @xmath50 . during the pulsed increase of the vapor pressure \n the rubidium coverage also grows and remains at an increased value after the puls . \n figure  [ fig : adsorption_phase ] ( b ) shows a similar measurement with higher resolution which allows to estimate the sensitivity of the method . \n after low pass filtering the signal with an integration time of @xmath51  ms the noise of the phase signal is on the order of @xmath52  rad . at this noise level \n the uncertainty of the measured layer thickness is @xmath53  pm . with an average distance between two atoms given by twice the covalent radius of rb of @xmath54  pm \n , the sensitivity amounts to better than @xmath55 of an adsorbed monolayer . \n this sensitivity corresponds to a resolveable relative refractive index change of @xmath56 .    in the experiment \n the gold surface is heated to a temperature of @xmath57  c . \n the resulting rb saturation vapor pressure of @xmath58  mbar is one order of magnitude larger than the maximum rb vapor pressure in the experiment of @xmath59  mbar . \n the above assumption of a fractional coverage is thus well justified . in figure \n [ fig : desorption_angle ] the observed coverage @xmath60 is plotted during and after a temporal increase of the rb vapor pressure . during the first 20 min the pressure stays very much near a value of about @xmath61  mbar . the coverage growth rate at this pressure can be derived by linearly extrapolating the coverage increase with time . \n we obtain @xmath62 . putting this value into ( [ eq : rate_eq_2 ] ) and setting @xmath63 \n the initial sticking coefficient can be determined to be @xmath64 . \n after @xmath65 min we reduce the pressure back to a value of @xmath66  mbar . now the atoms thermally desorb and the coverage decays exponentially . \n the thermal desorption constant @xmath67 can be determined from ( [ eq : tau ] ) by measuring the 1/e decay time @xmath68 . \n fitting an exponential curve to the data yields @xmath69 \n s. for the desorption constant we obtain @xmath70 . in order to show the consistency of the model with the determined parameters the equilibrium coverage is calculated from ( eq : coverage_gg ) to be @xmath71 . \n this value is comparable to the observed value in figure  [ fig : desorption_angle ] of @xmath72 . \n the equilibrium coverage can be further reduced by exposing the surface to a laser beam with a wavelength near @xmath73 ( @xmath74 laserpower , beam diameter @xmath17  mm ) . \n figure  [ fig : desorption_laser ] shows the resulting change of the surface coverage @xmath75 . \n as soon as the blue laser is turned on , the coverage decreases in time with a rate of @xmath76 . \n the total desorption coefficient is now the sum of the thermal and the laser - induced desorption coefficient @xmath77 . with ( [ eq : rate_eq_2 ] ) and for @xmath78 and a pressure of @xmath79 \n mbar the total desorption coefficient amounts to @xmath80 . \n this results in a pure laser - induced desorption rate of @xmath81 at a laser power of @xmath74 . \n the new equilibrium coverage of @xmath82 is reached witin a @xmath37  time of @xmath83  s. \n we have applied a recently introduced method @xcite for detecting de- and adsorption phenomena by means of phase - sensitive detection of a surface plasmon resonance to rubidium on a gold surface . \n adsorption and desorption of rb were observed and interpreted with a rate model . \n we reach a sensitivity of better than @xmath0 of a monolayer , respectively a refractive index unit change of @xmath84  riu within an integration time of @xmath85  ms . \n this is comparable to typical sensitivities reached with surface plasmon resonance sensors @xcite . \n the observed sensitivity in this paper is limited by technical noise which leaves much room for substantial improvement , e.g. by a shot - noise limited detection scheme , by suppression of laser frequency noise , and by longer integration time . as has been shown in @xcite , a resolution of @xmath86  riu within an integration time of @xmath87  s seam feasible even far above the shot - noise limit . \n such a sensitivity exceeds the best values reported for converntional detectors , e.g. in @xcite . by comparing the experimental data with a langmuir type adsorption model we find a desorption constant of @xmath88 and an initial sticking probability @xmath64 . \n laser - assisted desorption has been observed . \n a desorption coefficient of @xmath89 is determined for a laser power of @xmath90  mw . \n we acknowledge financial support by the dfg within the euroquasar program of the esf and thank a. hemmerich for inspiring discussions . \n 99 knig t , weidemller m and hemmerich a 2008 _ appl . \n b _ * 93 * 545", "StartTimeOffset": 500252771946, "RequestID": "5995ede9e8310405160a01e0fc8e8e4b3bf06beb", "TotalTokens": 3464}
{"ContextTokens": 3189, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "the glasses and colloids are interesting examples of out of equilibrium systems where the relaxation towards the equilibrium may last much more than a reasonable observation time . \n one of the problem which has been widely theoretically studied is the definition of an effective temperature @xmath0 in these systems using the fluctuation dissipation relation ( fdr ) . \n this relation is an extension of the fluctuation dissipation theorem for an out of equilibrium system and @xmath0 is defined as the ratio between the correlation and the response function@xcite . using numerical simulations \n it has been shown that in several models for out of equilibrium systems the effective temperature defined via fdr is higher than the temperature of the thermal bath and it is a good definition of temperature in the thermodynamic sense . \n however the experimental results are more confused . \n it has been observed that @xmath0 in polymer , spin glasses and colloids may depend on the experimental conditions . \n for example in the dielectric measurements in polymer @xmath0 depends on the quenching rate and it may be huge because of the presence of intermittent bursts . the same behavior is observed on mechanical variables . instead in a colloid ( laponite ) during the sol - gel transition the electric observables give a @xmath0 which is quite large whereas measurements done on thermal rheometer indicate that within experimental errors there is no violation of the fluctuation theorem because the @xmath0 is always equal to the temperature of the thermal bath.(a discussion on the @xmath0 obtained from dielectric measurements and mechanical measurements can be found in ref.@xcite ) . \n the rheological measurement described in ref.@xcite was a global measurement and one may wonder whether an experiment of microrheology give or not the same results . \n this experiment can be performed using as a probe a brownian particle using active and passive microrheology . \n these kind of experiments are interesting also from another point of view because one may studies whether the properties of the brownian motion are affected by the fact that the surrounding fluid ( the thermal bath ) is out of equilibrium . \n several experiments of brownian motion inside a laponite solution have been done by different groups using various techniques . \n the results are rather contradictory . \n let us resume them . \n abou et al . \n find an increase and then a decrease of @xmath0 as a function of time @xcite . \n bartelett et al . \n find an increase of @xmath0 @xcite . \n in contrast jabbari - farouji et al . do not observe any change and confirm the results on the thermal rheometer of ref @xcite . \n the purpose of this article is to describe the results of the measurement of the brownian motion of a particle inside a laponite solution using a combination of different techniques proposed in previous references . \n all the techniques do not show , within experimental errors , any increase of @xmath0 which remains equal to that of the thermal bath for all the duration of the sol - gel transition . \n thus the result of this papers agrees with those of jabbari - farouji et al . @xcite and of bellon \n et al . @xcite . \n the article is organized as follow . in section 2 \n we describe the experimental apparatus and the various techniques used to measure response and fluctuations . in section 3 we describe the experimental results of the various experimental techniques . in section 4 \n we discuss the result and we conclude . \n we measure the fluctuations of the position of one or several silica beads trapped by an optical tweezers during the aging of the laponite . \n the laser beam ( @xmath1=980 nm ) is focused by a microscope objective ( @xmath263 ) 20 @xmath3 m above the cover - slip surface to create a harmonic potential well where a bead of 1 or 2 @xmath3 m in diameter ( @xmath4 ) is trapped . \n we can trap several beads if the laser is rapidly swept from a position to another to form a multi trap system . \n the laponite mass concentration is varied from 1.2 to 3% wt for different ionic strengths . \n these conditions allow us to obtain either a gel or a glass according to the phase diagramm found in the literature @xcite . \n the laponite is filtered with a 0.45 @xmath3 m filter to avoid the formation of aggregates . \n the aging time @xmath5 is measured since the end of this filtering process . \n particular attention has been paid in the cell construction indeed the properties of the laponite are very sensitive to the experimental conditions . first the laponite solution is prepared under nitrogen atmosphere and second the cell is completely sealed using gene frame adhesive spacers in order to avoid evaporation and the use of vacuum grease , used in other experiments . \n indeed this grease , whose ph is much smaller than 10 , quickens the evolution of the suspension . in order to measure @xmath0 for the particle motion two techniques \n have been used . the first one is based on the laser modulation technique as proposed in ref.@xcite . \n the second is based on the kramers - kronig relations with two laser intensities and it combines the advantages of two methods one proposed in ref.@xcite and in ref.@xcite .      following the method used in @xcite , the stiffness of the optical trap is periodically switched between two different values ( @xmath6 pn/@xmath3 m and @xmath7 pn/@xmath3 m ) every 61 seconds by changing the laser intensity . \n the position of the bead is recorded by a quadrant photodiode at the rate of 8192 hz , then we compute the variance of the position over the whole signal , @xmath8 , where the brackets stand for average over the time . to avoid transients , \n each record is started 20 seconds after the laser switch to be sure that the system has relaxed toward a quasi stationary state . assuming the equipartition principle still holds in this out - of - equilibrium system , the @xmath0 is computed as in @xcite the expression of the effective temperature and of the laponite elastic stiffness @xmath9 is the following : @xmath10 @xmath11    this technique , although quite interesting and simple , has the important drawback that , being a global measurement , it has no control of what is going on the different frequencies . to overcome this problem \n we have used the following method . \n this combines the laser modulation technique described in the previous section and the passive rheology technique based on kramers - kronig relations . \n the fluctuation dissipation relations relate the spectrum @xmath12 of the fluctuation of the particle position to the imaginary part @xmath13 of the response of the particle to an external force , specifically :    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the spectra measured with the trap stiffness @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . \n we recall that for a particle inside a newtonian fluid @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the fluid viscosity . in eq . \n [ eq : fdr ] the dependence in @xmath5 takes into account the fact that the properties of the fluid changes after the preparation of the laponite . if one assumes that @xmath0 is constant as a function of frequency ( hypothesis that can be easily checked a posteriori ) then the real part @xmath22 of the response is related to @xmath13 by the kramers - kronig relations @xcite that is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for principal part of the integral and assumed that @xmath25 to write the second equality using eq . \n [ eq : fdr ] \n . however it can be easily ( details will be given in a longer report ) shown that using the two measurements at @xmath17 and @xmath18 we get : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . \n it is clear that if one finds a dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath28 this method can not be used because @xmath29 is not simply proportional to @xmath30 as assumed in eq . \n [ eq : krkr ] . \n [ fig : spectra]a ) shows the power spectra of the particle fluctuations inside laponite at concentration measured at four different @xmath5 with the trap stiffness @xmath6 pn/@xmath3 m . \n we see that as time goes on the low frequency component of the spectrum increases . that is the frequency cut - off @xmath31 decreases mainly because of the increasing of the viscosity . at very long time \n this cut - off is well below @xmath32 . in fig . \n [ fig : spectra]b ) we plot the variance of the particle measured for the same data of fig . [ \n fig : spectra]a ) on time windows of length @xmath33 s. the variance remains constant for a very long time and they begin to decrease because of the increase o the gel stiffness . using these data and eq . \n [ eq : temperature ] and eq . \n [ eq : klap ] one can compute @xmath0 and @xmath9 . the results for @xmath0 and @xmath9 are shown in fig . [ \n fig : teff]a ) and [ fig : teff]b ) respectively . \n we find that @xmath0 is constant at the beginning and is very close to @xmath34 k , then when the jamming occurs , that is when @xmath9 increases , it becomes more scattered without any clear increase with @xmath5 , contrary to ref . \n we now make several remarks . \n first , we point out that the uncertainty of their results are underestimated . \n the error bars in fig . \n [ fig : teff]a ) are here evaluated from the standard deviation of the variance using eq .  2 in ref @xcite at the time @xmath5 . \n although they are small for short time @xmath5 , ( @xmath35 ) , they increase for large @xmath5 . \n this is a consequence of the increase of variabilities of @xmath36 as the colloidal glass forms . \n this point is not discussed in in ref . \n @xcite and we think that the measurement errors are of the same order or larger than the observed effect . \n the results depend on the length of the analyzing time window and the use of the principle of energy equipartition becomes questionable for the following reasons . \n first , these analyzing windows can not be made too large because the viscoelastic properties of laponite evolve as a function of time . \n second , the corner frequency of the global trap ( optical trap and gel ) , the ratio of the trap stiffness to viscosity , decreases continuously mainly because of the increase of viscosity . at the end of the experiment \n , the power spectrum density of the displacement of the bead shows that the corner frequency is lower than @xmath37 hz . \n we thus observe long lived fluctuations , which could not be taken into account with short measuring times . \n this problem is shown on fig . \n [ fig : teff]b ) . \n we split our data into equal time duration @xmath38 , compute the variance and average the results of all samples . \n the dotted line represents the duration 3.3 s chosen in @xcite . at the beginning of the experiment , \n the variance of the displacement is constant for any reasonable durations of measurement . \n however , we clearly see that this method produces an underestimate of @xmath39 for long aging times , specially when the viscoelasticity of the gel becomes important . \n long lived fluctuations are then ignored . \n this new method , using kramers - kronig relation , allows us to test the dependence of the effective temperature on the frequency . \n the figure [ fig : krkr]a ) shows the real part of @xmath40 , which corresponds to the global elastic modulus of the gel and of the laser , for both trap stiffness . \n this numerical method is very sensitive to the spectrum . \n thus , before computing the elastic modulus , we average the spectrum to obtain smooth curves . \n the uncertainties would then misplace the curve rather than produce a noisy curve . \n the increase with time is consistent with the increase of the strength of the gel . \n the elastic behavior of the laponite is also more pronounced at high frequency . \n the last decrease of the curves at very high frequencies is due to the numerical method . \n indeed , the frequency cutoff should be set at least a decade below the frequency of the data acquisition : data above 200 hz is not reliable . \n we see that the curves of each stiffness are well separated except at the end of the measurement , where the results are not accurate due to the large difference between the optical stiffness and the laponite stiffness .    from these data , we compute the ratio of the effective temperature to the bath temperature along the ageing process . \n these results are shown on fig . \n [ fig : krkr]b ) for three different frequencies ( @xmath41 hz , 10 hz and 100 hz ) . \n we first note that the three curves are almost identical . \n this means that the effective temperature does not depends on the frequency . \n second , the temperature ratio is close to 1 . \n the dispersion of the data is rather small at early times and again increases when the stiffness of the gel overcomes those of the optical trap . \n this comes from the uncertainties on the elastic modulus which become larger than the difference between the two curves . \n this dispersion may also give , for very long time , negative temperatures , not shown in fig . [ \n fig : krkr]b ) which is an expanded view . \n even if this method is here less accurate than the previous one , it allows us to verify that the effective temperature is the same for all frequencies . \n finally , a remark has to be made concerning the mean position of the bead during aging . \n when the stiffness of the gel becomes comparable to the optical one , the bead starts to move away from the centre the optical trap . \n we observe a drift of the bead position at long time , which could lead to the escape of the bead . \n moreover we have performed simultaneous measurements with a multiple trap using a fast camera showing that at very long @xmath5 the mean trajectories of beads separated by 7 @xmath3 m are almost identical . \n this proves that one must pay attention when interpreting such measurements , specially on the duration of measurements . \n we also have seen that the way the sample is sealed can accelerate the formation of the gel and the drift of the bead by changing the chemical properties in the small sample . \n we have used different types of cell , laponite concentrations , bead sizes , stiffness of the optical trap . in each case \n we do not find any increase of the effective temperature .    in conclusion , \n our results show no increase of @xmath0 in laponite and are in agreement with those of jabbari - farouji @xcite , who measured fluctuations and responses of the bead displacement in laponite over a wide range of frequency and found that @xmath0 is equal to the bath temperature . \n this work has been partially supported by anr-05-blan-0105 - 01 .", "StartTimeOffset": 509779349874, "RequestID": "e144bf81c081e8715813d8d90b6fc1b4e8a46e86", "TotalTokens": 3314}

fit value depends on various aspects of the calculations that are not fully constrained , and this introduces uncertainty in any extraction from data . \n although these uncertainties have been the target of significant investigation , it has so far been done in a piecemeal fashion  @xcite . \n no one has yet attempted to compile this information in a systematic study of all sources of uncertainty in order to place a robust and reliable upper bound on @xmath0 . \n in addition , the conjectured bound is now known not to be universal , so it is of great interest to determine if one can place a lower bound on the quantity . \n currently , there is no convincing evidence that measured data can not be reproduced with ideal hydrodynamics , and in fact most flow data can be reproduced quite well in such calculations  @xcite . in these proceedings \n we present a proposal for how to extract @xmath0 with the smallest uncertainty currently possible , as well as preliminary results on such an extraction including a quantitative error bar obtained by systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty . \n , mc - kln  @xcite v3.43 and its glauber implementation [ glauber ( discs ) ] , mckt - v1.25 with negative binomial fluctuations  @xcite ( mcrcbk ( nb ) ) , dipsy  @xcite , and urqmd  @xcite . ]    in a standard picture of a heavy - ion collision , the asymmetric region of overlap in a collision between two nuclei results in a anisotropy in the transverse density of the system at early times . over time \n , this spatial anisotropy is transformed into a momentum anisotropy by a collective response that is well described by ( viscous ) hydrodynamics . \n in fact , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 is ( to a good approximation ) directly proportional to this initial eccentricity in a given collision event : @xmath4 . \n the proportionality constant depends sensitively on the viscosity of the medium , however , poor knowledge of the earliest stages of the collision result in significant uncertainty in @xmath5 see , for example , the top left panel of fig . \n [ ecc ] , which shows root - mean - square values of @xmath5 from a number of commonly - used models for initial conditions measurements are sensitive to the rms value of the event - by - event distribution of @xmath6 . \n the resulting uncertainty in @xmath3 has been the largest source of uncertainty when determining @xmath0 from data  @xcite . \n though there has been much recent study concerning the physics of the early stages of a collision  @xcite , it is not yet possible to make a reliable statement about what range of values of initial eccentricity are within the realm of possibility . \n it is now known that quantum fluctuations are also a significant source of anisotropy in the initial state , and therefore anisotropic flow . \n this is especially apparent from the presence of large odd harmonics , such as triangular flow @xmath7 , which is generated from a spatial `` triangularity '' , defined similarly to the eccentricity @xmath8 this would be zero at midrapidity in the absence of event - by - event fluctuations . \n the triangularity that one sees in a calculation is largely determined by the strength of these fluctuations . \n in contrast , the differences in particle production mechanisms that lead to very different @xmath5 in non - central collisions has very little effect on @xmath9 . \n compare , for example , the triangularities of the mc - kln model versus glauber ( discs ) in fig . \n [ ecc ] , which contain only fluctuations from random position of nucleons in the colliding nuclei , implemented in exactly the same way in the mc - kln code . \n the triangularity @xmath9 is very similar , despite the fact that the two pictures of particle production result in a very different eccentricity @xmath5 .    by comparing the results from other models , \n it is clear that there still remains some uncertainty due to different way fluctuations are implemented . despite the seemingly modest reduction in uncertainty ( as compared to the uncertainty in @xmath5 ) , one can reasonably argue that the results in the second panel of fig . \n [ ecc ] represent the full range of results that can be expected , in marked contrast to the results in the first panel . \n the models with the lowest triangularity are known to be missing important sources of fluctuations , while the large fluctuations in the models with the largest @xmath9 can not be reconciled with constraints from @xmath10 measurements  @xcite . \n one might thus propose to extract @xmath0 from measurements of @xmath7 to minimize uncertainty from the initial conditions . \n however , we can make use of more experimental constraints by noting that in the most central collisions , all harmonics are generated entirely from fluctuations , and the above discussion still applies . \n one further convenient factor is that , for ultra - central collisions , the approximate proportionality @xmath11 holds for all @xmath12  @xcite . \n this allows for a comprehensive parameter study with reasonable computing resources . \n thus , our proposal is to extract @xmath0 from a simultaneous fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements from ultra -

squares fit to find the preferred value . if a particular parameter is uncertain , one can vary that parameter within the allowed range and redo the fit . \n the shift of best - fit @xmath0 indicates the size of the resulting error bar in @xmath0 due to this particular source of uncertainty . \n if one then varies all possible aspects of the theory in all possible combinations , the smallest and the largest extracted values thus represent a robust , if conservative , upper and lower error bar for the quantity . \n this is the idea behind the preliminary results shown at this conference . \n details will be given in a forthcoming publication , but an example fit for a calculation using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters but different initial conditions is shown in fig . \n it is notable that hydrodynamics can , in fact , simultaneously give a good description of all @xmath13 . \n however , it is also interesting to note the tendency for tension in the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath7 for all initial conditions tested . \n we reported a preliminary result of @xmath16 , but a few comments are in order . \n first , the calculations used a constant value of @xmath0 during the hydrodynamic evolution . \n therefore , the result is an average value that corresponds to the viscosity at the typical time when flow is built up . \n the lower bound indicates that purely ideal hydrodynamic calculations can not describe these data . \n this is a significant result . \n however , it is technically possible that the viscosity could dip below our lower bound at some point during the evolution , so this result does _ not _ represent a lower bound for the viscosity of qcd over its entire temperature range . \n second , since it has never before been done , we want to be confident at every stage that we have a robust and reliable error bar . \n the preliminary result , therefore , is fairly conservative , and the error bar will likely be smaller in the final result after further study . \n we argue that at the current time , the most precise value for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 of the quark - gluon plasma can be obtained by a fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements in ultra - central collisions . \n we further report preliminary results such an extraction , including an error bar from a systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty . \n we thank the phobos collaboration , adrian dumitru , yasushi nara , and christoffer flensburg for providing their code to the public , which allowed us to calculate the eccentricities in various montre -

{"ContextTokens": 3038, "GeneratedTokens": 59, "SynthesizedBody": "contact interactions have been studied thoroughly in non - relativistic quantum mechanics . \n different studies have illustrated some of the analogies between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory @xcite . \n nevertheless , the analogies are still to a large extent ambiguous . in our opinion , studying contact interactions relativistically give a better chance for understanding the relation between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , especially quantum field theory is basically a theory for describing the interaction of relativistic particles . \n the problem of relativistic @xmath0-function potential has been studied in the mathematical literature in the context of the theory of self - adjoint extensions of pseudo - differential operators @xcite . lately , we studied the problem by directly solving the relativistic version of the schrdinger equation of the hamiltonian @xmath1 in 1-d @xcite . unlike the textbook case of the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential , the relativistic problem gives rise to ultra - violet divergences that required regularization and renormalization . \n previously , we used dimensional regularization to show that the system has remarkable features . \n for example , the relatively simple system shares many features with some complex quantum field theories , like asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation in the massless limit , and it also possesses an infra - red conformal fixed point .    in quantum field theory \n it is well known that in some cases , different regularization methods give different results for the same problem @xcite . \n this is also the case for non - local quantum field theories @xcite . in @xcite \n , it was shown that for the non - relativistic @xmath0- function potential in odd @xmath2 , the dimensional regularization gives different results than the cutoff regularization , provided that the calculation is done in a non - perturbative setting .    in the case of the relativistic schrdinger equation , \n the hamiltonian is nonlocal unlike the non - relativistic case . \n a naive guess would tell us that for this case , and for a certain problem , different regularization methods give different results . \n however , in this paper we prove that this is not the case for the solution of the relativistic schrdinger equation for a point particle in an external 1-dimensional @xmath0-function potential . \n we study the solution in a non - perturbative setting using cutoff regularization . \n it gives exactly the same results from our previous calculations using dimensional regularization . \n this important because it is an evidence of universality . \n the rest of this paper is organized as the following : section 2 is for studying the bound state problem non - relativistically and relativistically using contour integrals . \n section 3 is for discussing the gap equation and cutoff regularization , and using the bound state energy to define a renormalization condition . \n section 4 for studying the scattering state problem non - relativistically and relativistically with the use of contour integrals , and defining the energy - dependence of the running coupling constant . \n section 5 is for the conclusions . \n the non - relativistic solution of the schrdinger equation for the @xmath0-function potential is a textbook problem . \n nevertheless , we discuss it briefly to highlight the similarities and differences between the non - relativistic and relativistic case , especially regarding the contour integration approach used to calculate the wave function in both cases . \n the schrdinger equation for this case is @xmath3 in momentum space , the above equation takes the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5 accordingly , in coordinate space the wave function for the bound state is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the binding energy , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the bound state energy . the value of @xmath10 in the above equation can be obtained using contour integral . \n the contour in this case has one pole inside the upper half circle at @xmath11 , as it is illustrated in figure.1 top panel . for the non -

strong bound state with energy @xmath44 the series diverges . \n still , the result can be obtained by directly integrating the convergent expression , and taking the limit @xmath38 @xmath45 as a renormalization condition , we fix the binding energy @xmath9 in units of the mass @xmath46 , such that the running bare coupling is given by @xmath47 at the non -

{"ContextTokens": 3430, "GeneratedTokens": 226, "SynthesizedBody": "billiards play a predominant role in the study of classical and quantum chaos@xcite . \n indeed , the nature of quantum chaos in a specific system is traditionally inferred from its its classical counterpart . \n hence one may ask if quantum chaos is to be understood solely as a phenomenon that emerges in the classical limit , or are there some intrinsically quantal phenomena , which can contribute to irregular behavior in the quantum domain ? this is a question we raise in connection with quantum transport through ideal regular and irregular electron billiards . \n the seminal studies by mcdonald and kauffmann @xcite of the morphology of eigenstates in a closed bunimovich stadium have revealed characteristic patterns of disordered , undirectional and non - crossing nodal lines . here \n we will first discuss what will happen to patterns like these when input and output leads are attached to a billiard , regular or irregular , and an electric current is induced through the the billiard by an applied voltage between the two leads . \n for such an open system the wave function @xmath0 is now a scattering state with both real and imaginary parts , each of which gives rise to separate sets of nodal lines at which either @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath2 $ ] vanish . \n how will the patterns of nodal lines evolve as , e.g. , the energy of injected electrons is increased , i.e. , more scattering channels become open . \n could they tell us something about how the perturbing leads reduce symmetry and how an initially regular billiard may eventually turn into a chaotic one as the number open modes increase ? \n below we will argue that nodal points , i.e. , the points at which the two sets of nodal lines intersect because @xmath1=im[\\psi]=0 $ ] , carry important information in this respect . \n thus we will study their spatial distributions and try to characterize chaos in terms of such distributions . \n the question we wish to ask is simply if one can find a distinct difference between the distributions for nominally regular and irregular cavities . \n in addition , which other signatures of quantum chaos may one find in the coherent transport in open billiards ? \n the spatial distribution of nodal points play a decisive role in how the flow pattern is shaped . \n therefore we will also study the general behavior of streamlines derived from the probability current associated with a stationary scattering state @xmath3 the time independent schrdinger equation can be decomposed as@xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 the separate quantum streamlines are sometimes referred to as bohm trajectories@xcite . in this alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics \n it is thought that an electron is a `` real '' particle that follows a continuous and causally defined trajectory ( streamline ) with a well defined position @xmath6 with the velocity of the particle given by the expressions above . \n these equations imply that the electron moves under the action of a force which is not obtained entirely from the classical potential @xmath7 , but also contains a `` quantum mechanical '' potential @xmath8    this quantum potential is negatively large where the wave function is small , and becomes infinite at the nodal points of the wave function where @xmath9 . \n therefore , the close vicinity of a nodal point constitutes a forbidden area for quantum streamlines contributing to the net transport from source to drain . \n when @xmath10 does not vanish , @xmath11 is single valued and continuous . \n however at the nodal point where @xmath12 , neither @xmath13 nor @xmath14 is well defined . the behavior of @xmath13 around these nodal points is discussed in a @xcite . for our study \n the main important property of the nodal points of @xmath0 is that the probability current flows described by open streamlines can not encircle a nodal point . on the contrary , they are effectively repelled from the close vicinity of the nodal points , in a way as if these were impurities . \n the scattering wave functions @xmath0 are found by solving the schrdinger equation in a tight - binding approximation with the neumann boundary conditions outside the billiards , on a distance over which evanescent modes effectively decay to zero . \n the energy of the incident electron is @xmath15 where @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the fermi energy , @xmath18 the width of the channel , and @xmath19 the effective mass . \n an inspection of the two sets of nodal lines associated with the real and imaginary parts of the scattering wave function reveals the typical pattern of undirectional , self - avoiding nodal lines found already by mcdonald and kauffmann @xcite for an isolated , irregular billiard . \n however , in our case of a complex scattering function the nodal lines are not uniquely defined because a multiplication of the wave function by an arbitrary constant phase factor exp@xmath20 would yield a different pattern . \n the nodal points , on the other hand , appear to helpful in this respect . \n they represent a new aspect of the open system and will obviously remain fixed upon a change of the phase of wave function . here \n we conjecture that the nodal points may serve as unique markers which should useful for a quantitative characterization of scattering wave functions for open systems .    to be more specific , \n we have considered a large number of realizations ( samples ) of nodal points associated with different kinds of billiards and present averaged normalized distributions of nearest distances between the nodal points . \n [ fig1 ] shows the distributions for open sinai ( a ) , bunimovich ( b ) and rectangular billiards ( c , d ) . \n the distributions are obtained as an average over 101 different values of energy belonging to a specific energy window in which the conductance undergoes a few oscillations as shown by the insets in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . the cases ( a , b , c ) present two channel transmission through the billiards while the case ( d ) refers to five channel transmission . \n the rectangular billiard is nominally maximal in area with numerical size @xmath21 and with width of leads equal to 10 . \n it is noteworthy that the distribution of nearest neighbors is distinctly different from the corresponding distribution for random points in the two - dimensional plane @xcite @xmath22 where a density @xmath10 of random points is related to mean separation @xmath23 as @xmath24 . \n this distribution is shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a ) by the thin line indicating an underlying correlation between the nodal points of transport wave function through the sinai billiard . in this sense quantum chaos is not randomness .    with slight deviations the bunimovich billiard gives rise to the same distributions as the sinai as shown by fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) . \n analysis of the distributions for lower energies ( @xmath25 , one channel transmission ) gives quite similar universal forms as shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) , but with more pronounced fluctuations because the number of nodal points is less at lower energies . \n moreover the average over wider energy domains with a finer grid or for higher energies gives no visible deviations from the distributions in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) . \n we considered also the berry s wave function of a chaotic billiard which is accepted as standart measure of quantum chaos @xcite : @xmath26\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent random variables . \n we found that distribution of nearest distances between the nodal points of ( 2 ) has completely the same form as for the sinai billiard fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a ) . on the other hand an analysis of nodal points of wave function @xmath29 with \n @xmath30 distributed randomly leads to the distribution ( 1 ) of random points .    to supplement the averaging over energy we have also considered the positions of leads . \n [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows the normalized distribution of the nearest distances between nodal points for the sinai billiard obtained as an average over 101 positions of the input lead . as seen this distribution has the same form as the energy averaged sinai billiard in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a ) . in the same way fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( b ) shows the corresponding case of the bunimovich billiard with an asymmetric input lead to be compared with fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( b ) . \n the unsymmetric arrangement of leads allows a larger number of eigenstates of the bunimovich to participate in the electron transport because symmetry restrictions are relaxed@xcite .    on the basis of figs . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] and comparison with the berry s wave function ( 2 ) we therefore argue that there is a universal distribution that characterizes open chaotic billiards . at this stage \n we conclude that the form of the distributions is not sensitive to the averaging procedure , to the number of channels of electron transmission and to the type of attachment of leads . \n the mathematical form of the universal distribution constitues an interesting problem that remains to be solved . \n so does a derivation of the random distribution associated with wave function in eq . \n let us now turn to the case of the nominally regular rectangular billiard . in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c ) the distribution functions are given for the case of two - channel transmission with the same energy averaging procedure as for the chaotic billiards . \n the nearest neighbor distribution clearly displays a peak corresponding to a regular set of nodal points in contrast to other billiards discussed above . \n this feature is found even for very high energies around 250 ( five - channel transmission ) . \n therefore the rectangular dot with the two symmetrically attached leads displays considerable stability with respect to regular nodal points in contrast to the chaotic sinai and bunimovich billiards . \n as indicated , symmetric leads impose restrictions on how states inside the billiard are selected and mixed on injection of a particle . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( c ) the result of averaging over the positions of the input lead is therefore shown for the rectangular billiard at a fixed energy chosen from the energy domain in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c ) . \n as may be expected the pronounced peak in the distribution function of nearest nodal points has now disappeared . \n moreover , the distribution is close to the case of the bunimovich billiard in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( b ) and fig .  [ fig2 ] ( b ) . \n evidently the non symmetrical positioning of leads disturb the nominally regular billiard in a much more profound way , effectively rendering it chaotic characteristics . to reconfirm this conclusion \n we have also performed calculations of distribution of nodal points within the same energy domain and the same number of energy steps as in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c ) but for non symmetrical positions of the input lead . \n in fact , the distribution function of nearest distances in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( d ) demonstrates the close similarity with the position average of the nodal points . \n therefore the non universal behavior of the distribution function of nodal points for the rectangular billiard shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c , d ) is the result of only a few symmetrical eigenstates taking part in the transmission because of symmetry restrictions .    in order to give a quantitative measure of disorder of nodal point patterns we consider the shannon entropy @xmath13@xcite normalized for each specific billiard by the entropy of fully random points . \n numerical values for @xmath13 are specified in figs . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] . \n as may be expected there is a clear tendency towards maximal entropy for chaotic billiards for the same energy window . \n a similar tendency is clearly seen for the position average ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . a case of rectangular billiard with entropy 0.95 fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( d ) is beyond of this rule because for the five - channel transmission the number of nodal points substantially exceeds other considered cases irrespective of type of billiard . \n thus the shannon entropy of nodal points is important additional quantitative measure of quantum chaos for the quantum transport through billiards . \n as mentioned above streamlines are strongly affected by the positions of nodal points . \n superficially they play the role of impurities . \n it is therfore interesting issue if streamlines behave differently for regular and irregular situations and for this reason we will consider a few typical examples starting with two well defined systems , the nominally regular rectangle and the irregular sinai billiard . \n [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows the flow lines in the case of the rectangular billiard . \n the features of the flow lines connecting input and output leads are remarkable . \n it is clearly seen how the flow ( trajectories ) effectively channel through a nodal crystal avoiding the individual nodal points . \n this picture is evidently very different from semi - classical physics and periodic orbit theory@xcite . in fig . \n [ fig3 ] only contributions to the net current are displayed . \n in addition there are also vortical motions centered around each nodal point . \n the other extreme , the completely chaotic sinai billiard , is shown in fig . \n [ fig3 ] ( b ) . because the nodal distribution is now irregular also the streamlines form an irregular pattern when finding their way through the rough potential landscape . \n since a streamline can not cross itself fig . \n [ fig3 ] brings to mind the classical example of meandering rivers in a flat delta landscape . as well known , slight changes in the topography , for example , by moving only a few obstacles to new positions , \n may induce completely new flow patterns in a sometimes dramatic ways . in the same way slight variations of the energy , for example , \n may affect the quantum streamlines in the sinai billiard in an endless way , occasionally forming more collected bunches connecting the two leads in a more focused way than in fig . \n [ fig3 ] ( b ) . \n the same type of behavior has also been obtained for a two - dimensional ring in which a tiny variation of external magnetic flux induce drastic changes of the flowlines and , as a consequence , aharonov - bohm oscillations become irregular@xcite . \n this work has been partially supported by the intas - rfbr grant 95-in - ru-657 , rffi grant 97 - 02 - 16305 and the swedish natural science research council . \n the computations were in part performed at the national supercomputer centre at linkping university . \n j.o.hirschfelder , c.j.goebel , and l.w.bruch , j. chem . phys . * 61 * , 5456 ( 1974 ) . \n holland , `` the quantum theory of motion . \n an account of the de broglie - bohm causal interpretation of quantum mechanics '' ( cambridge university press , cambridge , 1993 ) . \n h. wu and d.w.l . \n sprung , phys . \n a183 * , 413 ( 1993 ) . \n p. exner , p. eba , a.f . \n sadreev , p. streda and p. feher , phys . \n lett . , * 80 * , 1710 ( 1998 ) . \n b.i.shklovskii and a.l.efros , `` elctronic properties of doped semiconductors '' , springer - werlag , 1984 , chapter 3 . \n j.r.eggert , phys . rev . * \n b29 * , 6664 ( 1984 ) . \n m.v . berry , phil . \n roy.soc a287 , 237 ( 1971 ) . \n i.v . zozoulenko and k .- f . \n berggren , phys . \n b * 56 * , 1 ( 1997 ) . \n a.garcimartin , a.guarino , l.bellon , and s.giliberto , phys . \n rev . lett.*79 * , 3202 ( 1997 ) . \n m. brack and r.k . \n badhuri , `` semiclassical physics '' , addison - wesley , 1997 ) k.n . \n pichugin and a.f . \n sadreev , phys . \n b , * 56 * , 9662 ( 1997 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 548180408670, "RequestID": "7265db1ea0f3f9d3cde5fad2d5ce3c6852ad0d7f", "TotalTokens": 3656}
{"ContextTokens": 2300, "GeneratedTokens": 172, "SynthesizedBody": "modern technology uses extensively ferroic materials i.e . having a spontaneous and permanent order parameter of one kind or another with fairly exotic properties . \n for example , commodity data - storage devices exploit ferromagnets with giant magnetoresistance in magnetic random - access memories , in a continued push toward increased information density and reduced dimensions and writing energy . besides their traditional use in sensors and actuators , ferroelectrics with their permanent and switchable electrical polarization are the building block of non - volatile , high speed , random - access memories which promise performances superior to semiconductor flash memories .    while their existence has been known since the 1960s , multiferroics , i.e. materials where polarization p and magnetization m coexist @xcite , have enjoyed a renaissance in recent years , because of great improvements in growth techniques and new theoretical approaches \n . the coexistence of several order parameters and their mutual coupling may open the way to new device concepts , including the electrical addressing of magnetic memories without magnetic fields and their generating currents ; the creation of multi - layer multi - state logical devices , exploiting combinations of polarization and magnetization ; and magnetoelectric sensors . \n however , most of the current multiferroics lack sufficiently strong polarization or magnetization , or sufficient magnetoelectric coupling , or the correct kind of magnetic order ( ferromagnets are desired , but antiferromagnets are much more common ) .    some of the difficulties of single - phase multiferroics are bypassed by `` metamultiferroics '' built of multilayer heterostructures of ferromagnets and ferroelectrics @xcite , as for example in multiferroic tunnel junctions ( mftj ) , where ferromagnetic electrodes are separated by a ferroelectric insulating barrier . \n the resistance against tunneling across the junction depends on the relative orientation of magnetization of the two electrodes ( magnetoresistance ) and on the direction of ferroelectric polarization of the insulating layer ( electroresistance ) . \n this enables in principle a 4-level switchable resistance using external electric and magnetic fields . \n of course , a further magnetic degree of freedom in the insulating - barrier material could potentially duplicate the number of states , and any chance of locally tuning the magnetization would add further design leeway . following this line of thought , in this paper we report an _ ab initio _ investigation strongly suggesting that pbtio@xmath0 ( pto ) doped with v ( v : pto ) is a ferromagnetic small - gap insulator , hence a proper multiferroic . \n this is particularly interesting in view of the giant electroresistance effect predicted in tunnel junctions with pto as ferroelectric tunnel layer @xcite . \n here we report the first principles prediction of a multiferroic state of lead titanate doped with magnetic vanadium . \n pto is a well - known tetragonal perovskite with a high spontaneous polarization ( 86 @xmath2c/@xmath3 ) of displacive origin . \n pbvo@xmath0 also happens to be tetragonal , and with an even higher spontaneous polarization ( 152 @xmath2c/@xmath3 ) . \n previous studies have shown its ground state to be an antiferromagnetic insulator ( c - type ) , making it not especially interesting as a multiferroic . \n motivated by our previous study of v - doped ferroelectric titanates @xcite , we examine the magnetic properties of vanadium diluted within the robust pto ferroelectric .    _ ab initio _ calculations are performed within density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew - wang using the paw method @xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . \n standard cutoff is used for the plane wave basis , and the k - point mesh for the bulk is 8@xmath48@xmath48 ( appropriately rescaled for defect super cells ) . the berry phase technique is used to calculate the polarization change upon v doping , using strings of 16 points in the polarization direction . \n density of states for v : pto . \n positive curve is majority spin , negative is minority spin . \n fermi energy is at 0 ev . \n inset shows a zoom of the gap peak . \n the dotted line is a v @xmath5-up . ]    after studying pto and pvo in the respective ferroelectric phases , we substituted v for one ti in a 2@xmath42@xmath42 tetragonal supercell of ferroelectric pto , i.e. dopant concentration @xmath612.5% . a selection of structure parameters ( lattice constants , distance of v or ti from neighbouring o along the polar axis ) \n are collected in tab . \n [ tab : table ] . \n v has one excess electron compared to ti , so it is , as expected , spin - polarized with a moment of 1 @xmath1 . \n orbital angular momentum is assumed to be quenched . \n [ fig : dos ] displays the key result , i.e. the density of states ( dos ) of ferromagnetic v : pto . \n as we can observe , a fully occupied peak appears in the gap of pto , placed so that a gap of about 0.2 ev survives . this dos feature is obviously related to the excess v electron occupying antibonding conduction states . \n indeed , as shown in the inset , the main contribution to that peak is that of spin - up _ d _ orbitals of v. thus , pto doped with vanadium is a small - gap ferromagnetic insulator thanks to the unpaired electron of dopant vanadium . \n the gap of pto is of course underestimated due to the known @xcite gap error of semi - local functionals ; it may well be that the small v - related gap be also somewhat larger than calculated due to the same effects ( self - interaction , xc discontinuity , etc . ) . \n .[tab : table]cell parameters for v doped pto , bulk pto and pvo . \n theoretical values are calculated for this work in gga approximation . \n experimental values are from ref . @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the cell just discussed , v is ferromagnetic by construction , being coupled to its periodic images . to study an antiferromagnetic configuration we consider two v s at the same concentration in a 2@xmath7@xmath42@xmath7@xmath42 tetragonal cell . \n the two v are placed in that cell as far as possible from each other . while the ferromagnetic configuration is stable , the antiferromagnetic configuration is not . \n the v moments disappear and the system converges to a metallic pauli paramagnet of zero moment , which is about 300 mev higher in energy than the ferromagnet . \n of course , this prevents the evaluation of a coupling parameter for magnetic models , but the ferromagnet seems quite stable nevertheless . \n @xmath8/@xmath9 ) . \n the state is anti - bonding with first - neighbor o s , has @xmath10-like nodal structure , and propagates through @xmath10-like ti states . charge paths along the vertical axis are negligible . ] \n inspection of the charge density of the impurity state ( fig . \n 2 ) suggests a @xmath10-like nodal structure and coupling of v s via v - o - ti - o- ... paths in the basal plane , whereas hardly any density is to be found along the vertical axis . \n while the v - centered state is , as expected , anti - bonding with first neighbors , the bonding o - v states ( which mimic those of the substituted ti ) appear to make for a larger charge accumulation in the v - o bond region ( fig . \n 3 ) , matching the shorter v - o bond length compared to ti - o ( 1.71 vs 1.79  ) .        following ref.@xcite , the equilibrium concentration is @xmath11$]=@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the density of ti sites and @xmath14 the growth temperature . assuming that the solubility limit for v in pto is pvo , i.e. that high v contents will eventually cause phase separation of pvo , the formation energy is e@xmath15(v)=e(v : pto)(@xmath161)e(pto)e(pvo)@xmath171.23 ev , involving the total energy of the doped supercell of v : pto comprising @xmath16 unit cells , and of the unit cells of pto and pvo . \n since @xmath13=1.25@xmath1810@xmath19@xmath20 , at a typical @xmath14=650 k we find a logarithmic concentration @xmath21\\approx$]13.4 , which may increase perhaps to about 16 due to vibrational entropy ( v is heavier than ti ) . \n this thermodynamic solubility limit is relatively low , but it may well not apply whenever kinetics or non - equilibrium phenomena become dominant , as it happens in modern epitaxial growth techniques .    finally , we estimated the changes in polarization induced by v doping . at 12.5% \n v we find a polarization increase of 8.3 @xmath2c/@xmath3 , which agrees nicely with 8.25 @xmath2c/@xmath3 obtained by linear interpolation between the bulk values of pto and pvo mentioned previously . \n therefore , in terms of polarization , v does not seem detrimental , but in fact benign . \n in summary , we presented an _ ab initio _ prediction of the proper multiferroicity of v - doped pto . \n the gap is about 0.2 - 0.3 ev and the magnetization is 1 @xmath1/v , or 1.5@xmath410@xmath22 spins / cm@xmath9 at our chosen v density . \n we predict the polarization to increase linearly with v concentration at the percentual rate of 0.7 @xmath2c/@xmath3 . \n presumably this will only apply at relatively low concentrations , since the antiferromagnetic character of pvo will eventually take over . \n + _ note _  during review we have become aware of a very recent study @xcite of transition - metal doping in a perovskite ferroelectric ( batio@xmath0 ) , reporting results in general agreement with the ones just presented . \n references                        see e.g. r. w. godby and p. garcia - gonzalez , in _ a primer in density functional theory _ , springer lecture notes in physics , c. fiolhais , f. nogueira , m. marques eds . \n ( springer , berlin 2003 ) , ch . 5 , p.185 .", "StartTimeOffset": 559662970926, "RequestID": "8ff8cf9784c3220b7ea625a002a273bc02771537", "TotalTokens": 2472}
{"ContextTokens": 3952, "GeneratedTokens": 236, "SynthesizedBody": "several years ago , the microscopic representation approach @xcite was introduced in order to understand in a systematic manner the way in which the human concept describes a very big number of microscopic objects , in terms of a limited number of macroscopic characters defined by them . according to this approach , the microscopic picture and \n the macroscopic one are considered to be two different pictures of one reality , that are complimentary to each other , as the ocean is both an aggregate of molecules and a mass of waves . in each scale should be found the macroscopic objects and the laws of their behavior , which are generated from the microscopic scale . at the same period of time a similar approach , \n the universal dynamics approach @xcite was developed but from the opposite direction : from the universal to the macroscopic . \n it put the emphasis on the theory , therefore it is more comfortable for the presentations of the fundamentals . \n this approach looked for the most fundamental physical theory , under the rule that a theory is the more fundamental the less structure it assumes a priori . \n it starts with the basic assumption that : * the human mind thinks about relations between objects * ( this assumption is becoming more precise after introducing axiomatic characters for `` relations '' and `` objects '' ) . \n a collection of objects with their inter - relations is defined as `` a system '' . \n objects of a system can be systems themselves , i.e. with internal structure , which allows a framework for the discussion of self - organization in complex systems . \n the relations are directed and will therefore be called `` arrows '' , some of which are identified as fundamental in a given level of description and will be called `` links '' . \n arrows are composed of links and own the main importance in the description of a system . \n for example : in a system which is a thin brick wall - the objects are the bricks and the arrows define the relations between each brick and its six nearest neighbors , twelve next nearest neighbors etc . \n fig 1 describes a system which is a thin brick wall . \n the arrows are those who are defining the structure and turn the wall into more than a pile of bricks . in this framework \n the dynamics of the system is described : the basic options of getting a new system from a given one are - death of an object or a link , duplication of an object or a link , merging identical objects or links , creating missing adjacent links or promoting an arrow , which can be composed of two or several links , to the status of link . \n the dynamical processes assembled from such elementary operations were called `` drama '' . \n several applications @xcite of the approach to domains outside natural sciences were developed . \n two examples for these applications are the works in new product development @xcite and in creative advertising ideas @xcite . in both these domains \n we do not expect to find well - defined lines of thought . yet , during their study according to the universal approach it was revealed that out of the many possible routes of the dynamics , specific routes can be clearly defined and shown to be preferred - these are the `` creativity templates '' . \n the templates can be identified and described in an abstract and simple way so they can be easily and efficiently applied and objectively tested . \n an example for such a template is the development of a delivery motorbike that bakes pizza during the delivery ride according to the component connection template ( table 1 shows an example for the component connection template ) . following the simple instructions of the algorithm , leads the dynamics of the mind to the new creation . \n the efficiency of the templates was tested quantitatively : a group of marketing personal were trained for 4 - 5 hours in one of the templates . \n this group and a control group who did not receive the training were asked to generate ideas for new products in three categories . \n the first group used the template and the second group used conventional ideation methods ( brainstorming , questionnaires etc . ) . \n eight senior marketing professionals acted as judges and rated the ideas on a 1 - 7 scale according to their originality ( 1=not original at all , 7=very original ) and according to their recommendation to implement the idea ( 1=not recommended at all , 7=highly recommended ) . \n the judges were blind to the identity of the individuals who generated the ideas and to one another . in spite of the short length of the training \n the advantage of the first group was salient : they received the average of 5.09 vs. 4.18 in originality and 4.40 vs. 3.36 in value . \n in the present paper we propose a more basic elementary building block underlying most ( may be all ) of the creative acts . \n we call it the `` diagonal link '' according to its structure or `` transitive template '' according to its function . \n the `` diagonal link '' seems to be the basic element that humans use in constructing and understanding reality in the widest sense . in order \n to test this possibility we use the `` diagonal link '' as the elementary microscopic operation in the microscopic representation study of creation as described in symbolic religious stories . \n structurally , the `` diagonal link '' resembles a transitivity connection ( fig 2 illustrates transitivity connection ) . in the example brought in the previous section \n it can be seen clearly in fig 3 . in the same way we found that each of the creativity templates included , at least once , a diagonal link as the core of the creative process . as the basic assumption of the microscopic representation and universal dynamics related to the fundamental infrastructure of the human way of thinking \n , we assumed that we will be able to find similar phenomena in other fields and turned to study the tales of rabbi nachman of bratslav using this approach . \n we focused on the first story and studied the appearances of the diagonal link and their role . \n it should be emphasized that the analysis was performed in a mechanical method that referred only to the syntactic structure and not to the meaning of the text . \n in a very simplified and short way we can say that according to the kabala ( the jewish medieval mystical tradition ) creation starts when g - d withdrew in order to make room for the world to be created . \n after the creation , a line of light was sent from the infinite g - d into the created world but due to the deficiencies of the world it could not bear the light and was `` broken '' with the sparks of light scattered all around it . \n the human task is to collect these divine sparks and bring them back to their roots . \n this task is laid upon every human being , more on the nation of israel and most on the righteous person - the tzadik . \n this dynamics has many manifestations : the exile of the soul in the body and the need of the individual to redeem it by bettering oneself and lifting oneself spiritually , the exile of the nation of israel and their need to return to the land of israel , the exile of the divine presence and the need to help it to be re - united with g - d etc . \n rabbi nachman of bratslav ( 1772 - 1810 ) saw himself as a tzadik and as such he felt , like other hassidic ( the hassidic movement is a pre - modern jewish revival movement , deeply inspired by kabala ) sages , responsible for the redemption process and for the recruitment of his followers to help in the process . at a certain point \n he felt that the direct cognitive approach did not give enough fruits and that his explicit teachings did not enlighten his people as he expected . \n at that point he decided to convey his message in an implicit manner through story telling . \n the first story that he told was `` the story of the lost princess '' @xcite . \n it starts with a king who once got angry with his beloved daughter and cursed her that the no - good will take her . \n after she disappeared the king became so sorry and regretful that his second - to - the - king volunteered to go out and look for the princess . \n after many hardships he found the princess who instructed him how to save her by fasting , not sleeping and longing for her , but twice he failed by eating or drinking and consequently falling asleep and the princess was transferred to the golden mountain . during his wanderings looking for the golden mountain he met a giant who was responsible for all animals who tried to convince him to give up , but even after all the animals did not know anything about the golden mountain the second - to - the - king remained determined to continue his search . \n so the giant sent him to his brother who was responsible for all the birds . after repeating the same scenario he sent the second to the third brother who was responsible for all the winds . \n after the winds did not know about the golden mountain and the second - to - the - king started to cry , came another wind who apologized that it was late as it had to deliver a princess to a golden mountain . \n the giant then ordered the wind to take there also the second and equipped him with a tool that will help him there . \n the end of the story was not told ; we only have a comment of the editor saying that in the end he managed to save her but rabbi nachman did not tell how . the story is usually interpreted along the lines described in the first paragraph of this section . \n the king represents g - d and the pair second - princess represents either the individual and his soul or the tzadik and the divine presence . the story was not completed by rabbi nachman , because the story of creation is not finished and the harmonious unification was not yet accomplished . \n when performing the diagonal analysis on `` the story of the lost princess '' , 18 diagonal links were found . \n two examples are presented in table 2 . \n our assumption was that diagonal links indicate key - events in the story and in order to check if the events associated with these 18 diagonal links were to be considered important events we went through 21 authors who commentated `` the story of the lost princess '' . \n we looked at the 29 events they referred to and ranked them according to the number of writers referring to them . when comparing the events pointed by the diagonal links we found that they matched quite fully the top part of the list : the first event that was not pointed by a diagonal link was number 14 in the ranked list and only one of these events matched a low - ranked event ( number 22 ) . \n the detailed analysis of this study will be published elsewhere . for the purpose of this paper \n it is enough that appearance of a diagonal link indicates a crucially significant point in the story . \n the grimm brothers story `` the raven '' starts with a queen who lost her patience with her daughter and cursed her to become a raven , which she did and flew to a black forest . \n a man going through the forest heard the raven and went to it . \n he met the princess who instructed him how to save her by fasting , not sleeping and waiting for her at a specific time . \n thrice he failed by drinking and falling asleep and the princess was transferred to the golden palace . during his wanderings looking for the golden palace he met a giant who first was hostile but then tried to help him . \n he looked for the palace in his map but in vain . \n he tried a bigger map and again - in vain . \n then he convinced the man to wait for his brother who , when came back , looked at his map that was still bigger but the palace was not on it . \n at last they found the palace in an old map and the giant took the man most of the way toward it . \n the man took from three thieves the equipment that helped him enter the palace and release the princess . \n the story ends with the princess thanking the man for saving her and declaring their wedding to be celebrated the next day . \n this story is clearly a parallel to rabbi nachman s `` the story of the lost princess '' although they are not identical . s. pitrushka claims that neither of the two stories is the source of the other but they both share a common source in the polish story `` a diverting story about the virtuous princess banialuce from an eastern land '' by hieronim morsztyn ( died in 1655 ) . \n although rabbi nachman did not know the polish language , pitrushka quotes the polish historian a. brinker who proved that `` princess banialuce '' was translated to the ukrainian language . finding a parallel story was indeed intriguing in light of the fact that rabbi nachman did refer to the relations between his stories and other folk tales . \n rabbi nachman s tales were edited by his main disciple rabbi nathan sternhartz of nemirow . in his first introduction rabbi \n nathan tells @xcite : `` before [ the rebbe ( hassidic sage ) ] began telling the first story in this book , he declared , ' ' many hidden meanings and lofty concepts are contained in the stories the world tell . \n these stories , however , are deficient : they contain many omissions . \n they are also confused , and people do not tell them in the correct order ... `` . \n the rebbe spoke about this . \n then he began to tell the story on the following page . \n he said , ' ' i told this story while on a journey ... `` in contemporary words , rabbi nachman claims that folk tales need to be upgraded and is moving to give an example how he does it . \n therefore it was especially interesting to perform a diagonal analysis on ' ' the raven \" @xcite . \n in the analysis we found 12 diagonal links in `` the raven '' . further examination showed that out of the 18 diagonal links of `` the lost princess '' only 9 were present in `` the raven '' . in 8 out of the 9 missing appearances , \n the event itself was present in `` the raven '' but its description lacked the diagonal link . on the other hand , in all three diagonal links that appeared in `` the raven '' and did not appear in `` the lost princess '' the event itself was not part of the story . \n two of these are placed in the last part of the story , the part that rabbi nachman did not tell . when calculating the density of diagonal links appearances according to the number of words we found that in `` the raven '' there were 12 diagonal links in 1652 words , which is a density of 0.7 percent . \n in `` the lost princess '' there were 18 diagonal links in 1312 words , which is a density of 1.4 percent . \n in an earlier section we showed that an appearance of a diagonal link indicates a part of the story which is of special quality . from this obviously derives that the overall importance of the text increases with the density of diagonal links appearances . \n the double density that was found in `` the lost princess '' in comparison to `` the raven '' indicates a significant difference in quality . according to our findings \n rabbi nachman managed to execute what he was trying to do - to upgrade the story . \n our intention now is to analyze the story of `` princess banialuce '' and one of the theoretical teachings of rabbi nachman . according to the above we expect to find a significant difference in the diagonal density between `` the lost princess '' and `` princess banialuce '' and a non - significant difference between the stories and the teachings of rabbi nachman .    10 , _ \n the microscopic representation of complex macroscopic phenomena _ , annual reviews of computational physics ii pp 243 -

{"ContextTokens": 3315, "GeneratedTokens": 298, "SynthesizedBody": "recent years have witnessed exciting developments both in the observations and theoretical modelling of the abundance star to star variations within most of the well studied globular clusters ( gcs ) . in most gcscen , \n in which the heavy elements spread and the hr diagram morphologies clearly show that we are dealing with several stellar generations , enriched by the supernova ejecta . ] only the light elements that are susceptible to abundance changes from proton - capture reactions , such as the pp , cn , on , nena , and mgal cycles , exhibit star - to - star abundance variations , far in excess of the modest dispersion seen in halo field stars  see , e.g. , @xcite , kraft ( 1994 ) , sneden ( 1999 ) , @xcite . \n observations of these abundance spreads at the turnoff and among the subgiant stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) have shown that these anomalies must be attributed indeed to some process of self  enrichment occurring at the first stages of the life of the cluster . \n the massive agb envelopes are the ideal place to manifacture elements through nuclear reactions in which proton captures are involved , as , especially for low metallicity , they are subject to hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) : the convective envelope reaches the hydrogen burning shell , and the products of burning are convected to the surface of the star and are given back to the intracluster medium by means of the stellar wind and the planetary nebula ejection .    today , the most popular explanation of the observed chemical anomalies , first proposed by cottrell & dacosta ( 1981 ) and dantona \n , gratton & chieffi ( 1983 ) , and recently adapted , is that these winds , collected in the central regions of the cluster , initiate a second stage of more or less continuous star formation lasting not more than 200myr . \n this model , which we will now call the _ standard self enrichment scenario _ \n , received * an interesting hint * by the interpretation of some peculiar horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies in terms of helium enrichment of the gas from which a fraction of stars were born @xcite . \n the chemical anomalies are correlated with the hb morphology ( e.g. catelan & freitas pacheco 1995 ) , and high helium abundances ( which are also found in the envelopes of the massive agbs subject to hbb ) seem to be the best explanation for the hb blue tails and for the peculiar blue main sequences in @xmath2cen @xcite and in ngc2808 @xcite .    in spite of the appealing features of the standard self \n enrichment scenario , a quantitative reproduction of the observed abundance spreads mainly of the oxygen vs. sodium and of the aluminum versus magnesium anticorrelations , for which abundant data are given in the recent astronomical literature is not available @xcite . in the recent literature \n indeed it is stated that quantitative considerations reveal a number of serious problems and  the current theoretical yields and chemical evolution models do not favour the agb pollution scenario ( with intermediate - mass agbs ) as the mechanism responsible for star - to - star abundance variations in globular clusters \" @xcite or that  the notion that massive agb stars are the origin of the o  na abundance anticorrelation in gc giants is not consistent with the model predictions of this study \" @xcite . \n most of these problems , however , are present in the computations which rest on mlt standard stellar models of low convective efficiency , due to which the hbb temperatures are not large enough to allow efficient on cycling . \n the recent models by @xcite , who indeed take care of developping an entire chemical evolution model , fail to reproduce the o \n na anticorrelation and most of the other chemical anomalies mainly due to this choice of convection modelling . by tradition \n , our group adopts the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model by @xcite , whose high efficiency allows strong on cycling . \n recently , @xcite have shown in detail that the modelization of the nuclear yields is enormously dependent on the efficiency of the adopted convection model and , indirectly , on the efficiency of mass loss . \n some problems of other modellers , e.g. the high increase in the cno total abundances , which _ is not _ found in the observations @xcite , is in fact due to the high number of third dredge up ( tdu ) episodes , due to the comparatively low luminosity of the models with respect to the luminosity of the fst models . in spite of this improvement , our most recent models @xcite reproduce in a satisfactory way the o  na anticorrelation only for a limited range of masses ( 3.5 - 4.5 ) , and are not consistent with the mg - al anticorrelation .    in this paper , we show that we can modify our models in order to solve these problems , and thus we are closer to the complete solution of this appealing conundrum . \n the guide - line of this study was to build agb stellar models whose ejecta are consistent with the chemistry of the most contaminated stars within gcs , i.e. : a ) strong enhancement of aluminum and fluorine ; b ) a positive yield of sodium ; c ) a large depletion of oxygen ; d ) a ( c+n+o ) sum increased by no more than a factor of @xmath3 . \n we show that the correlation of sodium with aluminum , and the anticorrelations of sodium versus oxygen and fluorine , can all be reproduced by assuming a modest extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope in addition to a very efficient convection model . \n we focus our attention on a typical massive agb model , of mass m=5 ; the adopted chemistry is ( z , y)=(0.001,0.24 ) . the complete description of the physics of the models is given in @xcite . \n the detailed study of the production of elements during the agb evolution requires computation of complete stellar models including nuclear processing by hbb , coupled with non  instantaneous mixing . \n we adopt a network of 30 isotopes from hydrogen to silicon . \n the standard cross sections adopted in the code are from @xcite . \n the abundances we adopt in the computation are solar scaled , due to the present limitation of opacities and equation of state in our code . actually , the @xmath4 elements in popii stars are enhanced by @xmath5 dex ( e.g. gratton , sneden & carretta 2004 ) , and the initial value of cno abundances affect the detailed nucleosynthesis . \n however we have made test models concerning the important oxygen abundance bahaviour , showing that the logarithmic decrease of oxygen abundance is roughly the same . \n consequently , if we had started , e.g. , from an oxygen overabundance of + 0.3dex , the final abundance would have been 0.3dex larger than that found in our model . \n convection is modelled according to the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) treatment by @xcite , which provides at the bottom of the convective envelopes temperature larger than the corresponding mlt models with @xmath6 @xcite .    the standard mass loss law adopted in our models ( e.g. * ? \n * ) is from @xcite , who modifies the reimer s formula in order to simulate the strong mass loss suffered by these stars as they climb along the agb . \n the @xmath7 parameter in this formulation is set to 0.02 . \n the strong depletion of oxygen needed to match the observed abundances of the bulk of the stars showing chemical anomalies in gcs ( @xmath8 dex ) requires very high temperatures at the base of the external envelope , that can be hardly achieved in the framework of the mlt modelling of convection ; the recent observations of giant stars in m4 @xcite , indicating a strong fluorine depletion ( @xmath9 dex ) , also point towards the same direction . \n the problem most difficult to overcome is that models depleting oxygen destroy sodium as well @xcite . \n when an efficient tdu is invoked , the sodium abundance can increase by even a factor of @xmath10 , that is at odds with the highest observed value in the m13 giants ( @xmath11 dex ) ; besides , in these same models the ( c+n+o ) sum would be much larger than observed . as discussed , the models by @xcite reproduced the oxygen depletion and sodium enhancement only for a small range of masses . \n in addition , the range of @xmath12 enhancement was a major problem of these models . \n we investigate now the effects that a small amount of extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope might have on the chemistry of the ejecta , by assuming that convective velocities decay exponentially inwards beyond the formal border fixed by the schwartzschild criterion . \n the difference between the present model and the model of the same mass presented in ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) is that the parameter @xmath13 connected with the extra - mixing is not set to zero , but is allowed to vary between @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the value used to simulate overshooting from the border of the convective core of intermediate mass stars during the phase of h - burning , that was calibrated in order to reproduce the observed main sequences of open clusters ( ventura et al . \n 1998 ) .    figs . \n [ ejecta1 ] and [ ejecta2 ] show the evolution ( in terms of variation with mass , that is obviously decreasing with time ) of the surface abundances of some key - elements of 5models calculated with different @xmath13 s . \n first , we note that large depletion of oxygen and fluorine can be easily achieved when the fst treatment is used for convection modelling . \n we also confirm , ( left panel of fig . \n [ ejecta1 ] , solid line ) that sodium can not be produced if a straight schwartzschild criterion is used to locate the base of the surface convection . \n conversely , if some extra - mixing is assumed , the surface sodium increases following each tp , due to the dredge - up of @xmath16 , later converted to @xmath17 ; this holds particularly during the latest evolutionary stages , when the temperature at the base of the surface convective region is decreased by mass loss . \n another bonus of these models is that the small total number of tps prevents from obtaining a final sodium abundance largely exceeding the initial value . \n [ ejecta1 ] ( right panel ) shows that the larger is @xmath13 the larger is the oxygen content of the ejecta , as this latter element can also be dredged - up following each tp if the base of the convective envelope penetrates deeply into the ashes of the former @xmath18 shell . \n we find that a value @xmath19 leads to ejecta whose chemical composition is both sodium rich ( @xmath20=+0.4 $ ] ) and oxygen poor ( @xmath21=-0.55 $ ] ) , and can thus take account of the observed anticorrelation sodium versus oxygen . \n the use of @xmath22 leads to a dredge - up parameter @xmath23 gradually increasing along the agb evolution , that reaches a maximum value of @xmath24 at the latest tps . \n * this , combined with the small number of tps in which tdu is achieved ( @xmath25 ) , makes the mass @xmath26 of the processed material to be @xmath27 ; we therefore expect a negligible effect on the s - process elements abundances . *    the left panel of fig . \n [ ejecta2 ] also shows that a strong depletion of fluorine is achieved in all cases ; the mass expelled by the @xmath22 model has @xmath28 \\sim -1.2 $ ] , a result that is in agreement with the analysis by smith et al . ( 2005 ) regarding the fluorine abundance variations in red giants of m4 ( see their fig.4 ) . \n the central panel shows that when using the higher limit of the nacre rates for @xmath29 and @xmath30 proton capture reactions it is also possible to achieve a strong @xmath12 production , ( @xmath31 = + 0.7 $ ] ) independently of @xmath13 ; this can not be obtained when we adopt the recommended nacre cross sections ( long - dashed line ) . finally , the right panel of fig . \n [ ejecta2 ] shows the evolution of the total ( c+n+o ) abundance , with respect to the initial value . \n we see that the model calculated with @xmath22 achieves a maximum final abundance increased by a factor of @xmath32 , and the average increase is @xmath33 , that is still consistent with the observations . \n * concerning the magnesium isotopic ratios , the ejecta of our model have @xmath34 and @xmath35 , both sensibly greater than the values ( @xmath36 ) observed by yong et al.(2005 ) in the most polluted stars of ngc6752 : we recall , however , that the theoretical estimate of relative abundances of the magnesium isotopes is affected by the uncertainties related to the cross section of the reactions of proton and @xmath4 captures by the heavy magnesium isotopes , and the @xmath4 captures by @xmath16 nuclei . * \n in this work we present results of detailed calculations focused on the agb phase of a typical intermediate mass star ( m@xmath37 ) of metallicity @xmath38 . \n our main finding is that when the fst model is used to deal with convective modelling , the use of a modest amount of extra - mixing at the base of the outer convective envelope leads to ejecta whose chemical composition reproduces simultaneously most of the chemical anomalies observed in gcs stars .      1 . \n oxygen and fluorine are strongly depleted : we find @xmath21=-0.55 $ ] and @xmath28=-1.2 $ ] . \n when the high nacre limit for the rates of the proton capture reactions by the heavy magnesium isotopes are used , aluminum can be easily manifactured : @xmath31=+0.7 $ ] . \n 3 .   a modest amount of extra - mixing at the base of the convective envelope ( @xmath22 , to be compared with the value @xmath15 that must be used in our models to increase the convective core extension during h - burning , to fit the observed open cluster main - sequences ) triggers some @xmath16 to be dredged - up following each tp ; when the pulse is extinguished , this fresh @xmath16 is converted in sodium , that in the latest evolutionary stages , when the temperature at the base of the convective envelope is reduced by mass loss , can survive to proton fusion . \n the overall sodium content of the ejecta is @xmath39=+0.4 $ ] 4 . \n the total ( c+n+o ) abundance , due both to the small number of tps and to the modest efficiency of the tdu , is increase by only a factor of @xmath33 , that is also consistent with the observations . \n the present results give more robustness to the current interpretation that the chemical anomalies among gc stars result from star formation in the intracluster medium polluted by the ejecta of an early generation of massive agbs . \n ventura , p. , mazzitelli , i. & dantona , f.  2004 , proceedings of the joint discussion 04 of the xxiv iau general assembly , sydney , astrophysical impact of abundances in globular cluster stars , eds . f.dantona and g. da costa , mem.s.a.it .", "StartTimeOffset": 574682545236, "RequestID": "8f3e9b93fc6b80cbaf357bc5b4f0bac65ba84fff", "TotalTokens": 3613}
{"ContextTokens": 3954, "GeneratedTokens": 271, "SynthesizedBody": "most of the known cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) were originally discovered because of their dramatic optical variability , exemplified by the outbursts of dwarf novae and classical novae . \n more recently , however , ultraviolet and x - ray sky surveys have led to discoveries of many new cvs , including members of subclasses that have less spectacular optical light variations ( e.g. , the novalike variables ) .    follow - up investigations at radio wavelengths have led to detections of a few well - known , mostly nearby , cvs as radio sources . in this paper \n we report what we believe to be the first case in which the sequence of discovery has been reversed : we have detected a new cv during a radio survey , with the subsequent confirmation having been made in the optical band . \n the first ( `` faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters '' ) survey is aimed at producing a deep radio map of 10,000 square degrees at the north and south galactic caps ( see becker , white , & helfand 1995 ; white , becker , helfand , & gregg 1997 ) . \n the survey is being carried out at 1.4  ghz with the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , and can be thought of as a radio analog of the optical palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) . \n source positions are provided to better than @xmath1 accuracy , and the sensitivity limit is about 1  mjy .    the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ;

mcmahon et al . \n the majority of fbqs candidates are found to be qsos , bl lac objects , or other extragalactic sources . \n only 8% of the candidates turn out to be galactic stars , the bulk of which are merely chance coincidences of unrelated , ordinary foreground stars with the radio positions . \n actual radio emission from galactic stars is exceedingly rare , even at the 1  mjy limit of the first survey , as discussed in detail by helfand et al . \n ( 1999 ) . \n it was thus a surprise when one of the faint fbqs candidates proved to be a galactic star with an unusual spectrum , which clearly showed it to be a previously unknown cv . \n this source , cataloged with a 1.4  ghz radio flux density of 3.58  mjy , lies at the j2000 coordinates given in the first line of table  1 . \n lying @xmath2 away from the radio source , at the coordinates listed in the second line of table  1 , is a faint stellar object contained in the apm catalog . \n also listed in the bottom line of table  1 are the coordinates and magnitudes of a nearby comparison star , used in the ccd observations described in the next section . \n figure  1 presents a finding chart for the optical candidate , with the radio contours superposed . \n the radio source is designated first j102347.6 + 003841 ( but hereafter the name will be shortened to first j1023 + 0038 ) . \n figure  2 shows the discovery spectrogram , which was obtained on 2000 may 6 by mark lacy with the lick observatory 3-m telescope . \n the spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum , with superposed emission lines of the balmer series , , and . \n the spectrum is fairly typical of a cv in quiescence ( see , for example , the spectroscopic atlas of williams 1983 ) . \n however , the lines of and especially of are rather stronger than in most dwarf novae , and suggest that the object may be more closely related to the subset of magnetic or am herculis - type cvs . \n the spectrum is , in fact , rather similar to that of am her itself , as illustrated in williams figure  13 .    as this paper was being prepared for publication , we realized that the source lies within the area of the sky covered by the june 2001 early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; stoughton et al . \n inspection of the data archive ( maintained at stsci ) shows that both photometry and a spectrum are available . \n table  2 gives the sdss astrometry and photometry for both the cv candidate and the comparison star . \n the sdss position is @xmath3 away from the radio position . \n the sdss spectrum is quite similar to our lick spectrum shown in figure  2 , although the equivalent widths of the emission lines appear to be slightly lower . \n moreover , the emission lines are incipiently resolved into double - peaked profiles . \n this would suggest that there is an accretion disk present in the system , and that therefore it may be a dq  herculis - type magnetic cv , rather than a full - fledged am  herculis system ( in which an accretion disk would be lacking ) . \n if the optical candidate counterpart of first j1023 + 0038 is a cv , then it would be expected to exhibit rapid optical variability . in order to search for such variations , h.e.b . and m.s.o . \n obtained photometric observations on five nights in 2000 \n november and december , using the 2.1-m reflector at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) . \n a tektronix @xmath4 ccd was used , with @xmath5 on - chip binning . in order to maximize the signal \n , we used a schott bg39 glass filter , which yields a broad - band blue bandpass . \n only a @xmath6 pixel subraster was read out , in order to reduce the read - out time between exposures but still produce a large enough field to contain both the target and a nearby comparison star . even with this ccd setup , however , the readout time was still 25  s with the kpno data acquisition system . \n exposure times of 30 - 60  s were used in 2000 november , and were shortened to 10  s for all of the 2000 december observations . \n table  3 contains a log of the ccd observations . as noted in the table , \n none of the nights were photometric , but accurate differential photometry is readily possible under non - photometric conditions , as has been shown by grauer & bond ( 1981 ) , ciardullo & bond ( 1996 ) , and many others . \n we performed standard aperture photometry on the frames , and reduced the data to differential magnitudes of the target with respect to the comparison star . in order to set an approximate photometric zero point \n , we adopted the blue magnitude of 16.14 given for the comparison star in the apm catalog . \n figure  3 shows our resulting light curves from the five nights of photometry . \n the differential magnitudes are generally accurate to better than 0.01  mag ( i.e. , smaller than the size of the plotting points ) , except on the very cloudy night of 2000 dec 24 where the errors were typically several hundredths of a magnitude . \n the object indeed shows variability on both slow and rapid timescales , confirming its classification as a cv . \n although generally maintaining a level around magnitude 17.5 , it showed a flare of @xmath00.8  mag lasting about 20  min ( apart from one rapid dip back to the baseline level ) on 2000 december 23 . on december 24 \n the target was more active , being initially about 0.5  mag brighter than on previous nights , declining briefly , and then ramping up by about 1  mag over about half an hour and remaining at that level for over an hour ( apart from two rapid dips ) . \n the object also shows short - timescale flickering , which gives the light curves a noisy appearance . on the first four nights , and on the fifth night when the star was near its baseline level , \n the light curves show a curious `` bimodal '' appearance , i.e. , the magnitudes tend to cluster near either `` high '' or `` low '' levels but rarely in between . \n we suspect that this appearance arises from our sparse sampling of a light curve that may have flickering with a timescale of approximately 10  s ; we are thus missing about 2/3 of the points that we would have obtained with uninterrupted 10-s integrations . \n power spectra were calculated for all of the light curves , but revealed no significant coherent signals ; of course , we were not able to test for signals with periods shorter than @xmath070  s , such as are seen in some of the dq  her - type subset of magnetic cvs ( patterson 1994 ) , because of the @xmath735  s interval between integrations . \n we see no evidence , in our fairly limited data set , for eclipses or other repetitive phenomena occurring on an orbital timescale . \n determination of the orbital period of the system will require additional photometry or a radial - velocity study . \n a strong confirmation that the optical cv is indeed the counterpart of the radio source would come from variability of the radio source . \n we therefore searched the first database for evidence of such variability . \n the first survey is based on data collected by the vla on a hexagonal grid of field centers spaced by about @xmath8 , and an object can thus appear in overlapping images from several adjacent fields ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) . \n the first source catalog is constructed by summing the overlapping fields to get uniform sensitivity on the sky , and does not contain information on source variability . however , a sufficiently bright radio source can be detected by inspecting the individual grid images before they are coadded . \n the sensitivity in each observation is a function of the distance of the source from the field center . \n table  4 lists details of the three vla observations of fields that contained first j1023 + 0038 . \n the successive columns give the observation date and time , followed by the position of the field center . \n 5 gives the distance of the source from the field center , and col . \n 6 contains the primary beam response of the vla at that radius . \n ( note , for example , that the response drops to 0.5 of its value at the field center at a radius of @xmath9 . ) finally , in cols .  7 and 8 , @xmath10 is the measured flux density ( mjy ) for the source ( or the @xmath11 upper limit in the case of non - detection ) , and @xmath12 is the true flux density after correction for the primary beam response . \n as table  4 shows , first j1023 + 0038 was detected in only one of the three observations , on 1998 august 10 . at that time , the implied true flux density of 6.6  mjy was well above the @xmath11 upper limits of the two earlier observations . \n the source is therefore definitely variable at 1.4  ghz by a factor of 3 or more over a period of only a few days . \n the source was also not detected in the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey , carried out between 1993 and 1996 , with a 50% completeness limit of 2.5  mjy ( condon et al . \n variability at this level among first radio sources is extremely rare , and makes it virtually certain that the variable radio source is the counterpart of the optical cv . \n the first cv to be detected at radio wavelengths was the prototypical magnetic cv am herculis , whose emission was discovered at the vla by chanmugam & dulk ( 1982 ) . \n they detected a flux density of 0.67  mjy at 4.9  ghz , and suggested that the emission is from mildly relativistic electrons trapped in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf . \n subsequent observations by dulk , bastian , & chanmugam ( 1983 ) led to detection of a strong flare from am  her , which lasted about 10  min and reached a peak of 9.7  mjy at 4.9  ghz ; dulk et al . \n were also able to set an upper limit on the quiescent flux density of am  her at 1.4  ghz of 0.24  mjy . \n the magnetic dq her - type system ae aqr has also been detected as a variable radio source , with the initial discovery having been made at the vla by bookbinder & lamb ( 1987 ) ; they found a flux density at 1.4  ghz varying from 3 to 5 mjy . \n other radio detections of am her- and dq her - type cvs have been reported by pavelin , spencer , & davis ( 1994 ) and references therein . \n by contrast , non - magnetic cvs in general are not detectable radio sources ( nelson & spencer 1988 ) , strongly suggesting that a highly magnetic white dwarf is a key element in the production of radio emission . for further information \n , the reader is directed to the summary of radio emission from cvs by mason , fisher , & chanmugam ( 1996 ) . \n we thus strongly suspect that first j1023 + 0038 is a new magnetic cv , either of the dq  her or am  her variety . \n our detection of a 6.6  mjy flare at 1.4  ghz is remarkable because , with a quiescent optical magnitude near 17.5 , first j1023 + 0038 is so optically inconspicuous . \n ( by comparison , ae  aqr is an 11th - mag object , and am her lies generally around 12th-13th mag , although with occasional drops to `` low '' states below 15th  mag ) . \n it remains to be seen whether the flare that led to our serendipitous discovery of first j1023 + 0038 was simply a very rare and unusually energetic one , or whether this object is indeed much more radio luminous than the typical magnetic cvs . \n we urge follow - up observations at radio , optical , and x - ray wavelengths . \n optical spectroscopy should reveal the orbital period , and might provide direct evidence for a strong magnetic field . \n polarimetry would determine whether the object is a highly magnetic am  her system . \n a search of archival plate collections , and future long - term photometric monitoring , might reveal either dwarf - nova outbursts , or am  her - like low states , although the object is rather faint . \n h.e.b . acknowledges the inspiration of his friend and colleague g.  chanmugam . \n we thank mark lacy for obtaining the lick spectrogram . \n r.h.b . acknowledges support from nrao , nsf ( grant ast-00 - 98355 ) , and the institute of geophysics and planetary physics ( operated under the auspices of the u.s . \n department of energy by lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract no . \n w-7405-eng-48 ) . \n kitt peak national observatory is operated by aura inc . \n , under contract with the national science foundation . \n the digitized sky surveys were produced at the space telescope science institute under u.s . \n government grant nag w-2166 . \n becker , r. h. , white , r. l. , gregg , m. d. , laurent - muehleisen , s. a. , brotherton , m. s. , impey , c. d. , chaffee , f. h. , richards , g. t. , helfand , d. j. , lacy , m. , courbin , f. , & proctor , d. d. 2001 , apjs , 135 , 227                                        lcccc first radio position & 10:23:47.621 & + 00:38:41.60 & @xmath13 & @xmath13 + optical candidate & 10:23:47.713 & + 00:38:42.40 & 18.05 & 16.98 + comparison star & 10:23:43.340 & + 00:38:19.20 & 16.14 & 14.88 +    lccclllll optical candidate & 2255048168702071 & 10:23:47.683 & + 00:38:40.99 & 19.418 & 17.794 & 17.206 & 17.053 & 16.999 + comparison star & 2255048168701986 & 10:23:43.308 & + 00:38:19.14 & 16.281 & 14.906 & 15.513 & 14.226 & 14.168 +    lccccl 2000 nov 21 & m.s.o . \n & 10:57 & 1.0 & 60 , 30 & cirrus + 2000 nov 22 & m.s.o . \n & 11:35 & 1.3 & 30 & thin haze + 2000 dec 22 & h.e.b . \n & 12:28 & 1.2 & 10 & thin cirrus + 2000 dec 23 & h.e.b . \n & 10:15 & 3.5 & 10 & haze + 2000 dec 24 & h.e.b . \n & 9:28 & 3.9 & 10 & thick haze +    lccccccc 1998 aug 3 & 20:33 & 10:24.0 & + 00:52 & 13.7 & 0.57 & 1.0 & 1.8 + 1998 aug 8 & 21:08 & 10:22.5 & + 00:39 & 19.4 & 0.30 & 1.0 & 3.4 + 1998 aug 10 & 21:24 & 10:24.0 & + 00:26 & 13.1 & 0.60 & 3.9 & 6.5 +", "StartTimeOffset": 581551821762, "RequestID": "cad25ac11ce6123e03a7dd00ea4fc111ace47cf6", "TotalTokens": 4225}
{"ContextTokens": 2801, "GeneratedTokens": 237, "SynthesizedBody": "gravitational wave astronomy inherently relies on high power resonant optical systems . \n the power of the probe light circulating in a cavity is the ultimate lever utilized to increase the sensitivity of a position measurement of a gravitational wave detector test masses carrying information about gravitational wave signals . \n the projected continuous wave ( cw ) light power pushes 0.8  mw value in the second generation of gravitational wave detectors , such as advanced ligo ( now in operation ) , advanced virgo and kagra , planned to become operational in the next few months @xcite . while this power value is by far lower \n if compared with the optical damage limit of the cavity mirrors , it is high enough to initiate various nonlinear processes resulting in depletion of the probe light and in generation of optical harmonics adding noise to the recorded signal and hindering the desirable sensitivity increase . technical solution allowing suppressing the nonlinear interactions are needed to push the limits of gravitational wave astronomy and to widen the horizon of observable events associated with gravitational wave emission . \n resonant opto - mechanical oscillations are expected to have the lowest power threshold if compared with the other nonlinear processes in the cavities , it may cause undesirable parametric instability ( pi ) @xcite . \n the pi occurs due to interaction of optical cavity modes and mechanical modes of the cavity mirrors . \n the photons of the probe light confined in a selected , usually fundamental , cavity mode pumped at frequency @xmath3 are parametrically converted to mechanical phonons of the cavity mirrors ( having frequency @xmath4 ) as well as lower frequency , or stokes , photons emitted into high order optical modes having frequency @xmath5 . \n the power threshold of pi is inversely proportional to the product of quality factors of the optical and mechanical modes participating in the process , so desirable reduction of the optical as well as mechanical attenuation results in undesirable reduction of the pi threshold . \n the phenomenon of pi was studied and validated experimentally in a table top fabry - perot resonator @xcite as well as in whispering gallery mode resonators @xcite . \n recently pi was observed in full scaled advanced ligo interferometer @xcite at relatively small circulating power @xmath6  kw as compared with @xmath7  mw planned in a advanced ligo . \n efficiency of pi depends on phase matching , comprising nonzero overlap integral and energy conservation , of the optical and mechanical modes . \n there is a significant probability that these conditions are always fulfilled in long - base gravitational wave detectors because of dense spectrum of optical modes of large cavities and dense spectrum of mechanical modes of large area cavity mirrors . since the mirrors involved into the system \n are not identical , they have slightly different associated mechanical frequencies that can lead to pi . \n several techniques of reducing pi impact have been studied recently . \n they involve either braking the phase matching of the nonlinear process by changing frequency spectra of the modes participating in the ip process , or reducing pi efficiency by damping nonessential modes . \n for instance , one can move the opto - mechanical system out of resonance by controlling surface temperature of the mirrors @xcite . \n this is possible since the optical ( @xmath3 and @xmath8 ) and mechanical ( @xmath4 ) eigenfrequencies of the system depend on the mirror temperature @xmath9 in different ways , so the pi favorable condition @xmath10 , ultimately breaks . \n the drawback of this technique is related to its lack of selectivity . \n all the modes of the optical cavity move at nearly the same pace , and while one pair of stokes and mechanical modes comes out of the resonance , another pair comes in . this drawback can be partially suppressed by modulation of the temperature of the mirror surface . \n alternative stabilization method involves damping of mechanical modes either in a passive or an active way . \n it was found that introducing an annular strip at the rims of cavity mirrors reduces quality ( q- ) factors of elastic modes @xcite . \n however , this strip reduces q - factor of the modes within the whole spectrum , including reception band of the antenna ( @xmath11  hz ) . \n this is undesirable , since low mechanical attenuation at these frequencies is essential for achieving the desirable detection sensitivity . \n active electro - mechanical feedback allows reducing q - factor of several particular elastic modes @xcite . \n the method is too selective to suppress all high - frequency modes in the entire bandwidth of interest ( @xmath12  khz ) and , hence , does not solve the problem of instability of highly overmoded opto - mechanical system . \n therefore , a universal method of pi suppression is still needed . \n we here propose a solution based on optimization of the shape of the cavity mirrors leading to increase of the diffraction losses of all high - order optical modes of the optical cavity and subsequent increase of the pi threshold . \n note that diffraction losses a cavity modes can be increased rather significantly by properly shaping mirrors of the cavity @xcite , however , with loss increase of main mode which is inappropriate for laser gravitational detector detector . \n we propose the method allows realizing an optical cavity containing only one family of low loss bounded modes . \n this is achievable in the case of large area optical mirrors . in a realistic gravity wave detector , \n though , the size of the mirrors is limited and suppression of the high - order modes is associated with loss increase of the fundamental mode family . \n we study this practically interesting case using numerical simulations and show that it is feasible to increase the pi threshold at least by an order of magnitude by proper shaping mirrors of a ligo interferometer keeping diffraction loss of main mode at acceptable low level . \n we show that the stability of the modified interferometer with respect to the mirror tilt and shape variations is acceptable . \n finally , we found that the optimized cavity can still be interrogated using conventional gaussian beams . \n the lowest pi intracavity threshold power evaluated for a fabry - perot ( fp ) resonator can be found from expression @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the round trip optical attenuation coefficient of the stokes mode , @xmath15 is the mass of the mirror , or test mass , @xmath16 is the quality factor of the elastic mode , @xmath17 is the speed of light in the vacuum , @xmath18 is a mismatching factor , @xmath19 is volume of the mirror , @xmath20 is the mechanical mode displacement , @xmath21 is the same normal displacement on the mirror surface , and @xmath22 is distribution of main and stokes optical modes on mirror surface . the integration is performed over mirror volume ( @xmath23 ) and mirror surface ( @xmath24 ) .    equation ( [ p ] ) is obtained for the all - resonant case : @xmath25 . substituting to eq . \n ( [ p ] ) parameters of ligo system , presented in table  ( [ param ] ) , and assuming full overlapping ( @xmath26 ) , we find that the pi threshold power , @xmath27 , is more than two orders of magnitude smaller if compared with the envisioned power level @xmath28 @xcite . to increase the threshold towards the desirable value we propose to increase @xmath14 to @xmath29 by inducing leakage of the stokes light out of the cavity due to enhanced diffraction of the high order optical modes . \n this increase results in a small practically acceptable increase of the attenuation of the fundamental mode @xmath30 . \n .parameters of ligo used in calculations [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      round trip loss ( red curve ) not exceeds 5 ppm , @xmath31 round trip loss ( blue curve ) is approximately @xmath32 ppm and ratio of these losses ( green curve ) reach a local maximum . \n this figure corresponds to the @xmath33 parameters set in table  ( [ table1 ] ) . \n , scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and gaussian one.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the tolerance requirements to approach the parameters described in table  ( [ table1 ] ) are reasonable . \n for example , for variant 3 in table  [ table1 ] the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 have to hold with accuracy about @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath38 respectively to keep the value of the loss within 3  db of the predicted values . \n it means that shape of the mirrors has to be manufactured within tolerance @xmath39 , which is practically feasible . \n another important factor is related to the dynamic stability of the modified fp cavity , which is discussed in the next section . \n the optimization of the mirrors shape results in reduction of the radiative loss of the higher order fp modes . as the consequence , \n the resonator sensitivity to the tilt of the mirrors increases if compared with the sensitivity of a conventional fp resonator . \n the tilt lifts orthogonality and results in linear coupling among the optical modes . \n the coupling is largest for the axial symmetric and the dipole modes . \n it is reasonable to expect that the angle sensitivity of the cavity attenuation is approximately proportional to the square root of the clipping loss value of the dipole mode . \n there is no known way of accurate analytical evaluation of the loss increase due to mirror tilt . \n moreover , the numerical simulations become rather involved since the tilt breaks the symmetry of the system . to evaluate this effect \n we use method of successive approximations that is based on fusion of the both numerical and analytical methods . according to this method , the round trip loss depends on small tilt angle @xmath40 of one of the mirrors of the fp cavity as @xmath41,\\\\ \\nonumber      u_{00,00 } & \\equiv    \\int |\\psi_{00}(x)|^2\\ , x^3\\ , dx ,      \\quad   \\int |\\psi_{j } ( x)|^2x\\ , dx=1\\,,\\\\      u_{j,00 } & \\equiv    \\int \\psi^*_{j } ( x)\\psi_{00 } ( x)\\ , x^2\\ , dx\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the wave number , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the calculated numerically forward trip eigenvalue and eigenvector of the unperturbed problem ( no tilt ) \n , @xmath45 is a permissible angle to characterize tilt stability . \n numeric calculations for parameters sets 1,2,3 listed in table  [ table1 ] give the following permissible tilt angles : @xmath46 to figure out if this value is large , we calculate similar number for current ligo interferometer ( table  [ param ] ) and find @xmath47rad . \n in other words , the dynamic range of the mirror angle deviation of conventional interferometer is an order of magnitude better than one of the interferometer with modified mirrors . \n this is expected as the loss parameter of the first dipole mode is approximately 1,000  ppm ( 10  ppm ) for the single mode ( conventional ) resonator . \n the considered here model of a fp resonator is a simplification of the realistic ligo system with one exception . \n the last one includes two fp resonators and a recycling mirror that allows increasing the effective finesse of the multi - resonator system . \n it is possible to show that the ligo resonator effective loss is proportional to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are power transmission coefficients of the input and recycling mirrors , respectively , and @xmath51 is the attenuation per round trip in the fp resonator . \n in advanced ligo interferometer @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite , so the effective transmission coefficient is about @xmath54  ppm , whereas diffraction loss @xmath55  ppm . \n hence , increase of diffraction loss of the fundamental mode by about an order of magnitude ( to @xmath0  ppm ) seems to be acceptable to use squeezing about @xmath56 . \n the increase of the attenuation of the dipole mode beyond 100  ppm results in reduction of pi in accordance with eq . \n we have shown that one can reduce impact of parametric instability of an interferometric gravity wave detector by optimizing geometrical shape of its mirrors . \n the improvement stems from the dependence of the threshold of the instability on the losses of the optical modes involved in the process . \n modification of the mirror shape increases the diffraction loss of the higher order optical modes resulting in the instability threshold increase , occurring at the cost of scrutinizing the mirror tilt stability requirements . to explain the effect , we have created a semi - analytical model of the diffraction loss of a fabry - perot cavity having an arbitrary mirror shape and found that engineered increase of diffraction loss of the high order modes with necessity leads to larger sensitivity of the fundamental mode loss to the mirror tilt . \n optimizing the ratio of the losses of the cavity modes it is possible to achieve a significant suppression of the opto - mechanic instability and also keep acceptable tolerances of the system implementation . \n we validated results of our predictions with numerical simulations . \n the authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with william kells . \n mikhail v. poplavskiy and sergey p. vyatchanin acknowledge support from the russian foundation for basic research ( grant no . \n 14 -

50 times smaller in the large magellanic cloud . in more detail , \n the hydroxyl and water maser populations are about 10 times smaller than our galaxy and thus accounted for by the smaller star formation rate in the large magellanic cloud . in contrast methanol is underabundant by a factor of 50 , with the additional factor attributed to the lower metallicity of the magellanic clouds ( green et al . \n 2008 ) . \n the second result was a simple study of the 3-kpc arms , an inner structure of the galaxy , located between the galactic bars and the spiral arms . \n the near arm has long been known ( van woerden et al . 1957 ) but \n the far - side counterpart was only recently discovered ( dame & thaddeus 2008 ) . \n there has been a continuing question over the existence of star formation within these structures , although some evidence ( e.g. caswell and haynes , 1987 ) existed . \n however , both arms were shown by 6.7-ghz methanol maser detections to clearly exhibit high - mass star formation ( green et al . \n 2009b ) . \n following on from the previous result , 6.7-ghz methanol masers were shown to highlight regions of enhanced star formation indicating the starting points of the spiral arms and the interaction of the ( long , thin ) galactic bar ( green et al . \n furthermore masers also provide many candidates for tracing the full 3-kpc arm structure ( a continuous ellipse rather than separate near and far components ) . \n additionally , the 12.2-ghz methanol companions detected in the follow - up observations were found to have smaller velocity ranges and lower flux densities than their 6.7-ghz methanol counterparts ( breen et al . \n there was an 80% coincidence in velocity of the strongest maser features of the 6.7-ghz and 12.2-ghz transitions . \n the 12.2-ghz are associated with a later evolutionary stage and an increase in velocity range and luminosity with age was found for both transitions . \n a comparison of the sites of 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission with infrared emission as detected by the glimpse survey has been made , and found @xmath380% of the maser sites had associated infrared emission ( gallaway et al . in prep . ) . \n the bright and compact nature of the maser sources makes them ideal for astrometry with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . \n such measurements provide accurate distances ( @xmath010 micro arcsec parallaxes ) and full three - dimensional motion ( @xmath01 km / s ) . \n maser astrometry can provide valuable data for both the structure of our galaxy and its velocity field . \n the nrao very long baseline array , european vlbi network and japanese vlbi network are currently being used , with @xmath230 parallaxes now published , and southern hemisphere observations are underway with the long baseline array .    another area \n that this project has provided the foundation for is in the study of magnetic fields . \n although the 6.7-ghz methanol maser itself can not easily be used for measuring in situ magnetic fields , due to the molecule being non - paramagnetic , the often associated hydroxyl maser can be . \n as such all the detections of the mmb have been observed with the australia telescope compact array for the ground - state transitions of hydoxyl ( as part of the ` magmo ' project ) and measurements of the zeeman splitting of components will provide estimates of the in situ magnetic field strength and line - of - sight orientation . \n finally it is the hope of the collaboration to follow up the survey with a northern hemisphere counterpart . \n + the mmb project is dedicated to jim cohen who sadly passed away in 2006 . \n + we are grateful to all the staff and engineers at both the parkes radio telescope and the australia telescope compact array .", "StartTimeOffset": 589611080688, "RequestID": "6286e640748fd2cc21d71061f7da5547e6cc7d1a", "TotalTokens": 1955}
{"ContextTokens": 3814, "GeneratedTokens": 212, "SynthesizedBody": "when active volcanism was discovered on io with the voyager spacecraft in 1979 it was soon speculated whether tiny dust grains entrained in io s plumes might be ejected into circumjovian space by electromagnetic forces [ ] . \n no observational proof for this mechanism , however , was available at that time . in 1992 \n streams of dust particles originating from the jovian system were discovered with the dust detector on - board the ulysses spacecraft [ ] . \n the dust streams consist of approximately 10 nm sized , electrically charged , dust grains [ ] , and they were later shown to originate from io [ ] . \n these tiny grains gain energy from the corotational electric field of the magnetosphere and escape from jupiter with speeds exceeding @xmath0 . \n the stream particles were also detected by the galileo and cassini spacecraft . since 1996 \n galileo made 33 orbits about jupiter and provided a long record about the temporal and spatial variability of the ejected dust fluxes . \n these observations show a large orbit - to - orbit variation due to both systematic and stochastic changes . \n systematic effects include io s orbital motion , changes in the geometry of galileo s orbit and in the magnetic field configuration due to the rotation of the planet . \n stochastic variations include fluctuations of io s volcanic activity and the deformation of the outer magnetosphere in response to the variable solar wind conditions . using the long record of galileo s dust measurements , the variability due to stochastic variations \n can be approximately removed by ` averaging ' . \n time series analysis of the data collected through the first two years of galileo in orbit about jupiter revealed that the intensity of the dust fluxes is modulated by both io s orbital period and jupiter s rotational period , even though these could not be easily recognized in single orbits [ ] . in this paper \n we examine the average spatial dependence of the dust emission pattern using the entire galileo data set . based on our earlier modeling [ ] , \n we expect a strong asymmetry in the dust emission pattern due to the asymmetry of the parameters of the io plasma torus . \n the plasma torus shows a dawn - dusk brightness asymmetry that is most likely the result of a large scale cross tail electric field related to the global flow pattern in the plasma tail of jupiter [ ] . \n the dawn - dusk electric field shifts the entire plasma torus by @xmath1 ( jupiter radius @xmath2 ) in the dawn direction , resulting in a higher plasma temperature on the dusk side . \n the charge of a dust particle escaping the plasma torus is a function of io s position in both magnetic and inertial coordinates , reflecting the plasma density and temperature variations along io s orbit . \n the cross - tail electric field is small compared to the co - rotational electric field and its direct effect on the dynamics of the dust particles is small . \n however , the displacement of the plasma torus leads to a strong dawn - to - dusk asymmetry in the plasma parameters that influences the escape of the dust particles . \n the charge carried by a dust grain will not stay constant as it travels through the io plasma torus . \n its charge is governed by a balance between electron and ion currents and secondary and photoelectron emission currents which are all functions of the plasma parameters , material properties , size , velocity and the instantaneous charge of a dust particle [ ] . for sufficiently high electron temperatures , secondary electron production becomes important so that incoming electrons can generate more than one outgoing secondary electron . \n hence , the net current can turn positive [ ] . in general , the charges of the grains are more positive on the dusk side of the torus where the electron temperature is higher . numerical simulations [ ] show that dust particles starting on the dawn side of jupiter remain captured by the io torus for some time whereas particles released at the dusk side have a higher chance to escape . \n this leads to a strong variation of the expected dust flux with jovian local time even if the dust ejection rate of io remains constant . \n the galileo dust measurements since 1996 provide a unique opportunity for long - term in - situ studies of the jovian dust environment . in this paper \n we analyze this six - year dust data set for systematic variations with jovian local time and compare our observations to our current models . \n galileo is a dual - spinning spacecraft with an antenna that points anti - parallel to the positive spin axis ( psa ) . during most of galileo s \n orbital tour about jupiter the antenna pointed towards earth . \n the galileo dust detector system ( dds ) , like its twin on - board ulysses , is a multi - coincidence impact ionization detector [ ] which measures submicrometer- and micrometer - sized dust particles . \n the dds is mounted on the spinning section of galileo and the sensor axis is offset by an angle of 60   from the psa . \n dds has a 140  wide field of view . \n thus , during one spin revolution of the spacecraft , the detector scans the entire anti - earth hemisphere , whereas particles approaching from the earth - ward hemisphere remain undetectable . \n the dust detector and the procedure for identification of jupiter stream particles in the galileo dust data set have been frequently discussed in the literature and are not repeated here [ ] . in this paper we will use class  3 ( our highest quality class ) and de - noised class  2 dust data [ ] . the galileo trajectory about jupiter \n is shown in a jupiter - centered coordinate system in fig . \n the spacecraft orbit is aligned along the planet s equatorial plane to within a few degrees . due to the planet \n s orbital motion about the sun , the line of apsides shifts by 360within one jovian year ( 11.9 earth years ) . \n since 1995 , when galileo was injected into a bound orbit about jupiter , the line of apsides has shifted clockwise by more than 180 . \n this allowed for dust measurements at varying jovian local times . \n the jovian dust streams have been detected with dds during all 33 galileo orbits about jupiter . due to the dds detection geometry , \n dust stream particles could be mostly detected in the inner jovian system , i.e. within @xmath3 from the planet , with a varying detection geometry from orbit to orbit . only after mid-2000 was the detection geometry significantly different so that dust stream particles could be detected during almost the entire galileo orbit including apojove ( cf . \n dds was operated continuously during galileo s orbital tour , and highly time resolved real - time science ( rts ) data were received from the instrument during most of the time periods when the geometry allowed for detection of the dust streams . \n dust fluxes measured in the inner jovian system are shown in fig . 1 superimposed upon the galileo trajectory . \n in these time periods and spatial region the dust flux varied by more than four orders of magnitude ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) . in order to calculate dust fluxes , \n the effective spin - averaged dds sensor area [ ] had to be taken into account , which did not remain constant as galileo moved about jupiter . \n the time - dependent sensor area was calculated by taking the trajectory of a 10  nm particle as a standard  trajectory : particles of this size best explain the observed impact directions of the streams [ ] . when no dust flux is superimposed upon the galileo trajectory in fig . \n 1 , the dust streams were either not in the field of view of dds or the spin - averaged effective sensor area was too small ( below @xmath6 which is less than 10% of the maximum value ) so that large uncertainties in the derived flux would occur . \n no rts dust data were collected during galileo orbits 5 ( jan 1997 ) and 13 ( feb 1998 ) and a few short intervals of spacecraft anomalies ( safings ) . \n = 0.96    the sensitivity of dds has changed over time due to radiation - related aging effects in the instrument electronics . this instrument degradation has been revealed from an analysis of the electronics response to simulated charge signals generated by a test pulse generator which is part of the dds . \n this change of the instrument response is consistent with a gradual shift of the charge signals measured for the jovian dust streams during the galileo jupiter mission [ ] . \n the drop in sensitivity has been about a factor of 5 since galileo s early jupiter mission in 1996 . by assuming a size distribution of the particles , a correction for the flux has been calculated and applied to the data : taking the impact charge distribution measured for stream particles in 1996 ( [ ] , their fig . \n 6 ) when the instrument still had its nominal sensitivity , the flux correction factor is one in 1996 and rises up to 25 in early 2002 . \n figure 1 shows some systematic trends : some adjacent orbits show similar dust fluxes at comparable spatial locations , but others do not . in order to search for systematic variations with jovian local time , \n we show the dust flux vs. local time for each orbit in fig . \n 2 . due to the orbital motion of galileo , \n these data were collected at different distances from jupiter as is indicated by contour lines . for a source with a constant dust ejection rate and assuming continuity , one expects the dust flux to drop with the inverse square of the source distance . \n therefore , in addition to the corrections discussed above , the fluxes shown in fig . 2 have been multiplied by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the distance from jupiter ) to eliminate the distance dependence of the flux due to the motion of galileo . \n = 0.99    an additional cause for temporal flux variations is the dust source io itself : for example , during orbits 4 and 21 , at distances between 15 and 30 @xmath9 , dds measured the highest dust fluxes in the inner jovian system during the entire galileo mission , whereas earlier and later adjacent orbits showed significantly lower fluxes . \n these variations are likely due to changes of the dust ejection of io s volcanic plumes . \n however , a correlation of io dust production with plume activity could not yet be established ( see also [ ] ) . in spite of such orbit - to - orbit variability , \n systematic trends with jovian local time are obvious in fig . \n 2 : higher fluxes occurred on the dawn side of jupiter whereas very low fluxes were typically measured around noon . \n flux variations from orbit to orbit caused by changes in the io dust production are expected to cancel out when averaging over the entire galileo dust data set is performed . \n this is done in fig . \n 3 : the bottom panel shows the dust flux for all galileo orbits averaged over half - hour local time intervals . before adding all flux measurements in a half - hour local time bin , the dust flux for each orbit was normalized to a range between 0 and 1 . due to this normalization , the flux correction for instrument aging does not have an effect on the averaged flux curve . due to the changing detection geometry of dds during the galileo mission , the number of orbits available for averaging varied with local time ( cf . \n 2 ) . in order to avoid extreme flux values from individual orbits to appear in the average flux curve , an average data point \n is only shown when flux measurements are available from at least three galileo orbits . \n therefore , no data are shown between 20 and 24  h local time . \n in addition , flux measurements with an effective sensor area below @xmath10 were ignored . \n the dust flux measurements from the entire galileo mission presented in the bottom panel of fig . \n 3 show a strong local time dependence : high fluxes occurred between 0 and 6  h and between 15 to 18  h. systematically fewer particles were measured between 8 and 15  h.    = 0.71 \n we now compare the galileo dust measurements with dynamical modeling [ ] . \n dust particles in the size range from 5 to 15  nm were released from io uncharged with the same initial velocity as io s velocity at the time of their ejection . \n their charging and dynamics was followed numerically . \n the grains get charged in the io plasma torus and their probability to escape the torus strongly depends on io s position at the time of particle release [ ] . \n jupiter s magnetic field has been described using the gsfc  @xmath11 or vip  4 model [ ] . \n jupiter s plasma has been approximated using a plasma model , which is a fit to the voyager  1 and 2 plasma measurements [ ] . \n the local time dependence of the probability of the particles crossing ganymede s orbit ( @xmath12 ) within @xmath13 above / below the equatorial plane of jupiter is shown in the top panel of fig . \n the data remarkably confirm the theoretical expectations : the local time dependence of the flux is well in agreement , even the factor of @xmath14 contrast of the dust fluxes between 5 and 12  h local time is seen in the data .    from the current study alone \n , we can not distinguish between io as a point source or the entire plasma torus as a ring source . \n in fact , the long - term averaging effectively smears io dust into a ring . \n this study shows that the plasma model , the description of the charging processes and the dynamics of the grains used in our model to describe dust production from io and its torus does reproduce the long - term averaged behavior of the observations . in particular , \n the plasma conditions in the io torus are well represented as they are crucial for dust charging there . \n models without the torus dawn - dusk asymmetry do not show any local time dependence of the dust flux . \n thus , dust stream particles can be used as tracers for the plasma conditions in the io torus . \n for example , we plan on using the direction and the magnitude of the dawn - to - dusk displacement as free parameters to fit the simulation results to the observations . \n hence , comparing the local time dependence of the measured flux to the theoretical expectations allows for using dust measurements to independently confirm the direction and the magnitude of the cross - tail electric field . in the same way the dust particles may also serve as probes of the jovian magnetosphere . \n our distance correction with @xmath15 assumes an average source distance of jupiter , consistent with a smeared out ring source of the io torus . \n we also applied a correction factor @xmath16 to the data , assuming a particle source at the io torus location . \n this does not significantly change the data in the bottom panel of fig . \n it even increases the contrast between 5 and 12  h local time . \n we have also searched for systematic variations of particle size with local time in the galileo dust data set . \n although the dust stream particles are not in the calibrated mass and speed range of the dust instrument [ ] , the charge released upon impact of the dust grains onto the detector target can be used as an indicator for particle size . \n the data indicate a systematic variation of impact charge with local time , although much less pronounced than in the case of the dust flux . together with our simulations \n , this may also lead to better constraints of the plasma conditions in the io torus . \n here we have taken the entire dds data set to average over flux variations from one orbit to the next in order to identify changes due to systematic variations alone . \n the understanding of these systematic changes will allow us to ` remove ' them from the data and to identify the ` true ' temporal variability of io and the plasma torus . \n complementing our earlier time - series analysis , our results also confirm that io and its plasma torus are the source for the majority ( if not all ) of the dust stream particles . \n this source alone gives an excellent fit to the observed spatial dependence of the dust fluxes , a significant contribution from an extended source , the gossamer ring , for example , or any other moon would show a different ejection pattern . \n a competing suggestion for the source of the stream particles was the gossamer ring region of jupiter . here \n the plasma density is expected to be very low , hence the dominant charging process is photoelectron production from the grains . as the charging environment remains axially symmetric , grains \n if ejected from this region  would show a uniform ejection pattern . \n in addition to the galileo dust measurements within jupiter s magnetosphere , the dust streams were also detected with three dust instruments in interplanetary space ( ulysses , galileo and cassini ) . \n the local time variation of the dust flux found in the inner jovian magnetosphere may at least partially explain why galileo ( approaching jupiter from @xmath17 local time ; [ ] ) has measured on average higher fluxes than ulysses ( approaching from @xmath18 ; [ ] ) . in 2004 \n ulysses will approach jupiter to 0.8  au again and will be able to measure the jovian dust streams at varying local times and jovigraphic latitudes . although the interplanetary magnetic field affects the dynamics of the stream particles [ ] , the imprint of the local time variations may show up that far from its origin .    in summary , we now recognize the escaping dust particles as a promising new diagnostic tool to characterize the average properties of the jovian magnetosphere , as well as the temporal variability of its most important source : io . \n we thank the galileo project at jpl for effective and successful mission operations . \n this research has been supported by the german bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung through deutsches zentrum fr luft- und raumfahrt ( grant 50 qj 9503 3 ) . \n m.h . has been supported by nasa . \n , h. and grn , e. 2002 . . \n in green , s. , editor , _ proceedings of the iau coll . \n 181 and cospar coll . \n 11 _ dust in the solar system and in other planetary systems _ held at univ . of kent at canterbury in april 2000_. 144159 .", "StartTimeOffset": 595361302026, "RequestID": "1bc981a5c11a91965acda9d64a9ca14cad69fc39", "TotalTokens": 4026}

the enhanced decay of the condensate could also be understood from two- and three - body inelastic collisions between condensate and thermal atoms . \n also , two- and three - body loss rate constants were not known accurately and both processes were expected to contribute about equally to the decay @xcite . \n therefore the rate constants had to be determined from a fit . \n recently , we have accurately determined these two- and three - body loss rate constants over a range of magnetic field values  @xcite . \n we transferred @xmath7he@xmath8  atoms from a magnetic trap into an optical dipole trap and measured , both for atoms in the  and  state , the two- and three - body loss rate constants as a function of an applied magnetic field and with a ( quasi-)pure bec . in this paper \n we extend the previous experiment to partially condensed clouds with a large thermal fraction in order to investigate atomic transfer . to reduce two- and three - body losses we study long time scales and work at small magnetic field using  atoms that , in contrast to  atoms , only show three - body losses . \n the time evolution of the density of a trapped atomic gas can be described as @xmath9 the first term on the right takes into account one - body loss , which causes exponential decay with a time constant @xmath0 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the rate coefficients for two- and three - body loss , respectively , and are defined such that they explicitly include the loss of two and three atoms per loss event . \n the constants in front of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 and @xmath13 for a bec , while @xmath14 for a thermal gas  @xcite . \n the rate coefficients are obtained by measuring the number of trapped atoms after a variable hold time . \n the analysis of this data requires integration of eq . \n [ densityevolution ] over space . because a bec and a thermal cloud have different density distributions , extracting two- and three - body loss rate coefficients from partially condensed samples becomes very difficult , and experiments usually focus on either a pure bec or a thermal sample . \n in sec.2 of their paper , zin _ et al . _ \n @xcite have derived a simple model for the decay of the thermal and bec components of a partially condensed cloud in thermal equilibrium below the temperature threshold for bose - einstein condensation . \n the essential assumption of the model is that thermal equilibrium holds during one - body decay of a condensate . \n although two- and three - body losses may be incorporated in the model , this complicates the discussion and therefore we here ensure those to be negligible compared to the one - body losses by using low enough densities . \n if an atom is removed from the thermal cloud by , for instance , a collision with a background atom , then there is a place free in the otherwise saturated thermal distribution , which can be filled by a bec atom , thus maintaining the size of the thermal cloud at the expense of the bec . \n this transfer of atoms from the condensate to the thermal cloud enhances the decay of the condensate and increases the lifetime of the thermal cloud .    for the whole cloud , containing @xmath15 atoms , decay is exponential with time constant @xmath0 . \n the model then predicts that the thermal cloud will also decay exponentially , however with a larger time constant , while the condensate is expected to decay non - exponentially  @xcite : @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number of condensed atoms and number of thermal atoms , respectively , and @xmath19 . \n the equations show that the thermal cloud is expected to decay exponentially with a time constant @xmath20 , independent of @xmath17 , which is assumed to be nonzero . for the bec \n a non - exponential decay is expected if an appreciable amount of thermal atoms is present . \n the model is valid up to the point that there are no bec atoms left or thermal equilibrium can not be assumed anymore . \n starting with a partially condensed cloud finally leads to the complete depletion of the bec ; for the pure thermal cloud , decay then proceeds with time constant @xmath21 . \n [ modelequation1 ] and [ modelequation2 ] are valid when the energy of a condensate atom ( which is , apart from a small mean - field contribution , equal to the ground state energy @xmath22 of the harmonic trap potential ) can be neglected compared to the average energy of a thermal atom ( @xmath23 )  @xcite : @xmath24 in order to observe atomic transfer experimentally , inelastic collisions within the cloud should not play a role , but still a high enough elastic collision rate is necessary to reach fast thermalization . \n the thermalization rate is given by @xmath25 @xcite , with collision rate @xmath26 . here \n , @xmath27 is the average density , @xmath28 is the mean relative thermal velocity , and @xmath29 the elastic cross - section at ultralow temperatures , where @xmath30=142.0(0.1)@xmath31 for @xmath7he@xmath8  @xcite . \n the large scattering length ensures fast thermalization down to a density of @xmath32 @xmath33 , which is reached after 40 s in our dipole trap ( see sec . \n [ experiment ] ) . \n we have studied one - body loss in a bec of @xmath7he@xmath8  atoms with a considerable thermal fraction . \n the experimental setup and measurement procedure have been described earlier  @xcite , here we summarize only the most essential parts . \n a bec of about 10@xmath34 atoms is prepared in a crossed optical dipole trap at a wavelength of 1557  nm , and all atoms are transferred from the  magnetic substate to the  magnetic substate by an rf sweep . \n we measure the remaining number of trapped atoms after a variable hold time by turning off the trap , causing the atoms to fall and be detected by a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) detector , which is located 17  cm below the trap center and gives rise to a time - of - flight of approximately 186  ms . from a bimodal fit to the mcp signal , the bec and thermal fraction are extracted as well as the temperature and the chemical potential of the trapped gas  @xcite . \n he@xmath8  gas in the  state at a magnetic field of 10  g , showing the results of bimodal fits of the mcp signal of the remaining @xmath7he@xmath8  atoms , where the insets show the fit temperature . \n the trap frequencies and the average temperature are ( a ) @xmath35  hz and 0.22(3 )  @xmath36k and ( b ) @xmath37  hz and 0.36(5 )  @xmath36k , respectively . \n the solid lines and the shaded area are obtained from fits to the atomic transfer model , as described in the text . \n [ lifetimedata],width=321 ]    in fig . \n [ lifetimedata ] we show typical time evolutions of the partially condensed cloud , where the total , thermal and bec atom number are logarithmically plotted , normalized to the total number of atoms at @xmath38 . \n [ lifetimedata](a ) shows the decay for a sample with an initial bec fraction of 80% ( with a thermal fraction at a temperature of 0.22(3 )  @xmath36k ) , while in fig . \n [ lifetimedata](b ) the bec fraction is 50% ( at a temperature of 0.36(5 )  @xmath36k ) . \n the experiments are performed in a dipole trap with a geometrical mean of the trapping frequency of @xmath35  hz and @xmath37  hz , respectively . \n .  [ assumption ] is easily fulfilled throughout the decay since @xmath39 . \n we also observe that the temperature changes very little during the decay ( see the insets in fig . \n [ lifetimedata ] ) . at short hold times , the loss is dominated by three - body recombination with a rate constant of @xmath40  cm@xmath34s@xmath42  @xcite . \n two - body loss by penning ionization is strongly suppressed for the spin - stretched states  and  @xcite , while for  the spin - dipole interaction also does not contribute to two - body losses because the atom is in the lowest spin state  @xcite . \n [ lifetimedata ] clearly shows that , for hold times longer than 10  s , the loss of the total atom number becomes exponential , indicating the regime of one - body loss . in both measurements the initial density of the bec is @xmath43  @xmath33 . \n the thermal cloud initially has a density @xmath44  @xmath33 , which after 40  s has decreased to @xmath45  @xmath33 . \n the thermalization rate decreases in that time from @xmath46  s@xmath42 to @xmath47  s@xmath42 , still much larger than the one - body decay rate of approximately 0.05  s@xmath42 , ensuring sufficiently rapid thermal equilibration . \n we observe a faster decay of the bec fraction than the thermal fraction , eventually leading to a full depletion of the condensate , as expected from the atomic transfer model . \n inspection of the decay of the thermal cloud for times longer than 10 s clearly shows that the thermal cloud decays with a larger time constant than the whole cloud . \n fitting an exponential decay function to the data at longer hold times yields @xmath48  s , @xmath49  s and @xmath50 for the data of fig .  [ lifetimedata](a ) , and @xmath51  s , @xmath52 s and @xmath53 for fig . \n [ lifetimedata](b ) , where we give @xmath54-uncertainties . \n we attribute the relatively small lifetime to off - resonant scattering of the dipole trap light or resonant excitation by stray light , which could also explain the difference in the obtained lifetimes ( our background pressure would limit the lifetime to @xmath2100  s ) . \n we conclude that the thermal fraction decays significantly slower than the bec fraction and that the measured lifetime ratio is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction of @xmath55 .    to compare the measurements of the bec fraction with the atomic transfer model we first fit an exponential decay @xmath56 to the total atom number for long hold times to obtain the overall lifetime @xmath0 as well as @xmath57 . \n here @xmath57 is the _ apparent _ atom number at @xmath58=0 in the absence of three - body loss . in the second step , \n we fit an exponential decay @xmath59 to the thermal fraction , with only the _ apparent _ bec fraction @xmath60 as a fit parameter . finally , with the obtained parameters @xmath57 , @xmath0 and @xmath60 , we numerically solve eq . \n [ modelequation2 ] to obtain @xmath61 . \n the fit results are shown in fig . \n [ lifetimedata ] as solid lines . \n the @xmath54 errors in the fit parameters are reflected in the band around the theoretical curve for @xmath17 . \n we observe that the atomic transfer model describes the time evolution of the thermal and bec fraction very well . \n our data provides direct verification of the atomic transfer model . the relatively short lifetime @xmath0 \n @xmath62  20  s , together with a large scattering length , provide optimal conditions to see this effect . \n also , at the relatively small numbers of trapped atoms needed to demonstrate atomic transfer , mcp detection allows better fitting of the bec fraction compared to absorption imaging . \n atomic transfer is most directly visible in the one - body loss regime , but is important in the two- and three - body regime as well , as was theoretically discussed in ref . \n @xcite . as a final remark \n we note that one should take care using a bec for loss measurements \n . the thermal fraction may be small in the initial stage of bec decay , but can dramatically increase after long hold times affecting the decay of the condensate , which will finally become non - exponential . \n we thank jacques bouma for technical support . \n this work was financially supported by the dutch foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) . \n s.  k.  acknowledges financial support from the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) via a vidi grant . \n 17ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12 \n & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 607336035468, "RequestID": "91d3e9ae1d3b1beedce6a53e88e60e1f749113d4", "TotalTokens": 3761}
{"ContextTokens": 2255, "GeneratedTokens": 256, "SynthesizedBody": "the basic picture of galaxy formation and evolution in the cosmological context can be explained in the standard @xmath1 cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology . \n particularly , large scale clustering properties and formation and evolution of dark matter halos can reliably be predicted by the theory of gravity . \n however , in order to obtain the full picture of cosmological galaxy formation , we must solve complicated processes of baryonic physics , such as gas cooling , star formation , feedback , galaxy mergers , and so on . \n one of the key observables about galaxies that must be explained by the theory of cosmological galaxy formation is the luminosity functions ( lfs ) and their evolution . \n compared with the shape of dark matter halo mass function predicted by the @xmath1cdm cosmology , the observed galaxy lfs have two remarkable features : flatter faint - end slopes and sharp exponential cut - off at the luminous / massive end ( see benson et al . \n 2003 and references therein ) , which must be explained by some baryonic processes . \n a widely accepted solution to achieve a flat faint end is supernova feedback , i.e. , energy input into the interstellar medium by supernova explosions to suppress star formation in small galaxies . \n however , the problem is not yet completely solved at the quantitative level . \n in fact , unreasonably high efficiency of supernova feedback to remove cold interstellar gas in dwarf galaxies is necessary in many existing theoretical models to reproduce the observed flat faint ends , and such an extreme supernova feedback tends to produce discrepancies with observations other than luminosity function shapes ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 , hereafter ny04 ; nagashima et al . \n 2005 ; bower et al . \n 2006 , 2012 ; guo et al . \n 2011 ; wang , weinmann & neistein 2012 ; mutch , poole & croton 2013 ; puchwein & springel 2013 ; hopkins et al . \n these results imply that another physical effect may also be taking an important role to produce the observed flat faint end slopes .    for the massive end , \n a popular solution to suppress the formation of too massive galaxies is the feedback by active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , bower et al . \n 2006 ; croton et al . \n 2006 ; menci et al . \n 2008 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; guo et al . 2011 ) . \n the agn feedback can also explain the observed trends of the early appearance of massive and quiescent galaxies at high redshifts , and downsizing of star - forming galaxies from high to low redshifts , which are apparently in contradiction with the simple expectation in the @xmath1cdm universe ( e.g. , bower et al . \n 2006 ; somerville et al . \n 2008 ) . however , there are large uncertainties about the physics of agn feedback both in theoretically and observationally . \n the current success in explaining the observed trends by this process is based on rather phenomenological modelings including highly uncertain parameters , and further studies are required to confirm the quantitative influence of this process on galaxy evolution . \n therefore it is still worth to explore yet other physical effects working to shape galaxy lfs , which is the aim of this paper . \n it is reasonable to expect that such an effect would be manifested in the scaling laws about star formation efficiency . \n the relation between the surface densities of star formation rate ( sfr ) and gas ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) has been a subject of intensive research . \n it is popular to fit this relation by a power - law ( so - called kennicutt - schmidt law , kennicutt 1998 ) , but recent observations indicate a cut - off around the total ( i.e. , + h@xmath4 ) gas density of @xmath5 , under which sfr is suppressed and not well correlated with gas density . \n this threshold gas density for sfr can be interpreted as a result of less efficient formation of cold molecular gas under the threshold , while the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) from molecular gas is rather universal in many different environments ( wong & blitz 2002 ; kennicutt et al . \n 2007 ; bigiel et al . 2008 , 2010 ; leroy et al . 2008 \n ; blanc et al . 2009 ; heiderman et al . 2010 ; lada et al . \n 2010 , schruba et al . 2011 \n ; see kennicutt & evans 2012 and schruba 2013 for reviews ) . \n a likely physical origin of the suppression of h@xmath4 formation under the threshold is radiative feedback by uv photons produced by young massive stars ( schaye 2004 ; krumholz , mckee & tumlinson 2008 , 2009 ; mckee & krumholz 2010 ; hopkins et al . 2013 ) . \n the formation of h@xmath4 is driven by collisionally excited metal line cooling and molecule formation on dust grain surfaces , which should be balanced with molecule dissociations by uv photons and grain photoelectric heating , both of which are energetically supplied by uv radiation field . if a region in a galaxy is optically thick to uv radiation field by dust grains , self - shielding of uv radiation would accelerate h@xmath4 formation . \n this implies that the more fundamental threshold about star formation is not the total gas surface density but dust opacity . for a typical dust - to - gas ratio , \n the observationally indicated threshold in @xmath3 is close to the value at which the effective dust opacity @xmath6 becomes of order unity , where @xmath6 is averaged over wavelength with a weight of the heating radiation energy spectrum ( totani et al . \n 2011 ) . \n therefore it is physically reasonable to expect that a galaxy - scale mean value of @xmath6 has an important role in galaxy formation and evolution . \n a further observational support to this picture comes from infrared observations . \n the relations between dust temperature , galaxy size , and infrared luminosity of @xmath71,000 nearby star - forming galaxies indicate that almost all of them are in the optically thick regime , and the distribution of dust opacity estimated by gas - phase metal column density suddenly drops around @xmath8 , indicating less efficient formation of galaxies at @xmath9 ( totani et al . \n 2011 ) . \n the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the radiative feedback depend on dust opacity , on cosmological galaxy formation and evolution particularly about the shape of galaxy luminosity functions . \n the theory of structure formation in the universe predicts that the mean surface density @xmath10 of dark halos with mass @xmath11 and size @xmath12 nearly scales as @xmath13 , indicating higher gas surface density and dust opacity at higher redshifts in more massive objects , and hence more efficient star formation . \n this may have a favorable effect to explain observations , in a similar way to the feedbacks by supernovae and agns .    to investigate the effect quantitatively \n , we use a semi - analytic model ( sam ) of cosmological galaxy formation , _ the mitaka model _ ( ny04 ) . \n this is a model similar to general sams , in which formation and evolution of dark matter halos are solved analytically or calculated by n - body simulations , while complicated baryonic processes are treated phenomenologically ( for reviews , see baugh 2006 ; benson 2010 ) . in general \n , sams has many adjustable parameters and the effects of complicated physical processes on the lfs are degenerate ( e.g. , neistein & weinmann 2010 ) ; therefore a set of best - fit parameters may not be a quantitatively correct description of real galaxy formation . \n it should be noted that the most important aim of this work is to examine the qualitative effects of the new feedback on luminosity functions .    in most of the sams , \n the star formation rate is simply proportional to cold gas mass , and the star formation time scale is modeled as a simple function of the dynamical time scale of galaxy disks or dm halos ( e.g. , cole et al . \n 2000 ; ny04 ) . some models ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ; croton et al . \n 2006 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; lagos et al . 2011 ; wang et al . \n 2012 ) incorporated the threshold of gas surface density below which star formation activity is significantly suppressed . in the models of kauffmann ( 1996 ) , croton et al . \n ( 2006 ) , and lagos et al . \n ( 2011 ) , they introduced the threshold of gas surface density motivated by the toomre stability criterion on a galactic scale ( toomre 1964 ) . in this scenario the threshold of gas surface density increases with redshift , and hence the threshold effect should be systematically different in the cosmological context from the threshold by dust opacity considered in this paper . \n furthermore , some recent observations indicate that star formation are controlled by the physical state of local interstellar gas , rather than the dynamical state of an entire galaxy ( e.g. , leroy et al . \n 2008 ; lada et al . \n 2010 ) .    in other models , such as somerville et al . \n ( 2008 ) , a critical gas surface density threshold for star formation is introduced motivated from the observations of the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation ; however , to our knowledge there are no sams that consider a feedback depending on dust surface density rather than gas density . \n recently krumholz & dekel ( 2012 ) incorporated a star formation law which depends on gas surface density and gas metallicity , and discussed average evolution of typical galaxies without calculating detailed merger histories of dark halos . \n the relation between the luminosity function shapes and the dust opacity threshold of star formation has not yet been discussed in previous studies . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : \n model ] , we will describe our model particularly focusing on the modelings of star formation and feedback . \n in section [ sec : results ] , we show the results of our model , and section [ sec : gasmodel ] is devoted for discussion . we will summarize our work in section [ sec : summary ] . in this work , \n the cosmological parameters of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are adopted , and all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system .", "StartTimeOffset": 614782892388, "RequestID": "8c1286e5618996b2596e98c1e97efa6178e3ca56", "TotalTokens": 2511}
{"ContextTokens": 2737, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations , and vlbi surveys in particular , have contributed significantly to our understanding of active galaxies . \n for example , the discovery of superluminal motion in these systems provided the first clue that viewing angle was an important parameter in interpreting and eventually unifying different classes of active galaxies , including radio galaxies and quasars ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . \n more recently , vlbi has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary scenario wherein very young compact sources are the precursors of giant extended sources associated with radio galaxies ( taylor et al . \n numerous other advances are summarized in these proceedings .    at ghz frequencies , \n vlbi surveys usually target sources distributed across the sky . \n the sources are also often pre - selected to be strong ( @xmath0  mjy ) and to exhibit flat spectra ( e.g. , beasley et al.2002 ) . \n such samples are largely dominated by intrinsically luminous active galaxies at moderate redshifts @xmath1 . \n self - calibration techniques can be used for such bright sources so calibration overhead is minimal . \n but the observation time @xmath2 per source is reduced by needing to slew the array from source to source . \n also , most observers impose a typical image field of view ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4  milliarcseconds , ensuring that only one source is detected in any given observation time @xmath2 . \n such vlbi surveys are therefore slow and the biases introduced are substantial . \n recent attempts have been made to survey weaker ( @xmath5  mjy ) sources using phase referencing in the switching style . \n such vlbi surveys take advantage of the huge catalog of first sources now available at 1.4  ghz with a resolution of 5 ( white et al.1997 ) . \n these vlbi surveys are usually localized to a region subtending a few square degrees and including a strong phase calibrator close to weaker targets . \n example surveys are presented in these proceedings by gurvits et al . \n ( 2004 ) and by wrobel et al.(2004 ) . \n these surveys are both unbiased as no spectral pre - selection is made and efficient as they minimize array slewing . \n but phase referencing in the switching style causes substantial calibration overhead , leaving a typical observation time per source of @xmath6  minutes . for the weaker vlbi detections , the dynamic range can be 10 or less . for the stronger vlbi detections , \n the dynamic range is often limited by residual phase - referencing errors . \n these limitations mean that jets and other secondary features can easily be missed , making morphological classification difficult . \n although a @xmath7  milliarcseconds is required to accommodate first s astrometric accuracy , this is still small enough to ensure only one target per @xmath3 . \n moreover , the 10-millijy sources from first still involve essentially the same radio source populations that are targeted in the bright surveys ( ivezi et al . \n 2002 ) . \n indeed , at 1.4  ghz most sources slightly stronger than @xmath8  mjy are energized by active nuclei ( e.g. , condon et al . \n 2003 ) . what steps can be taken toward studying the more diverse sub - millijy population at resolutions of , say , 10  milliarcseconds ( 80  pc at @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 ) ? \n sources brighter than 0.1  millijy have an areal density of 0.2 per square arcminute , so about a dozen are expected within the primary beam of a 100-m class antenna . \n therefore , progress can be expected if two technical goals can be reached : achieve wider fields of view and lower detection thresholds , such that many sources can be observed simultaneously with the vlbi array .    for a connected array with short baselines , the @xmath3 is often set by the primary - beam response of the antennas in the array . for vlbi \n this is rarely the case . in vlbi \n , a more demanding limitation is set by the frequency and time sampling used during data correlation . \n this sampling must be fine enough to mitigate the effects of both bandwidth and time - average smearing in images . also , since preserving @xmath3 scales computationally with the square of the baseline length , generating wide - field vlbi images is often limited by the off - line computing resources available . \n this latter restriction has introduced a psychological barrier , which is that most vlbi observers over - average their data in both the time and frequency domains to make data sets more manageable . \n data - averaging collapses both the @xmath3 and the total information content , leaving us with the postage - stamp vlbi images with which we are all so familiar . \n the sub - millijy population in a region containing the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) was observed using the evn at 1.6  ghz , 25-milliarcsecond resolution , and 64-mhz bandwidth ( garrett et al.2001 ) . \n the observations spanned two 16-hour segments but phase referencing in the switching style left an observation time of only @xmath14  hours . \n a @xmath3 a few arcminutes in diameter was set by bandwidth and time - average smearing , and by the primary - beam responses of the largest antennas in the array . \n the evn clearly detected sources stronger than 210  microjy per beam ( 5@xmath15 ) in two of the five target patches imaged within the @xmath3 . \n one detection locates the active nucleus and an adjacent feature in an fr - i galaxy at @xmath16 , while the other detection is a candidate active nucleus embedded in an obscured starburst at @xmath17 . \n the observed rms noise levels were higher than the expected thermal levels , due to residual phase - calibration errors . \n we have improved upon the hdf - n survey with a vlbi observation in the noao botes field using the nrao vlba and gbt at 1.4  ghz and 64-mhz bandwidth ( garrett , wrobel , & morganti , in preparation ) . \n the vlba is described by napier et al . \n the observations spanned three 8-hour segments . \n phase referencing in the in - beam style led to an observation time @xmath18  hours . \n two correlation passes were made within the gbt primary beam of fwhm 8.6 , shown as the circle in the figure . \n the passes were centered on the in - beam calibrator and on a region with six faint wsrt targets ( de vries et al . \n 2002 , morganti & garrett 2002 ) . for each pass , a @xmath19 4 in diameter was preserved and the output data rate of 1  mbyte per second yielded a data set of size 60  gbytes . \n the data from the calibrator pass were edited , averaged , and calibrated , and its gain parameters applied to the target - pass data . \n the aips task imagr was used to make dirty images / beams from the target - pass data after editing and calibration . \n each dirty image subtended a square 6 on a side . for each target , three such dirty images were made from the three observation segments and then simply co - added . \n this was a slow computational task : about 8 hours were required to produce one dirty image / beam on a 2-ghz linux pc with dual processors . \n for the stronger sources , cleaned images were produced with aips task apcln by subtracting the dirty beam from the dirty image . \n visibility - based cleaning is currently prohibitively expensive in terms of computing requirements . \n three sources were detected within the gbt primary beam , at a resolution of 10  milliarcseconds and above the detection threshold of 63  microjy per beam ( 7@xmath15 ) . \n these detections include the 20-millijy calibrator and two sub - millijy sources . \n each detection is unresolved and has noao photometric data available ( januzzi & dey 1999 ) . the calibrator is a quasar . \n one sub - millijy detection locates the active nucleus with @xmath20  millijy within an fr - i galaxy with @xmath21  millijy . \n the other sub - millijy detection has @xmath20  millijy and recovers most of the @xmath22  millijy . \n this is a candidate active nucleus because , at the comological distance suggested by the host s blue drop - out , ( 1 ) the spectral luminosity is too high for prompt emission from a sn and ( 2 ) the wsrt photometry spanning 20 months shows no variability , arguing against emission from a grb afterglow . \n finally , the disk galaxy ngc5646 at @xmath23 with @xmath24  millijy was not detected at 10-milliarcsecond resolution ; its wsrt emission follows the optical isophotes and obeys the fir / radio correlation , suggesting a star formation origin .    by tapering the visibility data , portions of the vlba primary beam of fwhm 29 were imaged at poorer sensitivity and resolution to yield five further detections . \n these detections involve brighter radio sources probably hosted by active galaxies and quasars , but the available noao photometric data have not yet been analysed . \n the long - term goal for these new vlbi surveys is to constrain the contribution that active galaxies make to the faint radio source population in general , and the optically faint radio / sub - mm source population in particular ( garrett 2003 ) . to have an impact in this area , it is essential that many sources be surveyed over large regions with rms sensitivities of a few microjy . \n global vlbi arrays employing disk - based recordings should be able to achieve such sensitivities . \n the proposed pcint program at jive will enable output data rates as high as 160  mbytes per second , remarkably expanding the accessible @xmath3 . \n it will thus be possible to sample simultaneously the summed response of all milliarcsecond - scale emission within ( and beyond ) the primary - beam response . \n after some phase - referencing to improve the coherence time , simple self - calibration of most fields should be possible at frequencies of 1 - 3  ghz . \n access to grid - like computing resources may be the best way to analyse the enormous data sets generated . \n huge and unbiased vlbi surveys will be conducted , with the bulk of the targets being faint sources with flux densities of only a few tens of microjy . \n this work made use of images provided by the ndwfs , which is supported by noao . \n noao is operated by aura , inc . \n , under a cooperative agreement with the nsf . \n nrao is a facility of the nsf operated under cooperative agreement by aui . \n beasley , a.  j. , et al . \n 2002 , , 141 , 13 condon , j.  j. , et al . \n 2003 , , 125 , 2411 de vries , w.  h. , et al . \n 2002 , , 123 , 1784 garrett , m.  a. , et al . \n 2001 , , 366 , l5 garrett , m.  a. 2003 , new technologies in vlbi , ed .  y.  c. minh gurvits , l.  i. , et al . \n 2004 , this volume ivezi , z. et al . \n 2002 , , 124 , 2364 jannuzi , b.  t. , & dey , a. 1999 , in asp conf .  ser . \n 191 , photometric redshifts and high redshift galaxies , ed . \n r.  j. weymann et al . \n ( san francisco : asp ) , 111 morganti , r. , & garrett , m.  a. 2002 , astron newsletter , no . \n 17 + ( http://www.astron.nl/astron/newsletter/2002-1/ ) napier , p.  j. , et al . \n 1994 , proc . \n ieee , 82 , 658 taylor , g.  b. , et al . \n 2000 , , 541 , 112 urry , c.  m. , & padovani , p. 1995 \n , , 107 , 803 white , r.  l. , et al . \n 1997 , , 475 , 479 wrobel , j.  m. , et al . \n 2004 , this volume", "StartTimeOffset": 629332347414, "RequestID": "cd76d163903db0d0cba484da1bdfc046126bcb5c", "TotalTokens": 2922}
{"ContextTokens": 3061, "GeneratedTokens": 144, "SynthesizedBody": "because the gravitational interaction is so weak , a stochastic background of gravitational radiation ( the graviton background ) decouples from the matter in the universe at very early times . \n for this reason , the stochastic background of gravitational radiation , which is in principle observable at the present time , carries with it a picture of the state of the universe at very early times , when energy densities and temperatures were very large . \n the most interesting features of string theory are associated with its behavior at very high energies , near the planck scale . \n such high energies are unobtainable in present - day laboratories , and are unlikely to be reached for quite some time . \n they were , however , available during the very early history of the universe , so string theory can be probed by the predictions which it makes about that epoch . \n recent work has shown how the early universe might behave , if superstring theories are a correct description of nature @xcite . \n one of the robust predictions of this  string cosmology \" is that our present - day universe would contain a stochastic background of gravitational radiation @xcite , with a spectrum which is quite different than that predicted by many other early - universe cosmological models @xcite . in particular , the spectrum of gravitational waves predicted by string cosmology has rising amplitude with increasing frequency . \n this means that the radiation might have large enough amplitude to be observable by ground - based gravity - wave detectors , which operate at frequencies above @xmath0 . \n this also allows the spectrum to be consistent with observational bounds arising at @xmath1 from observations of the cosmic background radiation and at @xmath2 from observation of millisecond pulsar timing residuals .    in this short paper \n , we examine the spectrum of radiation produced by string cosmology , and determine the region of parameter space for which this radiation would be observable by the ( initial and advanced versions of the ) ligo detectors @xcite . \n in models of string cosmology @xcite , the universe passes through two early inflationary stages . the first of these \n is called the  dilaton - driven \" period and the second is the  string \" phase . \n each of these stages produces stochastic gravitational radiation ; the contribution of the dilaton - driven phase is currently better understood than that of the string phase .    in order to describe the background of gravitational radiation \n , it is conventional to use a spectral function @xmath3 which is determined by the energy density of the stochastic gravitational waves . \n this function of frequency is defined by [ e : defomegagw ] _ \n gw(f ) = 1 _ critical d _ \n gw d f. here @xmath4 is the ( present - day ) energy density in stochastic gravitational waves in the frequency range @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the critical energy - density required to just close the universe . \n this is given by [ e : crit ] _ \n critical = 3 c^2 h_0 ^ 2 8 g 1.6 10 ^ -8 h_100 ^ 2 ergs / cm^3 , where the hubble expansion rate @xmath7 is the rate at which our universe is currently expanding , [ e : hubble ] h_0 = h_100 100 = 3.2 10 ^ -18h_100 1 sec . \n because @xmath7 is not known exactly , it is defined in terms of a dimensionless parameter @xmath8 which is believed to lie in the range @xmath9 . \n the spectrum of gravitational radiation produced in the dilaton - driven and string phase was discussed in @xcite . in the simplest model , which we will use in this paper , \n it depends upon four parameters . \n the first pair of these are the frequency @xmath10 and the fractional energy density @xmath11 produced at the end of the dilaton - driven phase . \n the second pair of parameters are the maximal frequency @xmath12 above which gravitational radiation is not produced and the maximum fractional energy density @xmath13 , which occurs at that frequency . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ f : spec ] . \n an approximate form for the spectrum is @xcite [ e : approx ] _ \n gw(f)= where = is the logarithmic slope of the spectrum produced in the string phase . \n if we assume that there is no late entropy production and make reasonable choices for the number of effective degrees of freedom , then two of the four parameters may be determined in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath14 at the onset of radiation domination immediately following the string phase of expansion @xcite , f_1= 1.3 10 ^ 10 ( h_r 5 10 ^ 17 ) ^1/2 and _ gw^max = 1 10 ^ -7 h_100 ^ -2 ( h_r 5 10 ^ 17 ) ^2 . \n more complicated models and spectra were discussed in @xcite . \n the ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 are determined by the basic physical parameters of string cosmology models , the values of the hubble parameter and the string coupling parameter at the end of the dilaton - driven phase and the onset of the string phase @xcite . \n a number of authors @xcite have shown how one can use a network of two or more gravitational wave antennae to detect a stochastic background of gravitational radiation . \n the basic idea is to correlate the signals from separated detectors , and to search for a correlated strain produced by the gravitational - wave background , which is buried in the intrinsic instrumental noise . \n it has been shown by these authors that after correlating signals for time @xmath17 ( we take @xmath18 ) the ratio of  signal \" to  noise \" ( squared ) is given by an integral over frequency @xmath19 : [ e : sovern ] ( s n ) ^2 = 9 h_0 ^ 4 50 ^4 t _ 0^df .    in order to detect a stochastic background with @xmath20 confidence the ratio @xmath21 needs to be at least @xmath22 . in this equation , \n several different functions appear , which we now define . \n the instrument noise in the detectors is described by the one - sided noise power spectral densities @xmath23 . \n the ligo project is building two identical detectors , one in hanford washington and one in livingston louisiana , which we will refer to as the  initial \" detectors . \n after several years of operation , these detectors will be upgraded to so - called  advanced \" detectors . since the two detectors are identical in design , @xmath24 . \n the design goals for the detectors specify these functions @xcite . they are shown in fig .  [ \n f : noise ] . \n the next quantity which appears is the overlap reduction function @xmath25 . \n this function is determined by the relative locations and orientations of the arms of the two detectors , and is identical for both the initial and advanced ligo detectors . for the pair of ligo detectors ( f ) = -0.124842 j_0(x ) - 2.90014 + 3.00837 , where the @xmath26 are spherical bessel functions . \n the dimensionless frequency variable is @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the light - travel - time between the two ligo detector sites . \n this function is shown in fig . \n [ f : overlap ] \n .    equation ( [ e : sovern ] ) allows us to assess the detectability ( using initial or advanced ligo ) of any particular stochastic background @xmath3 . \n making use of the prediction from string cosmology , we may use equation ( [ e : sovern ] ) to assess the detectability of this stochastic background . for \n any given set of parameters we may numerically evaluate the signal to noise ratio @xmath29 ; if this value is greater than @xmath22 then with at least 90% confidence , the background can be detected by ligo . \n the regions of detectability in parameter space are shown in fig . \n [ f : init ] for the initial ligo detectors , and in fig . \n [ f : adva ] for the advanced ligo detectors . for these figures \n we have assumed @xmath30 and @xmath31 . \n the observable regions for different values of these parameters can be obtained by simple scaling of the presented results .    at the moment , \n the most restrictive observational constraint on the spectral parameters comes from the standard model of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( ns ) @xcite . \n this restricts the total energy density in gravitons to less than that of approximately one massless degree of freedom in thermal equilibrium . \n this bound implies that _ \n gw(f ) d f = _ \n gw^s < 0.7 10 ^ -5 h^-2_100 . [ nucleo ] where we have assumed an allowed @xmath32 at ns , and have substituted in the spectrum ( [ e : approx ] ) . \n this bound is shown on figs . \n [ f : init],[f : adva ] . \n we also show the weaker  dilaton only \" bound , assuming no stochastic background is produced during the ( more poorly - understood ) string phase of expansion : _ \n gw^s < 2.1 10 ^ -5 h^-2_100 \n . this is obtained by setting @xmath33 in the previous equation , i.e. assuming that @xmath34 vanishes for @xmath35 . \n we note that if the  dilaton + string \" spectrum is correct , then the ns bounds rule out any hopes of observation by initial ligo . on the other hand , in the  dilaton only \" case , a detectable background is not ruled out by ns bounds ; it would be observable if the spectral peak falls into the detection bandpass between 50 and 200 hz ( figure 7 of @xcite ) . \n because the function @xmath36 decays rapidly at high and low frequencies , the asymptotic behavior of the 90% confidence contours for the advanced ligo detector in the high and low @xmath37 regions can be estimated analytically as follows ( _ gw^s)_90%= 7.4 10 ^ -10 h_100 ^ -2 ( f_s/100 ) ^3 ,  f_s100 ( _ gw^s)_90%= 2.6 10 ^ -11  h_100 ^ \n -2  ( f_s/20 ) ^0.4 ,  f_s20 similar estimates may be obtained for the initial ligo detector . \n in this short paper , we have shown how data from the the initial and advanced versions of ligo will be able to constrain string cosmology models of the early universe . in principle , this might also constrain the fundamental parameters of superstring theory . \n the initial ligo is sensitive only to a narrow region of parameter space and is only marginally above the required sensitivity , while the advanced ligo detector has far better detection possibilities . \n the simultaneous operation of other types of gravitational wave detectors which operate at higher frequencies , such as bar and resonant designs , ought to provide additional increase in sensitivity and therefore further constrain the parameter space . \n -0.5 in g. veneziano , phys . lett . * \n b265 * ( 1991 ) 287 . m. gasperini and g. veneziano , astropart \n * 1 * ( 1993 ) 317 ; mod . \n a8 * ( 1993 ) 3701 . \n r. brustein , m. gasperini , m. giovannini and g. veneziano phys . \n b361 * ( 1995 ) 45 . m. gasperini and m. giovannini , phys . rev . \n * d47 * ( 1993 ) 1519 . \n grishchuk , sov . \n jetp * 40 * ( 1975 ) 409 . \n m. s. turner , _ detectability of inflation produced gravitational waves _ , preprint fermilab - pub-96 - 169-a ( astro - ph/9607066 ) . \n b. allen , _ the stochastic gravity - wave background : sources and detection _ , in proceedings of the les houches school on astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation , springer - verlag , 1996 . \n a. abramovici , et . \n al . , science * 256 * ( 1992 ) 325 . \n r. brustein , _ spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave background _ , preprint bgu - ph-96 - 08 ( hep - th/9604159 ) . \n r. brustein , m. gasperini and g. veneziano , _ peak and endpoint of the relic graviton background in string cosmology _ \n , preprint cern - th-96 - 37 ( hep - th/9604084 ) . \n m. gasperini , _ relic gravitons from the pre - big - bang : what we know and what we do not know _ , preprint cern - th-96 - 186 ( hep - th/9607146 ) . \n a. buonanno , m. maggiore and c. ungarelli , _ spectrum of relic gravitational waves in string cosmology _ , preprint ifup - th-25 - 96 ( gr - qc/9605072 ) . \n m. galluccio , m. litterio and f. occhionero , _ graviton spectra in string cosmology _ , rome preprint ( gr - qc/9608007 ) . \n g. veneziano , _ string cosmology and relic gravitational radiation _ , preprint cern - th-96 - 37 ( hep - th/9606119 ) . \n p. michelson , mon . not . \n . soc . * 227 * ( 1987 ) 933 . \n n. christensen , phys . \n * d46 * ( 1992 ) 5250 . \n e. flanagan , phys . rev . \n * d48 * ( 1993 ) 2389 . \n @xmath38 note that the second term on the right hand side of equation ( b6 ) should read @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 , and that the sliding delay function shown in figure 2 on page 2394 is incorrect . \n v. f. schwartzmann , jetp lett . \n * 9 * ( 1969 ) 184 ; t. walker et al . \n , ap . j. * 376 * ( 1991 ) 51 .", "StartTimeOffset": 632515608642, "RequestID": "af5ff2edac58b6004799f89d48d0941633d8a8b1", "TotalTokens": 3205}
{"ContextTokens": 3767, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "nuclear matter at high energy density has been extensively studied through high energy heavy - ion collisions.@xcite the primary goal of these studies is to observe the possible phase transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp),@xcite in which quarks and gluons are deconfined over an extended region . \n it is believed that the qgp state existed in the early universe shortly after the big bang , and may still exist in the cores of today s neutron stars.@xcite    if a qgp is created in a heavy - ion collision , the collision system will experience the states from deconfined quarks and gluons to interacting hadrons to , finally , freeze - out particles where the measurements are realized . in order to extract the information about the quark - gluon stage of heavy - ion collisions , systematic studies of multi - observables at freeze - out as a function of collision system size and bombarding energy are \n necessary.@xcite these observables include strangeness and antibaryon production . \n enhancement in strangeness production in high energy heavy - ion collisions over elementary nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions has been proposed as a signature of qgp formation.@xcite the idea is that , in the deconfined qgp , strange quark pairs ( @xmath0 ) can be copiously produced through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath1),@xcite while in the hadronic gas , @xmath0 pairs have to be produced via pairs of strange hadrons with higher production thresholds . \n moreover , the time scale of the gluon - gluon fusion process is short , on the order of 13  fm.@xcite on the other hand , it is argued that strangeness production rate in a chemically equilibrated hadronic gas might be as high as that in a qgp.@xcite however , the time needed for a hadronic gas system to reach chemical equilibrium is significantly longer  @xcite than the typical life time of a heavy - ion reaction of the order of 10  fm . \n in addition to the enhanced production of strangeness , production of strange and multistrange antibaryons should be further enhanced in qgp  @xcite under finite baryon density . \n the argument can be made in the simple fermi energy - level picture as the following . \n low energy levels of light quarks ( @xmath2 ) are already occupied by the excessive light quarks contributing to the finite baryon density . \n when the fermi energies of light quarks are higher than the bare mass of a @xmath3 pair , @xmath3 pair production is energetically more favorable than that of @xmath4 . \n hence , the production of nonstrange light antiquarks is suppressed , resulting in a high @xmath5 ratio in qgp . \n the definition of strangeness enhancement is broad . in this article , we use two types of definitions : ( 1 ) enhancement of strangeness production rate and antilambda to antiproton ( @xmath6 ) ratio in central heavy - ion collisions with respect to peripheral collisions , and/or to isospin weighted nn interactions at the same energy ; ( 2 ) enhancement in the ratio of strange antibaryons , @xmath7 ( high strangeness content ) with respect to @xmath8 ( low strangeness content ) .    the article is organized in the following way . in section  [ strangeness ] , we discuss strangeness enhancement at the ags and sps . in section  [ antibaryon ] , we discuss strange antibaryon enhancement . \n since strangeness and strange antibaryons are closely related , the discussions are necessarily coupled in these two sections . in section \n [ conclusion ] , we draw conclusions . \n at ags energy , the dominant carriers of strangeness produced in heavy - ion collisions are kaons ( charged and neutral ) and hyperons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 s ) . charged and neutral kaon yields are approximately equal under charge ( isospin ) symmetry . \n hyperons are mostly produced through associate production with kaons . \n therefore , charged kaon yields give a fairly good overall scale of strangeness production at the ags . \n kaon yields are systematically measured by ags e802/859/866 . \n fig.[fig1 ] shows , in data points , kaon yields per participant as a function of the number of participants ( @xmath11 ) in si+a and au+au collisions.@xcite @xmath11 is a good indication of collision centrality under the participant - spectator picture of high energy heavy - ion collisions . \n the data show that kaon production rate steadily increases with collision centrality in si+al and au+au collisions . for comparison , \n kaon yields per participant for isospin weighted nn interactions at the corresponding energies are shown in fig.[fig1 ] as the open circles and squares . \n the enhancement factor  the ratio of kaon yields per participant in heavy - ion collisions over the same energy nn interactions  is higher in au+au central collisions than si+a for both @xmath12 and @xmath13.@xcite    = 2.35 in = 2.35 in    the difference between si+a and au+au at the same number of participants ( say @xmath14 ) is qualitatively consistent with the different collision geometries under a binary collision model for kaon production , however , can not be quantitatively explained by glauber - type calculations of the average number of binary nn collisions.@xcite    from a classical glauber - type picture , in which each nucleon collides multiple times with others in a heavy - ion collision , with each collision having certain probability producing kaons , one would expect higher kaon production rate in heavy - ion collisions than nn . to check this expectation , fig.[fig1 ] shows , in the dashed curves , results of rqmd calculations for au+au collisions with meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions switched off . \n one observes slight increase in kaon production rate from peripheral to central collisions . \n however , in contrast to the expectation , the calculated kaon production rate in heavy - ion collisions is lower than the corresponding nn value . \n this is probably due to the net effect of the following : ( 1 ) not all the initial nucleons collide at least once at full energy ; ( 2 ) subsequent nn collisions have less than the full energy ; ( 3 ) ags energy is near kaon production threshold where kaon production rate changes rapidly with energy in elementary p+p interactions.@xcite    by including secondary meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions ( the default settings ) , rqmd is able to describe the qualitative features seen in the data . \n the results of the default calculations are shown in fig.[fig1 ] as solid curves . \n within the rqmd model , both baryon - baryon and meson - induced interactions increase kaon production rate . \n however , as seen from comparison between the dashed and solid curve ( for au+au ) in fig.[fig1 ] , the meson - induced interactions dominate for kaon production , especially in central collisions.@xcite since rqmd is a hadronic model , and it describes the general features of the data , it is fair to conclude that the observed kaon enhancement is consistent with hadronic physics . however , we note that subtle difference exists between the data and the default rqmd results .    as seen from fig.[fig1 ] , the centrality dependences of @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields are quite similar . \n the similarity is surprising because @xmath12 and @xmath13 are thought to be produced through different mechanisms : @xmath13 through pair production , and @xmath12 through both pair and associate production . \n kaon enhancement in heavy - ion collisions over nn is also observed at the sps.@xcite recent preliminary results from na49  @xcite show a similar centrality dependence of kaon yields as observed at the ags . \n data on production of the more exotic multistrange baryons and antibaryons are also available at the sps . \n wa97 results  @xcite show that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 midrapidity yields in the 30% most central pb+pb collisions are larger than those expected from p+pb by a wounded - nucleon scaling . \n the effect is the largest for @xmath16 , following the trend @xmath17 . \n more interestingly , the @xmath18 ratio is larger than @xmath19.@xcite na49 reported results on midrapidity @xmath20 production in the 5% most central pb+pb collisions,@xcite consistent with the wa97 results taken into account the different centralities . \n fig.[fig2 ] shows the @xmath19 and @xmath21 ratios from na49 ( 5% centrality )  @xcite , and the @xmath18 ratio from wa97 ( 30% centrality )  @xcite in pb+pb collisions . in the simple quark counting model , the particle ratios ( @xmath22 ) \n present the ratio of @xmath23 , and the antiparticle ratios ( @xmath24 ) present the ratio of @xmath5 . in fig.[fig2 ] , one observes a hierarchy in the ratios : @xmath25 , and that the antiparticle ratios are systematically larger than the particle ratios , indicating non - vanishing baryon density at midrapidity in pb+pb collisions . \n = 2.8 in    rqmd predictions for central pb+pb collisions ( impact parameter @xmath26  fm ) are shown in fig.[fig2 ] as the small points connected by the lines . \n rqmd agrees with the @xmath19 data , but overpredicts @xmath21 by a factor of 1.52 , while underpredicts @xmath18 by a factor of 2 . \n the discrepency in @xmath18 between the data and rqmd may due to an underestimate of the string fragmentation probability into @xmath16 in @xmath27 , used in rqmd.@xcite an even larger discrepency is seen between data and urqmd model prediction.@xcite presumably , the better agreement between data and rqmd than urqmd is due to the novel `` rope '' mechanism,@xcite implemented in rqmd but not in urqmd \n . however , the `` rope '' mechanism is clearly beyond the scope of hadronic physics . \n as discussed in the introduction , enhancement in strange antibaryon production is a possible signature for qgp formation . \n preliminary results from ags e859 indicate a large @xmath6 ratio in si+au central collisions near midrapidity.@xcite direct measurement of @xmath28 production in au+au collisions at the ags was not available until recently.@xcite however , the @xmath6 ratio can be inferred from @xmath29 measurements in the midrapidity region by e864  @xcite and e878  @xcite at @xmath30 with different acceptances for @xmath29 from weak decays ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , provided that the experimental acceptances and systematics are well understood . \n the obtained @xmath33 ratio increases strongely with collision centrality , with a most probable value of 3.5 in the 10% most central collisions.@xcite    assuming @xmath34 yield of each sign is 1/3 of @xmath28 yield under isospin consideration , and @xmath34 , which may yield a deviation from 1/3 in a thermal model argument . \n however , the assumption of 1/3 is fairly consistent with and venus model calculations . ] \n the @xmath6 ratio can be deduced . further using the e866 measurements of @xmath29 s which include 60% weak decay @xmath29s,@xcite the yields of @xmath29 and @xmath28 can be obtained , \n the results of which are shown in fig.[fig3 ] against collision centrality . \n the recent direct measurements of @xmath29 and @xmath28 yields by e917  @xcite are plotted as filled points . \n they agree with the obtained systematics , although suffering from large statistical errors . \n = 2.8 in    as seen from fig.[fig3 ] , @xmath29 yield increases from peripheral to medium central collisions , and saturates ( or even slightly decreases ) in central collisions . \n this is consistent with the picture that more @xmath29 s are absorbed in the nuclear medium in central collisions with higher baryon density and/or larger collision zone . \n however , the continuous increase of the @xmath28 yield is surprising . in the additive quark model , \n @xmath35 annihilation cross section is 2/3 of @xmath36 s , therefore , a strong absorption of @xmath28 should also occur . \n because of the lack of @xmath35 annihilation cross - section data at the relavent low energy ( @xmath37  gev ) , hadronic models have to make assumptions for the cross - seciton to calculate @xmath6 . \n cascade calculations by wang _ et al._,@xcite using various parameterizations for the @xmath35 annihilation cross - section , fail to describe the observed @xmath6 in central collisions , while giving reasonable agreement to the peripheral collision data \n .    it would be interesting to compare the centrality dependences of @xmath28 and @xmath9 yields . \n since the @xmath9 yield centrality dependence at the ags is presently not available , we use the difference in @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields to reflect the @xmath9 yield , exploiting the constrain of overall strangeness neutrality , and further assuming @xmath38 and @xmath39 under isospin consideration . \n the results are shown in fig.[fig3 ] as the dashed curve . \n it is interesting to note that the centrality depedences of the @xmath9 and @xmath28 yields are very similiar , a feature also observed for @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields . \n = 2.6 in    from the centrality dependence of @xmath6 , it is hard to disentangle the two different effects , qgp formation and strong medium absorption , both giving an increasing @xmath6 with centrality . \n it is therefore attempting to examine the ratio as a function of collision energy , which is shown in fig.[fig4 ] . \n the two effects would give different dependences : at high energy , qgp formation would result in a high ratio , while strong absorption would result in a low ratio because the baryon density is lower at high energy.@xcite therefore , an increase of @xmath6 with collision energy would indicate qgp formation or other new physics . from the current data shown in fig.[fig4 ] , we can not draw conclusions . \n data at other energies are therefore highly desirable . \n the @xmath7 and @xmath8 ratios discussed in section  [ strangeness ] are significantly lower than @xmath6 shown in fig.[fig4 ] for pb+pb central collisions . \n this points to the speculation that medium absorption of strange antibaryons may be very different from that of antiprotons . \n again , measurements of low energy @xmath35 annihilation cross - sections are indispensable . \n we reviewed the ags and sps data on strangeness and antibaryon production . \n we draw the following conclusions :    * enhancement in charged kaon production is observed in central heavy - ion collisions at the ags with respect to peripheral collisions and isospin weighted nucleon - nucleon interactions . \n the enhancement can be qualitatively explained by secondary particle scattering within the rqmd model . \n however , subtle difference exists between the data and rqmd . * a hierarchy of particle ratios , @xmath25 , is observed at midrapidity in pb+pb central collisions at the sps . \n the antiparticle ratios are systematically larger than the particle ratios . rqmd with string and rope formation and fragmentation , which is clearly beyond hadronic physics \n , may barely describe the data . * \n large @xmath6 ratios are observed in central heavy - ion collisions at the ags and sps . \n strong increase of the ratio from peripheral to central collisions is indirectly observed at the ags . \n hadronic cascade calculations , with certain assumptions for the @xmath35 annihilation cross - section , fail to describe the ratio in central collisions . * to fully understand the @xmath6 ratio in heavy - ion collisions , measurements of low energy @xmath35 annihilation cross - sections are needed . on the other hand , an excitation function measurement of @xmath6 may provide a new avenue in the search for qgp . \n i am especially grateful to professor r.k . \n seto for inviting me to review the experimental results . \n i would like to thank drs . \n a.m.  poskanzer , h.g . \n ritter , n.  xu , and other members of the lbnl / rnc group for fruitful discussions . \n this work was supported by the u.s . \n department of energy under contract de -

{"ContextTokens": 2361, "GeneratedTokens": 213, "SynthesizedBody": "on april 18 , 2001 at 07:55:11.509 ut the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm , 40 - 700 kev ) onboard bepposax was triggered by a large flare . \n the event was also observed by the unit 1 of the bepposax wide field cameras ( wfcs , 2 - 28 kev ) , that was automatically shut - down few seconds after the start of the event by an onboard safeguard algorithm . \n the wfc localized this giant flare as originating from the soft gamma - ray repeater sgr 1900 + 14 .    the bepposax grbm unit 1 , \n co - aligned to wfc unit 1 , detected a peak flux of 16,400 counts / s ( 40 - 700 kev , after deadtime correction ) , corresponding to ( 1.1@xmath00.1)@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 . \n the event lasted approximately 40  s , and the total fluence was about 240,000 counts . \n a 5-s periodic modulation of the light curve is consistent with the 5.17-s period of the persistent x - ray source . in the light curve of the flare \n we can identify the repetition of 5 or 6 cycles , and a last pulse that is out of phase with respect to the previous ones . assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral shape , from our 2-channel , 1-s resolved spectrum \n , we can derive a plasma temperature kt of @xmath430  kev . \n there is no evidence for a hard spike at the start of the event , and the spectral evolution during the event is relatively smooth , with a general hardening trend . \n the konus - wind instrument detected this event in the non - trigger mode because of very high background level after strong solar flare ( 30 times more than normal ) . \n our estimation for energy more than 15 kev is : fluence - 2@xmath510@xmath6 erg @xmath2 and peak flux - 2.5@xmath510@xmath7 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 . in spite of rough time resolution in the background mode \n the konus - wind data has evidences of the 5-s pulsations . \n three weak and short bursts are detected at times 2537 , 755 and 444 seconds _ before _ the giant flare in the wfc unit 1 . \n their durations are 100 , 125 and 55 ms , and their peak fluxes exceed 20 crab units in 2 - 28 kev ( feroci et al . 2001b ) . \n no gamma - ray counterpart was found for these events in the grbm , nor in _ ulysses _ or konus / wind . \n this is the first reported bursting activity from sgr 1900 + 14 since approximately two years .    at the time of the giant flare , as detected by the grbm , \n the wfc1 detected a large increase in the count rate for approximately 3 seconds after the grbm trigger . at this time \n the count rate was so high ( larger than 30,000 counts / s ) that it triggered the automatic turn off of the experiment . \n the april 18 2001 activity of sgr 1900 + 14 allowed us to activate our target of opportunity observation program with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfi , 0.1 - 300 kev ) . \n thanks to the remarkable effort by the mission scientist team , the mission planners team and our team , the first follow - up observation was started on april 18 at 15:10 ut , less than 8 hours after the event . \n this first observation ( feroci et al . \n 2001c ) was 28 hours long , for a net exposure time in the mecs instrument of 60 ks . \n a second pointing was carried out on april 29 at 20:20 ut , for a similar exposure time . \n the persistent x - ray counterpart of sgr 1900 + 14 was detected in both observations . \n the source emitted a large number of short x - ray bursts during the first observation , whereas in the second pointing only one burst was detected . \n the average spectrum during the first pointing , after removal of the bursts , can be fit with a power law with photon index 2.6@xmath00.1 and n@xmath8=(4.3@xmath00.3)@xmath9 @xmath2 . \n the persistent 2 - 10 kev flux showed a rapid decaying behaviour during our first pointing , going approximately from 3.5 to 2@xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( unabsorbed ) . using the x - ray flux in the same band provided by the chandra observation carried out on april 22 ( kouveliotou et al . \n 2001 ) , we obtain that the time behaviour of the x - ray flux can be described by a power law , with index @xmath4 - 0.6 . \n interestingly , studying the hardness ratio between the 1.6 - 4 kev and the 4 - 10 kev energy ranges , we find a clear correlation flux vs. hardness , indicating that the spectrum softens when the persistent flux decreases .    during our second observation the source appeared to have gone back to its quiescent status . \n removing the single burst that we observed , the 0.1 - 10 kev energy spectrum is best fit by the sum of an absorbed power law plus a blackbody with temperature @xmath40.5 kev . \n the 2 - 10 kev flux is consistent with the ` standard ' quiescent status , at @xmath41.1@xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( unabsorbed ) . in figure 1 \n we show the plot of the x - ray flux vs. time , including also the chandra point , that suggests that the source returned to its quiescent status in less than 3 days after the burst . \n we performed a period search in both nfi observations and found the expected 5.17-s periodicity in the 2 - 10 kev flux from the persistent source . in the first observation \n the best period was 5.17277 s , with a smooth sinusoidal profile . in the second pointing the period increased to 5.17298 s , without significant differences in the pulse profile . \n therefore , the period derivative between the two bepposax observation is about 2.3@xmath11 s s@xmath3 . \n the bepposax instrumentation observed the most interesting phases of the 2001 activation of sgr 1900 + 14 with a very complete set of observations . \n the grbm and wfc caught the second giant flare in the ( observed ) history of this source and its precursor x - ray activity . \n the nfi observed the afterglow of the persistent source after the flare , the bursting activity and its quenching , and the period history soon after the giant flare . \n the giant flare is rather unusual with respect to its two predecessors , the march 5 1979 event from sgr 0526 - 66 and the august 27 1998 flare from sgr 1900 + 14 ( e.g. , mazets et al . 1979 , hurley et al . 1999 , feroci et al . \n the most important differences in the april 18 are in the following aspects :    * the peak flux and fluence are more than one order of magnitude smaller * the duration is almost one order of magnitude shorter * there is no evidence for the first short and very hard pulse at the beginning of the event , implying that , contrary to the other two events , most likely there was no relativistic particle emission during this event . \n the nfi observation is the fastest pointing after a giant flare and provides a _ direct _ observation of a long - duration afterglow emission from an sgr after a giant flare . \n our result of an afterglow showing a power law decay , with index -0.6 , is similar to that obtained by woods et al . \n ( 2001 ) , who measured a decay index of -0.713@xmath00.025 after the august 27 event , based on the assumed constancy of the pulsed fraction . \n interestingly , ibrahim et al . \n ( 2001 ) found a similar decay law in the pulsating soft tail of the august 29 short burst . \n the spectral variability of the x - ray afterglow is also interesting . during our first observation , at high flux level , \n the source spectrum showed a softening , and an overall power law shape . in our second observation , at a flux typical of the quiescent state , we clearly detect the emergence of a kt=0.5 kev blackbody component , and an n@xmath8 smaller by about a factor of 2 . based on our observations , together with our analysis of the previous bepposax observations \n ( see also woods et al . 1999 , 2001 ) of this source in quiescence ( may 1997 and march / april 2000 ) and after the august 27 giant flare ( september 1998 ) , we can state that the blackbody component for this source is peculiar of its quiescent state . \n we warmly thank l. piro , g. gandolfi , l. salotti , m. capalbi , l. amati , the bepposax mission planners , the bepposax soc , occ and sdc for their personal efforts that allowed a fast repointing of the source after the flare , as well as a prompt analysis of the grbm , wfc and nfi data . \n feroci , m. , hurley , k. , duncan , r.c . , & thompson , c. , 2001a , , 549 , 1021 feroci , m. , mereghetti , s. , gandolfi , g. , piro , l. , & costa , e. 2001b , gcn circular 1055 feroci , m. , in t zand , j.j.m . , \n soffitta , p. , hurley , k. , frontera , f. , & mazets , e. 2001c , gcn circular 1060 guidorzi , c. , et al . \n 2001 , iau circular 7611 hurley , k. , et al . \n 1999 , , 397 , 41 ibrahim , a.i . , \n 2001 , , 558 , 237 kouveliotou , c. , et al . \n 2001 , gcn circular 1046 mazets , e. , et al . , 1979 , , 282 , 587 woods , p. , et al . 1999 , , 518 , l103 woods , p. , et al . 2001 , , 552 , 748", "StartTimeOffset": 654576068280, "RequestID": "ad08edc14722fadb2689eb9738b94729dc3d2094", "TotalTokens": 2574}
{"ContextTokens": 2526, "GeneratedTokens": 276, "SynthesizedBody": "surface diffusion is a very important process in many phenomena , in particular in crystal growth . \n that is why the diffusion of single adatoms on stepped metal surfaces has been recently widely investigated both experimentally and theoretically . \n energy barriers for the moves of an adatom on a surface with steps or islands are not easily accessible by experiment but for many elementary processes they can be calculated on microscopical level by molecular dynamics . \n the knowledge of the barriers can then be utilized in the construction of kinetic monte carlo models to study growth processes . \n the diffusion energy barriers have already been calculated for various metals and different surface orientations . \n for example , in the case of fcc ( 111 ) surface there are calculations for al @xcite , ag @xcite , au @xcite , cu @xcite , ni @xcite , pt @xcite , ir @xcite . in most of these studies \n the semi - empirical potentials were used due to their simplicity allowing a systematic study of numerous possible processes . \n comparable ab initio calculations demand much more computer power , therefore the number of investigated processes must considerably be reduced . \n although the recent first principles calculations @xcite indicates that in the case of pt(111 ) the semi - empirical potentials may be insufficient , in many other studies they lead to reasonable results and their application helped at least qualitative understand diffusion energetics and reveal new processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n in this paper we study diffusion on stepped rh(111 ) surface . \n the research was motivated by a recent stm experiment on unstable growth of rh(111 ) @xcite where a coarsening due to a step - edge barrier was observed over three orders of magnitude of deposited amount . \n more recent observation on pt(111 ) @xcite indicates almost no coarsening over the similar interval of deposited material . whereas the step - edge barriers on pt(111 ) surfaces were extensively studied ( see references in @xcite ) , results for rh(111 ) are not available . \n we present here a systematic study of energy barriers for inter - layer transport as well as for diffusion along the step edges . \n our simulations were done for finite atomic slabs with a free surface on the top , two atomic layers fixed on the bottom , and periodic boundary conditions in the two directions parallel to the surface . \n the slab representing the substrate of ( 111 ) surface was 11 layers thick with 448 atoms per layer . \n we used systems of approximately 5000 atoms consisting of 19 to 44 layers , with 110 to 240 atoms per layer for diffusion along channels on the vicinal surfaces ( 311 ) , ( 211 ) , ( 331 ) , ( 221 ) and ( 322 ) . \n the semi - empirical many - body rosato  guillope \n legrand ( rgl ) potential @xcite including interactions up to the fifth nearest neighbors @xcite was used . for computational details \n see @xcite . \n the energy barrier for a particular diffusion process was obtained by testing systematically various possible paths of an adatom . \n the path with the lowest diffusion barrier was chosen to be the optimum one , and the diffusion barrier , @xmath0 , was calculated as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the total energies of the system with the adatom at the saddle point and at the equilibrium adsorption site , respectively . \n we considered both the jump and exchange processes . \n the minimum energy path for jump diffusion was determined by moving an adatom in small steps between two equilibrium positions and by allowing the adatom to relax in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting two equilibrium positions . \n the rest of the atoms in the system were allowed to relax in all directions . \n the energy barrier for exchange process was determined by moving the edge atom , that should be replaced , in small steps toward its final position . \n this final position was one of neighboring equilibrium sites . \n the moving atom was allowed to relax in the plane perpendicular to the exchange direction at each step , whereas the other atoms , including the adatom , relaxed free in all directions . \n in our simulation we obtained the energy barrier @xmath4 ev for self - diffusion on the flat rh(111 ) surface , which is in good agreement with experiments . in the field - ion - microscope ( fim ) experiment @xcite the barrier @xmath5 ev was found and recently the value @xmath6 ev was obtained in the stm experiment @xcite from the temperature dependence of island density . \n the results of molecular statics calculations and experimental values are summarized in table 1 . \n we calculated also binding energy for the supported dimer . \n the value @xmath7  ev is in good agreement with @xmath8  ev obtained in the stm experiment @xcite . \n we studied the descent of an adatom to the lower terrace from both types of steps on the ( 111 ) surface , i.e. , step a with \\{100 } microfacet and step b with \\{111 } microfacet ( see fig . \n we performed calculations for several geometries : straight steps , steps with a kink , and also for a small island atoms . \n for all considered geometries we systematically investigated all possible adatom jumps and pair exchange processes . \n our results for straight steps and steps with a kink are summarized in table 2 . \n the energy barrier for a direct jump from the upper to the lower terrace is 0.73 ev for straight step a and 0.74 ev for straight step b. the presence of a kink decreases the barrier for the jump to @xmath9 ev on both steps . \n we can see that the energy barriers for the jumps are always larger than for the exchange which are and 0.39 ev for a and b step , respectively .    in more complex geometries the number of competing processes to be energetically compared increases , e.g. in the case of step b with a kink we consider four types of processes according to which step - edge - atom ( denoted by r1 , r2 , r3 , or r4 ) is pushed out ( see fig . \n we call them exchange next to corner , exchange over kink i , exchange over kink ii , and exchange next to kink , respectively . \n we consider all possible combinations of initial and final positions . \n for example , in the case of the exchange next to the corner there are three possible processes : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . in the process \n @xmath12 , e.g. , the adatom starts in the fcc site labeled by 3 and pushes out the edge atom r1 . \n two possible directions of moving for pushed atom r1 are shown schematically in fig . \n the lowest barrier for the inter - layer transport is the barrier for two exchange processes near the kink on the step b ( @xmath13 ev ) , i.e. the ehrlich - schwoebel barrier is only @xmath14 mev . \n the barriers for exchange processes on the step a are significantly higher . for a island , \n the minimal values were obtained for the exchange of the atom in the middle of the edge ( 0.43 ev for a - type edge and 0.24 ev for b - type edge ) . \n we found that for rh(111 ) similar as for pt(111 ) @xcite the barriers for the descent at a small island are significantly lower than for the descent at straight long steps . \n 3 shows the energy profile for the diffusion along two edges of a large island . \n the structure in the middle corresponds to a diffusion around the corner formed by two edges . \n the angle contained by the edges is 120@xmath15 . \n there is a small minimum just at the corner positions . \n the transport between two edges is asymmetric . \n we found that the diffusion along the straight step of type a is faster ( the barrier is 0.40 ev ) than along the step of type b ( the barrier is 0.81 ev ) . \n this could be attributed to a purely geometrical effect due to different local geometries along the steps . \n the adatom diffusing along the step b has to pass closer to the topmost atoms of the lower terrace than when it is diffusing along the step a ( see fig.1 ) . \n there are no available experimental data for diffusion along the steps on rh(111 ) surface . \n only one measurement on the ( 311 ) and ( 331 ) surface has been published @xcite . in order to have some comparison , we calculated the energy barriers for the diffusion along steps on vicinal surfaces with terraces : ( 211 ) , ( 311 ) - terraces with step edges of type a , and ( 332 ) , ( 221 ) and ( 331 ) - step edges of type b. results are summarized in table 3 . \n the vicinal surfaces are ordered according to the distance between terraces . \n we can see that there is a clear tendency with the decreasing distance between steps . in the case of a - step \n the barrier along the step is increasing with the step distance increasing , whereas for b - step it is decreasing . \n we obtained the barriers @xmath16  ev and @xmath17 ev for the diffusion along steps ( 311 ) and ( 331 ) surfaces , respectively . \n experimental results of fim measurements are the energy barriers @xmath18 ev and @xmath19 ev @xcite . \n there is qualitative agreement between experimental and calculated data : @xmath20 . \n using the rgl potential we calculated the energy barrier for self - diffusion on the flat rh(111 ) surface and binding energy of supported dimer which are in good agreement with the experimental data . with the same potential , we systematically studied energy barriers for the descent at straight as well as rough steps on rh(111 ) . \n we found that the lowest energy barriers for descent to the lower terrace is for the exchange process near a kink on step b. we also calculated barriers for the diffusion along step edges on rh(111 ) surface and along step edges on several vicinal surfaces . \n we found that the diffusion along step a is faster than along step b , which is in qualitative agreement with the fim experiment . \n we observed that these barriers are slightly affected by the step - step interaction . \n we expect that due to rather large barriers for the diffusion along steps , both steps will be rough during the growth at lower temperatures and the interlayer transport will prefer step b. at a higher temperature the diffusion along step a starts to be active and the descent on both steps will be possible . however , step b will remain rough and the descent on this step will be easier . in island growth \n this would imply that b - edges of an island will grow faster than a - edges , therefore , b - edges will become shorter . \n however , the number of kinks for the easy descent on a shorter b - edge will be lower . \n hence we expect that for a certain interval of temperatures the shape of the growing island will be asymmetric with longer a steps . \n this picture seems to be in agreement with the morphologies presented in @xcite . \n + * figure captions * +   + fig \n . 1 . two types of step edges , a and b , for a large island . \n solid line shows the diffusion path along the island edge . \n the atoms of different layers from the surface to the bulk are shown as large filled circles , large open circles , small open circles , and tiny open circles . \n [ fig : along ] +   + fig . \n 2 : different exchange processes near a kink site on step b on rh(111 ) surface . the edge atoms undergoing exchange diffusion ( r1, ... ,r4 ) and starting positions of an adatom ( 1, ... ,9 ) are shown . \n the four topmost atomic layers from the surface to the bulk are distinguished by different circle radii ( cf . \n +   + fig . \n 3 : dependence of the adatom energy for the path along the edge of a large island . \n the path is composed from three sections : along edge a , around the corner and along edge b. +", "StartTimeOffset": 658661420154, "RequestID": "e855eb3693f30e779804ea7c50d52745725cf144", "TotalTokens": 2802}
{"ContextTokens": 2979, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) is a common feature of all promising candidates of quantum gravity . \n string theory , loop quantum gravity , black hole physics , and noncommutative geometry ( based on a deeper insight to the nature of quantum spacetime at planck scale ) all support the need for a necessary modification of the standard heisenberg principle . \n it has been shown that measurements in quantum gravity are governed by the generalized uncertainty principle @xcite . \n there are some evidences from string theory and black holes physics ( based on some gedanken experiments ) , that lead authors to re - examine the usual uncertainty principle of heisenberg @xcite . \n these evidences have origin on the quantum fluctuation of the background spacetime metric and are related to the very nature of spacetime in quantum gravity era . the introduction of this idea has drown attention and many authors considered various problems in the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle ( see for instance @xcite ) . \n these investigations have revealed some new features of the very nature of spacetime : spacetime is not commutative at planck scale and it has a foam - like structure in this scale , it seems that gravity is not a fundamental interaction of the nature ( it may be induced by the residual effects of fundamental quantum fields on the vacuum , with the lagrangian playing the role of an elastic stress ) , constants of the nature are not really constant and the very notion of locality in position space representation breaks down in planck scale . \n therefore , it seems that a reformulation of quantum theory is required in order to incorporate gravitational effects in planck scale phenomena . \n these issues have been the topics of a wide range of researches in recent years .    in this paper , we consider the problem of a particle of mass @xmath0 that is bouncing vertically and elastically on a smooth reflecting floor in earth s gravitational field . \n we solve this problem in the presence of a minimal length within the gup framework . \n first , we give an overview to the gup formalism and in this way we obtain a generalized schrdinger equation . after studying this equation in the momentum space , we find the modified eigenstates and energy spectrum of this system . \n we compare the outcomes of our study with the results obtained from elementary quantum mechanics . \n a potential application of the present study in the spontaneous decay of an excited state for ultra cold neutrons bouncing above a perfect mirror in the earth s gravitational field is discussed finally . \n we note that modification to the decay rate due to existence of a minimal length studied here , becomes important at or above the planck energy . \n although this modification is too small to be measurable at present , we speculate on the possibility of extracting measurable predictions in the future . \n quantum mechanics with modification of the usual canonical commutation relations has been investigated intensively in the last few years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . such works which are motivated by several independent streamlines of investigations in string theory and quantum gravity , suggest the existence of a finite lower bound to the possible resolution @xmath1 of spacetime points . \n the following deformed commutation relation has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite @xmath2=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2),\\ ] ] and it was shown that it implies the existence of a minimal resolution length @xmath3 @xcite . \n this means that there is no possibility to measure coordinate @xmath4 with accuracy smaller than @xmath5 . \n since in the context of the string theory the minimum observable distance is the string length , we conclude that @xmath6 is proportional to this length . if we set @xmath7 , the usual heisenberg algebra is recovered . \n the use of the deformed commutation relation ( [ com ] ) brings new difficulties in solving the quantum problems . \n a part of difficulties is related to the break down of the notion of locality and position space representation in this framework @xcite . \n the above commutation relation results in the following uncertainty relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive quantities which depend on the expectation value of the position and the momentum operators . \n in fact , we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the planck mass and @xmath13 is of the order of unity . \n we expect that these quantities are only relevant in the domain of the planck energy @xmath14 . \n therefore , in the low energy regime , the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are irrelevant and we recover the well - known heisenberg uncertainty principle . these parameters , in principle , can be obtained from the underlying quantum gravity theory such as string theory . \n note that @xmath4 and @xmath15 are symmetric operators on the dense domain @xmath16 with respect to the following scalar product @xcite @xmath17 moreover , the comparison between eqs . \n ( [ com ] ) and ( [ gup ] ) shows that @xmath18 . \n now , let us define @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 obey the canonical commutation relations @xmath22=i\\hbar$ ] . \n one can check that using eq . \n ( [ x0p0 ] ) , eq . \n ( [ com ] ) is satisfied to @xmath23 . \n also , from the above equation we can interpret @xmath21 as the momentum operator at low energies ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath15 as the momentum operator at high energies . \n now , consider the following form of the hamiltonian : @xmath25 which using eq . \n ( [ x0p0 ] ) can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in the quantum domain , \n this hamiltonian results in the following generalized schrdinger equation in the quasi - position representation @xmath29 where the second term is due to the generalized commutation relation ( [ com ] ) . \n this equation is a @xmath30th - order differential equation which in principle admits @xmath30 independent solutions . \n therefore , solving this equation in @xmath20 space and separating the physical solutions is not an easy task . in the next section , \n for the case of a bouncing particle , we find the energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenstates up to the first order of the gup parameter . \n consider a particle of mass @xmath0 which is bouncing vertically and elastically on a reflecting hard floor so that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the acceleration in the earth s gravitational field . \n the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath33 which results in the following generalized schrdinger equation @xmath34 this equation , for @xmath7 is exactly solvable and the solutions can be written in the form of the airy functions . \n moreover , the energy eigenvalues are related to the zeros of the airy function . however \n , for @xmath35 , the situation is quite different . because , we need to solve a forth order differential equation and eliminate the unphysical solutions . on the other hand , because of the linear form of the potential , this equation can be cast into a first order differential equation in the momentum space . \n since the later form is much easier to handle , we define a new variable @xmath36 and rewrite above equation in the momentum space , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath39 and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath21 . \n it is straight forward to check that this equation admits the following solution @xmath40.\\ ] ] since @xmath9 is a small quantity , we can expand the above solution up to the first order of @xmath9 as @xmath41 now , using the fourier transform , we can find the solution in the position space up to a normalization factor @xmath42+\\frac{4}{15}\\beta m^2g\\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left\\{4\\mbox{ai}\\left[\\alpha\\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\right]+ \\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left.\\mbox{ai}'\\left[\\alpha\\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath20 . finally , \n since the potential is infinite for @xmath44 , we demand that the wave function should vanish at @xmath45 . \n this condition results in the quantization of the particle s energy , namely @xmath46=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to proceed further and for the sake of simplicity , let us work in the units of @xmath47 . in this set of units , \n the energy eigenvalues are the minus of the roots of the following algebraic equation @xmath48=0.\\ ] ] so , the energy eigenvalues will be quantized and result in the following eigenfunctions @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50s should satisfy eq . \n ( [ root ] ) . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows the resulting normalized ground state and first excited state eigenfunctions for @xmath51 . \n moreover , the calculated values of the energy eigenvalues for the first ten states are also shown in table [ tab1 ] . \n these results show that the presence of @xmath9 increases the energy levels in agreement with the functional form of @xmath52 . \n in other words , existence of a minimal length results in a positive shift in the energy levels of quantum bouncer . \n as a potential application of our analysis , we note that quantization of the energy of _ ultra cold neutrons _ bouncing above a mirror in the earth s gravitational field has been demonstrated in an experiment few years ago @xcite . \n this effect demonstrates quantum behavior of the gravitational field if we consider the spontaneous decay of an excited state in this experiment as a manifestation of the planck - scale effect @xcite . \n since the spectrum of a quantum bouncer changes in the presence of the minimal length , we expect the rate of this decay will change as a trace of quantum gravitational effects via existence of a minimal length scale . \n in fact , as we have shown , the energy levels of a quantum bouncer in the gup framework attain a positive shift as given by equation ( [ zero ] ) . \n the energy levels of a quantum bouncer in ordinary quantum mechanics are given by zeros of airy function as @xmath53 . \n in the presence of a minimal length , the locations of zeros are given by @xmath54 . within a semi - classical analysis \n , we evaluate the rate for a bouncer to make a transition @xmath55 . \n the quantum quadrupole moment for the transition @xmath55 for a quantum bouncer of mass @xmath0 is given by @xmath56 @xcite . \n the quantum mechanical transition rate is ( in the quadrupole approximation ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 . \n now , the quadrupole matrix element for quantum bouncer in the presence of minimal length can be calculated using the generalized airy function zeros given by equation ( [ zero ] ) . \n the transition probability in our framework is therefore @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . \n so , there will be an essentially measurable difference in the transition rate of a quantum bouncer due to the presence of the extra @xmath63 in comparison with the case that we consider just the ordinary heisenberg uncertainty relation .    ) for @xmath7 ( red ) , @xmath64 ( green ) , and @xmath65 ( blue).,width=302 ]    .the first ten quantized energies of a bouncing particle in gup formalism .

it would be either the fundamental mode or the first overtone , immediately constraining the mean stellar density . \n the enormous asteroseismic promise of motivated us to perform a high - precision photometric and radial velocity study of its pulsations , in the hope to detect a sufficient number of p and g modes to sound its interior structure . \n was observed with the most satellite @xcite from sep 16 to oct 16 , 2008 . due to the brightness of the target , fabry imaging mode was used , and the data reduction method developed by @xcite to minimize the effects of stray light was employed . \n there were over 55000 data points at a cadence of 30  s in the original data set . \n these were summed into 4018 0.005-d bins having an rms scatter of 1  mmag per point and an effective nyquist frequency of @xmath692 . \n a simultaneous ground - based spectroscopic multisite campaign was organized for pulsational mode identification . \n the majority of the data originated from the automatic spectroscopic telescope of tennessee state university ( tsu - ast , * ? ? ? \n * ) , and consisted of 1660 spectra ( 49007100  ) taken over a span of ten weeks ( sep 3 - nov 15 , 2008 ) with an effective nyquist frequency of @xmath668 . \n we have reduced these spectra and extracted radial velocities from 34 lines with the techniques described by @xcite . \n the external error of these radial velocities is about 0.2 . \n this high precision results from @xmath1  peg having a very sharp lined spectrum for a hot star ; @xcite listed @xmath7 ! concerning the star s metallicity , @xcite derived @xmath8 from optical and @xcite determined @xmath9=-0.04\\pm0.08 $ ] from ultraviolet spectra . \n additional spectroscopy was carried out at three observatories , and ground - based time - resolved multicolor photometry was acquired at three more sites \n . however , the present paper only reports the initial results from the most space photometry and tsu - ast radial velocities . \n the heliocentrically corrected data were searched for periodicities using the program period04 @xcite . \n amplitude spectra were computed , compared with the spectral window functions , and the frequencies of the intrinsic and statistically significant peaks in the fourier spectra were determined . \n multifrequency fits with all detected signals were calculated step by step , the corresponding frequencies , amplitudes and phases were optimized and subtracted from the data before computing residual amplitude spectra , which were then examined in the same way . \n this analysis was performed for the most and radial velocity data independently . \n we conservatively only accepted signals that exceeded an amplitude signal - to - noise ratio of five in at least one of the data sets and that were prominent in the other . \n some steps of this procedure are shown in fig . \n fourteen independent signals were detected ; the agreement between the photometric and radial velocity measurements is remarkable . the residual amplitude spectrum after this solution was featureless for the radial velocities . some peaks in the residual most data remained , but to err on the side of caution we did not consider them to be intrinsic to @xmath1  peg . \n the frequencies of all these signals are consistent within the errors between the two data sets . \n we have determined weighted mean values of those frequencies by computing the formal uncertainties @xcite in the individual data sets and then applying their inverse squared as the weight . with the resulting frequencies fixed , we have re - calculated the amplitudes , phases and amplitude signal - to - noise ratios and list the results in table  [ tbl-1 ] . \n all but the two closest frequencies are resolved within our data set . \n their difference @xmath10  is 82% of the time resolution of the radial velocity data . \n since a significant peak remains after prewhitening @xmath11 we accept @xmath12 , but caution that the parameters of these two variations in table  [ tbl-1 ] may have systematic errors . \n we start by examining previous claims that @xmath1  peg is a spectroscopic binary . \n our radial velocities were acquired in a period of time where the orbital solution by @xcite predicts a change in radial velocity of about 20 . \n our nightly mean radial velocities are constant within @xmath13 . \n @xcite claimed an orbit with a 6.816d period and about 0.8radial velocity amplitude . \n again , this is inconsistent with our data . \n instead , the 1alias of this `` orbital '' period lies well within the domain of the g - mode frequencies ( @xmath14d=0.8533 ) ; the strongest g - mode pulsations have radial velocity amplitudes of 0.7 . \n we conclude that @xmath1  peg is not a 6.8-d spectroscopic binary . \n the cause of the sporadic radial velocity changes remains to be understood . \n the possibility of be - star outbursts @xcite seems remote given that @xmath1  peg likely rotates intrinsically slowly , unlike the be stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    according to the position of @xmath1  peg in the hr diagram determined by @xcite , all signals with frequencies below 1are due to high - order g  modes ; \n the remaining variations are caused by low - order p and mixed modes . \n @xcite identified @xmath15 as a radial mode and argued that @xmath11 is a dipole mode ; these are the only two modes with reasonably secure identifications . from comparison with pulsation models this author concluded that models in just two small domains of parameter space in the hr diagram are consistent with these mode identifications and with the frequency values . in case @xmath15 \n is the radial fundamental mode , models around 8.5  m@xmath16 match the observations . if @xmath15 corresponded to the first radial overtone \n , models with masses around 9.6  m@xmath16 reproduce @xmath15 and @xmath11 . \n all models in the present paper and by @xcite were computed with the the warsaw - new jersey stellar evolution and pulsation code ( e.g. , see @xcite for a description ) , using op opacities , the @xcite element mixture , and providing linear nonadiabatic model frequencies . \n no rotation or convective core overshooting was included in the models for simplicity of this preliminary model fitting . \n figure [ fig2 ] compares the additional @xmath2 @xmath0  cep - type pulsation frequencies predicted by the two models with our new observations . \n all newly detected pulsation frequencies are explained by the 8.5 m@xmath16 model ( upper panel of fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) . at first sight , \n there are two small inconsistencies : the close doublet @xmath17 only has one theoretical counterpart , and @xmath18 is not well matched by the theoretical value . \n the doublet can be explained by possible rotational splitting at @xmath19 , consistent with the very low @xmath20 of the star . \n the mismatch for @xmath18 may be more of a problem , but it would not be new : in their analysis of the pulsation spectrum of , @xcite noted the same problem for the highest - frequency p  mode ( @xmath21 , p@xmath22 ) observed . \n interestingly , in the present model @xmath18 would also correspond to the @xmath21 , p@xmath22 mode and even the size of the frequency mismatch is similar . \n it can be suspected that this mismatch originates from inadequate physics in the models that can be improved through asteroseismology .    the 9.6 m@xmath16 model ( lower panel of fig .

a final seismic model must explain their excitation . \n we conclude that @xmath1  peg presents sufficient information to carry out detailed seismic modeling of a hybrid pulsator for the first time . \n the eight @xmath0  cephei pulsation frequencies restrict the possible models and their parameters considerably . \n the observed amplitude ratios and phase shifts between the radial velocities and photometric data provide clues towards the opacities to be used . \n theoretical models constrained by such a large set of observables must also reproduce the high - order g  modes and the excited frequency domains . \n the present study is a demonstration of the value of combining space photometry with ground - based spectroscopy of bright stars . \n this work has been supported by the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung under grant p20526-n16 . \n afjm is grateful for financial support from nserc ( canada ) and fqrnt ( quebec ) . \n we thank frank fekel of tennessee state university for providing the list of photospheric lines we used for extracting velocities from the tsu spectra . \n we are grateful to ramotholo sefako for organizing the saao observations . \n peg data with consecutive prewhitening . \n the photometric data are compared with the radial velocity measurements ( reverted graphs ) . \n the frequency regions @xmath32 and @xmath33are not shown as they contain no intrinsic signals . \n the frequencies @xmath34 have been assigned for consistency with @xcite . \n the apparent 1sidelobe of @xmath15 in the most data is an alias peak originating from the orbital frequency.[fig1 ] ]     and @xmath11 . \n the model frequencies are plotted at the bottom of the panels , with amplitudes of 0.7 ( radial modes ) , 0.5 ( dipole modes ) , and 0.33 ( quadrupole modes ) . \n the observed frequencies protrude from the top of the panels.[fig2 ] ]    cep pulsations and the lower panel the spb oscillation modes . \n the star symbols show the theoretical locations of radial modes in this diagram , the diamonds represent dipole modes and the triangles stand for quadrupole modes . \n only model modes with frequencies in the observed domains are plotted . \n [ fig3 ] ]     model of @xmath1  peg with the observed frequencies . as ordinate \n the stability parameter @xmath35 is used ;

( 2 ) how are the weak cusps in bright galaxies maintained in spite of mergers with dense low - luminosity galaxies ? \n if the small galaxy survived such a merger with its central regions intact , this would create a new high - density core in the center of the big galaxy and destroy the observed correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n strong cusps form naturally in stellar systems where the black hole grows on time scales long compared with the crossing time ( peebles 1972 ; quinlan et al . \n milosavljevi & merritt ( 2001 ) presented simulations where the initial galaxies have steep central density cusps ( like those in low - luminosity galaxies ) and central black holes . \n the central density cusp in the final remnant had a slope @xmath8 after the binary black hole had ejected a mass of order its own mass from the pre - existing nucleus . \n this result can explain how shallow cusps form . in this work \n , we describe a set of merger simulations that address the question of how a shallow cusp can _ survive _ the accretion of a small dense galaxy . \n our work extends that of merritt & cruz ( 2001 ; hereafter paper i ) who first presented merger simulations of galaxies containing central black holes and density cusps . \n initial galaxies were generated from dehnen s ( 1993 ) law , @xmath9 which has a power - law central density dependence , @xmath10 . \n our primary ( massive ) galaxies had @xmath11 , characteristic of the shallow cusps in bright galaxies , and our secondary ( dwarf ) galaxies had @xmath12 , characteristic of the steep cusps of dwarf galaxies . \n subscripts 1 and 2 will henceforth refer to the primary and secondary galaxies respectively . \n initial particle velocities were assigned from an isotropic distribution function that accounts for the central point mass representing the black hole ( tremaine et al . \n each black hole was assigned a mass 2@xmath13 times that of the parent galaxy . \n this is consistent with the best estimated value of @xmath14 for the mean ratio of black hole mass to luminous galaxy mass in the local universe ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) . \n the mass @xmath15 and length scale @xmath16 of the primary galaxy were set to unity . \n we chose @xmath17 ; this mass ratio complements the more extreme ratio of @xmath18 adopted in paper i. as in that paper , the ratio of the galaxies scale lengths was fixed using scaling relations drawn from observations of real galaxies . \n in particular , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we took @xmath21 . \n the primary galaxy had @xmath22 equal - mass particles . \n for the secondary galaxy we took @xmath23 so that all particles had the same mass . \n we set the initial orbital parameters for the mergers such that the separation between the galaxy centers was @xmath24 times the half - mass radius of the primary galaxy . \n the initial orbital velocities were assigned in units of the angular momentum of a circular orbit at the defined separation , @xmath25 , with @xmath26=@xmath27 . \n the evolution was followed using the tree code gadget ( springel et al . \n 2000 ) , a parallel algorithm with continuously - variable time steps for each particle . \n the merger simulations were continued until @xmath28 1 dynamical time of the primary galaxy after formation of the hard black - hole binary , slightly longer than in the simulations of paper i. integrations were carried out using the hpc10000 supercomputer at the rutgers center for advanced information processing and the cray t3e at the san diego supercomputer center . \n all simulations used 16 processors . \n final density profiles for the merger remnants are shown in figure 1 , computed from the particle positions using the mapel package ( merritt 1994 ) . \n we also plot final density profiles from the @xmath29 mergers of paper i ; because those simulations were extended for slightly longer times here , the central densities have dropped slightly compared to the values shown in paper i due to continued ejection of stars by the black - hole binary . \n the central density slopes for all of our simulations are lower at the final time step than the initial slope of the giant galaxy . \n we find @xmath30 for the @xmath1 mergers and @xmath31 for the @xmath29 mergers . in projection , \n all of the remnants exhibit `` cores , '' regions of nearly constant surface brightness near the center ; the cores are especially noticeable in the @xmath1 remnants . \n this is similar to the situation in real elliptical galaxies , where nonparametric deprojection of the luminosity profiles of the `` core '' galaxies reveals shallow power - law cusps in the space density ( merritt & fridman 1995 ) . \n the very mild inflections seen in the projected density profiles of figure 1 are also consistent with observed profiles . \n based on these simulations , and on the @xmath32 merger simulations of milosavljevi & merritt ( 2001 ) , we propose the following two rules that relate initial and final density profiles at the centers of merging galaxies . 1 \n . mergers between galaxies containing power - law density cusps produce remnants with power - law cusps . \n the final density profile is always shallower near the center than the initial profile of the more massive galaxy . \n the first `` law '' appears to be true even in mergers without black holes ( figure 1c , f ; barnes 1999 ) , while the second `` law '' only holds if the massive galaxy contains a supermassive black hole . \n central densities might be driven even lower by the continued ejection of stars by a binary supermassive black hole ( milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) . \n these `` laws , '' if they can be shown to hold generally for mergers between galaxies with supermassive black holes , could explain how the observed relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is preserved in the face of mergers . \n this work was supported by nsf grant ast 00 - 71099 , nasa grants nag5 - 6037 and nag5 - 9046 , by a fellowship from the consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnologia de mexico , and by grant no . \n mca00n010n from ncsa . \n barnes , j. e. 1999 , in iau symp . \n 186 , galaxy interactions at low and high redshift , ed . \n j. e. barnes & d. b. sanders ( dordrecht : kluwer ) , 137 dehnen , w. 1993 , mnras , 265 , 250 ferrarese , l. , van den bosch , f. c. , ford , h. c. , jaffe , w. & oconnell , r. w. 1994 , aj , 108 , 1598 gebhardt , k. et al . \n 1996 , aj , 112 , 105 merritt , d. 1994 , http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/@xmath28merritt/mapel_1.html merritt , d. & ferrarese , l. 2001 , mnras , 320 , l30 merritt , d. & cruz , f. 2001 , apj , 551 , l41 ( paper i ) merritt , d. & fridman , t. 1995 , in fresh views of elliptical galaxies , a.s.p . \n a. buzzoni , a. renzini & a. serrano ) 22 . \n milosavljevi , m. , & merritt , d. 2001 , astro  ph/0103350 peebles , p. j .. \n e. 1972 , gen . \n grav . , 3 , 63 quinlan , g. d. , hernquist , l. & sirgudsson , s. 1995 , apj , 440 , 554 springle , v. , yoshida , w. & white , s. d. m. 2000 , astro - ph/0003162 tremaine , s. et al . \n 1994 , aj , 107 , 634", "StartTimeOffset": 680363382036, "RequestID": "d74f962382e53bee7d8a55883ae98dbe73e8f589", "TotalTokens": 2089}

ballistic behavior is obtained @xcite . \n here we generalize the discrete qw using a time dependent unitary coin operator . \n we find an analytical expression for the dependence of the standard deviation on the coin operator in the asymptotic regime . \n this expression shows explicitly how to select the unitary evolution to obtain a predetermined asymptotic behavior for the wave function spreading : ballistic , sub -

bins accentuate the increase of the number of high mass clusters with increasing age . \n this arises because the sample grows with time  a ` size - of - sample ' effect . as the sample increases , \n so does the likelihood of producing a massive cluster .      unlike the top envelope of the age - mass diagram , the line along the bottom of the distribution is not caused by statistics , but the detection limit of our modelled observations . \n as clusters fade with time , this constant limiting flux translates into an increasing limiting mass .    in most of the cases observed cluster samples will be luminosity limited . as the population ages , clusters of higher mass fade below the detection limit \n we have denoted this by a green line , representing the mass of a cluster with @xmath6 ( adapted to the study of m33 that will follow ) at a given age . \n @xmath3  band is normally the limiting filter in observational studies and we emulate the detection limit in this plot .      the lower panel shows the main diagnostic used in the study of cluster disruption . \n the vertical axis gives the number of clusters our imaginary galaxy formed in each log - age bin , normalised to unit time ( in this case one myr ) . \n here we present the input sample as a solid line : a constant cfh gives rise to a flat line . \n this will not , however , be observed , due to the detection limit . \n the green line shows all clusters that lie above the detection limit in each log - age bin and displays the characteristic power - law shape found in all observational studies . \n the interpretation of this plot is far from trivial : this @xmath5 shape means that 90% of the population is lost with each age dex . \n mid interprets this as 90% of clusters dissolving each age dex (  in m33 , ( * ? ? ? \n * sarajedini & mancone 2007 ) ) . in this example \n , however , this is due to detection incompleteness . \n thus , a model has to treat _ fading _ and _ dissolution _ as two separate and concurrent causes of cluster disappearance .      having established the above , we can now perform a simple test for the mass dependence of cluster disruption : cutting the sample according to mass .    in the @xmath4  plot we present two mass cuts as a red and blue line respectively . both cuts \n split the power - law distribution to a composite shape : a flat part , i.e. a constant cluster formation rate , and a power - law decline , due to clusters fading below the detection limit . \n after understanding the caveats inherent in the study of the @xmath4  plot , we can proceed to plot the distribution of an observed cluster sample . \n we obtained the age and mass of a sample of @xmath7 _ bona fide _ clusters in m33 ( spanning the entire surface of the galaxy , an unbiased , _ hst_-selected sample ; ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * sarajedini & mancone 2007 , san roman et  al . \n 2009 ) ) using _ ubvi _  imaging from the local group survey ( ( * ? ? ? \n * massey  et  al .  2006 ) ) . \n the sfr is known to have been constant for @xmath8  gyr in m33 , making it ideal for our study . \n [ fig : obs ] presents the age distribution of the magnitude -

law for a magnitude - limited sample . \n crucially , as predicted by the models of fig . \n [ fig : theory ] ( left ) , taking a mass cut produces a composite structure , with a flat initial part and a power -

wavelength instabilities . \n however , the dispersion relation does not contain any sixth order terms . \n this is because the only sixth order term in action ( [ faction ] ) does not contribute to the dynamics of the scalar more . \n the absence of sixth order terms in the dispersion relation poses a threat for renormalizability . \n however , a straightforward resolution is to add to the superpotential @xmath10 fourth order terms , so as to generate sixth ( and eight order terms ) in the action , which would restore the appealing renormalizability properties of the theory . \n the minimal consistent prescription would be to add to @xmath10 all possible fourth order terms that respect invariance under foliation preserving diffeomorphisms , but also impose parity invariance . \n then the terms added would be r^2 , r^r _ , r ^i a_i , r^ija_i a_j , r a_i a^i,(a_i a^i)^2 , ( ^i a_i)^2 , a_i a_j ^i a^j . \n one would be left with 12 free couplings , which is an appreciable improvement with respect to the theory without detailed balance . \n we have put together an action for hoava  lifshitz gravity that satisfies detailed balance without assuming projectability . \n this version appears to lead to sensible dynamics for the scalar mode and be free of other pathologies that plague the projectable version of hoava  lifshitz gravity . \n additionally , it has the appealing renormalizability properties of the most general non - projectable theory , with about an order of magnitude less independent couplings . \n however , imposing detailed balance leads to a large and negative bare cosmological constant . barring a miraculous cancelation with the ( yet to be understood ) vacuum energy contribution to the cosmological constant , \n this is obviously hard to reconcile with low energy gravitational phenomenology . \n an additional caveat in the use of detailed balance is the fact that it is not clear if or why it should be robust against radiative corrections . \n the implementation of detailed balance presented here leads to a consistent theory which is free of pathologies and , therefore , allows to consider this question rigorously . \n 15    hoava p 2009 _ phys . \n _ d * 79 * 084008 visser m 2009 _ phys . \n _ d * 80 * 025011 visser m 2009 arxiv:0912.4757 [ hep -

dependent term is calculable in string theory ; the precise values of the parameters that appear in this term depend on the details of the model . \n in fact , one might expect such a velocity - dependent term from the post - newtonian approximation in higher dimensional gravity . in this paper \n , we also examine the impact of such a velocity - dependent force on the slow - roll and the power spectrum of the density perturbation . \n we find that the effect on the tilt of the spectral index of the density perturbations may be small . \n however , such a term is likely to have an observable effect on the ratio of the tensor to scalar perturbations . \n moreover , the scale dependence of the spectral index is also modified . \n therefore , a global analysis of data from various measurements may allow us to distinguish these effects from that of the conventional inflationary scenario . \n our starting part is the effective action @xmath1 for the canonically normalized inflaton @xmath2 of the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective potential . \n the precise form of @xmath5 will be specified later on . \n note that the field @xmath2 in the brane world is related to the separation @xmath6 between the branes by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the string scale . to lowest order @xmath9 . \n there are also higher order corrections to @xmath10 . in the usual inflationary scenario , \n the deviation of @xmath11 from unity is due to quantum effects . \n typically , it takes the form of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a constant and @xmath14 is the coupling constant . here \n , we will consider a different type of contribution to @xmath11 which is motivated by brane world physics ( or higher dimensional gravity ) .    in an expanding universe , @xmath15 , then , @xmath16    for inflation to take place , there is some choice of @xmath2 so that the potential @xmath17 satisfies the slow - roll conditions : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the solution of @xmath171 does not change greatly with the velocity - dependent term , @xmath172 furthermore , @xmath158 and so the velocity - dependent term is also negligible . \n therefore , @xmath173 where @xmath136 . \n the spectrum is tilted to the red . if the lowest non - vanishing contribution to the potential comes from the dipole of a brane - orientifold plane system , @xmath174 which gives a slightly larger red tilt . \n in this paper , we have examined the density perturbation spectrum in the brane inflationary scenario . \n we have also studied the effect of a velocity - dependent potential . \n the form of the inflation potential as well as the velocity - dependent potential is strongly motivated from higher dimensional gravity ( in particular , string theory ) . in the usual four - dimensional inflationary scenario , \n the deviation of @xmath11 from unity is due to quantum effects and is usually small . in brane inflation , however , the velocity - dependent potential can give rise to a significant effect in @xmath11 . \n generically , the effect on the spectral index is comparable with that from the slow - roll parameter @xmath43 ( from eq.([index ] ) ) . \n therefore , in models where @xmath43 is not small , this may be a measurable effect . even though this effect on @xmath46 can be small in a generic model \n , the scale - dependence of @xmath46 has a stronger dependence on the velocity dependent term , as it scales @xmath175 by a factor of @xmath176 ( see eq . \n ( [ ktilt ] ) ) . \n more importantly , the velocity - dependent potential can also modify the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations ( see eq.([t / s ] ) ) . with a global analysis of data from various measurements , \n one should be able to distinguish these effects from those that can be obtained from a conventional inflationary scenario . \n we expect that a few percent deviation of @xmath39 from unity may be measurable . \n it seems that the power spectrum index in a generic inflationary scenario in the brane world has a red tilt of a few percent . \n the velocity dependent potential can further tilt the density perturbation spectrum to the red or to the blue , depending on the specific form of the potential . \n the blue tilt due to the velocity - dependent term does not require extra fields , in contrast to other inflationary models ( _ e.g. _ , hybrid inflation ) . \n the velocity - dependent potential in the brane flationary scenario is similar to that appears in k - inflation @xcite . \n however , unlike k - inflation , in our scenario , inflation is still driven by the static potential . \n the additional velocity dependent term provides modifications of the usual slow - roll inflation . \n furthermore , the kinetic term and the static potential in the brane inflation scenario are related by string theory or by post - newtonian approximation ( see eq.([postnewton ] ) ) . \n potential of the type @xmath177 has been studied in the context of quintessence @xcite . \n it was argued in @xcite that this type of potential appear naturally in supersymmetric theory . \n as we have described , this type of potential is also motivated when we study cosmology involving branes . \n furthermore , the velocity dependent term has a close resemblance to that in k - essence @xcite \n . it would be interesting to explore whether the specific form of k - essence motivated by brane dynamics may offer an explanation for the present accelerating universe . \n the research of g.s . was supported in part by the doe grant fg02 - 95er40893 , the university of pennsylvania school of arts and sciences dean s fund , and the nsf grant phy99 - 07949 . \n the research of s .- h.h.t . was partially supported by the national science foundation . \n g.s . would like to thank the m - theory workshop at itp , santa barbara , and the theory division at cern for support and hospitality during the final stage of this work . \n in this appendix , we derive the equation for the quantum fluctuation @xmath25 in the presence of a non - trivial @xmath11 , and show that at late time , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obey the same differential equation with respect to time . \n we used this fact to derive eq.([gpformula ] ) analogous to the original derivation of @xcite .    to study quantum fluctuations , we split @xmath2 into the classical piece @xmath178 ( which satisfies ( [ eom ] ) ) and the quantum piece @xmath25 : @xmath179 the classical piece is homogeneous , whereas the fluctuations satisfy : @xmath180 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath13 for the classical part of @xmath2 . \n we note that for scales outside the horizon ( hence the gradient term is negligible ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obeys the same time - dependent differential equation . by expanding @xmath25 in fourier modes : @xmath181 \n the equation of motion for @xmath182 is @xmath183 it is convenient to rewrite it in terms of @xmath184 . in the conventional case , @xmath9 , @xmath185 where prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath186 . for de sitter space \n , the solution is @xmath187 which reduces to @xmath188 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 .    in the presence of a velocity - dependent potential , @xmath192 for scales inside the horizon , when the fluctuations are generated \n , the dominant term is still @xmath193 . \n therefore , @xmath194 is still given by the bunch - davies vacuum , @xmath195 hence the quantum fluctuations @xmath182 is still given by the de sitter temperature , @xmath196                        v.f . \n mukhanov , g.v . \n chibisov , jetp lett . \n * 33 * , 532 ( 1981 ) ; sov . \n jetp * 56 * , 258 ( 1982 ) ; + s.w . hawking , \n . lett . * b115 * , 295 ( 1982 ) ; + a.a . \n starobinsky , _ ibid _ , * b117 * , 175 ( 1982 ) ; + j. bardeen , p.j . \n steinhardt , m. turner , phys . rev . * \n d28 * , 679 ( 1983 ) ; + v.f . \n mukhanov , jetp lett . * 41 * , 493 ( 1985 ) . \n m.  bianchi , g.  pradisi and a.  sagnotti , nucl . \n b * 376 * , 365 ( 1992 ) ; + m.  bianchi , nucl . \n b * 528 * , 73 ( 1998 ) ; + z.  kakushadze , g.  shiu and s .- h . \n h.  tye , phys . \n d * 58 * , 086001 ( 1998 ) ; + z.  kakushadze , int . \n j.  mod . \n a * 15 * , 3113 ( 2000 ) . \n e.  witten , jhep * 9802 * , 006 ( 1998 ) . \n g. dvali , phys . lett . * \n b459 * , 489 ( 1999 ) ; + n.  arkani -

{"ContextTokens": 3064, "GeneratedTokens": 76, "SynthesizedBody": "oscillators directly generating femtosecond pulses with energy exceeding 100 nj are of interest for numerous applications including frequency conversion , metrology , micro - machining , etc . nowadays \n oscillators operating at mhz - repetition rates have reached the micro - joule pulse energy frontier without an extra - resonator amplification . \n an ingenious idea allowing such an advance is the pulse stretching , that suppresses the instabilities inherent to the high - peak - power oscillators @xcite . \n since the pulse is soliton in the negative group - delay - dispersion ( gdd ) regime , its stretching is linearly irreversible . \n the issue of pulse compressibility can be solved by a chirped - pulse oscillator ( cpo ) providing : i ) sufficient pulse stretching ( few picoseconds ) , ii ) broad spectrum ( more than 100 nm ) , and iii ) pulse compressibility down to few tens of femtoseconds @xcite . \n the remaining issue is that a high - energy oscillator ( including cpo ) is stable only within a confined region of gdd and pulse energy . \n the existing theory @xcite predicts that some minimum positive gdd is required for the cpo stabilization against the cw - amplification and this `` threshold '' gdd increases with the energy . \n it was found , that the gain saturation is a key factor determining the oscillator stability . \n however , the existing models do not take into account the gain dynamics and , thereby , some substantial features of the regime remain unexplored . \n for instance , it is unclear why the region of gdd and energy , where a single stable pulse exists , is confined @xcite .    here , for the first time to our knowledge , \n the theory of cpo taking into account the gain dynamics will be presented . \n as it will be shown , the gain dynamics provides an explanation for the confinement of the pulse stability region . \n the model demonstrates an existence of two main mechanisms of pulse destabilization : the satellite rise in front of the pulse and the cw - amplification . \n the cpo conception is based on the pulse energy ( @xmath0 ) scaling with the scaling of resonator period ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the averaged power ) . \n since the pulse peak power ( @xmath4 ) scales with the energy : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the pulse width ) , one has to stretch the pulse ( i.e. , to increase @xmath6 ) in order to reduce @xmath4 and , thereby , suppress the instabilities causing by the nonlinear effects inside a resonator ( e.g. , the self - focusing inside an active medium ) . \n however , in the solitonic regime ( i.e. , when the gdd is negative ) , such a stretching is linearly irreversible . \n this means that the femtosecond high - energy pulse can be produced by only nonlinear compression , which worsens its characteristics ( e.g. , enhances the noise ) . in the cpo \n , the picosecond pulse has an extremely wide spectrum due to large chirp . as a result , \n the pulse is linearly compressible down to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the pulse spectrum width ) . \n the experiments demonstrate that such a regime is very stable and reproducible @xcite . \n the pulse stability in the cpo can be explained by the combined action of two mechanisms : a pure phase mechanism and a frequency - dissipative one . \n the first mechanism is the balance of phase contributions from the pulse envelope @xmath9 : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the gdd coefficient , @xmath12 is the local time ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) and the time - dependent phase @xmath15 : @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite . such a balance is possible if the pulse is chirped . however , a pure phase balance is not sufficient for pulse stabilization as the pulse spreads , i.e. some dissipative effects are required to form a quasi - soliton . \n the pulse lengthening due to gdd can be compensated by its shortening owing to frequency filtering if the pulse is chirped @xcite . \n the chirp results in frequency deviation at the pulse front and tail , and the filter cuts off the high- and low - frequency wings of the pulse , thus the pulse shortens .    the cpo can be described on the basis of the distributed generalized complex cubic - quintic nonlinear ginzburg - landau model @xcite :    @xmath17 + \\left [ { \\left ( { \\kappa   - i\\gamma } \\right)p(z , t ) - \\kappa \\zeta p(z , t)^2 } \\right]a(z , t).\\ ] ]    here @xmath18 is the propagation distance normalized to the cavity length ( i.e. , the cavity round - trip number , in fact ) . \n @xmath19 is the instant power , @xmath20 is the square of the inverse spectral filter bandwidth . \n the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the self - phase and self - amplitude modulation coefficients , respectively . \n parameter @xmath23 describes saturation of the self - amplitude modulation . in a broadband solid - state oscillator , for example \n , parameter @xmath20 is the square of the inverse gain band width multiplied by the saturated gain coefficient . \n parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined by the kerr - lens mode locking mechanism @xcite .    the @xmath24-parameter is the spectrally independent saturable net - loss coefficient , which depends on the instant pulse energy @xmath25 . \n below , such a dependence will be referred as the dynamic gain saturation . \n it was found @xcite , that a heavily - chirped pulse in cpo can be described as the soliton - like solution of eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) in the limit of time - independent @xmath24 . in this case , the simplest energy - dependence of the @xmath24-parameter is @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . \n the spectrum of the chirped soliton - like pulse has a lorentz profile truncated at some frequency @xmath30 , where the central frequency @xmath310 corresponds to the cpo carrier frequency @xcite . \n the chirped soliton - like pulse is stable within the region of its existence , i.e. within the region of @xmath32 @xcite . \n positivity of @xmath24 , i.e. stability against the cw - amplification ( vacuum stability ) , can be provided by a certain minimum positive gdd growing with energy . \n nevertheless , the existing theory does not take into account the time dependence of @xmath24 provided by the dynamic gain saturation . \n let us consider some numerical estimations . \n the gain saturation fluency for a ti : sapphire oscillator is @xmath330.8 j/@xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the emission cross - section , @xmath36 is the emission frequency , @xmath37 is the planck s constant ) . \n then , the gain variation due to gain saturation per one resonator round - trip is @xmath380.2 ( @xmath391 ps , the mode area @xmath40 equals to 130 @xmath41m@xmath42 , @xmath43200 nj ; and the peak power is close to the stability limit , which is defined by the self - phase modulation coefficient @xmath444.5 mw@xmath45 ) . that is the gain variation per one cavity round - trip \n is not negligible unlike that in a low - energy femtosecond oscillator operating in the solitonic regime . \n below , the extended theory of cpo taking into account the dynamic gain saturation will be considered . \n the cubic nonlinear limit of eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) admits the chirped soliton - like solution @xcite : @xmath46^{1 + i\\psi } \\exp \\left [ { i\\omega \\left ( { t - \\upsilon z } \\right ) } + i\\phi z   \\right],\\ ] ] which is frequency ( @xmath47)- and phase ( @xmath48)-shifted and time - delayed ( @xmath49 ) in the presence of the dynamic gain saturation ( @xmath50 is the dimensionless chirp ) :    @xmath51    the pulse parameters are :    @xmath52    in eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) \n @xmath53 is the net - loss coefficient , @xmath54 is the gain at the pulse peak taking into account its time - delay with propagation , @xmath55 . \n one can see a clear manifestation of the dynamic gain saturation : the time - delay and the frequency shift appear . \n [ f1 ] shows the gdd - dependence of the chirp parameter @xmath50 for two fixed @xmath22 . \n one can see , that the chirp ( @xmath56 ) increases with gdd and its value is sufficiently large to provide an efficient compression ( the pulse width after compression is @xmath57 ) . \n growth of the self - amplitude modulation decreases @xmath56 due to reduction of the relative contribution of the self - phase modulation in comparison with the self - amplitude modulation .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     on the other hand , both gdd and pump decrease destabilizes the pulse , as well ( @xmath58 in figs . \n [ f3],[f4],[f6 ] ) . \n the destabilizing mechanism is an appearance of satellite in front of the pulse ( dashed curve in figs . \n [ f3 ] ) . as a result of the dynamic gain saturation , the energy transfer from the pulse to satellite destabilizes the cpo . \n to determine the operational range of cpo in terms of dispersion and energy variations , an effect of the dynamic gain saturation on the cpo stability has been studied numerically for the first time to our knowledge . \n it has been found , that the dynamic gain saturation has a strong impact on a cpo dynamics in contrast to a low - energy (  10 nj ) mode - locked solid - state oscillator . \n first , there is some minimum positive net - gdd providing the oscillator stabilization . below this value \n the pulse is destroyed by excitation of the satellite before the pulse . \n such a satellite is clearly visible in the experiment and can co - exist stably with the pulse within some narrow gdd - range . \n second , there is some maximum gdd and its excess fragments the pulse front owing to the cw - amplification . \n third , the highest pulse energy at a given repetition rate is limited because the maximum and minimum gdds stabilizing the pulse merge . \n the work was supported by the austrian national science fund ( fonds zur frderung der wissentschaftlichen forschung ( fwf ) , projects no . \n p20293 and p17973 ) and by the max - planck gesellschaft ( institut fr quantenoptik ) . \n a.apolonski ( department fr physik der ludwig - maximilians - universitt mnchen ) is gratefully acknowledged for active discussions and providing the experimental data concerning the high - energy ti : sapphire cpos . \n s. h. cho , b. e. bouma , e. p. ippen , j. g. fujimoto , `` low - repetition - rate high - peak - power kerr - lens mode - locked tial@xmath59o@xmath60 laser with a multiple - pass cavity , '' _ opt . \n * 24 * , pp . 417419 , 1999 . \n a. fernandez , t. fuji , a. poppe , a. frbach , f. krausz , a. apolonski , `` chirped - pulse oscillators : a route to high - power femtosecond pulses without external amplification , '' _ opt . \n lett . _ * 29 * , pp . 13661368 , 2004 . v. l.kalashnikov , e. podivilov , a. chernykh , s. naumov , a. fernandez , r. graf , a. apolonski , `` approaching the microjoule frontier with femtosecond laser oscillators : theory and comparison with experiment , '' * new j. phys . * * 7 * , p. 217 \n v. l. kalashnikov , e. podivilov , a. chernykh , a. apolonski , `` chirped - pulse oscillators : theory and experiment , '' _ appl . \n _ b * 83 * , pp . 503510 , 2006 . \n a. fernndez , a. apolonski , _ \n private communication_. v. l. kalashnikov , a. fernndez , a. apolonski , `` high - order dispersion in chirped - pulse oscillators , '' _ optics express _ , pp . 42064216 , 2008 . h. a. haus , j. g. fujimoto , e. p. ippen , `` structures for additive pulse mode locking , '' _ j. opt \n . soc . am . \n b _ * 8 * , pp . 20682076 , 1991 . b. proctor , e. westwig , f. wise , `` characterization of a kerr - lens mode - locked ti : sapphire laser with positive group - velocity dispersion , '' _ opt . \n * 18 * , pp . 16541656 , 1993 . n. n. akhmediev , a. ankiewicz , _ solitons : nonlinear pulses and beams _ , chapman & hall , london , 1997 . v. l. kalashnikov , i. g. poloyko , v. p. mikhailov , d. von der linde , `` dynamical gain saturation in kerr - lens mde - locked cw solid - state lasers , '' _ optical and quantum electronics _ * 31 * , pp . 369365 , 1999 . v. l. kalashnikov , v. p. kalosha , v. p. mikhailov , i. g. poloyko , `` self - mode locking of four - mirror - cavity solid - state lasers by kerr self - focusing , '' _ j. opt . \n b _ * 12 * , pp . \n 462467 , 1995 .", "StartTimeOffset": 732170552406, "RequestID": "5f4886810c51c6835fb4fcf77306a473da9d006e", "TotalTokens": 3140}
{"ContextTokens": 2089, "GeneratedTokens": 238, "SynthesizedBody": "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are an unusual class of astrophysical objects . \n there are currently only five confirmed axps : 4u  0142 + 61 , 1e  1048.15937 , 1e  1841045 , rxs  j170849.0400910 , and 1e  2259.1 + 586 . all five are found in the plane of the galaxy ; and two of the five certain members of the class appear to be located at the geometric centers of apparent supernova remnants . \n axp characteristics can be summarized as follows ( see israel , mereghetti , & stella 2002 , for a review ) : they exhibit x - ray pulsations in the range @xmath1512  s ; they have pulsed x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ; they spin down regularly ; their x - ray luminosities are much greater than the rate of loss of rotational kinetic energy inferred from the observed spin - down ; they have spectra that are characterized by thermal emission of @xmath4  kev with evidence for a hard tail in some sources . \n soft gamma repeaters also exhibit axp - like pulsations in quiescence ( e.g. kouveliotou et al . 1998 ) ; the connection between axps and sgrs is intriguing but not yet clear . \n the results here summarize those reported by gavriil & kaspi ( 2001 ) . \n the results presented here were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) . \n our observations consist primarily of short snapshots taken on a monthly basis . \n in addition , we used a handful of archival observations ; the exposures in these observations vary . \n phase - coherent timing of axps has shown that the rotational stability of some axps is comparable to those of some radio pulsars . \n the rotational stability of 1e  2259.1 + 586 , first reported by kaspi , chakrabarty , & steinberger ( 1999 ) , has now persisted over 4.5  yr , although the inclusion of @xmath5 has recently been necessary . \n 4u  0142 + 61  has been an extremely stable rotator over 4.4  yr of _ rxte _ monitoring . for rxs \n j170849.0400910 , phase coherent timing has been accomplished in the 1.4  yr since the glitch reported by kaspi , lackey , & chakrabarty ( 2000 ) . in these data , \n we find a significant positive @xmath5 . \n this indicates a decay of the negative @xmath0 , expected for long - term glitch recovery , as seen in glitching radio pulsars ( e.g. shemar & lyne 1996 ) . \n 1e  1841045  shows rotational stability but with considerably higher red noise ( see gotthelf et al . \n , this volume ) . \n 1e  1048.15937  has exhibited far noisier behavior , making phase - coherent timing using monthly and weekly observations virtually impossible . \n interestingly there is a correlation between timing stability and @xmath0 : the sources with the smallest @xmath0 are the most stable . \n arrival time residuals for 1e  2259.1 + 586 , 4u  0142 + 61  and rxs  j170849.0400910  are shown in figure  [ fig : res ] . \n axp spectra are generally best fit by a two - component model consisting of a photoelectrically absorbed blackbody with a hard power - law tail ( israel et al . \n whether these two components are physically distinct is an open question ( see zel , psaltis , & kaspi 2001 ) . to investigate this \n , we compared the pulse profile morphology of the axps in two energy bands . figure  [ fig : energy ] displays the average pulse profiles of rxs  j170849.0400910 , 1e  2259.1 + 586   and 1e  1048.15937  in the energy bands 24  kev and 68  kev . from figure \n [ fig : energy ] it is clear that axp pulse profiles exhibit different degrees of energy dependence ; rxs  j170849.0400910  shows high energy dependence , while 1e  1048.15937  shows no energy dependence . \n we have also used our _ rxte _ data to monitor the pulsed flux of the axps as a function of time . \n rapid ( @xmath6 months ) flux variability would challenge the magnetar model and accreting sources generally show flux variability correlated with @xmath0 . \n given the large field - of - view of the pca and the low count rates for the sources relative to the background , total flux measurements are difficult with our _ rxte _ data . \n instead , we have determined the pulsed component of the flux , by using the off - pulse emission as a background estimator . \n the flux time series for 1e  2259.1 + 586 , 4u  0142 + 61  and rxs  j170849.0400910 are displayed in figure  [ fig : flux ] . \n we do not find evidence for any large variability in the pulsed flux for any source , and have set @xmath7 upper limits on variations @xmath12030% ( depending on the source ) . \n this is surprising given previous reports of large ( factor of 510 ) total flux variations in 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 4u  0142 + 61  ( baykal & swank 1996 ; oosterbroek et al . 1998 ) . \n assuming a constant pulsed fraction , this suggests that more than one of the axps happen to be much more quiescent during the _ rxte _ monitoring than in the past . \n iwasawa , koyama , & halpern ( 1992 ) reported a significant change in the pulse morphology of 1e  2259.1 + 586  in 1.214  kev _ ginga _ observations obtained in 1990 , such that the leading pulse had amplitude roughly half that of the trailing pulse . \n if correct , this has important implications for the magnetar model , which predicts such pulse morphology changes in the event of a restructuring of the magnetic field , as might occur following a major sgr - like outburst . \n motivated by this finding , we searched for pulse profile changes in our _ rxte _ observations of all the axps . \n we have not detected any large pulse profile variations . \n this justifies our other analysis procedures which assume a fixed profile . \n we rule out variations in features having amplitude @xmath820% of the peak amplitude at the @xmath7 level , although the limit depends on source and integration time . \n baykal , a. & swank , j. 1996 , apj , 460 , 470 cordes , j.  m. & helfand , d.  j. 1980 , apj , 239 , 640 gavriil , f.  p. & kaspi , v.  m. 2001 , apj , in press , http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0107422 gotthelf , e.  v. , gavriil , f. , kaspi , v.  m. , vasisht , g. , & chakrabarty , d. 2001 , this volume israel , g. , mereghetti , s. , & stella , l. 2002 ( memorie della societa astronomica italiana ) , in press israel , g.  l. , oosterbroek , t. , angelini , l. , campana , s. , mereghetti , s. , parmar , a.  n. , segreto , a. , stella , l. , van paradijs , j. , & white , n.  e. 1999 , a&a , 346 , 929 iwasawa , k. , koyama , k. , & halpern , j.  p. 1992 \n , pasj , 44 , 9 kaspi , v.  m. , chakrabarty , d. , & steinberger , j. 1999 , apj , 525 , l33 kaspi , v.  m. , lackey , j.  r. , & chakrabarty , d. 2000 , apj , 537 , l31 kouveliotou , c. , dieters , s. , strohmayer , t. , van paradijs , j. , fishman , g.  j. , meegan , c.  a. , hurley , k. , kommers , j. , smith , i. , frail , d. , & murakami , t. 1998 , nature , 393 , 235 oosterbroek , t. , parmar , a.  n. , mereghetti , s. , & israel , g.  l. 1998 , a&a , 334 , 925 zel , f. , psaltis , d. , & kaspi , v.  m. 2001 , apj , in press , http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0105372 shemar , s.  l. & lyne , a.  g. 1996 , mnras , 282 , 677", "StartTimeOffset": 737898443640, "RequestID": "bc386fff514fff7a735f633a0121789b056bf41b", "TotalTokens": 2327}

purity @xmath0he , a superfluid density @xmath2% has been measured below a temperature @xmath3mk . the transition temperature from normal solid \n to supersolid is nearly constant with the pressure and no signal of the transition is observed in the specific heat.@xcite on the other hand , other manifestations of superfluidity like pressure - induced flow has not been detected in a recent experiment where solid @xmath0he was confined in vycor.@xcite    on the theoretical side , the pioneering works by andreev and lifshitz  @xcite and chester  @xcite suggested for the first time the possibility of bose -

diagonal long - range order.@xcite it is worth mentioning that the estimation of both magnitudes is rather difficult using pimc since the temperature is very low and the signal is expected to be very small . \n zero - temperature properties of solid @xmath0he such as its equation of state , static structure factor or lindemann s ratio have been calculated using diffusion monte carlo ( dmc )  @xcite and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc).@xcite the results obtained show an excellent agreement with experimental data due to both the exactness of the method and the accuracy of the interatomic potential between helium atoms . \n however , these calculations use as importance sampling trial wave function a nosanow - jastrow ( nj ) model,@xcite which is not symmetric under the exchange of particles . \n this is not a drawback for calculations of the energy or the spatial structure since the exchange energy has been estimated to be negligible , about 3@xmath4k / atom,@xcite but the lack of a correct quantum symmetry does not allow for estimations of the one - body density matrix and the superfluid density . \n two different models have been proposed to overcome this limitation . \n the first one is inspired in the bloch function of band theory currently used for electrons ; it is effectively a symmetric trial wave function but has proven to be worse than the nj model at the variational level.@xcite the second one corresponds to the shadow wave function,@xcite which allows for a good variational description of the solid , but not yet implemented in a dmc calculation .    in the present work \n , we present a microscopic study by means of the dmc method of bulk @xmath0he immersed in a lattice of confining potentials . by increasing progressively the strength of these external potentials we can get relevant information on the interplay between localization and superfluidity . measuring the degree of localization through the lindemann s ratio @xmath5 \n one can compare the physics of this structured phase with the solid one . at the experimental value for @xmath5 near the melting point \n the present model shows a non -

the authors conjecture that this may be due to the presence of grain boundaries formed in the growth of the crystal and which affect the coherence in the superflow . regarding this issue , \n we have computed @xmath65 at higher density , @xmath66 , and external constraint yielding @xmath62 and @xmath67 at density @xmath68 . \n the pressure of bulk solid @xmath25he at density @xmath69 ( @xmath70 bars ) is still on the range of supersolid experiments . \n we find @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 for the dmc - nj simulation at @xmath74 ) . \n therefore , within the statistical uncertainties of the model we do not observe pressure dependence of @xmath65 in the range of pressures analyzed . \n we have studied the competing effects of localization and superfluidity of bulk @xmath0he immersed in a lattice of external confining potentials . \n the simulations have been carried out at zero temperature using the dmc method . from the curve @xmath75 , and using the experimental value of @xmath5 of solid @xmath0he we obtain an estimation of the superfluid fraction @xmath1 , a value significantly larger than the experimental measure ( @xmath76 ) . on top of the possible drawbacks of the localized model for describing the @xmath0he solid phase , \n there are two effects that could help to explain the difference between the experimental measure and the present prediction . \n they are , first , the temperature ( the simulation is at zero temperature ) , and second , the possible influence of impurities in the experiments . \n the latter can be specially relevant since , as commented by kim and chan,@xcite a crucial point to observe superfluidity is the as much as possible elimination of impurities in the sample . \n the influence on the superfluid signal of @xmath77he impurities and/or incommensurability can be also analyzed in the present framework . \n work is in progress along this direction .", "StartTimeOffset": 742082977446, "RequestID": "8d66a36dcb3e27b8e875a0fbeb15fbbac25a2635", "TotalTokens": 3666}

they are consistent . \n one found the total @xmath34 quark angular momentum and the angular momentum from the sum of @xmath35 and @xmath34 quarks to be consistent with zero . \n this is because @xmath36 and @xmath37 are of the same magnitude but have opposite signs . \n a similar relation holds for @xmath38 and @xmath36 . \n note that in both of the calculations only connected diagrams are included .    for the transverse structure of the proton \n , qcdsf calculates the lowest two moments of the transverse spin densities of quarks in the nucleon@xcite . \n an exploratory attempt has been made to calculate transverse - momentum distributions ( tmds ) using lattice link products to approximate the wilson line in light - cone frame in spatial coordinates and fourier transforming into momentum - space to map the density distributions@xcite ; this calculation used 2 + 1f mixed action ( dwf on staggered , @xmath39  mev ) . \n another new development during the last year is progress on disconnected diagrams . \n an indirect way of calculating the strangeness form factors via charge symmetry in 2 + 1f lattices is shown on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : spin - gems ] . \n the direct approach has also made great progress . \n for example , the strange - quark distribution @xmath40 has been calculated by the @xmath41qcd collaboration on 2 + 1f lattices@xcite . \n the same group has also calculated the gluon momentum fraction @xmath42 with improved signal . \n this is an exciting era for the use of lattice qcd in nuclear physics : there have been huge leaps due to increasing computational resources worldwide and improved algorithms , allowing continual improvement in lighter pion masses , larger volumes and finer lattice spacings . \n various groups have demonstrated universality with the consistent results coming from independent calculations using different lattice actions . by reproducing well measured experimental values , \n we solidify confidence in lattice predictions of quantities that have not or can not be measured by experiment . \n there are many different aspects of hadron structure that one can do with lattice qcd ; only a few examples have been presented here .    in the near future , pion masses around 200  mev or lighter with multiple volumes and lattice spacings will become commonplace . \n there will be less need to depend on chiral perturbation theory for extrapolations , and once the physical pion mass becomes accessible , we can check its correctness . \n full - contraction calculations ( including disconnected diagrams ) in all matrix elements , form factors and gpds will lead to precision calculations for individual quark components or individual proton and neutron quantities . \n further improvements in methodology and expanding computational resources will allow direct calculations of the gluon content of the nucleon . \n the future is unlimited with lattice qcd . \n _ acknowledgements _ : authored by jefferson science associates , llc under u.s . \n doe contract no . \n de - ac05 - 06or23177 . \n government retains a non - exclusive , paid - up , irrevocable , world - wide license to publish or reproduce this manuscript for u.s . \n government purposes .", "StartTimeOffset": 750518983020, "RequestID": "96e504e9473831dd3eb434cb7c9c7a6146ad3e0e", "TotalTokens": 3035}

meson molecules , hybrids , glueballs , etc . here \n we shall discuss the tetraquark option . \n the study of multiquark systems , as tetraquarks or hexaquarks has been initiated by jaffe @xcite in the mit bag model . \n later on it has been extended to potential models and applied to light scalar mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . \n subsequently heavy tetraquarks have been considered in search for stability @xcite . \n flux tube models @xcite suggested instability .    in a previous work we studied a light tetraquark system of identical particles in a standard nonrelativistic potential model with colour confinement and hyperfine chromomagnetic interaction @xcite . \n our result showed explicitly the role of hidden colour states ( see below ) . \n subsequently we have studied the stability of a system of two light quarks @xmath6 and two heavy antiquarks @xmath7 @xcite . \n taking @xmath8 we performed a simple variational calculation with results comparable to other studies @xcite . \n we focused on the @xmath9 system because it has more of a chance to be bound than @xmath10 , the latter having a lower threshold . \n the argument was based on the following inequality @xcite @xmath11 valid for any value of the heavy - to - light mass ratio and where @xmath12 . \n this means that @xmath13 is a lower threshold than 2 @xmath14 . \n in addition the @xmath9 system is free of quark - antiquark annihilation processes which in @xmath10 can not be avoided . \n the open charm @xmath15 tetraquark with spin @xmath16 and isospin @xmath17 appears unbound in ref . \n @xcite , where the four - body problem was solved by an expansion in a harmonic - oscillator basis up to @xmath18 quanta . \n however , in the recent study of janc and rosina @xcite it is bound . \n this work , where a more sophisticated variational basis was used , has been inspired by the considerations made in ref . \n @xcite to include all possible channels which accelerate the convergence and in particular the meson  meson channels .    in the above calculations the potential of bhaduri et al . \n @xcite has been used . \n the hyperfine interaction is of chromomagnetic type . \n the parameters include constituent quark masses , the string tension of a linear confinement , the strength of the coulomb interaction , and the strength and size parameter of the hyperfine interaction which is a smeared contact term . \n they were fitted over a wide range of mesons and baryons .    in this paper \n we use the classification of tetraquark states as given in refs . \n @xcite and a simple quark model to calculate the spectrum of @xmath19 tetraquarks and we discuss it in the light of recent data . \n here we suppose that particles 1 and 2 are quarks and particles 3 and 4 antiquarks , see fig . \n we define the basis states in the orbital , colour and spin space taking into account the pauli principle . \n the flavour space is trivial if we restrict to su(2 ) . \n the total wave function of a tetraquark is a linear combination of products of orbital , spin , flavour and colour parts . \n there are at least three possible ways to define the relative coordinates . \n the three relevant possibilities for our problem are shown in fig . \n 1 . in the cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 the internal coordinates are @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 the first system of coordinates is convenient when the quarks or antiquarks are correlated to form diquarks , as in the diquark - antidiquark model . the coordinates ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are useful in describing the direct and exchange meson - meson channels _ i. e. _ the strong decays . one should use the system which is more appropriate for a given problem . \n but in specific calculations one can pass from one coordinate system to the other by orthogonal transformations . in the diquark - antidiquark picture the radial wave function can be written as a function of 6 variables @xmath25 but it can also be expressed in terms of coordinates ( [ direct ] ) or ( [ exchange ] ) . all channels which accelerate convergence should be included . \n the non - orthogonality between different @xmath26 functions can be handled without problems  @xcite . \n [ fig2 ]          in the colour space one can construct a colour singlet tetraquark state using intermediate couplings associated to the three coordinate systems defined above . in this way one obtains three distinct bases . \n these are @xmath27 are antisymmetric and 6 and @xmath28 are symmetric under interchange of quarks or antiquarks . \n each set , ( [ directcolor ] ) or ( [ exchangecolor ] ) , contains a singlet - singlet colour and an octet - octet colour state . \n the amplitude of the latter vanishes asymptotically , when the mesons , into which a tetraquark decays , separate . \n these are called _ hidden colour _ states by analogy to states which appear in the nucleon - nucleon problem , defined as a six - quark system  @xcite . \n the contribution of hidden colour states to the binding energy of light tetraquarks has been calculated explicitly in ref . \n below we shall point out their crucial role in the description of @xmath19 tetraquarks \n .      as the quarks and antiquarks are spin 1/2 particles the total spin of a tetraquark can be @xmath29 or 2 . for @xmath30 \n there are two independent basis states for each channel . \n the bases associated to ( [ diquark ] ) , ( [ directcolor ] ) and ( [ exchangecolor ] ) are @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for pseudoscalar and vector meson subsystems respectively and the lower index 0 indicates the total spin . \n the corresponding young tableaux for the states ( [ diquark0 ] ) are shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ]    ) . \n , width=226 ]    for @xmath33 there are three independent states in each channel , to be identified by three distinct young tableaux @xcite . as an example we give the basis for the direct meson - meson channel @xcite @xmath34 the lower index indicates the total spin 1 . \n the permutation property under transposition ( 13 ) manifestly is @xmath35 and similarly for ( 24 ) @xmath36 with the identification 1 = @xmath37 , 2 = @xmath38 , 3 = @xmath39 and 4 = @xmath40 the permutation ( 13)(24 ) is equivalent to charge conjugation , reason for which the basis vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 defined below have charge conjugation @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 have charge conjugation @xmath48 . \n the case @xmath49 is trivial . \n there is a single basis state    @xmath50    which is symmetric under any permutation of quarks . \n below we shall first briefly describe the diquark - antidiquark model and next we shall calculate the full spectrum of tetraquarks @xmath51@xmath52 in the framework of a simple model . \n the diquark model for tetraquarks , named also exotic mesons , has been attractive for some time already . \n one obstacle is to estimate the mass of the diquark . \n a simple consistent picture has been given by lichtenberg et al . \n @xcite . in that context \n the mass of @xmath53 with diquarks of spin 0 and 1 was 3910 mev and that of @xmath54 with diquarks of spin zero 3920 mev . \n the heavy - light diquark picture of maiani et al . \n @xcite is more sophisticated . \n it contains explicitly a hyperfine interaction between quarks ( antiquarks ) and the diquarks have spin zero or one in all cases . \n however the colour space is truncated to @xmath55 so that the number of basis vectors is twice less than that presented in the following subsection . \n quarks the approximation is better . ] \n accordingly there are only two basis vectors for @xmath56 , one for @xmath57 , two for @xmath58 and one for @xmath59 , so that in the tetraquark spectrum there are twice less states than in fig . 3 below . \n the narrow decay width is explained by a rearrangement and by a `` bold guess '' of the coupling constant @xmath60 . \n here we use the simple model of ref . \n @xcite in order to point out the important role of hidden colour channels introduced above . \n accordingly the mass of a tetraquark is given by @xmath61 where    @xmath62    the first term in eq . \n ( [ eq : mcm ] ) contains the effective masses @xmath63 which incorporate the conventional constituent mass plus the kinetic energy and the confinement potential contributions . \n the constants @xmath64 represent the integral in the coordinate space of some unspecified analytic form of the one gluon - exchange potential and of spatial wave functions . \n a fit within @xmath65 mev to properties of charmed baryons gave the following parameters    @xmath66    for a tetraquark the possible states are @xmath67 and @xmath59 . \n in each case a basis can be built with ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,4 ) as quark - antiquark subsystems where each subsystem has a well defined colour , singlet or octet . \n this arrangement corresponds to @xmath68 + _ light meson _ channel . \n other intermediate couplings can also be defined , as for example , ( 1,4 ) and ( 2,3 ) which can correspond to the @xmath69 channel , when the total spin allows . \n one can pass from one coupling to the other , depending on the problem one looks at and also , for convenience in the calculations . \n for the colour - spin basis states we shall use the notation introduced in the previous section , i. e. @xmath70 for colour singlet and @xmath71 for colour octet subsystems and @xmath72 and @xmath73 for spin 0 and 1 respectively .    for @xmath56 \n the basis constructed from products of states ( [ directcolor ] ) and ( [ directcolor0 ] ) is @xmath74 the chromomagnetic interaction hamiltonian with minus sign , -@xmath75 , acting on this basis leads to the following symmetric matrix + -20pt @xmath76@xmath76 for @xmath77 there are six linearly independent basis vectors built as products of colour ( [ directcolor ] ) and spin ( [ directcolor1 ] ) states . @xmath78 and @xmath79 have charge conjugation @xmath43 and the others @xmath48 . \n the 6 @xmath80 6 matrix of -@xmath81 can be found in ref . \n note that all matrix elements between states with opposite charge conjugation are naturally zero which means that the 6 @xmath80 6 matrix of ref . \n @xcite has a block - diagonal form . \n one block is the 2 @xmath80 2 submatrix for states of charge conjugation @xmath43 . \n this is + -20pt @xmath76@xmath76 which can be related to x(3872 ) . \n the other block is a 4 @xmath80 4 submatrix for states of charge conjugation @xmath48 , not written explicitly here , but which can be easily identified from ref . \n @xcite .    for @xmath59 \n the basis vectors are latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : deltai } \\hskip -10pt & \\delta_1 =    &   \\delta_2 =    @xmath49 spin state ( [ spin2 ] ) . \n the corresponding 2 @xmath80 2 matrix is + -20pt @xmath76@xmath76 in the calculation of the matrix elements we have used the equalities @xmath83 due to charge conjugation . \n one can extend the observation made in ref . \n @xcite , for @xmath84 to @xmath85 states as well , namely the matrices of both @xmath84 and @xmath85 are diagonal provided the chromomagnetic interaction is the same for a quark - quark pair as for a quark - antiquark pair , \n @xmath86 @xmath87 = @xmath88 . \n this implies that the eigenvectors are either a pure colour singlet - singlet or a pure colour octet - octet state . in each case \n the pure octet - octet state is the lowest and obviously can not dissociate into a charmonium state and a vector meson . \n but if one allows for a difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , see parameters ( [ eq : par ] ) , then the lowest state receives a small singlet - singlet component which can then decay into @xmath89 or @xmath90 with a small width . \n such a description is very suitable for @xmath1 which has a width @xmath91 mev ( 95 % c.l . ) \n @xcite . \n the states with @xmath92 can decay into @xmath93 + _ pseudoscalar meson _ as required by charge conjugation . \n there is no observation which can be associated to these states .    in fig . \n 3 we show the calculated spectrum with the parameters ( [ eq : par ] ) . these parameters were obtained from a fit to charmed baryons , but determined within @xmath9410 mev . \n this means that the levels in fig . \n 3 should be submitted to some uncertainties , not easy to be estimated . \n one can see that the 3910 mev @xmath84 level is close to @xmath1 but the 4057 mev @xmath85 level is about 100 mev above the observed @xmath2 resonance .    [ fig4 ]     tetraquarks , width=377 ] \n the work of ref . @xcite and \n its present extension suggests that the resonance x(3872 ) is an interesting candidate for the tetraquark @xmath95 . \n but the resonance x(3940 ) does not fit so well into this scheme as a @xmath96 state , its mass being 100 mev below the calculated value . for x(3872 ) further work is necessary . \n one has to quantitatively estimate the contribution of annihilation channels . \n also estimates of the strong decay widths are necessary before any definite conclusion . \n besides the chromomagnetic interaction , other effects may be important to the description of tetraquarks , as for example a long - range strong attraction between light quarks , generated by one - meson exchange . \n actually this is the basic mechanism of the molecular picture @xcite . \n a speculative discussion on an additional effect of the one - meson exchange interaction can be found in ref . \n @xcite      s.  k.  choi _ et al . _ [ belle collaboration ] , k+- phys . \n lett .   * 91 * , 262001 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0309032 ] \n . k.  abe _ et al . _ [ belle collaboration ] , exclusive phys . \n * 94 * ( 2005 ) 182002 [ arxiv : hep - ex/0408126 ] . \n b.  aubert _ et al . _ [ babar collaboration ] , around phys .  rev . \n lett .   * 95 * , 142001 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0506081 ] . \n d.  acosta _ et al . \n _ [ cdf ii collaboration ] , phys .  rev .  lett . \n * 93 * ( 2004 ) 072001 [ arxiv : hep - ex/0312021 ] . \n r.  k.  bhaduri , l.  e.  cohler and y.  nogami , nuovo cim . \n a * 65 * ( 1981 ) 376 . \n m. harvey , nucl . \n * a352 * ( 1981 ) 301 ; ibid . \n * a352 * ( 1981 ) 326 ; see also s. pepin and fl . \n stancu , phys . \n d * 65 * ( 2002 ) 054032 .", "StartTimeOffset": 761970120816, "RequestID": "bd3499a97c764786cf469675c1fba31d7bea91e2", "TotalTokens": 3855}

times charged ions in photoionized plasmas ( kingdon & ferland 1996 ) . \n surprisingly , modeling has also shown that ct on h of iron ions five - times charged and higher can significantly affect photoionized plasmas ( ferland et al . \n this may also hold for ions of other elements . \n total ct rates are needed for ionization balance calculations . \n state specific partial rates are needed for line emission predictions . \n most of the rates currently being used for plasma modeling have been calculated using a landau - zener ( lz ) approximation and are not expected to be reliable to better than a factor of @xmath4 , but the error may be even larger . \n recent laboratory measurements have shown lz calculations can be off by an order of magnitude ( thompson et al . \n much theoretical and experimental work is needed to provide reliable ct rates for modeling cosmic plasmas . \n dr rates at the low temperatures appropriate for photoionized plasmas are theoretically and computationally challenging . \n it is particularly difficult to calculate accurate resonance energies for dr resonances at electron - ion relative energies close to zero ev . \n laboratory measurements have consistantly found errors even in state - of - the - art theory for resonance energies and strengths below @xmath4  ev ( dewitt et al . \n 1996 ; schippers et al . 1998 ; schippers et al . \n 2001 ; savin et al . \n these near zero ev resonances often dominate the dr rate in photoionized plasmas . \n care also needs to be given to states which are forbidden to autoionize in ls coupling . \n recent measurements of dr onto c  iv have shown the importance at low temperatures of dr via these ls forbidden autoionizing states ( mannervik et al . \n 1998 ; schippers et al .  2001 ) . \n currently , the majority of dr rates for modeling photoionized plasmas come from older calculations . \n these rates , given the computational power available at the time and the theoretical approximations used to make the calculations tractable , are expected to be somewhat unreliable , particularly at low temperatures . \n this lack of reliable low temperature dr rates is one of the dominants uncertainties in the ionization balance in photoionized plasmas ( ferland et al . \n 1998 ) . \n modern calculational techniques can be used to produce the needed dr rates \n . however , given the discrepancies found between theory and experiment at low energies , it is clear that improvements to the theoretical techniques are called for . \n until these needed theoretical advances are achieved , the only way to produce reliable low temperature dr rates will involve a co - ordinated effort between laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations . \n many plasma diagnostics used for interpreting spectra of agn , h ii regions , and pne use eie - generated line emission from transitions between low - lying energy levels of various atomic ions ( osterbrock 1989 ) . \n the upper state in the observed transitions can be populated by direct eie ( a one - step processes ) or by resonant eie ( a two - step processes ) . particularly challenging to calculate \n is the contribution to the total eie rate due to resonant eie . \n this channel involves dielectronic capture to an excited ( autoionizing ) state of the recombined system which then autoionizes to the upper level of interest in the initial ion . \n this indirect excitation process is the dominant population mechanism for many important transitions . \n for example , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 transition within the valence shell , calculations carried out including resonance effects can yield eie rates over an order of magnitude larger than calculations which do not account for resonances ( oliva , pasquali , & reconditi 1996 ) . for situations where resonance eie is important , reliable eie rates requires knowing the position of those autoionizing levels lying within @xmath7  ev of the ground state ( oliva et al . \n 1996 ) . accurately determining these resonance energies is extremely challenging theoretically and experimentally . \n reliable energy levels are important for modeling and interpreting spectra from stellar winds of hot stars . bound - bound photoabsorption transitions between 800 and 1300   can dramatically affect stellar spectrum ( hillier 2001 ) and type ia supernovae spectra ( pauldrach et al . \n a significant number of these transitions are due to states involving electrons in @xmath8 levels , up to @xmath9 in some situations ( kurucz 2001 ) . \n for many ions , no accurate measured wavelengths exist for the corresponding transitions . \n theoretical energy levels must be used and the resulting wavelengths can be shifted by @xmath10    or sometimes more ( haser et al . \n once the energy levels are reliably known , then improved ( photoabsorption ) oscillator strengths can be calculated . \n of all the cosmically - abundant heavy metals in stellar atmospheres , iron has the richest spectrum . \n of particular importance for understanding stellar atmospheres and wind are states involving @xmath11 levels in fe iv , v , and vi . \n the article by hillier ( 2001 ) in this conference proceedings briefly discusses and demonstrates the importance of these high - lying levels in models of stellar winds from o stars . \n the majority of pi cross sections currently used by astrophysicists for valence shell electrons come from opacity project ( op ) calculations ( opacity project team 1995 ) \n . the op energy levels are uncertain by 1 - 2% ( verner , barthel , & tytler 1994 ) . \n this translated directly into uncertainties in the resonance structure of the pi cross section and can introduce significant uncertainties when calculating pi rates due to spectral lines ( verner et al . \n accurate knowledge of this resonance structure is particularly important in the wavelength regions around h i ly@xmath0 , he i k@xmath0 , and he ii ly@xmath0 , as well as near other astrophysically important lines . to reduce the effects of accidental coincidences between resonances and spectral lines , \n op results are often averaged over resonances ( verner et al . \n 1996 , kallman & bautista 2001 ) . \n it is also worth noting that the op assumption of @xmath12-coupling is not satisfactory for closed shell systems ( verner et al . \n 1994 ) . \n recent laboratory advances have finally allowed pi measurements of valence shell for a few astrophysically important singly- and doubly - charged ions ( e.g.  kjeldsen et al .  1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) . \n reasonable agreement has been found between theory and experiment for most of these systems . \n but for fe ii , which is one of the astrophysically most important ions ( viotti , vittone , & friedjung 1988 ) , significant discrepancies remain ( kjeldsen 2000 ) . \n innershell pi of ions plays an important role in determining the ionization and thermal structures and line emission of x - ray photoionized plasmas . \n the innershell pi cross sections currently used for modeling these plasmas have been calculated using a hartree - slater central field approximation ( reilman & manson 1979 ; verner et al . \n the calculations do not account for any of the structure in the pi cross section near the innershell ionization thresholds . \n to date , these calculations have been benchmarked only with measurements on atoms . \n multielectron ionization can occur as a result of innershell pi . \n this is due to auger processes which occur as the electronic structure of the ion relaxes to fill the innershell hole . \n auger yields are currently estimated using theoretical and experimental results for atoms from the early 1970 s ( kaastra & mewe 1993 and references therein ) . \n these estimates have never been tested for ions and their reliability is highly questionable . \n shortcomings in our current theoretical and experimental capabilities in atomic physics as well as a lack of available atomic data hinder our ability to infer reliably the properties of many cosmic plasmas . \n this in turn limits our ability to address many of the fundamental issues in astrophysics . in order to help improve the situation , we have attempted to list here some of the most glaring atomic data needs for a better understanding of photoionized cosmic plasmas . \n it is our hope that this review will help to guide the future research of theoretical and experimental atomic physicists . \n given the current resources being devoted to removing the above described uncertainties in our understanding of atomic physics , it seems likely that it will require decades to remove these uncertainties and provide data needed by the astrophysicists . \n the author thanks gary ferland , d.  john hillier , kirk korista , and bob kurucz for helpful suggestions regarding this article . \n dws is supported by nasa space astrophysics research and analysis program grant nag5 -

mello spectra . \n evidently a term with this period deserves further investigation .      at the next step \n we had applied the wavelet analysis to all the nutation series to investigate the time variations of the fcn period ( phase ) and amplitude , which is the main goal of our study . for this analysis we used program wwz , developed by the american association of variable star observers and available as executable at the http://www.aavso.org/cdata/wwz.shtml . \n theoretical background of this method can be found in  @xcite . \n the results of the wavelet analysis are presented in figures  [ fig : wwz_up][fig : wwz_ea ] . \n figure  [ fig : wwz_mean ] presents the final results of the present investigation . \n it should be mentioned that based on the comparison of fcn amplitudes found here and previous investigations @xcite , we consider the results obtained before 1990 seems to be not very reliable .    of course , an important question arising from the obtained result is whether the variations of the period found from our analysis is an actual geophysical signal or an artifact caused by inadequate computational procedures . \n one can see that large increasing of the fcn period after @xmath11998 corresponds to relatively low amplitude of the fcn oscillation . \n we have performed some tests to estimate how result of wavelet analysis depends on variable amplitude of input signal .    for test purposes we used several artificial signals , and also we constructed new series as original one normalized by found variations of the fcn amplitude . \n the latter provides the fcn contribution series with near - unity amplitude with all other peculiarities inherited from real nutation series . \n the variations of the period found for the test series are practically the same as for real data . \n after all test , our conclusion is that found variations of the fcn period can not be explained by computational errors . \n besides , the results of spectral analysis made for different subset of data also corroborate our conclusion .    one of the important points to be investigated is the edge effect which may lead to misinterpreting of the results of the wavelet analysis for the first and the last epochs . for this purpose \n we performed a special test with wwz . \n we computed the fcn period and amplitude variations for several series starting with original one and cutting the first and the last 200 points from it . \n then this process was repeated and in that way four test series were obtained , each starts 200 days later and ends 200 days earlier than previous one . \n figures [ fig : wwz_edge_p ] and [ fig : wwz_edge_a ] show the result of this test .    from this test \n , we can conclude that the edge effect may affect the result at the first and the last 5001000 days of the interval under investigation . \n evidently , this fact should be accounted for to determinate the start point for prediction of the fcn contribution to nutation . \n variations of the fcn amplitude found in this investigation are close to ones used in the mhb2000 model , except the edge intervals ( see figure  [ fig : ampcomp ] ) \n . a reasons of these discrepancies may be insufficient quality of the vlbi data in the earlier 1980th and the edge effect present in the wavelet analysis results , as discussed above .    as a supplement test \n , we computed variations of the fcn amplitudes immediately from the vlbi series . for this purpose \n we used the smoothed differences between observed nutation angles and model described above . \n taking into account that the fcn contributions in @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two projections of the same variations in the earth rotation velocity , we can compute the fcn amplitude as @xmath4 . \n figure  [ fig : ampl_ma ] shows the result of comparison . comparing figures [ fig : ampcomp ] and [ fig : ampl_ma ] \n one can see that the direct computation of the fcn amplitude shows better agreement with the mhb2000 model . \n we can expect that amplitude estimates obtained with wwz method are not good enough at the edges of the time interval ( see also the discussion of the edge effect in wavelet analysis above ) . \n comparison of the fcn phase variations found in this study and computed from the amplitudes of sine and cosine fcn terms of the mhb2000 model is presented in figure  [ fig : phasecomp ] , after removing the linear phase change corresponding to the fcn with permanent period . \n one can see that the fcn phase variations are similar in two approaches , though ours provides more smooth variations , and so for the fcn period variations . \n the fcn period ( phase ) most likely varies with time . \n probably , change in the period is physically connected with change in amplitude . on the other hand \n , one can see that the variations of the fcn period show clear periodicity with a period about 5 years , whereas variations of the fcn amplitude does not show such an effect . \n another reason of the observed behavior of the fcn period maybe variability of the fcn phase . \n analogous effect was found also at the chandler frequency @xcite , for which dependence of the period on amplitude , and the phase jump occurred during the period of the lowest amplitude were also found . \n it is interesting , that the chandler wobble period also decreased in @xmath119861988 , and increased in @xmath119891996 ( see @xcite ) \n . unfortunately , polar motion series studied in those papers are much shorter than one analyzed here to perform a reliable comparison .    variations of fcn amplitudes show several possible epochs of the excitation of the fcn , most of them are close to ones detected in @xcite . \n some tests we performed allow us to make a conclusion that investigated nutation series really contain such a signal with variable amplitude and period ( phase ) . \n however , as stated above , we interpret the differences between observed nutation and the iau2000a model as the fcn contribution , which may be too strong assumption . \n possible interference of the fcn and other nutation frequencies should be carefully investigated . \n in particular , the authors of @xcite pointed out a possible interference with near - yearly nutation terms , but the investigated period of observations seems to be long enough to separate these frequencies by spectral and wavelet analysis . \n authors are grateful to prof . \n vineamin vityazev for useful advices on the spectral and wavelet analysis and t.  shirai for fruitful discussion on fcn issues .", "StartTimeOffset": 787696092804, "RequestID": "1ccb46074f62046b6194dc6689bbe86852137811", "TotalTokens": 2603}

{"ContextTokens": 3994, "GeneratedTokens": 71, "SynthesizedBody": "the rayleigh - taylor instability  @xcite ( rti ) is an instability of an interface between two fluids in a metastable state . for instance , \n when a layer of a heavier fluid is laid on a lighter fluid , the system is energetically unfavorable and the two fluids tend to exchange their positions . \n however , if the two fluids are immiscible and their interface is flat , the exchange can not occur without breaking the translation symmetry of the interface . \n once an infinitesimal modulation arises on the interface , it exponentially grows due to the rti , and the interface develops into complicated patterns such as a mushroom -

mass growth at different cosmic times . in the study of near- and mid - ir - selected galaxies , deep \n data have had a major role in the following aspects : 1 ) the determination of optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , 2 ) the computation of precise ( @xmath3 ) photometric redshifts , as a complement to existing spectroscopic redshifts and 3 ) galaxy morphology . \n the two former aspects have been of key importance to conduct complete studies of galaxy luminosity evolution and stellar mass assembly . \n an important landmark in the study of near -

south field , indicating that these objects must be very rare ( if any exists ) at very high redshifts @xcite . \n moreover , during the last years , a general consensus has been achieved on the redshift evolution of the total stellar mass density : half of the stellar mass has been assembled in galaxies before the universe was 30 -

ir galaxy populations in the general context of galaxy evolution . \n after _ iso _ set the first constraints on the mid - ir universe up to redshift @xmath26 , _ spitzer _ has allowed us to prove that mid - ir galaxies have in fact a significant contribution up to higher @xmath27 redshifts , e.g.@xcite . \n a sort of ` downsizing ' effect is observed in the typical stellar masses of the galaxies hosting the bulk of ir activity : at @xmath28 , most of the ir activity is found in @xmath29 $ \\sim$}}~}10^{11 } \\ , \\rm m_\\odot$ ] galaxies , while at @xmath30 , an important fraction of the ir activity is concentrated in intermediate -

ir lf strongly evolves from @xmath32 to 1 @xcite@xcite . \n but , after removing to our best current knowledge the agn contribution at high redshifts , the mid - ir lf associated with star formation shows only a modest evolution from @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xcite . \n this is reflected in the observed evolution of the bolometric ir ( @xmath21 ) luminosity density , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] . from this figure , \n it is clear that the amount of energy associated with on -

i.e. @xmath20 if @xmath21 denotes the energy of the non - linear capacitance , then @xmath22    the circuit version of eq.(3 ) is that @xmath23 the circuit eq.(12 ) is pictured in fig . \n i. in the landau - khalatnikov circuit , the upper capacitor carries a charge @xmath24 while the lower non - linear capacitor carries a charge @xmath25 and voltage @xmath26 determined by the thermodynamic eq.(11 ) . the resistance \n @xmath27 describes the dissipation present when the polarization varies with time . \n hysteretic cycles are measured applying a time varying voltage of the form @xmath28 for the case of the landau energy shown in fig .  2 \n , @xmath29 where the saturation polarization @xmath2 determines @xmath30 eqs.(12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) read @xmath31    in order to solve eq.(16 ) numerically , let us introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) now read @xmath34 one seeks solutions to eq.(18 ) which are periodic @xmath35 for example , let us suppose that at an initial time zero @xmath36 after a numerical integration through one period of motion , one then finds that @xmath37 eqs.(18 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) define the function @xmath38 . \n it is possible to analytically compute @xmath39 in two limits : @xmath40 @xmath41    a sufficient condition for existence of periodic eq.(19 ) solutions of eq.(18 ) is that @xmath42 be a fixed point ( solution ) of the equation @xmath43 if eq.(24 ) has a unique solution for @xmath44 , than there exists a unique periodic solution of eq.(18 ) . \n if eq.(24 ) had more than one solution for @xmath44 , then there will be ( in general ) more than one periodic solution to eq.(18 ) . \n the number of solutions for @xmath44 depends on the values of parameters in the @xmath45 plane . \n in this section we consider the region in the @xmath46 plane for which the following conditions hold true : ( i ) eq.(24 ) has a unique solution for @xmath44 and ( ii ) there there exists a unique periodic solution for @xmath47 . a hysteretic loop located in the @xmath48 plane \n may be found by eliminating the time parameter @xmath49 in a one period interval @xmath50 from the parametric equations @xmath51    in fig .  3 , we have plotted two hysteretic loops corresponding to the same frequency but with different driving voltage amplitudes . \n the inner smaller hysteretic loop corresponds to a smaller driving voltage than that of the outer larger hysteretic loop . in fig . \n 4 we have plotted two hysteretic loops corresponding to the same voltage amplitude but with different frequencies . \n the inner smaller hysteretic loop corresponds to a lower frequency than that of the outer larger hysteretic loop .    since the large amplitude and high frequency loops have a larger enclosed area than do the small amplitude and low frequency loops , it is not at once evident how to extract the coercive voltage directly from hysteretic loop data . \n this is a well known problem in attempting to measure the coercive electric field forcing a polarization flip . \n the nature of the problem becomes evident from a study of the effective circuit in fig .  1 . \n the _ theoretical _ `` coercive voltage '' @xmath52 is that voltage across the lower branch non - linear capacitor present at the time when the polarization flips . \n the _ experimental _ \n `` coercive voltage '' @xmath53 includes the voltage across the resistor . \n it is not an easy matter to separate the dissipative voltage from the thermal capacitor voltage .    in order to understand the `` area '' enclosed by the hysteresis loop in the @xmath48 plane , \n one notes that the thermodynamic work performed by the non - linear capacitor during one cycle is given by @xmath54 which is also ( via the first law of thermodynamics ) the heat dissipated by the resistor @xmath19 during the cycle . \n the area enclosed by the hysteretic loop is large or small , respectively , when the dissipated heat in the resistor is large or small .    in order to understand \n the role of dissipative heating in more detail , multiply eq.(10 ) by the current @xmath55 and integrate the result over time for one cycle ; i.e. @xmath56 the first term on the right hand side of eq.(28 ) obeys @xmath57 we then see directly that the work done by the non - linear capacitor during one cycle must be dissipated as heat in the resistor ; i.e. eqs.(26 ) , ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) imply @xmath58 thus , a large applied voltage amplitude and/or a large applied voltage frequency yield a large area loop because more heat is dissipated per cycle by the resistor . \n from the parity symmetry of the energy equation of state @xmath59 , the are two possible thermal _ equilibrium _ minimum energy states at @xmath60 in the absence of a driving voltage . for a _ small driving amplitude _ \n @xmath61 in eq.(13 ) , we then expect two possible periodic charge response functions @xmath62 @xmath63 on the other hand , for a _ large driving amplitude _ \n @xmath61 in eq.(13 ) , we expect a unique periodic charge response functions @xmath64 \n @xmath65    in terms of the dimensionless variables in eq.(17 ) , @xmath66 one expects the two regimes to be described by a dynamical bifurcation function @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 we have numerically computed @xmath67 and the results are plotted in fig . \n the regions in the @xmath70 plane are exhibited corresponding to the symmetric and broken symmetry dynamical phases . in the broken symmetry phase , \n there are two possible hysteretic curves ; @xmath71 is localized in the neighborhood of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is localized in the neighborhood of @xmath74 .    for a more clear picture of the bifurcation@xcite boundary curve at @xmath75 \n we show a sequence of hysteretic loops in fig . \n 6 . for @xmath76 , \n we have chosen four values for the amplitudes @xmath77 . \n explicitly @xmath78 for illustrations of broken symmetry , and @xmath79 for illustrations of unbroken symmetry . \n the two ovals in both fig . \n 6(a ) and fig . \n 6(b ) correspond , respectively , to @xmath80 for the values @xmath81 and @xmath82 . \n the symmetry is broken because only _ one _ of the ovals ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 but not both ) will appear in an experiment described by the model . \n the oval in the unbroken symmetry phase corresponding to @xmath85 is unique but does not appear very similar to conventional hysteretic curves . by increasing the amplitude to @xmath86 \n a conventional looking hysteretic loop appears in fig . \n it has been shown that the landau - khalatnikov model of ferroelectric hysteresis has a very rich dynamical structure . \n only a small part of the symmetric dynamical phase had been reported in standard literature . \n the conventional looking hysteretic curves are present theoretically and experimentally only in the regime of high driving amplitudes . \n the region in the neighborhood of the bifurcation into the broken symmetry phase has received little or no experimental attention . \n the numerical simulations of this work indicate what is to be expected . \n experimental measurements of the dynamical bifurcation curve @xmath87 of ferroelectrics would be of great interest in checking the validity of the landau - khalatnikov model . \n further insights on how to measure the coercive voltage can be obtained by driving the circuit in fig .  1 with a voltage source which has both dc and \n ac components @xmath88 the dc voltage component @xmath89 can be put into the energy function via @xmath90 leaving eq.(12 ) in the form @xmath91    the advantage of employing a dc component is now evident . \n the symmetry breaking of the energy in fig \n .  2 will now be controlled by varying the dc voltage . \n the dc offset will allow for precise measurements of the coercive field . \n 99 mrs bull . \n * 21 * , 7 ( 1996 ) . \n m. w. j. prins , k .- o . \n grosse - holz , g. mller , j. f. m. cillessen , j. b. giesbers , r. p. weening and r. m. wolf _ appl . \n lett . _ * 68 * , 3650 ( 1996 ) . \n m. w. j. prins , s. e. zinnemers , j. f. m. cillessen and j. b. giesbers , _ appl . \n * 70 * , 458 ( 1997 ) . \n y. t. kim and d. s. shin , _ appl . \n * 71 * , 3507 ( 1997 ) . \n b. dickens , e. balizer , a. s. dereggi and s. c. roth , _ j. appl \n * 64 * , 5092 ( 1988 ) . \n j. c. hicks and t. e. jones , _ ferroelectrics _ * 32 * , 119 ( 1981 ) . \n s. ikeda , s. kobayashi and y. wada , _ \n * 23 * , 1513 ( 1985 ) . \n a. k. kulkarni , g. a. rohrer , s. narayan and l. d. mcmillan , _ ferroelectrics _ * 116 * , 95 ( 1991 ) . \n d. b. a. rep and m. w. j. prins , _ j. appl . \n * 85 * , 7923 ( 1999 ) . \n a. sheikholeslami and p. \n g. gulak , _ ieee trans . \n . control _ * 43 * , 450 ( 1996 ) . \n a. sheikholeslami and p. g. gulak , _ ieee trans . \n . control _ * 44 * , 917 ( 1997 ) . \n d. e. dunn , _ ieee trans . ultranson . \n . control _ * 41 * , 360 ( 1994 ) . \n chung and h .- \n kim , _ ferroelectrics _ * 198 * , 1 ( 1997 ) . c. b. swayer and c. h. tower , _ phys . \n rev . _ * 35 * , 269 ( 1930 ) . \n s. l. miller , r. d. nasby , j. r. schwank , m. s. rodgers and p. v. dressendorfer , _ j. appl . phys . \n _ * 68 * , 6463 ( 1990 ) \n . s. l. miller , j. r. schwank , r. d. nasby and m. s. rodgers , _ j. appl . \n phys . _ * 70 * , 2849 ( 1991 ) . \n a. vladimirescu , _ the spice book . _ \n ( wiley , new york . 1994 ) . \n l. d. landau and i. m. khalatnikov , _ dok . \n nauk sssr . \n _ * 46 * , 469 ( 1954 ) . \n s. machlup and l. onsager , _ phys . \n rev . _ * 91 * , 1505 ( 1953 ) . \n s. machlup and l. onsager , _ phys . \n rev . _ * 91 * , 1512 ( 1953 ) . \n y. makita , i. seo and m. sumita , _ j. phys . \n * 28 * , suppl . 268 \n r. seydel , _ practial bifurcation and stability analysis . from equilibrium to chaos _ second edition ( springer interdisciplinary applied mathametics , 1994 ) \n . g. bertotti , a. magni , i. d. matyergoyz , c. serpico , _ j. appl . \n _ * 89 * , 6710 ( 2001 ) . \n g. gumbs and mirsoslav , _ j. appl \n . phys . _ * 73 * , 5479 ( 1993 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 830285388780, "RequestID": "2fb650a9a8946b94189b137d28e6136343ff22e5", "TotalTokens": 3746}
{"ContextTokens": 2902, "GeneratedTokens": 240, "SynthesizedBody": "thanks to the progress of telescope technology and the detection technique of recent years , it is expected that we will meet with a situation where a large scale of high - quality data is continuously generated by such as subaru telescope , sloan digital sky survey an so on . the way of traditional analysis , however , appears to be insufficient for using the large amount of data effectively and efficiently and getting the maximum scientific results . \n although many people recognize the importance of research that uses the multi - wavelength data , such research actually needs considerable effort . \n one reason is that , for each data set , one needs to learn how to reduce and analyze the data , and even needs to know where the analysis tools are available . \n to overcome such situation and maximize the scientific return from a big project like subaru and alma , it is important to construct an environment where user can access to the science - ready data with very few effort . \n national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) started its vo project ( japanese virtual observatory \n jvo ) in 2002 . \n the objectives of the jvo project are to provide a seamless access to the distributed data service in the vo , and to provide user - friendly analysis environment . \n this paper describes our recent progress on the second objective . \n , is an optical - infrared 8.2  m telescope operated by national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) at mt . \n mauna kea hawai . \n subaru has seven open use instruments : ciao , comics , focus , ircs , suprimecam , hds and moircs . \n cisco is no longer available for open - use . using these instruments , \n observation can be made for wavelengths from optical ( 300 nm ) to infrared ( 20 @xmath0 m ) with spectrum resolution up to @xmath1 ( hds ) . \n the total amount of public data for each instrument is shown in figure  [ fig : totalamount ] . \n as of october 2006 , 8 tb of data is archived in the public area . \n more than 70% of the data are from the suprimecam , which is a mosaic of ten 2048 @xmath2 4096 ccds and covers a 34 x 27 field of view with a pixel scale of 0.20  . \n more than 90% of all the data requests are for the suprimecam , so our current priority issue is how to improve the usability of the suprimecam data . \n figure  [ fig : subaruarchive ] shows the flow of data taken by the subaru . \n the data are registered in the subaru telescope archive system ( starts ) as soon as the data are acquired by the instruments , so an observer retrieves his data from stars during and/or after the observation . \n the data of stars is mirrored to the mitaka advanced stars ( mastars ) , so the observer can retrieve the data also from the mastars . \n starts and mastars are not public data archive . to use the system , you need to get an account on the subaru computing system for stars or an account on the mitaka computing system for mastars . \n the data that passed 18 months of a proprietary period becomes publicly available through the , and system . \n the smoka system provides various query modes for the subaru archive , and it is described in enoki et al . \n the jvo system provides a vo standard access interface to the subaru archive . \n currently only the data of suprimecam is available from the jvo . \n the amount of data , especially of suprimecam , is very large , so it is important to provide a way to analyze the data without moving the data to a remote users machine . \n one of the ways to do so is to login to the subaru or mitaka computing system and analyze the data on the machine . \n it is , however , not practical to use the visualization tool from a remote machine , especially when accessing through a slow network . \n another solution is to provide a web service , through which one can access to the data analysis software and visualize the data in a compact graphical format such as gif , jpeg and png . recently \n a lot of open source framework are available for making such a service , and it has been realized that interactivity of the web based service can be improved by using ajax technique as demonstrated by the google map service . another important point is to provide the data in a form that detector and environment dependencies are removed . \n those dependencies are usually not known by an archive user , so it should be properly reduced by a data provider . \n the quality of the data reduction is improved as the experience is accumulated and the reduction software is also evolves continuously , so it is adequate to reduce the data on demand with the most developed algorithm . \n it is also important to provide the way to reduce the data with older version software for assuring data reproducibility to enable later same analysis . by providing the data in such a manner , \n a data provider can control the quality of data by putting a tag representing a version of reduction software in the fits header . \n the reduction process is hidden from a user , and the user does not need to take care about most of part of data reduction . \n so , we have decided to provide such a service on the japanese virtual observatory ( jvo ) web portal . \n the data reduction processes are concentrated on the jvo servers , so computing resources need to be integrated in a scalable manner to the jvo . \n we have developed a web service based grid computing system . \n this system is composed of four services : monitoring and discovering service ( mds ) , data analysis service ( das ) , data search service ( dss ) and storage service ( srs ) . figure  [ fig : subarupipeline ] shows an example of suprimecam response ( flat frame ) calculation system , which is showing how each service interacts each other . \n the mds manages the status of each das , and schedules the job submission requested by a grid client . \n each das server periodically report its status , such as load average , number of running job and job status , and the status is stored on an mds database . \n a grid client queries to the mds to ask which server is free for a job submission . \n the mds returns a service endpoint url that is appropriate for the job submission . \n the client submit the job , and wait it to finish . \n while waiting , the client periodically polling to the mds for querying the job status . \n the das sends a query to the dss to get subaru raw data , the dss returns the urls for the data , the das retrieves the data and starts analysis . \n when a job status is changed to `` finish '' , the client queries the das for an url to retrieve the result . \n the url is passed to the srs , the result is stored on the storage of the srs , and the metadata of the result is registered on the dss . \n the interactions between each service and client are made by exchanged a soap message . \n the interface of each service is defined in the web service description language ( wsdl ) . \n several examples of the defined interfaces are described in java interface as follows :    .... mds interface     void reportstatus(string hostid , double load , int njob )     serviceinfo resolveservice(string serviceid )     void reportjobstatus(string hostid , int jobid , string status )     string getjobstatus(string hostid , int jobid )     ...    das interface     int submitjob(string command , string argv )     string getresulturl(int jobid )     string query(int jobid )     string finalize(int jobid )     ...    srs interface     int copyasync(string src , string dest )     void copy(string src , string dest )     void finalize(int jobid )     ...    dss interface     vodata performquery(select select )     ... ....    the ` reportstatus ` interface is used by a das server to report its load average and the number of submitted jobs . \n the ` resolveservice ` interface is used by a grid client to decide which server to submit a job . \n the returned ` serviceinfo ` contains an endpoint url . \n the ` submitjob ` interface is used to submit a job to the das server , which returns a job i d and it is used for polling the job status . \n the ` getresulturl ` interface returns an access url for retrieving the result . \n the ` copyasync ` and ` copy ` interface are used to transfer data between two servers or just to copy the data inside the same server . \n the former interface is used for data transfer that is expected to take long time . \n the ` performquery ` interface is used for querying the data by astronomical data query language ( ) , and return the result in format .    a web form based gui for calculating a response frame of suprimecam ccd is made for easy job submission as shown in figure  [ fig : subaruflat ] . \n the * observation * section of the gui is used for browsing the number of exposures for each filter on each day . the observation period for calculating a response frame \n is determined here . usually select a period of successive suprimecam observations , which typically lasts one week . at the section of * \n create flat calibration frames * , one can select a filter and/or a chip for which a flat calibration frame is calculated . after submitting the jobs \n , the job status can be viewed at the section of * job status*. the status changes from `` running '' to `` data transfer '' and then to `` finished '' if an error does not happen . \n the mds server manages a database that contains static information ( host name , ip address , cpu type , memory size ) and status ( load average , number of submitted jobs , living and enabled flags ) of each das server , which can been seen on the mds web page as shown in figure  [ fig : mds ] . \n the living flag stays `` true '' while the mds are receiving a hear beat message from the das server . \n when a successive five minutes of disconnection happens , the flag changes to `` false '' , and the server is recognized as `` unavailable '' . \n the `` enabled '' flag is used to prohibit the job submission to the server . when the flag is `` false '' , a job is not submitted to the server . \n the japanese virtual observatory ( ) is a vo portal service , which federates the distributed vo services and provides data analysis environment through a web browser . \n jvo is especially going to provide analysis environment utilizing the subaru data . \n the subaru data currently available on the jvo are : subaru deep field catalog ( sds , sxds ) , suprimecam chip image , and suprimecam mosaic image . \n we are preparing to provide reduced data of the other subaru instruments . \n we are also going to implement the data analysis interface for : reduction of raw data with user specified parameters , image manipulation , spectrum fitting , catalog creation from a image , and so on . \n these data analysis will be executed on the server side , so any plugin tools are required to be installed on the user s machine . \n we are going to integrate the grid computing system described above to the jvo portal so that enough amount of computing resource is provided to a user . \n an overview of the jvo system is shown in figure  [ fig : overviewjvo ] . \n the details of the jvo system were described in elsewhere ( shirasaki et al . \n 2006 ,

{"ContextTokens": 2996, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "the analysis of fine structure lines is crucial to interpret ir observations of ultra - compact  regions , giant  regions and starburst galaxies in terms of their stellar content . through photoionization modeling the nature of the ionizing sources of  regions and properties of starburst regions such as the age and the imf ( slope , upper mass - cutoff ) \n can in principle be determined . \n considerable progress has been made in the recent year in this respect through the use of new stellar fluxes , spectral energy distributions appropriate for evoling stellar populations at different metallicities and including detailed observational constraints ( e.g.  garcia - vargas et al . \n 1995 , 1997 , stasiska & leitherer 1996 , stasiska & schaerer 1997 , gonzlez - delgado et al . \n none of these studies have , however , focussed on ir observation which are now becoming widely available thanks to iso .    in this contribution we present exploratory results regarding predictions of ir lines from two sets of recent photoionization models : _ 1 ) _ single star  regions using the latest ionizing fluxes from non - lte , line blanketed atmospheres including stellar winds (  models , schaerer & de koter 1997 ) and , _ 2 ) _ photoionization models for evolving starburst populations based on the leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) synthesis models . \n detailed results from new photoionization models for starbursts including the  models and updated stellar tracks will be presented elsewhere . \n in figure 1 we illustrate the behaviour of the line ratios of some important fine structure lines observable in the sws range and with isocam / cvf . \n this figure , based on the model calculations of stasiska & schaerer ( 1997 , hereafter ss97 ) , shows the dependence of the line ratios on the stellar temperature and  importantly  also on the ionization parameter . \n the comparison between the top and bottom row shows the differences obtained using either the recent  atmosphere models or kurucz plane parallel lte models . due to the harder spectrum predicted by the  models above @xmath0 35 - 40 ev ( schaerer & de koter ) a _ higher excitation _ \n is generally predicted for a given  than with kurucz models ( see ss97 ) . \n evidence supporting such an increase of the hardness of the ionizing flux comes from the kao observations of rubin and coworkers ( cf.simpson et al . \n 1995 ) . indeed , the  models including stellar winds , non - lte effects and line blanketing are thereby able to provide a satisfactory description of the ne@xmath1/o@xmath1 ionic fractions ( see ss97 , also sellmaier et al . \n 1996 ) .    encouraged by these successes atmosphere models including the most relevant physical processes ( stellar winds , non - lte , blanketing ) continue to be improved . \n see e.g.  pauldrach ( 1997 ) and schaerer ( 1997 ) for recent progress reports . \n in addition more stringent tests using iso observations of nebulae with well known ionizing sources would be extremely valuable . \n detailed photoionization modeling including constraints on the nebular geometry and likely also their dust content will be necessary to achieve such a goal .    in fig .  2 we plot the predictions for single star  regions for some quantities of interest for the interpretation of integrated populations discussed later . \n the middle and right panels show the ratio of luminosity in the lyman continuum ( assuming an average photon energy of 16 ev ) @xmath2 to the  and  line luminosity respectively . \n it is useful to understand the behaviour of the /  12.8/33.5 ratio ( left ) since either of these lines is sometimes used as a proxy in case the other line is unobservable ( cf . \n genzel et al .  1998 ) . \n indeed for a given  one obtains a relatively small variation ( @xmath0 1 dex ) of /  with the ionization parameter . in all our `` reference models '' ( constructed assuming a gas density of 10 @xmath3 ) we predict /  @xmath4 1 . for stars with  @xmath5 36 \n kk the differences between the  and kurucz fluxes become non - negligible for /. \n some implications of these finding are briefly discussed below . \n ir fine structure lines provide a new tool to study the hot star population of obscured starbursts . through comparisons with photoionization modeling this allows in particular to constrain the star formation history and the upper end of the initial mass function ( e.g.  lutz et al .  1998 ) . \n empirical diagnostic diagrams based on ir lines also allow the distinction between starburst and agn powered sources ( genzel et al . \n theoretically these diagnostics remain , however , to be understood and quantified .    to address such questions photoionization models representing evolving starbursts at different metallicities are nowadays required . in the following \n we will briefly illustrate some predictions from such models for fine structure lines in the iso lws range . \n the predictions shown here are drawn from the models of stasiska & leitherer ( 1996 , hereafter sl96 , available by anonymous ftp from ftp.obspm.fr/pub/obs/grazyna/cd-crete ) . \n detailed results from new photoionization models for young starbursts based on the most recent evolutionary synthesis models of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) including the latest geneva stellar tracks and  model atmospheres ( cf.above ) will be presented elsewhere .    in figure 3 \n we show the computed temporal evolution of the line ratios of /  12.8/15.5 , /  8.9/6.9 , and /  10.5/18.7 ( all top row ) for an instantaneous burst at 1/4 solar metallicity with a salpeter imf and @xmath6  surrounded by a gas cloud of density n=10 @xmath3 . \n different symbols represent models with different ( initial ) ionization parameters : typically one has @xmath7 ( circles ) to @xmath8 ( crosses ) . \n note that in photoionization models of evolving starbursts , the dependence of @xmath9 with time is a function of the adopted geometry , as stressed by stasiska ( 1998 ) . in the models of sl96 , @xmath9 decreases slightly with time . \n as expected the excitation decreases with the age of the burst . \n it must , however , be reminded that the considered lines also strongly depend on the ionization parameter ( see fig . \n 3 ) . indeed \n the line ratios shown here vary typically by three orders of magnitudes for variations of @xmath9 of 4 orders of magnitudes . for comparison a change of the upper mass - cutoff from 50 to 100 increases the same line ratios by less than one order of magnitude ( e.g.  lutz et al . \n 1998 ) . in general @xmath9 is poorly constrained . \n although optical spectra of  galaxies can be reproduced with models covering only a fairly small range of @xmath9 ( @xmath0 1 dex , sl96 ) this is not necessarily the case for iso observations of starburst galaxies . \n this question needs a careful analysis before meaningful results can be derived on the imf , age etc . \n genzel et al . \n find an empirical value of + /  @xmath10 1.7 @xmath11 1.3 ( or 1.2 @xmath11 0.6 excluding the two largest outliers ) from their sample of 10 starbursts . \n the sl96 models constructed with a density of n=10 @xmath3 typically predict  @xmath4 ( this is true also for solar metallicity models , not shown here ) . \n however , the sl96 models with n@xmath12 @xmath3 reach /  of 1.5 , due to collisional deexcitation of . \n the electron densities deduced from  18.7/33.5 for a subset of starburst galaxies from the genzel et al . \n sample are typically @xmath13 , so it seems that collisional deexcitation is not sufficient to explain the large /  observed . \n among possible factors to reduce the discrepancy are an ne overabundance ( which however needs to be understood in more detail ) , or a softer ionizing radiation field . \n we conclude that the empirical value /@xmath0 1.7 for starbursts used in the diagnostic diagrams of genzel et al . \n ( 1998 ) is theoretically not well understood yet . for comparisons of the lyman continuum luminosity @xmath2 to the bolometric luminosity of starbursts , ulirgs , etc . \n it is interesting to be able to derive @xmath2 from the ir fine structure lines . \n this requires , however , some empirical calibration or the use of models . `` empirical '' values of @xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath14@xmath16 are obtained from the starburst sample of genzel et al .  excluding ngc 5253 , which shows much larger values . \n it must be reminded that @xmath2 is derived from the brackett recombination lines assuming case b and an average photon energy of 16 ev , and neglecting the absorption of lyc photons by dust . \n our model predictions show in fig .  3 ( mid / right bottom panels ) for the instantaneous burst model show quite a wide range for the @xmath17line ratios , depending on age and ionization parameter . \n although these idealised models ( instantaneous burst ) are not necessarily representative for the average starburst population observed through the iso aperture it is instructive to compare our predictions with the `` observed '' values of genzel et al . in any case the predicted values of @xmath14@xmath18 are systematically larger than the empirical starburst value even for the oldest age considered here . using the  model atmospheres will even further increase the predicted value given their harder energy distribution with respect to the kurucz ones . \n the @xmath14@xmath18 ratio shows a better agreement with the average value from genzel et al . \n this is consistent with the discrepancy between the model predictions for /  and the observations discussed earlier . \n most probably , the lyc luminosities derived from the observations are underestimated because they do not take into account dust absorption of lyc photons . \n more detailed analysis are required to obtain consistent a consistent picture of the fine structure lines in such objects . \n we have illustrated the impact of the recent  ionizing fluxes on ir fine structure lines for single star  regions and shown predictions of ir lines for evolving starbursts resulting from calculations of extensive grids of photoionization models ( see sl96 , ss97 ) .    as shown earlier , \n ionizing fluxes from non - lte , line blanketed atmospheres including stellar winds predict a harder spectrum ( schaerer & de koter 1997 ) leading to higher excitation in the nebula . \n these predictions are supported by comparisons with optical and pre - iso ( kao ) ir observations of  regions ( ss97 and references therein ) . \n detailed models of ultra - compact  regions or  regions with well - known stellar content based on iso observations and other observational constraints will be extremely useful to better constrain the atmosphere models and probe the importance of other effects ( e.g.  dust ) usually neglected in photoionization models . \n such studies also provide important tests for our understanding of more complex objects like starbursts .    for starbursts \n we have illustrated the behaviour of line ratios which can in principle be used to constrain burst properties such as the age , imf slope and upper mass - cutoff . \n we have also studied the behaviour of the /  ratio and diagnostics of @xmath2 from fine structure lines extensively used by genzel et al . \n we have shown that a thorough analysis of the properties of the _ nebular _ gas ( ionization parameter , geometry , dust content , total amount of gas ) is needed for reliable determinations of the _ stellar _ content of the nebulae observed by iso . \n garca -

dyson ( sd ) equation approach . \n recent investigations @xcite@xcite of euclidean pure su@xmath11 yang - mills theory in the lorentz gauge show @xmath12 the transverse gluon propagator vanishes , while the fp ghost propagator is enhanced in the infrared limit @xmath13 . \n that is , the ghost propagator behaves more singularly than the free propagator in low energy region . \n these results mean the ir ghost dominance . \n this is consistent with the well - known gribov prediction and the confinement criterion due to kugo and ojima . \n but these results are strongly dependent on approximations in the calculation . \n simple bare vertex approximation fails to reproduce 1-loop perturbative result . \n this situation is very different from the case of fermion sd equation . \n in addition to the approximation ambiguity , we pay attention to the in the uv propagators which may come from ope ( @xmath14 condensate ) or renormalon or some other non -

penington projection @xmath17 to remove a tadpole graph . \n next , we neglect all 2-loop diagrams and adopt higashijima - miransky approximation to the internal propagators .    thus the relevant sd equations become @xmath18{ghost_sdeq.eps } \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath18{gluon_sdeq1loop.eps } \\end{array}\\ ] ] \n at this stage , in addition to propagators @xmath15 and @xmath19 , the vertices @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unknown . in the landau gauge , the ghost - gluon vertex @xmath20 does not have divergence . \n so our main attention directs to approximate @xmath21 .    in the investigations @xcite \n @xcite @xcite @xcite , various ansatz are adopted to @xmath21 . in @xcite @xcite , the bare or the slavnov - taylor ( st ) improved vertex is adopted . \n this procedure is similar to the case of fermion sd . in @xcite @xcite , \n improved vertices are used to reproduce the uv 1-loop perturbative result correctly where free parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are introduced in @xcite . it does not change uv leading exponent . \n bloch @xcite used a similar ansatz derived from his own argument based on multiplicative renormalizability . \n but in their cases , infrared solutions become very delicate in the sense that whether ghost dominance property is realized or not depends on the choice of parameters or the effect of 2-loop diagrams . \n the simple bare vertex approximation can not reproduce even the 1-loop perturbative result , while the ir solutions are very sensitive to the choice of vertex correction . in order \n to get rid of this difficulty , we consider the higher logarithmic terms in the uv asymptotic solution . \n we are interested in the  non - perturbative \" power correction terms too .    to obtain the solutions \n , we define the gluon form factor @xmath24 and the ghost one @xmath19 by multiplying @xmath25 to the propagators .    for the uv asymptotic solutions , we adopt the new ansatz which has logarithmic ( perturbative ) powers and power ( non - perturbative ) corrections as @xcite @xmath26    we use the two parameter ansatz @xcite for the renormalized triple gluon vertex @xmath27 simply introducing parameters makes a result more ambiguous . in our approach , new parameters will be automatically determined by considering subleading solutions and ope consistency . \n we put these into sd equations , and get infinite series of algebraic equations with respect to coefficients @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 and parameters @xmath33 . \n we first find that without power corrections ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) the ansatz can not satisfy the coupled sd equation for large @xmath25 , even if we include the logarithmic corrections @xmath36 . \n a self -

mills in landau gauge for the ansatz using power and logarithmic expansion . \n contrary to the fermion sd case , the bare vertex approximation can not reproduce the uv solution consistent with the uv perturbation and the uv ope . \n we have found the consistent solution by considering the uv higher order corrections .    using the same vertex ansatz ( 4 ) determined as above , we have obtained also the ir solutions which have the same form as the power - law solutions [ 6 ] : @xmath53 . \n therefore the existence of non - perturbative power correction does not influence the ir solution . \n ir ghost dominance is realized , and the color confinement criterion of kugo and ojima is satisfied . \n 9 f.v  gubarev and v.i . \n zakharov , phys.lett . \n b501 , 28 -

see also luck et al 2003 ) . \n the former find a spread in [ fe / h ] of 0.4 dex , which they argue is real , the latter focus on investigating galactic abundance gradients ( @xmath10  dex / kpc ) . \n luck et al ( 1998 ) have measured the iron abundance of 16 cepheids in the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc and smc , respectively ) with the echelle spectrograph at the ctio 4 meter telescope . \n the relatively small size of the telescope forced them to choose only stars at the bright end of the period - luminosity relation , _ \n i.e. _ long periods , whereas the entire range needs to be sample in order to reach meaningful conclusions on the @xmath0 relation ( e.g. kennicut et al 1998 , caputo et al 2000 ) . \n as for the _ indirect measurements _ in external galaxies ( e.g. kochanek et al 1997 , kennicutt et al 1998 ) , which probe a broader range in metallicity than the one available in the galaxy , they find that metal - rich cepheids are _ \n brighter _ in @xmath5 and @xmath6 than metal - poor ones by @xmath11 to @xmath12 magnitudes per dex in metallicity . \n these results have been widely used in the literature , including in the final paper of the hst key project on @xmath1 ( freedman et al 2001 ) . \n with the scenario described above in mind , we have collected high quality spectra of an unprecedented dataset of 40 galactic , 22 lmc and 14 smc cepheids with the aim of measuring metallicity directly on a statistically significant sample of stars covering about one order of magnitude in chemical composition . \n the galactic stars were observed with feros at the eso 1.5 m telescope on la silla at a spectral resolution of 48,000 with a signal - to - noise ratio of about 70 to 150 . as for the spectra of the magellanic cloud objects \n , we used the uves spectrograph on the kueyen telescope on cerro paranal , yielding a resolution of 40,000 and signal - to - noise ratio of about 50 to 70 . \n deriving metallicities for cepheids is by no means a trivial task , but we have now carefully analyzed and derived [ fe / h ] for an initial subsample of 14 cepheids in the lmc , 12 in the smc and 6 in the galaxy . \n the data reduction procedures and analysis are described in detail in mottini et al ( 2003 ) . \n the main result from the subset analyzed so far is summarized in figure  1 . there , we plot the v - band residuals from the standard madore & freedman ( 1991 ) @xmath0 relation as a function of the iron abundance derived from feros and uves spectra . \n a positive magnitude difference here means that the star is fainter than the mean @xmath0 relation . for consistency with the adopted @xmath0 relation , \n the lmc is assumed to have a distance modulus of 18.50 . \n the smc is considered 0.44  mag more distant ( e.g. cioni et al 2000 ) and the distances to galactic stars were taken from fouqu et al ( 2003 ) , barnes et al ( 2003 ) and tammann et al ( 2003 ) . \n photometry and reddening are taken from laney & stobie ( 1994 ) . \n the data are binned in metallicity to reflect the typical observational error on our determination ( @xmath13  dex ) . \n the magellanic cloud cepheids populate the bins at lower metallicity , the higher [ fe / h ] one containing only galactic stars . \n the median magnitude residual in each bin is plotted as a square and the rms and error on the median are shown as boxes and errorbars , respectively . \n the magnitude difference plotted on the ordinates can be directly compared to the _ `` c '' _ quantity computed by fiorentino et al ( 2002 ) . \n this is the correction to be applied to the distance modulus derived using a universal , metallicity independent @xmath0 relation to take into account the influence of metallicity as derived from their non - linear pulsation models . \n the agreement between our data and the predictions by fiorentino et al ( 2002 ) , indicating a strong dependence of the @xmath0 relation on metallicity , is tantalizing , even though the errorbars are still somewhat large . as it can be seen , the error on the inferred distance can be as large as 10% if the effect of metallicity is neglected .", "StartTimeOffset": 860250239586, "RequestID": "8fb1e27eb9b04e3e0f5bb497b70ced64f98ea67e", "TotalTokens": 1896}

{"ContextTokens": 3692, "GeneratedTokens": 122, "SynthesizedBody": "almost all low mass stars are born in binary systems ( reipurth & zinnecker @xcite ; ghez et al . \n @xcite ; kohler & leinert @xcite ) , which are themselves often part of larger stellar clusters ( clarke , bonnell & hillenbrand @xcite ) . in some well - studied star forming regions , such as taurus - auriga , these are merely loose aggregates of young stars ( gomez et al . \n @xcite ) , which may be expected to have little influence on the evolution of protoplanetary discs . \n this is not , however , the case in richer clusters  of which orion is the nearby prototype  where the radiation and winds from massive stars have a dramatic impact on the local environment ( palla & stahler @xcite ; johnstone & bertoldi @xcite ; chevalier @xcite ) . \n planet formation in the discs around low mass stars in such clusters can not then be considered in isolation . \n observations of discs in orion suggest that photoevaporation in the radiation field of the massive stars is likely to be the dominant process leading to the destruction of discs ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) . in this paper , \n i assume that this is the case , and discuss the implications for planet formation in clusters of varying richness . \n the basic conclusion is that the formation of giant planets in clusters richer than orion is likely to be heavily suppressed , _ unless _ either they form from prompt hydrodynamic collapse ( e.g. boss @xcite ) , or there is a substantial delay between the onset of low mass and high mass star formation . \n preliminary indications from a _ hubble space telescope _ \n search for planetary transits in the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( gilliland et al . \n @xcite ; brown et al . \n @xcite ) , in which the fraction of giant short - period planets appears to be at least an order of magnitude below the value in the solar neighbourhood ( marcy & butler @xcite ) , are consistent with this conclusion ( provided , of course , that we assume that planet - bearing stars in the solar neighbourhood were _ not _ themselves formed within rich clusters ) . \n with hindsight , however , numerous plausible explanations for the deficit of planets in this dense , low metallicity system are likely to be forthcoming ( see e.g. bonnell et al . \n theoretical estimates suggest that there is no reason why protoplanetary discs around isolated low mass stars should not survive for lengthy periods , especially if the rate of angular momentum transport ( and hence accretion ) within the disc is reduced due to the low ionization fraction at a few au ( matsumoto & tajima @xcite ; gammie @xcite ; armitage , livio & pringle @xcite ) . \n although estimates of the ages of pre - main - sequence stars are subject to significant uncertainties ( tout , livio & bonnell @xcite ) , some low mass stars ( @xmath0 ) do appear to retain their discs for more than 10 myr ( strom @xcite ; brandner et al . \n the disc lifetime is found to be much shorter for more massive stars ( strom @xcite ) , and this , coupled with the observation of substantial mass loss rates from discs in the orion nebula ( mccullough et al . \n @xcite ; johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ; and references therein ) , suggests that photoevaporation of the discs is an important process that can lead to their destruction ( for a review see e.g. hollenbach , yorke & johnstone @xcite )    photoevaporation of discs has been extensively studied , both when the source of ionizing radiation is the central star ( shu , johnstone & hollenbach @xcite ; hollenbach et al . \n @xcite ) , and for the case relevant here where the radiation field arises externally ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ; strzer & hollenbach @xcite ) . in the simplest analysis , ultraviolet radiation heats the disc surface , raising the sound speed to @xmath1 . beyond a radius , \n @xmath2 the heated gas is unbound and flows away as a thermal wind . \n both lyman continuum euv photons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and less energetic far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation ( @xmath5 ) can contribute to disc mass loss . \n however , for @xmath6 , fuv - driven flows ( for which the sound speed in the heated layer is @xmath7 , as compared to @xmath8 for euv - driven flows ) have @xmath9 that is substantially larger than the radii of principal interest for planet formation . in this paper \n we therefore concentrate on euv - driven mass loss , while noting that the effects of fuv radiation will also be important for lower mass stars . \n to estimate the strength of ultraviolet radiation in clusters of varying richness , we first need the emission from an individual star . for stars with @xmath10 , we obtain the luminosity and effective temperature @xmath11 from stellar models computed by schaller et al . \n ( @xcite ) for a metallicity @xmath12 ( for these purposes , differences in metallicity are of secondary importance ) . \n we use the model output closest to @xmath13 , which should be appropriate for young clusters of any age given the very short pre - main - sequence phase of the massive stars that dominate the uv flux . the model output \n is then combined with theoretical stellar atmosphere models by kurucz ( e.g. buser & kurucz @xcite ) to yield the euv and fuv output as a function of stellar mass . \n [ fig1 ] shows the euv and fuv luminosity as a function of stellar mass . a negligible fraction of the total flux is emitted in the euv by stars with @xmath14 , which corresponds to a mass @xmath15 . \n the fraction of flux in the euv band then rises roughly linearly with increasing @xmath11 to @xmath16 of the total for @xmath17 stars with @xmath18 . \n significant fluxes of fuv radiation are produced by lower mass stars with @xmath19 .    for a standard mass function \n the most massive stars are rare . \n [ fig1 ] also shows which stars dominate the output of euv and fuv radiation in a cluster . \n we assume a kroupa , tout & gilmore ( @xcite ) mass function for @xmath20 , and a salpeter ( @xcite ) form , @xmath21 , for higher masses . \n both the fuv and ( especially ) the euv flux is expected to be dominated by the most massive star in a cluster .    using this mass function , with a low mass cutoff at @xmath22 , and a high mass cutoff at @xmath23 , we generated realizations of clusters with number of members @xmath24 ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . \n [ fig2 ] shows the resultant integrated euv luminosities . \n the median luminosity rises steeply for smaller clusters , which do not fully sample the high mass end of the mass function , and becomes linear only for larger clusters with @xmath27 . \n the dependence of the luminosity on the single most massive star that a cluster happens to have implies a large dispersion in the integrated luminosity . \n the range of luminosities that encompasses 90% of the probability distribution spans almost 3 orders of magnitude at @xmath28 , and is still a factor of @xmath29 at @xmath30 . \n this implies that otherwise similar clusters in which the maximum stellar mass varies can have widely different uv environments , leading to substantial dispersion in the predicted lifetimes of circumstellar discs . \n the theory of euv - driven flows from discs provides a prediction for how the mass loss rate scales with the flux of ionizing photons . in the simplest analysis , \n the mass loss rate for a disc of fixed radius , at distance @xmath31 from a source emitting a flux of ionizing photons @xmath32 , scales as ( bertoldi & mckee @xcite ; johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) , @xmath33 more sophisticated analysis are available ( strzer & hollenbach @xcite ; richling & yorke @xcite ) , but are hardly warranted here given the uncertainties .    to calibrate the predicted disc lifetime , we make use of the results obtained in orion . the most massive star in the orion trapezium , @xmath34 ori c , has a mass estimated at around @xmath35 ( hillenbrand @xcite ) . \n both this mass , and the estimated ionizing flux in orion of the order of @xmath36 , fall withing the range expected for clusters with @xmath37 . within orion , \n one of the best studied evaporating discs , hst 182413 , at a projected distance of 0.12 pc from @xmath34 ori c , has an estimated mass loss rate @xmath38 . \n the disc radius @xmath39 is @xmath40 , and the estimated disc mass @xmath41 ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) . \n this disc mass is consistent with the upper end of the distribution of disc masses inferred from mm - wavelength observations by osterloh & beckwith ( @xcite ) . for this object , \n the characteristic disc lifetime is therefore @xmath42 .    for planet formation , \n we are interested in smaller discs than that which presently surrounds hst 182413 . \n these will have smaller mass loss rates , which in the case of euv - dominated flows scale as @xmath43 ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) . scaling to a solar system sized disc ( 30 au ) , and assuming conservatively that the mass remains similar to that of hst 182413 , we obtain @xmath44 as a simple estimator of the disc survival time for @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \n this estimate of the time available for planet formation before the disc is destroyed is certainly crude , and in particular ignores completely the effects of angular momentum transport in the disc . \n however , viscosity will tend to _ hasten _ disc destruction by moving material to larger radii where it can be lost via photoevaporation more easily . \n [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the predicted disc lifetime on the size of the cluster , for discs located at distances @xmath31 from the principal source of ionizing radiation . for smaller clusters \n this will typically be a single massive star , while for rich clusters with @xmath47 or larger several stars will contribute . \n we assume that , as in orion , these stars are formed near the cluster centre ( bonnell & davies @xcite ) , and thus can be treated as a single radiation source . \n if in reality the massive stars were instead distributed throughout the cluster , that would result in a _ \n larger _ volume over which significant ablation of discs would occur . \n similarly , mixing of the cluster over timescales shorter than the disc lifetime increases the fraction of stars whose discs are affected by photoevaporation .    by construction , the dependence shown in fig . \n [ fig3 ] is consistent with a destruction timescale of a few @xmath48 yr in the inner ( @xmath49 pc ) part of orion near @xmath34 ori c. it is also consistent with observed disc lifetimes of a few myr , extending upwards to more than @xmath50 yr , in poor clusters with just a few hundred members . \n a large dispersion in disc lifetime is expected in this case .    for clusters richer than orion , the volume over which photoevaporation significantly curtails the disc lifetime grows . for large @xmath24 , @xmath51 , and the volume within which mass loss is significant scales as @xmath52 . \n thus , for rich clusters , a larger fraction of the discs will be ablated by the action of the radiation field , even if the central cluster density remains constant . for @xmath53 , \n the disc lifetime is expected to be severely curtailed ( less than a few @xmath48 yr ) out to distances of the order of 1 pc , and to be significantly reduced ( to @xmath54 yr , an order of magnitude below the value inferred for isolated discs ) , out to distances of perhaps 3  5 pc .      in the solar system , \n the observation that the gas fraction of the outer planets varies substantially has been taken to imply that these planets formed at roughly the epoch when the gas disc was being dissipated , probably at about a few @xmath55 yr ( e.g. shu , johnstone & hollenbach @xcite ; strzer & hollenbach @xcite ) . \n a few myr is also the typical theoretical estimate for the time required for a growing core at 5 au to reach a mass where it can rapidly accrete gas from the disc in a runaway manner ( pollack et al . \n somewhat shorter timescales are derived if the cores initially migrate inwards through the gas disc , but subsequently halt and accrete the gas at smaller radii ( papaloizou & terquem @xcite ) . \n these timescales suggest that a disc lifetime of @xmath56 yr might well pose difficulties for giant planet formation , at least in some theoretical models , while lifetimes closer to @xmath26 yr would very probably preclude giant planet formation . from fig . \n [ fig3 ] , this suggests that giant planet formation will be strongly suppressed in clusters with @xmath57 stars out to around 1 pc , and possibly at substantially larger radii . \n we also note that since short period planets ( analagous to that orbiting 51 peg ) are unlikely to have been formed _ in situ _ \n ( bodenheimer , hubickyj & lissauer @xcite ) , the disc must survive for a significant additional time , subsequent to planet formation , to allow inward migration through the gas disc ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson @xcite ) . some additional reduction in the frequency of such systems would then result . \n low mass planets are largely unaffected by these considerations . indeed , since rapid inward migration through the disc \n can substantially deplete the population of such objects ( e.g. ward @xcite , and references therein ) , the rapid removal of the gas could in principle even enhance the initial frequency of low mass planets in clusters . \n the conclusion that rapid disc destruction in clusters severely reduces the probability of planet formation can be evaded in two ways . \n first , massive planets might form from the disc via direct hydrodynamic collapse ( e.g. boss @xcite , @xcite ; cameron @xcite ) . \n if this process occurs at all , it is most likely at very early times when the disc is massive and vulnerable to gravitational instability . \n a detection of massive planets around systems where the disc lifetime was very short would constitute indirect but persuasive evidence for the importance of this process . \n second , if there is a significant delay between the epoch of low mass and high mass star formation , planets could have time to form before the discs began to be exposed to ionizing radiation . in orion , observations suggest that at least some low mass star formation appears to have been underway well before the formation of the high mass members of the cluster ( palla & stahler @xcite ) , while in some theoretical models for high mass star formation prior low mass star formation is a necessary ingredient ( bonnell , bate & zinnecker @xcite ) . more generally , \n unless star formation in a cluster is somehow synchronized to better than the sound crossing time of the gas in the star forming region , there is bound to be some spread in the times at which stars form . since high mass stars are relatively scarce , this would typically lead to some low mass stars in the cluster forming well before the first massive star turns on and begins the process of disc destruction . \n as searches for extrasolar planets extend beyond the immediate solar neighbourhood , it will become possible to study how the frequency and properties of extrasolar planetary systems depend upon the star formation environment . in this paper , i have argued that in what may be the typical setting for star formation ( clarke , bonnell & hillenbrand @xcite )  a cluster containing a mix of high and low mass stars \n photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs severely limits the time available for giant planet formation . \n observations indicate that discs are being rapidly destroyed by this process within a few tenths of a pc of orion s trapezium , and the effect will be stronger in richer clusters . for a cluster of @xmath26 stars , \n the disc lifetime is likely to be significantly reduced when compared to that of discs around isolated stars , out to a distance from the cluster centre of several pc . \n unless planets form contemporaneously with the disc itself ( boss @xcite ) , or there is a significant delay ( perhaps @xmath56 yr or more ) between the epochs of low mass and high mass star formation , the fraction of stars in rich clusters with massive planets is likely to be small . \n this provides both a possible explanation for the apparent dearth of massive , short - period planets in 47 tucanae ( gilliland et al . \n @xcite ; brown et al . \n @xcite ) , and suggests that planet formation could also be noticeably suppressed in substantially less dense clustered environments .", "StartTimeOffset": 879485860452, "RequestID": "dcfe1622d22d4a151f269e9332c1afd49c104a95", "TotalTokens": 3814}

{"ContextTokens": 3123, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "during the last years , many systems have been analyzed from the perspective of graph theory @xcite . \n it turns out that seemingly diverse systems such as the internet , the world wide web ( www ) , metabolic and protein interaction networks and food webs , to mention a few examples , share many topological properties @xcite . among these properties , \n the fact that one can go from one node ( or element ) of the network to another node passing by just a few others is perhaps the most popular property , known as `` six degrees of separation '' or small - world ( sw ) property @xcite . \n the sw feature has been shown to improve the performance of many dynamical processes as compared to regular lattices ; a direct consequence of the existence of key shortcuts that speed up the communication between otherwise distant nodes and of the shorter path length among any two nodes on the net @xcite . \n however , it has also been recognized that there are at least two types of networks fulfilling the sw property but radically different as soon as dynamical processes are ran on top of them . \n the first type can be called `` exponential networks '' since the probability of finding a node with connectivity ( or degree ) @xmath0 different from the average connectivity @xmath1 decays exponentially fast for large @xmath0 @xcite . \n the second kind of networks comprises those referred to as `` scale - free '' ( sf ) networks @xcite . \n for these networks , the probability that a given node is connected to @xmath0 other nodes follows a power - law of the form @xmath2 , with the remarkable feature that @xmath3 for most real - world networks @xcite . \n the heterogeneity of the connectivity distribution in scale - free networks greatly impacts the dynamics of processes that they support . \n one of the most remarkable examples is that an epidemic disease will pervade in an infinite - size sf network regardless of its spreading rate @xcite . \n the change in the behavior of the processes is so radical in this case that it has been claimed that the standard epidemiological framework should be carefully revisited . \n this might be bad news for epidemiologists , and those fighting natural and computer viruses . \n on the other hand , in a number of important technological and commercial applications , it is desirable to spread the `` epidemic '' as fast and as efficient as possible , not to prevent it from spreading . \n important examples of such applications are epidemic ( or rumor - based ) protocols for data dissemination and resource discovery on the internet @xcite , and marketing campaigns using rumor - like strategies ( viral marketing ) . \n the above applications , and their dynamics , have passed almost unnoticed @xcite to the physics community working on complex networks despite the fact that they have been extensively studied by computer scientists and sociologists @xcite . \n the problem here consists of designing an epidemic ( or rumor - mongering ) algorithm in such a way that the dissemination of data or information from any node of a network reaches the largest possible number of remaining nodes . \n note that in this case , in contrast to epidemic modeling , one is free to design the rules of epidemic infection in order to reach the desired result , instead of having to model an existing process . \n furthermore , in a number of applications , such as peer - to - peer file sharing systems @xcite built on top of the internet and grid computing @xcite , the connectivity distribution of the nodes can also be changed in order to maximize the performance of such protocols .    in this paper \n we study in detail the dynamics of a generic rumor model @xcite on complex scale - free topologies through analytic and numerical studies , and investigate the impact of the interaction rules on the efficiency and reliability of the rumor process . \n we first solve the model analytically for the case of exponential networks in the infinite time limit and then introduce a stochastic approach to deal with the numerical solution of the mean - field rate equations characterizing the system s dynamics . \n the method @xcite is used to obtain accurate results for several quantities when the topology of random sf networks is taken into account , without using large and expensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . \n section ii is devoted to introducing the rumor model and to derive the mean - field rate equations used throughout the paper . in section \n iii we deal with the stochastic approach , and compare its performance with analytical and mc calculations in homogeneous systems . we extend the method to the case of power - law distributed networks and present the results obtained for this kind of networks in section iv and v. finally , the paper is rounded off in the last section , where conclusions are given . \n the rumor model is defined as follows . \n each of the @xmath4 elements of the network can be in three different states . \n following the original terminology and the epidemiological literature @xcite , these three classes correspond to ignorant , spreader and stifler nodes . \n ignorants are those individuals who have not heard the rumor and hence they are susceptible to be informed . \n the second class comprises active individuals that are spreading the rumor . \n finally , stiflers are those who know the rumor but that are no longer spreading it . \n the spreading process evolves by directed contacts of the spreaders with others in the population . \n when a spreader meets an ignorant the last one turns into a new spreader with probability @xmath5 . \n the decay of the spreading process may be due to a mechanism of `` forgetting '' or because spreaders learn that the rumor has lost its `` news value '' . \n we assume this latter hypothesis as the most plausible so that the contacting spreaders become stiflers with probability @xmath6 if they encounter another spreader or a stifler . \n note that as we are designing our rumor strategy in such a way that the fraction of the population which ultimately learns the rumor be the maximum possible , we have assumed that contacts of the type spreader - spreader are directed , that is , only the contacting individual loses the interest in propagating the rumor further . \n therefore , there is no double transition to the stifler class .    in a homogeneous system , \n the original rumor model due to daley and kendall @xcite can be described in terms of the densities of ignorants , spreaders , and stiflers , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , as a function of time . besides , we have the normalization condition , @xmath10 in order to obtain an analytical insight and a way to later test our numerical approach , we first study the rumor model on top of exponentially distributed networks . \n these include models of random graphs as well as the watts and strogatz ( ws ) small - world model @xcite . \n this model produces a network made up of @xmath4 nodes with at least @xmath11 links to other nodes . \n the resulting connectivity distribution in the random graph limit of the model @xcite takes the form @xmath12 which gives an average connectivity @xmath13 . \n hence , the probability that a node has a degree @xmath14 decays exponentially fast and the network can be regarded as homogeneous . \n the mean - field rate equations for the evolution of the three densities satisfy the following set of coupled differential equations : @xmath15 , \\label{eq3}\\\\   \\frac{d r(t)}{d t } & = & \\alpha { \\langle k \\rangle}s(t ) [ s(t)+r(t ) ] , \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the initial conditions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the above equations state that the density of spreaders increases at a rate proportional to the spreading rate @xmath5 , the average number of contacts of each individual @xmath1 and to the densities of ignorant and spreader individuals , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively \n . on the other hand , the annihilation mechanism considers that spreaders decay into the stifler class at a rate @xmath19 times the density of spreaders and of non - ignorant individuals @xmath20 . \n the system of differential equations  ( [ eq2]-[eq4 ] ) can be analytically solved in the infinite time limit when @xmath21 . using equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) , we have that @xmath22 . introducing the new variable @xmath23 we obtain the transcendental equation \n , @xmath24    equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) always admits the trivial solution @xmath25 , but at the same time it also has another physically relevant solution _ for all _ values of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n this can be easily appreciated since the condition , @xmath26 reduces to @xmath27 . \n that is , there is no `` rumor threshold '' contrary to the case of epidemic spreading @xcite . \n this strikingly different behavior does not come from any difference in the growth mechanism of @xmath8 @xmath28the two are actually the same@xmath28 , but from the disparate rules for the decay of the spreading process . \n on the other hand , this result also points out that a mathematical model for the spreading of rumors can be constructed in many different ways . \n the results of this paper , however , indicate that the presence of spreader annihilation terms due to spreader - spreader and spreader - stifler interactions is very relevant for practical implementations @xcite . \n we shall come back to this point later on . \n recently @xcite , we have introduced a numerical technique @xcite to deal with the mean - field rate equations appearing in epidemic - like models . \n it solves the differential equations by calculating the passage probabilities for the different transitions . \n the main advantage of this method , as compared to mc simulations , is its modest memory and cpu time requirements for large system sizes . besides \n , we do not have to generate any network . \n instead , we produce a sequence of integers distributed according to the desired connectivity distribution @xmath29 . \n the numerical procedure here proceeds as follows . at each time step until the end of the rumor spreading process , the following steps are performed :    .density of stiflers at the end of the rumor spreading process . \n results are shown for 5 different values of @xmath6 for each method considered . \n monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were performed in a ws network with @xmath30 and @xmath31 nodes . \n the same system size was used in the stochastic numerical approach ( sna ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figs . \n [ figure4 ] and  [ figure5 ] we have represented the time ( in units of @xmath32 ) profiles of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for each decay term and several values of @xmath6 . from the figures , \n it is clear that while the final density of stiflers increases when modifying the original decay rules , the time needed to reach such high levels of reliability also increases . \n this is due to the fact that the tails of the densities of spreaders decay more slowly than before . in particular , it is noticeable that when only spreader - spreader interactions are taken into account in the decay mechanism , the lifetime of the propagation process is more than two times longer than for the other two settings . \n this means that this implementation is not very suitable for practical applications as the costs associated to the process rise as well . on the other hand \n , the performance of the spreader - stifler setting seems to depend on the value of @xmath6 in such a way that it is more efficient at both the reliability level and time consumption for a large @xmath6 , but not in the middle region of the parameter space . in summary \n , the present results support that the original model works quite well under any condition , while other variants can be considered depending on the value of @xmath6 used and the type of applications they are designed for . \n in this paper , we have analyzed the spreading dynamics of rumor models in complex heterogeneous networks . \n we have first introduced a useful stochastic method that allows us to obtain meaningful time profiles for the quantities characterizing the propagation process . \n the method is based on the numerical solution of the mean - field rate equations describing the model , and contrary to monte carlo simulations , there is no need of generating explicitly the network . \n this allows to save memory and a fast exploration of the whole evolution diagram of the process . \n the kind of processes studied here are of great practical importance since epidemic data dissemination might become the standard practice in multiple technological applications . \n the results show that there is a fragile balance between different levels of reliability and the costs ( in terms of time ) associated to them . in this sense , \n our study may open new paths in the use of rumor - mongering process for replicated database maintenance , reliable group communication and peer to peer networks @xcite . \n besides , as shown here , the behavior and features of the different algorithms one may implement are not trivial and depend on the type of mechanisms used for both the creation and the annihilation terms . \n it is worth noting here that we have studied the simplest possible set of rumor algorithms , but other ingredients such as memory must be incorporated in more elaborated models @xcite .    of further interest \n would be a more careful exploration of the possibility of using dynamical shortcuts for a more efficient spreading of the updates . \n our results suggest that it would be more economic to start from hubs and then kill off the updating process when a given level of reliability is reached than starting at random and letting the process dies out by itself . \n preliminary studies of more elaborated models aimed at implementing a practical protocol confirm our results @xcite . \n this feature is specially relevant for the understanding and modeling of social phenomena such as the spreading of new ideas or the design of efficient marketing campaigns . \n we would like to thank a.  vespignani for many useful discussions and comments . \n y.  m.  thanks m.  vzquez - prada for helpful comments and the hospitality of bt exact , u.k . where parts of this work were carried out . \n y.  m.  acknowledges financial support from the secretara de estado de educacin y universidades ( spain , sb2000 - 0357 ) . this work has been partially supported by the spanish dgicyt project bfm2002 - 01798 . \n a. j. demers , d. h. greene , c. hauser , w. irish , and j. larson , _ epidemic algorithms for replicated database maintenance_. in proc . of the sixth annual acm symposium on principles of distributed computing , vancouver , canada , 1987 \n .                            note that for the @xmath35 variant , the initial conditions should include the existence of at least one stifler . \n this has been taken into account by randomly selecting a node among all the remaining ignorants . \n hence the initial conditions are now @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .", "StartTimeOffset": 896805283194, "RequestID": "2ae4a493b1580fc77a59abf9c25577dccf744af4", "TotalTokens": 3255}

@xcite ) . \n secondly , co measurements by @xcite indicate a very low expansion velocity ( about 2.5kms@xmath5 ) , which led them to label l@xmath0  pup as an extreme case , with one of the smallest expansion velocities ever measured for an agb star . the slow wind from l@xmath0  pup led @xcite to suggest that this star could represent their b - model , in which mass loss is driven entirely by pulsations , without any significant input from radiation pressure on dust grains \n this has been further discussed by @xcite , who modelled the mass loss and suggested that the pulsations may be non - radial . \n thirdly , as we report here , this star has shown a remarkable change in mean visual magnitude over the past century , and is currently undergoing a dramatic dimming . \n we present visual and infrared photometry which characterizes this behaviour , and argue that the most likely cause is the formation of dust along the line of sight . \n we also present the first 10-micron spectrum of l@xmath0  pup , obtained with the japanese irts satellite , which shows strong silicate emission . \n we have analysed visual observations of l@xmath0  pup from the following sources : the royal astronomical society of new zealand ( rasnz ; 12100 measurements by 110 observers , including 1100 by a.  jones ) , the variable star observers league in japan ( vsolj ; 792 measurements by 6 observers ) and the association francaise des observateurs detoiles variables ( afoev ; 389 measurements by 3 observers ) . \n only data from individual observers contributing 30 or more observations were used and we did not attempt to correct for offsets between observers . \n the top panel of fig . \n [ fig.wavelet ] shows the combined data , binned to 10-day averages . \n the variation in mean magnitude is evident . before 1945 \n the data are too patchy and/or noisy to reach strong conclusions . \n however , it is clear that the star faded significantly after 1960 , recovering around 1975 but remaining fainter by about 0.5 mag compared to the 1950s . \n recently , starting around 1994 , a dramatic fading has occurred . even at maximum , \n the star now remains fainter than magnitude  6 , and it is no longer a naked - eye variable .    we have used wavelet analysis to search for period and amplitude changes . \n wavelets have been used previously to study long - period variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we used the weighted wavelet z - transform ( wwz ; @xcite ) , developed specifically for unevenly sampled data . \n we experimented with different values for the parameter @xmath6 , which defines the tradeoff between time resolution and frequency resolution @xcite , and settled on @xmath7 as a good compromise . \n more details of the application of the wwz transform to long - period variables are given by @xcite . \n the lower three panels of figure  [ fig.wavelet ] show the wavelet plots for l@xmath0  pup , based on the light curve in the top panel . \n the second panel shows the wwz transform , with the grey scale indicating the significance of each frequency as a function of time ( see @xcite ) . \n only a small range of frequencies is shown  there is no evidence for significant power outside this range . \n the third and fourth panels show , for each time bin , the semi - amplitude ( in magnitudes ) and period ( in days ) corresponding to the peak of the wwz in the second panel . \n it is clear from fig . \n [ fig.wavelet ] that the period of l@xmath0  pup has remained within a fairly narrow range ( 135145d ) for the past 75 years . \n such period jitter is common among semiregular and mira variables . \n there is a slight indication of a lengthening of period _ before _ the onset of the recent dimming , from 136 to 142 days , but the change ( at most 4% ) is well within the range of normal mira variables . the amplitude , on the other hand , has changed significantly over the years , but the changes are apparently uncorrelated with the period jitter . \n l@xmath0  pup is classified as an srb variable , a class of stars with poorly defined periodicity . \n in fact , the period of this star is remarkably stable . \n the characteristics of the wavelet plot show that l@xmath0  pup should be classified as sra , a class closely related to miras , often differing only in having smaller amplitudes . \n l@xmath0  pup was discovered to be variable by gould in 1872 @xcite . \n @xcite estimated a period of 137.2d from the dates of nine maxima observed by himself , gould and williams during 187292 . \n @xcite , in the _ second catalogue of variable stars _ , quoted a period of 140.15d , which they attributed to roberts . \n @xcite listed dates of maxima going back to 1872 , and also adopted a period of 140.15d . \n it therefore seems that the period of l@xmath0  pup has remained within a narrow range since its discovery . \n the visual magnitude at maximum during the late 1800s was about 3.6 @xcite , consistent with modern ( 1950s ) out - of - decline values . \n @xcite listed the magnitude range since discovery as 3.44.6 at maximum and 5.86.2 at minimum . \n this suggests that , between 1872 and 1918 , l@xmath0  pup was never as faint as it currently is . \n we have taken @xmath8 infrared photometry from @xcite , together with more recent observations obtained with the same system ( see table  [ table.ir ] ) . \n the infrared observations are much less frequent than the visual ones and do not sample the pulsation cycle very well . nevertheless , the mean infrared magnitudes can be estimated , and we have shown these in fig .  [ fig.ir ] by fitting a low - order polynomial to each waveband . \n .[table.ir ] near - infrared photometry of l@xmath0  pup [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -10pt @xmath9 range between smallest grains at inner radius and largest grains at outer radius + @xmath10 assuming [ fe / h]@xmath11    the most constraining aspects of the spectrum are the lack of dust emission at 8@xmath1 m and the strong silicate feature , which preclude the presence of hot dust . in our ` best ' model , the inner radius is at a dust temperature of 350k , well below the dust condensation temperature . \n the 17@xmath1 m flux ( also dominated by silicate emission ) is also surprisingly sensitive to the inner radius and agrees with a dust shell detached from its condensation point . \n the outer radius is not as well determined as the inner radius . \n however , a single thin shell can fit the long - wavelength iras / dirbe flux densities . \n there is no evidence for a cold distant dust shell , consistent with the low co mass - loss rate found by @xcite .    between 4 and 8@xmath1 m , \n the spectral energy distribution indicates a colour temperature consistent with the photospheric temperature . \n @xcite argued that dust emission dominates from 5@xmath1 m , based on evidence that the variability behaviour is very different longward of 5@xmath1 m . \n however , the emission in this band in mira variables is dominated by water vapour at @xmath122000k , located in the extended envelope at about 1.5 stellar radii @xcite . \n this water vapour also raises the flux in this region above that extrapolated from the photospheric @xmath13 magnitudes , as seen in the fit . \n our findings do not indicate a substantial contribution from dust to the spectrum shortward of 8@xmath1 m . \n we derive a ( pre - dimming ) mass - loss rate of @xmath14 . \n this is similar to that estimated by @xcite ( post - dimming ) . \n they found a dust mass - loss rate 4 times larger than derived by us because they adopted a dust outflow velocity of 10kms@xmath5 rather than 2.5kms@xmath5 , but used a much lower gas - to - dust ratio , which almost cancels this difference . \n our high gas - to - dust ratio is based on the assumption that l@xmath0 pup is a thick - disk star ( see sec .  [ sec.thickdisk ] ) , for which we have assumed [ fe / h]@xmath11 . in reality \n the gas mass - loss rate is not well determined . \n the model shows that the photometric data imply a narrower silicate feature than is observed . \n the most likely explanation is that the observed 10-@xmath1 m feature is not purely silicate . in the scheme of @xcite , this feature in l@xmath0  pup \n would be classified either as ` broad ' or possibly as ` silicate d ' . \n ( the difference is subtle and requires continuum subtraction , for which we lack sufficient wavelength coverage . ) \n they fitted the broad feature with a mixture of olivine ( mgfesio@xmath15 ) and porous amorphous alumina ( or corundum ) ( al@xmath0o@xmath16 ) . \n corundum has the highest condensation temperature of any circumstellar solid , and is the first condensate to form at @xmath17k . \n silicates may form subsequently from gas - solid reactions with alumina @xcite . \n @xcite suggested that the broad feature is seen in less evolved mira variables . \n this may reflect the possiblity that , at low @xmath18 , the conversion of alumina to silicate ( replacing the al with mg ) remains incomplete , due to a low reaction rate . \n we note that our model calculations used the pre - dimming spectrum . \n it would interesting to see whether the spectrum has changed significantly since the dimming . \n if alumina formed first , the peak of the 10@xmath1 m feature may have shifted to the red . \n it is tempting to associate the alumina with the grey extinction curve , but it has little extinction in the optical ( glass - like ) . \n better candidates would be tio@xmath0 or pyroxenes @xcite . \n the precise agent responsible for the variable polarization also remains undetermined . \n @xcite pointed out that the luminosity and effective temperature of l@xmath0  pup do not unambiguously identify it as an agb star , and allow the possibility that it is on the first ascent red giant branch . \n it is not clear whether the spectrum of l@xmath0  pup shows technetium , which is usually taken as indicating an agb star . \n @xcite reported a probable detection , while @xcite listed only a possible detection . \n however , if the @xmath19-band has significant obscuration then the bolometric magnitude has been underestimated . \n the bolometric correction would also have been overestimated because of the observed @xmath20 is too large . \n the two effects combined would mean that the actual luminosity is substantially greater than has been assumed , and is perhaps sufficiently large that placement on the agb is unambiguous .    finally , as pointed out by @xcite , the space motion of l@xmath0  pup indicates it may be a thick disk star . \n given that the thick disk accounts for up to 13%  of the local star density @xcite , it is not unexpected to find a local mira - like example . \n if l@xmath0  pup is indeed a thick - disk star , as seems plausible but which can not be stated with certainty , the progenitor would likely have had a low metallicity and a low mass . \n visual photometry of l@xmath0  pup shows an unprecedented dimming over the past 5 years . \n the long - term light curve shows stable periodicity , and we argue that l@xmath0  pup is mira - like and should be classified as sra . \n the period stability implies a constant stellar radius , which rules out temperature and/or luminosity variations as the cause of the dimming . \n rather , the dimming seems to arise from an episode of dust formation close to the extended atmosphere . \n episodic dust obscuration events are fairly common in carbon stars but have not been seen in ( non - symbiotic ) oxygen - rich stars . \n we suggest that dust forms continuously but anisotropically , with the current dimming event being due to to dust formation along the line of sight .    the red colours indicate reddening from dust , but the extinction curve is greyer than found for ism dust . \n this could reflect a higher fraction of oxides . \n the change of colour during the dimming indicates that already before the dimming , the @xmath21-band magnitude was significantly affected by circumstellar or atmospheric extinction . \n l@xmath0  pup was one of the few stars located below the mira @xmath22@xmath23 relation : the derived @xmath19-band extinction puts the star in closer agreement with this relation . \n we present a 10-@xmath1 m spectrum showing strong silicate emission . \n these observations were carried out in 1995 , just prior to the recent dimming . \n the silicate feature can be fitted with a detached , thin dust shell , with inner radius @xmath24 and outer radius @xmath25 . \n longer wavelength photometry shows no evidence for more distant , colder dust . \n we derive a mass - loss rate of @xmath26 , but this value depends on the assumed expansion velocity and metallicity  if the dust velocity is high , the actual mass - loss rate could be higher . \n we are extremely grateful to the observers who have provided visual observations , and to those who have maintained the databases and made them publicly available . \n we also thank peter tuthill for useful discussions . \n trb and ar are grateful to the australian research council for financial support . \n chen , b. , stoughton , c. , smith , j.  a. , uomoto , a. , pier , j.  r. , yanny , b. , ivezi ' c ,  . \n , york , d.  g. , anderson , j.  e. , annis , j. , brinkmann , j. , csabai , i.  . , \n fukugita , m. , hindsley , r. , lupton , r. , munn , j.  a. , & the sdss collaboration , 2001 , apj , 553 , 184 . \n murakami , h. , freund , m.  m. , ganga , k. , guo , h. , hirao , t. , hiromoto , n. , kawada , m. , lange , a.  e. , makiuti , s. , matsuhara , h. , matsumoto , t. , matsuura , s. , murakami , m. , nakagawa , t. , narita , m. , noda , m. , okuda , h. , okumura , k. , onaka , t. , roellig , t.  l. , sato , s. , shibai , h. , smith , b.  j. , tanabe , t. , tanaka , m. , watabe , t. , yamamura , i. , & yuen , l. , 1996 , pasj , 48 , l41 . \n percy , j.  r. , colivas , t. , sloan , w.  b. , & mattei , j.  a. , 1990 , in cacciari , c. , & clementini , g. , editors , _ confrontation between stellar pulsation and evolution _ \n , volume  11 of _ a.s.p . \n _ , page 446 . \n san francisco : asp .", "StartTimeOffset": 909912568386, "RequestID": "97a127f58d65d30f9a716a93f052a16926b5b58a", "TotalTokens": 3888}

ray . \n this signal is sinusoidal and has an amplitude from @xmath04% to @xmath010% . \n it is observed only in two observations ( _ chandra _ and _ bepposax _ after the burst ) when the source is in a typical high / soft state : the energy spectrum is well described as the sum of a comptonized plasma with a temperature of @xmath12 2 - 5 kev and an optical depth of @xmath13  6 and a blackbody component with a thermal temperature of @xmath00.3 - 0.5  kev . \n this result is independent from the extrapolated luminosity of the system , which spans from 0.7 to 5.2 @xmath14 erg  s@xmath15 in the 0.5 - 50 kev energy band , for _ chandra _ and _ bepposax _ ( after the burst ) , respectively . \n this periodicity is not seen when the source is in a low / hard state ( _ xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ data ) and data is well reproduced by a simple comptonized model with a plasma temperature of @xmath12 15 - 21  kev and an optical depth of @xmath13  2 , without any thermal component . according to our present understanding , the black - body component in the soft state could originate at both the neutron star surface or boundary layer and the surface of an optically - thick accretion disk . \n the comptonization component in the hard state may arise from a corona above the disk and/or between the disk and the stellar surface and accretion probably assumes the form of a truncated outer accretion disk ( olive et al . \n the origin of these spectral changes is not clear , the thermal temperature ( @xmath00.3 - 0.5 kev ) confirm that the accretion disk is ionized and should not be subject to the standard ionization instability ( done et al . \n 2007 ) . \n the far - ultraviolet photometry obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ has shown the same periodicity described here ( zurek et al . \n these timing properties seen in uv / optical observations and the eclipse observed in the x -

{"ContextTokens": 1444, "GeneratedTokens": 173, "SynthesizedBody": "typical elm signals are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . here \n , we try to model type - i and type - iii elm signals of @xmath0 . \n jet typical elm signals ( [ perez2004 , thesis]).,width=321 ]    we just focus on the signal itself and ignore all the other information behind , i.e. , we just discuss how to use ( as simple as possible ) equations or other approaches to reproduce the shape of these signals . \n it is qualitative or at most semi - quantitative . \n this is a wide used approach for modeling . for example , the famous prey - predator model for fishbone and drift wave - zonal flow system . \n one may also extend it to pde to contain the spatial information . \n indeed , this way has been used to model elm and l - h transit in literatures , e.g. , [ diamond1994 ] , [ itoh1991 , 1993 , 1999 ] .    if we assume that the dynamic of signal is not explicit depend on time @xmath1 , then one equation @xmath2 is not enough because that @xmath3 is not single valued with @xmath4 . \n so , at least , we must use second order equation or use two first order equations . while , one second order equation is just a special case of two first order equations . \n in this example , we use the second option , i.e. , two first order equations , which is also used in [ diamond1994 ] . \n the equations are @xmath5    a result is shown in fig . [ \n fig : ode1 ] . \n ode for modeling elm , example 1.,width=321 ]    the physical explanations of the equations and parameters can be found in [ diamond1994 ] , however , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 . \n using one second order equation , e.g. , @xmath8 which is modified from stiff system equation , a result is shown in fig . \n [ fig : ode2 ] . \n the shape is very similar to the pde result in [ itoh1993 ] . \n but , an apparent drawback of ( [ eq : ode2 ] ) is that the signal @xmath4 is not always positive here . \n ode for modeling elm , example 2.,width=321 ] \n ddes contain derivatives which depend on previous time . \n we guess some equations here . \n the equations are from or modified from [ shampine2000 ] . \n there is also a type of dde has sawtooth solutions ( see e.g. , [ mallet - paret2011 ] ) , which may be also suitable for model the unsolved sawteeth phenomena in magnetic confined fusion study . \n the equation is @xmath9     dde for modeling elm , example 1.,width=321 ]    results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : dde1 ] . \n equation is @xmath10 which is original to model four - year cycle of the population of lemmings . \n dde for modeling elm , example 2.,width=321 ]    the result is shown in fig . \n [ fig : dde2 ] . \n this is a more intuitive way to model elm , which combines different time scales using a more acceptable approach . \n the burst of elm signal is suggested related to peeling - ballooning mode in standard elm model ( [ connor1998 ] ) . \n so , we give two time scale : transport time scale and ballooning mode time scale .    to simplify the transport process , the transport time scale is modeled using @xmath11    when pressure gradient exceeds marginal value ( using @xmath12 to represent it ) , the ballooning mode occurs . \n the signals will grow exponentially @xmath13 with the characteristic time @xmath14 .    when @xmath15 exceeds a marginal value @xmath16 , the plasma crash . \n and then , go to next cycle . \n we also add some randomicities to @xmath12 and @xmath16 to make the whole signal more like the actual experimental signal . a result \n is shown in fig . \n [ fig : demc ] . \n demc modeling for elm.,width=321 ]    this simple demc model captures some fundamental properties of integrated simulations , such as [ chang2008 ] and [ lonnroth2009 ] . \n which one is more reasonable ? at present , i choose demc @xmath17 ode @xmath17 dde . while , maybe none of them can be final explanation of elm or h - mode . \n there is another math tool called fractional differential equation ( fde ) , which has been used for anomalous transport / diffusion problems in some areas . for plasma community \n , fde is not wide accepted yet , but it is possible in the future . \n fde is hard to give periodic solutions as elm at present . \n so , i havent given examples . \n chang , c. s. ; klasky , s. ; cummings , j. ; samtaney , r. ; shoshani , a. ; sugiyama , l. ; keyes , d. ; ku , s. ; park , g. ; parker , s. ; podhorszki , n. ; strauss , h. ; abbasi , h. ; adams , m. ; barreto , r. ; bateman , g. ; bennett , k. ; chen , y. ; azevedo , e. d. ; docan , c. ; ethier , s. ; feibush , e. ; greengard , l. ; hahm , t. ; hinton , f. ; jin , c. ; khan , a. ; kritz , a. ; krsti , p. ; lao , t. ; lee , w. ; lin , z. ; lofstead , j. ; mouallem , p. ; nagappan , m. ; pankin , a. ; parashar , m. ; pindzola , m. ; reinhold , c. ; schultz , d. ; schwan , k. ; silver , d. ; sim , a. ; stotler , d. ; vouk , m. ; wolf , m. ; weitzner , h. ; worley , p. ; xiao , y. ; yoon , e. and zorin , d. , toward a first - principles integrated simulation of tokamak edge plasmas , journal of physics : conference series , 2008 , 125 , 012042 . \n mallet - paret , j. and nussbaum , r. d. , superstability and rigorous asymptotics in singularly perturbed state - dependent delay - differential equations , journal of differential equations , 2011 , 250 , 4037 - 4084 .", "StartTimeOffset": 927161287044, "RequestID": "c2524c7bfa7114bcd9729689b74ee31a2718c167", "TotalTokens": 1617}
{"ContextTokens": 3879, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "considerable breakthroughs in studies of stellar populations have been enabled over the past 15 years by the development of high - multiplex optical spectrographs , such as aat-2df ( lewis et al . \n 2002 ) , vlt - flames ( pasquini et al . \n 2002 ) , and magellan - imacs ( dressler et al . 2011 ) . \n these powerful instruments have typically been used to compile large samples of stellar spectra to address questions in stellar evolution ( e.g. , evans et al . \n 2005 , 2011 ) , or to use stars as tracers of the dynamics and assembly histories of galaxies ( e.g. , zoccali et al . \n 2014 ) . \n this contribution highlights some of the plans for new multi - object spectrographs ( mos ) in the coming decade , and some of the opportunities they will bring for studies of stellar populations . sections  [ ir ] and [ next ] considers recent developments for 4 - 10 m class observatories , while section  [ elts ] looks foward to future mos observations with the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , which was recently approved for construction by eso council ( de zeeuw , tamai & liske , 2014 ) . \n one of the most exciting developments in the past couple of years has been the arrival of the first near - ir mos instruments on large telescopes : keck - mosfire ( mclean et al . 2012 ) and vlt - kmos ( sharples et al . \n 2013 ) . although employing different technologies / approaches , i.e. , a configurable cryogenic slit unit cf .  deployable integral field units ( ifus ) , \n both are highly capable instruments for stellar studies , enabling efficient collection of relatively large spectroscopic samples in the near - ir for the first time . \n as an example of the new research enabled by access to near - ir mos observations , i highlight recent studies of the physical properties and chemical abundances of red supergiants ( rsgs ) , the cool , luminous descendants of massive stars . \n the potential of @xmath0-band spectroscopy of rsgs to determine chemical abundances in galaxies was introduced by davies , kudritzki & figer ( 2010 ) in their analysis of archival spectra from the irtf library ( rayner , cushing & vacca , 2009 ) . the spectral window used in this approach \n is shown in fig . \n [ dkf10 ] , and has been further validated by studies of rsgs in the galaxy ( gazak et al . \n 2014 ) and in the magelllanic clouds ( davies et al . 2015 ) . \n a first application of this technique at larger distances was demonstrated by kmos science verification observations of eleven rsgs in ngc6822 ( d@xmath10.46mpc ) , with an estimated mean metallicity , [ @xmath2 , of @xmath30.52@xmath40.21 ( patrick et al . \n the final test phase of this technique was kmos guaranteed time observations in ngc300 ( d@xmath51.9mpc ) , enabling a comparison of the rsg abundances ( gazak et al . \n 2015 , see fig . \n [ zke15 ] ) with those for blue supergiants from kudritzki et al . \n ( 2008 ) . with the method \n now tested rigorously in the local universe , efforts are underway to observe a larger sample of galaxies ( spanning a range of masses ) to obtain a direct calibration of the mass - metallicity relation ( see , e.g. , kewley & ellison , 2008 ) . \n in addition to observational factors such as sky and telluric subtraction , quantitative stellar work in the near - ir also presents new challenges in the sense that much of the focus on atomic data has traditionally been at optical wavelengths , so new calculations are required to , for instance , account for deviations from the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( bergemann et al . 2012 ; 2013 ; 2015 ) . \n continued efforts will be required in this area if we are to obtain the maximum benefit from future facilities , both from the 8 - 10 m class telescopes and the elts . \n beyond the facilities already in operation on ground - based telescopes , there are four mos projects in the design / construction phase that each have ` legacy'-style large surveys of stellar populations as part of their core programmes :    * 4most : optical mos for the 4 m vista telescope ( de jong , this vol . ) ; * moons : ( red-)optical / near - ir mos for the vlt ( cirasuolo , this vol . ) ; * pfs : optical / near - ir mos for the subaru telescope ( takada , this vol . ) ; * weave : optical mos for the wht ( dalton , this vol . ) . \n the surveys enabled by this next generation of instruments will provide a truly vast ( @xmath610@xmath7 stars ) census of the stellar populations of the inner milky way , its disk and halo populations , the magellanic clouds , and the dwarf / irregular galaxies of the local group . \n other instruments under construction such as gtc - megara ( de paz , this vol . ) and gtc - emir ( garzon , this vol . ) \n will also contribute valuable observations . \n many of the detailed plans for the stellar surveys with these new instruments are presented elsewhere in this volume . as an example of studies of star formation ( specifically whether it always occurs in dense clusters ) , spatial analyses of star - forming regions can already provide us with insights into their initial conditions and dynamical evolution ( e.g. , parker et al . \n 2014 ; wright et al . \n 2014 ) , but the information encoded in the radial velocities ( from the spectroscopy ) and proper motions ( from the _ gaia _ mission ) will give us unique three - dimensional information to trace their dynamical histories ( e.g. , to identify comoving groups with the different spatial sub - structures ) . \n the mos facilities planned for the coming years will be transformative due to the combination of their large multiplexes with substantial telescope allocations to acquire the vast samples required . however , as we look further ahead , we are ultimately limited by the collecting area of current facilities . \n for instance , keck - deimos spectroscopy of the evolved stellar populations in m31 gives insufficient signal - to - noise below the tip of the red giant branch ( at @xmath8@xmath921.5mag , e.g. , chapman et al . \n 2006 ) , and quantitative analysis of massive o - type stars is limited to all but the most luminous objects beyond 1mpc ( e.g. , tramper et al . \n 2011 , 2014 ) . \n the elts will provide a huge leap forward in both sensitivity and , via adaptive optics ( ao ) , spatial resolution . \n in addition to eso s planned 39 m e - elt , there are two other elt projects now entering the construction phase : the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) and the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) . \n some of the challenges of simply scaling - up current mos designs and capabilities to elt - class instruments are discussed by bernstein ( this vol . ) . \n nonetheless , there is a huge range of scientific topics which require elt - mos observations , ranging from spectroscopic characterisation of the most distant galaxies , through to studies of exoplanets in stellar clusters ( evans et al . \n 2015 ) . \n following phase  a studies of three potential e - elt mos concepts ( see ramsay et al . \n 2010 ) , european and brazilian astronomers have combined their efforts to assemble a comprehensive science case for an elt - mos ( evans et al . \n 2015 ) , working together on the mosaic instrument concept ( hammer et al . \n 2014 ) . \n the range of cases presented by evans et al . \n ( 2015 ) flow down to instrument requirements which are knowingly broad ( see their table  7 ) . \n this step was intended as a first census of all the potential cases and relevant parameter space for mos observations . the phase  a conceptual design of mosaic is anticipated to start in late 2015 , including scientific trade - offs of capability vs.  cost ( and technical feasibility ) . \n one of the key approaches in plans for mosaic has been the delineation of possible mos sources into two types of observations , identified by evans et al . \n ( 2012 ) as :    * _ high definition : _ observations of tens of channels at fine spatial resolution , with multi - object adaptive optics ( moao ) providing high - performance correction for selected sub - fields . * \n _ high multiplex : _ integrated - light ( or coarsely - resolved ) observations of @xmath9100 objects at the spatial resolution given by the ground - layer adaptive optics ( glao ) of the telescope . \n the technical readiness of the high - definition mode has advanced significantly over the past few years thanks to the canary project on the wht in la palma . \n this has performed the first on - sky demonstrations of moao using natural guide stars ( gendron et al . 2011 ; vidal et al . 2014 ) and , more recently , using laser guide stars . \n as illustrated by the point - spread functions in fig . \n [ vgr14 ] , while moao does not yield the same performance as single - conjugate ao , it is substantially better than that from seeing or glao . \n the attraction of this approach is that such performance can potentially be obtained for multiple sub - fields within the large ( @xmath510@xmath10 diameter ) field of the e - elt .    a second moao pathfinder , raven on the subaru telescope \n , has also made impressive progress with on - sky tests in the past year ( lardire et al . 2014 ) . \n as an aside , note that even in the deep cosmological fields that are deliberately free of bright foreground stars , there are still sufficient ( fainter ) stars for significant improvements in image quality from moao ( basden , evans & morris , 2014 ) . \n a key component of the mosaic case , indeed for the elts in general , is concerned with stellar populations , both in the inner milky way and in distant systems beyond 1mpc . \n for example , when combined with ao , the @xmath0-band method introduced in section  [ rsgs ] is potentially very powerful , opening - up direct abundance studies of rsgs out to distances of tens of mpc ( evans et al . \n work is now underway to explore this technique for lower - mass , evolved stars on the red giant branch , to compare it with the use of the calcium triplet in estimation of stellar metallicities and radial velocities ( e.g. tolstoy et al . \n 2001 ;

{"ContextTokens": 1998, "GeneratedTokens": 195, "SynthesizedBody": "to provide accurate observational constraints for pre - main sequence evolutionary models , and thereby improve our understanding of star - formation , it is crucial to measure as accurately as possible the properties ( age , mass , luminosity , etc . ) of individual young stars . \n the determination of most of these parameters , however , depends critically on the often poorly known distance to the object under consideration . while the average distance to nearby low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g.  taurus or @xmath0ophiuchus ) has been estimated to about 20% precision using indirect methods ( elias 1978a , b ; kenyon et al . \n 1994 ; knude & hog 1998 ; bertout & genova 2006 ) , the line - of - sight depth of these regions is largely unknown , and accurate distances to individual objects are still missing . \n even the highly successful hipparchos mission ( perryman et al .  1997 ) did little to improve the situation ( bertout et al . \n 1999 ) because young stars are still heavily embedded in their parental clouds and are , therefore , faint in the optical bands observed by hipparchos . \n low - mass young stars often generate non - thermal continuum emission produced by the interaction of free electrons with the intense magnetic fields that tend to exist near their surfaces ( e.g.feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) . \n if the magnetic field intensity and the electron energy are sufficient , the resulting compact radio emission can be detected with very long baseline interferometers ( vlbi e.g.andr et al . \n the relatively recent possibility of accurately calibrating the phase of vlbi observations of faint , compact radio sources using nearby quasars makes it possible to measure the absolute position of these objects ( or , more precisely , the angular offset between them and the calibrating quasar ) to better than a tenth of a milli - arcsecond ( brisken et al . \n 2000 , 2002 ;

lestrade et al.1999 ) \n has a vlbi - based parallax determination . taking the mean of that and our 3 measurements \n , we estimate the mean distance to the taurus cluster to be @xmath18 = 137 pc . \n the dispersion about that mean leads to a full width at half maximum depth of about 20 pc , comparable to the linear extent of taurus on the plane of the sky . \n traditionnaly assumed to be at a distance of 165 pc ( chini 1981 ) , ophiuchus has recently been proposed to be somewhat nearer , at 120 pc ( knude & hog 1998 ) . \n interestingly , two of our sources are consistent with the traditionnal value , but the other two are consistent with a distance of 120 pc . since ophiuchus is only a few parsecs across on the plane of the sky , it is very unlikely to be 40 pc deep . \n it is noteworthy that the two sources at about 120 pc ( s1 and doar21 ) are associated with the sub - condensation oph a , whereas the two sources at @xmath19 165 pc ( vssg14 and wl5 ) are associated with the condensation oph b ( see motte et al . \n 1998 for an overview of the ophiuchus complex ) . \n thus , a plausible explanation of our results is that two physically unrelated star - forming regions are located along the line - of - sight toward ophiuchus . \n interestingly , knude & hog ( 1998 ) noticed an effect that would be consistent with this possibility in their analysis of extinction towards ophiuchus . while a clear extinction step was clearly visible at 120 pc \n , extinction was apparently extending up to about 160 pc . \n additional vlbi observations will be needed to confirm the existence of two regions of star - formation towards ophiuchus , and to investigate at which distance the other condensations in ophiuchus are located . \n the present results show that vlba observations of non - thermal sources associated with young stars have the potential to improve very significantly our knowledge of the space distribution of star - forming regions in the solar neighborod . \n indeed , the precision obtained by these measurements is even sufficient to probe the 3d structure of star - forming regions . coupled with pre - main sequence evolutionnary models , such information could be used to reconstruct the history of star - formation with individual regions .", "StartTimeOffset": 961745958090, "RequestID": "688fb675501d2b25b096a52fe9c7130338d6215b", "TotalTokens": 2193}

threaded algorithm .    in @xcite an @xmath0 algorithm is proposed for strong bisimulation as an improvement upon the algorithm of @xcite . the core idea for this improvement \n is described as `` process the smaller half ''  @xcite . whenever a block is split in two parts the amount of work \n must be contributed to the size of the smallest resulting block . in such a case a state \n is only involved in the process of splitting if it resides in a block at most half the size of the block it was previously in when involved in splitting . \n this means that a state can never be involved in more than @xmath11 splittings . as the time used in each state is proportional to the number of incoming or outgoing transitions in that state , the total required time is @xmath0 .    in this paper \n we propose the first algorithm for stuttering equivalence and branching bisimulation in which the `` process the smaller half''-technique is used . by doing so \n , we can finally confirm the conjecture in  @xcite that such an improvement of gv is conceivable . \n moreover , we achieve an even lower complexity , namely @xmath0 , than conjectured in  @xcite by applying the technique twice , the second time for handling the presence of inert transitions . \n first we establish whether a block can be split by combining the approach regarding bottom states from gv with the detection approach in  @xcite . \n subsequently , we use the `` process the smaller half''-technique again to split a block by only traversing transitions in a time proportional to the size of the smallest subblock . \n as it is not known which of the two subblocks is smallest , the transitions of the two subblocks are processed alternatingly , such that the total processing time can be contributed to the smallest block . for checking behavioural equivalences , applying such a technique \n is entirely new . \n we are only aware of a similar approach for an algorithm in which the smallest bottom strongly connected component of a graph needs to be found  @xcite . \n the algorithm that we propose is complex . \n although the basic sketch of the algorithm is relatively straightforward , it heavily relies on auxiliary data structures . \n for instance , for each transition it is recalled how many other transitions there are from the block where the transition starts to the constellation in which the transition ends . \n maintaining such auxiliary data structures is a tedious process . \n therefore , we do not only prove the major steps of the algorithm correct , we also provide a very detailed description of the algorithm , and we ran the implemented algorithm on many thousands of randomly generated test cases , comparing the reductions with the outcomes of existing algorithms . \n this not only convinced us that the algorithm is correct and correctly implemented , it also allows others to easily reimplement the algorithm .    from a theoretical viewpoint \n our algorithm outperforms its predecessors substantially . but \n a fair question is whether this also translates into practice . \n the theoretical bounds are complexity upperbounds , and depending on the transition system , the classical algorithms can be much faster than the upperbound suggests . \n furthermore , the increased bookkeeping in the new algorithm may be such a burden that all gains are lost . \n for this reason we compared the practical performance of our algorithm with that of the predecessors , and we found that for practical examples our algorithm can always match the best running times , but especially when the kripke structures and transition systems get large , our algorithm tends to outperform existing algorithms with orders of magnitude .    compared to checking other equivalences the existing algorithms for branching bisimulation / stuttering equivalence were already known to be practically very efficient . \n this is the reason that they are being used in multiple explicit - state model checkers , such as cadp  @xcite , the mcrl2 toolset  @xcite and tvt  @xcite . \n in particular they are being used as preprocessing steps for other equivalences ( weak bisimulation , trace based equivalences ) that are much harder to compute . for weak bisimulation recently a @xmath12 algorithm has been devised @xcite , but until that time an expensive transitive closure operation of at best @xmath13 was required . using our algorithm as a preprocessing step \n , the computation time of all other behavioural ` weak ' equivalences can be made faster . \n we introduce kripke structures and ( divergence -

34 @xcite . in an observation of 200 ksec duration when the source was bursting , \n 12 bursts were seen , 6 of them exhibiting oscillations at about 363 hz . \n so far , when a source has multiple bursts with oscillations , the frequencies are almost the same , so that a frequency identifies the source . \n it is likely that some bursts from many other bursters also exhibit oscillations . in most cases \n , we have no way , yet , of knowing whether a burster is burst active , so that we have not been able to choose to observe it at such a time . \n we also do not know for sure why sometimes the oscillations are not seen , although this seems to be correlated with the strength of the bursts and whether they result in radius expansion of the neutron star .    to display properties of the burst oscillations it is convenient to compute the power spectra of 2 s intervals with a new interval sampled \n every 1/8 s. figure 1 shows an example of a burst with a typical appearance of the oscillations during the course of a burst , with a slight rise in frequency of about 2 hz to a value that stays approximately constant during the decline of the burst . \n sometimes only a portion of this kind of pattern can be seen . even with the change of frequency in some bursts , @xmath0 . in the tails of the bursts \n , it can be @xmath1 .    among the six bursters with burst oscillations \n four also exhibit twin `` kilohertz '' quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) , which drift in frequency with inferred mass accretion rate during an observation . \n table  [ tab : periods ] gives their burst oscillation periods and figure 2 summarizes the relations between oscillation frequencies that have been reported to date . \n the frequencies are plotted with respect to estimated persistent luminosity @xcite , to emphasize that they are approximately independent of it . for 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1702 - 43 \n the difference frequencies of the twin kilohertz peaks are close to the burst frequencies . for 4u 1636 - 53 and ks 1731 - 44 , the difference frequencies are closer to half the burst frequencies . for aql x-1 and a burster in the galactic center , x1743 -

52 . a strong case has been made that the burst frequencies are directly related to the stellar spin frequency @xcite . for the burst oscillations the variations in frequency for a given source are rather small and explanations appear plausible , as we will discuss . in either case a model in terms of rotation of a neutron star with \n a non - uniform temperature distribution appears reasonable \n . there could be a single hot ( or cold ) spot giving rise to rotational modulation or perhaps a spot associated with each magnetic pole , even if the magnetic fields are much smaller than the @xmath2 g fields of high mass binary accreting neutron stars . in this paper \n we discuss the evidence that the burst frequencies are the rotation frequencies of the neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) . \n other explanations might have been , a priori possible . when a neutron star is hot because of a thermonuclear flash , oscillations in the inner part of a remnant disk , not blown back by the explosion , could obscure part of the glowing star periodically . \n we will see , however , that there are associated oscillations in the temperature , rather than the area , making this explanation less probable . \n the explosion and the transfer of heat to the surface , by a combination of diffusion and convection , could excite oscillation modes of the neutron stars . \n such modes have been studied theoretically @xcite and some have frequencies in the observed range . \n however , there is no compelling reason why the frequency spectrum of the modes would be so simple and estimates of the amount of energy that would be in these oscillations are a small fraction of the amplitudes actually observed . \n we report on our studies of properties of the burst oscillations that tend to confirm interpretation in terms of rotation : the sinusoidal pulse shape , the very high amplitude which can occur at the onset of bursts , the correlation with a temperature oscillation , and coherence of the oscillations through the bursts . \n we have expected theoretically that these neutron stars are rotating fast and the large population of millisecond radio pulsars has implied the existence of progenitors such as lmxb , so that the theoretical implication that we should find such objects is very strong . finally , we address briefly the neutron star properties that the burst observations can strongly constrain . \n the data allow the pulsed amplitude to be tracked during bursts as a function of energy @xcite . \n the spectra of the bursts during the rise can be fit every 0.125 s and yield a color temperature and an apparent radius to better than 10 % during a period when the apparent radius changes by @xmath3 50 % . \n expected corrections to the spectra would make the scale of radius increase larger .    in some bursts \n the oscillations are seen very close to the beginning of the rise in flux , within the first 100 ms . within such time intervals , \n the oscillations are coherent and can be folded on the period . \n fractional amplitudes near and exceeding 50 % are seen both in bursts 4u 1728 - 34 , in which the difference frequency of 363 hz is about the burst frequency , and in bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 , in which the difference frequency of about 255 hz is closer to half the burst frequency of 581 hz . the fractional amplitude decreases strongly as the burst flux rises to the peak . \n this suggests that the thermonuclear burning starts as a localized hot spot on the neutron star and from there spreads around the neutron star . \n calculations have suggested the burning is inhomogeneous @xcite . \n simulations of emission from the surface of a neutron star show that this model can reproduce the observed behavior of the fractional amplitude . \n because the neutron star gravitational field bends light around it the intensity of radiation emitted from a surface hot spot on the neutron star depends on the rotational phase of the spot and the compactness , @xmath4 of the neutron star . here \n @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the stellar mass and radius , respectively . \n this is taken into account in simulations of the expected pulse growth and decay @xcite . \n the more compact the neutron star , that is , the higher is m / r , the more severe is the bending of light , the more smeared the pulse , and the lower would be the modulation of radiation from the surface @xcite . \n thus the high level of modulation of the flux that is observed puts a strong constraint on the compactness of the neutron star . \n the neutron stars must be fairly large . if the intensity is actually from opposing poles of a neutron star , these constraints become almost impossible for known and tested equations of state of nuclear matter . \n this suggests that the hypothesis of two antipodal spots may be untenable . \n we have found no substantial differences between the behavior of the burst oscillations for 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1636 - 53 to contradict the hypothesis that the mechanisms are the same . \n the similarity of the burst rise behavior thus argues in favor of both being the neutron star spin . \n interpretation of the oscillations at the beginning of a burst in terms of a spreading hot spot raises the question of what mechanism causes the oscillations that appear during the decays of bursts . \n there would have to be a remnant or recurring inhomogeneity on the surface of the neutron star . \n possibly what was hot first is now a cooler spot , although conductivity might tend to make the star homogeneous . \n so far at least , there is no evidence there are different numbers of hot spots arising on the neutron star . \n this suggests that the occurrence is not random and a magnetic pole is an obvious candidate .      in cases where the duration of coherent oscillations is long enough and \n the amplitude strong enough , pulse phase spectroscopy is possible . in a burst from 4u 1636 - 53 shown in figure 3 , \n the pulsations for 5 s in the burst decay produce a 6 % modulation in the derived blackbody kt . \n for the burst oscillations to represent the rotation period of the neutron stars , there must be an explanation for the 1 - 2 hz change in frequency observed during bursts , since this can not represent a real change in the angular momentum of the entire neutron star on such a short time scale . \n a model which has been discussed @xcite is that the heated burning layer expands on the order of 10 - 30 m and is not rigidly attached to the neutron star , so that conservation of angular momentum causes the expanded hot material to rotate more slowly than material deeper in . \n it might then wrap around the neutron star about once during the initial second of the burst rise . \n a crude estimate of the height above the surface that the material would have to rise in order to produce such an effect is given by equating the angular momentum of a thin shell at the stellar surface , @xmath6 , and at a slightly higher altitude , @xmath7 , including the correction introduced by the gravitational time dilation from different radii . \n @xmath8    here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the frequencies measured near burst onset and burst decay , respectively . \n an observed frequency lower by 1 hz than a final frequency of 500 hz would correspond to a 10 - 20 m expansion during the rising part of the burst in comparison to the tail of the burst . \n whatever the exact explanation , this serves to illustrate that modest changes in the source of a modulation near the neutron star surface could cause the amount of frequency change observed .    in this model , gradual changes in the pulse peak phases would be seen . \n given a frequency during the tail of the burst and a frequency at the beginning , a frequency derivative can always bridge a gap . but for a given frequency change , the pulses need not remain in phase . \n in fact , zhang et al . \n @xcite apply the frequency derivative seen in a burst from aql x-1 , correct the times to that of the neutron star and find that almost all of the power in the oscillation is recovered , consistent with coherence of the underlying clock . \n the lmxb are part of the old population of stars in the galaxy . \n they have been accreting for a long time compared to high mass x - ray binaries @xcite . \n it was speculated when the low magnetic field millisecond radio pulsars were found that they were recycled pulsars spun up by accretion in lmxb . \n the periods we find are certainly in the approximate region of the periods of the millisecond radio pulsars as shown in figure 4 . \n we do not have firm measurements of the magnetic fields but they have been expected to have surface fields of @xmath11 g and the current data can be interpreted in terms of upper limits on the field of that order @xcite . however , careful estimates of the number of low field millisecond radio pulsars @xcite ( @xmath12 ) imply a birthrate about 10 times the birthrate of lmxb . the long time needed for lmxb to spin up the neutron star ( @xmath13 ) yr \n when accreting at the observed luminosities of only @xmath14 of the eddington limit imply a birth rate insufficient to be responsible for the observed millisecond radio pulsars . \n a large part of that population may have a different origin , perhaps accreting low mass binaries which have a phase of accretion so strong that they are not seen as x - ray sources ( @xcite ) , perhaps actually formed with low magnetic fields . \n a radius expansion burst from 4u 1820 - 30 illustrates the possible information that can be obtained from the bursts . \n spectral fits per 0.125 s show the pattern of temperature and radius changes associated with the flux rising to the eddington limit for hydrogen poor material and then a decay at approximately constant apparent radius after the photosphere has presumably returned to the surface of the neutron star . taking the flux at the start of this decay to give the observed eddington limit at the neutron star radius , the flux and color temperature run during the decay can be fit to the relation calculated by ebisuzaki and nakamura @xcite for the value of the effective temperature at the eddington limit . \n this temperature constrains the mass and radius :    @xmath15^{1/4 } ( 1 - 2gm / rc^2)^{3/8}\\ ] ]    figure 5 shows the results . \n many , but not all bursts from some sources show possible coherent strong oscillations . \n a correlary is that bursts that are observed without oscillations do not imply that oscillations will not be seen on other occasions . \n the period range of @xmath16 ms is about right for these sources eventually becoming some of the recycled millisecond radio pulsars . \n the behavior at onset of the burst suggests probably a single expanding hot spot . in all cases \n so far analyzed , the burst tail frequency is no more than a couple of hz different from the rise frequency , so that the geometry of the emission region must remain essentially the same . \n spectral analysis indicates the parameter varying is the average temperature in view . \n coherence during the burst and the rationale for the small frequency changes needs further study to answer outstanding questions . \n the possibility of using burst spectra and the oscillations to constrain the mass , radius , composition , and distance of the neutron stars holds great promise . \n 9 t. e. strohmayer , w. zhang , j. h. swank , a. p. smale , l. titarchuk , & c. day , apj 469 ( 1996 ) l9 . \n d. j. christian & j. h. swank , apj , 109 ( 1997 ) s177 . \n t. e. strohmayer , k. jahoda , a. b. giles , & u. lee , apj 486 ( 1997 ) 355 . n. e. white & w. zhang , apj , 490 ( 1998 ) l87 . \n t. e. strohmayer , w. zhang , j. h. swank , n. e. white , & i. lapidus , apj , ( 1998 ) in preparation . \n t. e. strohmayer , apj , 388 ( 1992 ) 138 . \n l. bildsten , a. cumming , g. ushomirsky , & c. cutler , in a half century of stellar pulsation interpretations , asp conf . \n 1998 ) in press . t. e. strohmayer , w. zhang , & j. h. swank , apj , 487 ( 1997)l77 . l. bildsten , apj 438 ( 1995 ) 852 . \n w. zhang , k. jahoda , r. l. kelley , t. e. strohmayer , & j. h. swank , apj , ( 1998 ) in press . \n d. battacharya , in x -

{"ContextTokens": 2635, "GeneratedTokens": 68, "SynthesizedBody": "following the well known _ rhetoric _ , photons are weakly coupled to the strongly interacting quarks and gluons . \n photons emitted in a qgp will immediately escape without further interactions in the plasma . \n this immediate `` escape '' will carry useful information on the nature of the supposedly formed plasma , at the emission stage . \n hence the comparison between the _ calculated _ photon spectrum from a qgp and that from a hadron gas medium with the measured photon spectrum in heavy ion collision , after background subtraction , will constitute an evidence in favor of either state of matter . \n + in an optimistic scenario , the plasma will live long enough for thermalization to occur . at a suitable high temperature ( @xmath2 ) , which is not so realistic in present heavy ion collisions , \n the running strong coupling constant @xmath0 will be small . \n + the above framework can be summarized as follows : we have a system in thermal equilibrium with an exact microscopic description in terms of quarks and gluons . in the small coupling constant regime \n , the calculation of the photon spectrum seems to be a straightforward application of perturbation theory . \n this is seemingly a simple situation compared to photon production in proton - proton collision where form - factors show up . \n although photons are weakly coupled to the plasma this description is oversimplified , since the quark that emits the photon is affected by medium effects such as debye screening ; it also acquires a thermal mass which plays a central role in screening infrared divergences . \n medium effects are well described by the hard thermal loop ( htl ) effective theory @xcite . \n so , the htl theory is the natural scheme for calculating the photon production rate in a thermalized qgp . \n + for present ( rhic ) , and near future ( lhc ) , heavy ion collision experiments a more realistic prediction should go beyond the small coupling constant regime . \n this will be briefly discussed at the end of this article . \n in a qgp in local thermal equilibrium , the photon production rate or the number of photons , with momentum @xmath3 , produced per unit time and per unit volume is conveniently expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the photon two point function , calculated in the plasma @xmath4 this formula is valid at lowest order in the electromagnetic coupling , and to all orders in the strong coupling constant . in other words , \n the two point function encodes the essential physics of the plasma , relevant for photon emission . + as mentioned in the previous section , to obtain the photon two point function in a perturbative procedure , the htl theory should be used . the one loop calculation in the effective theory \n was performed some time ago @xcite . \n it was believed that the one loop result gave * the * leading order @xmath0 photon spectrum . \n this belief was based on the success of the effective theory . \n the essence of the effective theory is to reorder the perturbation theory to give a meaning to the equivalence between the loop - wise expansion and the successive orders in the coupling constant . \n the loophole in this equivalence comes from collinear configurations . \n the effective theory does not incorporate a ready - to - use remedy for collinear problems . \n collinearity is kinematical , _ \n i.e. _ it depends on the particular problem of interest , so it is not surprising if the effective theory fails to treat such problems systematically . \n +    it worth mentioning that the underlying physical processes in the one loop diagram are the @xmath5 processes , compton and annihilation . however , it was shown @xcite that bremsstrahlung and the new process of annihilation of an off - shell quark ( on the left of figure [ fig : processes ] ) contribute to leading order . \n these processes appear only at the two loop level in the effective theory . \n the breakdown of the effective theory , two loop is of the same order as one loop , is traced back to the appearance of collinear divergences ( _ i.e. _ the collinear emission of the photon by a quark ) . \n this collinearity is soften by the use of the effective theory which gives a kinematical cutoff denoted by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thermal mass of fermions , provided by the effective theory , and @xmath8 is the quark energy . \n the present form of the cut - off is valid for real and small mass virtual photons ( the real photon case is obtained for @xmath9 ) . \n the dependence of this cut - off on the coupling constant , although it regularizes what would be a collinear singularity , renders the two loop diagrams equally important as the one loop contribution . since , after phase space integration the cut - off @xmath10 appears linearly in the denominator , its @xmath11 dependence cancels the extra powers of the couplings in the two - loop diagrams . \n + it is thus natural to ask whether this breakdown of the effective theory does not propagate to higher loop orders ? \n + simple power counting @xcite indicates that the collinear configuration persists for all ladder diagrams . as a consequence , higher loop diagrams do contribute to the leading @xmath0 order for real photon production . \n hence a resummation of a whole set of gauge invariant diagrams is mandatory . \n in attempt to focus on the underlying physical mechanism which renders higher loop diagrams equally important as the one loop diagram , we calculated @xcite the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor at two loop level with quarks having a finite width . \n this study leads to a simple physical picture . \n photon emission from a quark gluon plasma gives rise to two natural physical scales ( figure [ fig : lpm ] ) :    * the formation length ( time ) @xmath12 , also called the coherence length @xmath13 : @xmath14\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the quark transverse ( compared to photon momentum ) momentum , * the mean free path ( width)@xmath16 : @xmath17    the interplay between these two scales leads to the emergence of different physical regimes :    * the perturbative regime ( @xmath18 ) , where the dominant mechanisms of photon production are compton and annihilation appearing at one loop order in the htl effective theory . \n high dilepton mass spectrum is a typical example of this regime . * \n the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal regime ( @xmath19 ) : it is the region where the formation length is much longer than the mean free path . \n inelastic processes like bremsstrahlung should be considered . \n this leads to coherent photon production , which is responsible for the lpm suppression of the photon spectrum . in this region \n a further resummation is needed to include rescattering . \n real photon production exemplifies this regime . \n the finite width study cited in the previous section , although it provides a nice physical picture , is far from giving the complete photon spectrum . \n a correct approach would consist in re - summing the ladder diagrams mentioned above together with quark propagators with a finite width ( self - energy corrections ) . \n this has been recently carried out @xcite . \n the authors of @xcite showed that important cancellations of long ranged interactions occured between vertex and self - energy diagrams and derived an integral equation with a simple physical interpretation . \n the bottom line of their resummation is to consider the rescattering of an almost on - shell quark in a random gaussian background field . \n the imaginary part of the two point function was found to be : @xmath20\\ ; { { p_0 ^ 2+(p_0+q_0)^2}\\over{2(p_0(p_0+q_0))^2 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\times{\\rm re}\\,\\int { { d^2{\\bf p}_\\perp}\\over{(2\\pi)^2}}\\ ; { \\bf   p}_\\perp\\cdot{\\bf f}({\\bf p}_\\perp ) \\nonumber \\label{eq : amy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath22 is the same as the inverse of the formation time defined before . \n this integral equation reflects the following features :    * the combination @xmath23 $ ] guarantees the cancellation of all infrared behavior ( _ a priori _ non - perturbative ) when @xmath24 . \n * iteration is equivalent to rescattering in the medium with a collision term @xmath25 . * \n the width , discussed in the previous section , could be seen as a part of the collision term . \n we notice again that multiple scatterings are important when the collision integral is of the same order as the @xmath22 term , as was predicted by the model discussed in the previous section . \n the above equation is solved numerically and it is found that rescattering leads to about 25 % suppression of the photon spectrum coming from bremsstrahlung and off - shell scattering . \n hence , although the `` next to one loop '' processes are not as enhanced as was thought originally @xcite they still give important contribution which should be included beside the strict one loop processes to obtain the complete order @xmath0 photon spectrum . + \n recently the collision term was obtained analytically using new sum rules at finite temperature @xcite . \n the collision term is found to be @xmath26 this analytical form allows to circumvent the evaluation of complicated integrals in the original form of the collision term . \n it is also useful for the extension of the above study to the production of low mass dileptons . \n photon production nowadays is known to complete order @xmath0 . \n it is among the rare theoretical calculations going beyond the leading logarithm approximation . \n the resummation done by arnold _ et al _ leads to a picture where one averages over a gaussian background field which goes beyond the classics of static scattering centers extensively used in the literature to model rescattering . \n + it must be emphasized that bremsstrahlung and off - shell annihilation are among the dominant mechanisms for photon production . \n although the resummation has led to a 25 % suppression , the next to one loop processes still give significant contributions which will enhance the photon production rate in a quark - gluon plasma . \n thermal photon production is not the unique source of photons . \n pions , for example , decay into photons giving a very important background . this background should be subtracted in order to isolate the thermal photon production and compare it to photon production in a hadron gas model . on the other hand \n , dilepton production has a different background to be subtracted . \n hence a compilation of photon and dilepton will constitute a tractable mean for `` plasma detection '' . \n + the resummation done in @xcite includes only the transverse photon polarization . \n however , dilepton could receive contributions from the longitudinal polarization sector , hence the extension of the above resummation to dilepton case requires some precautions . \n the necessary resummation for low mass dilepton leads to @xcite ( preliminary results ) @xmath27\\int   \\left[2{\\bf p}_{\\perp}.{\\bf f}({\\bf p}_{\\perp})\\oplus q^2 g({\\bf p}_{\\perp})\\right]\\ ] ] the new scalar function @xmath28 satisfies an equation analogue to that satisfied by @xmath29 . \n the preliminary results for the dilepton rate indicates an lpm type suppression which does not rule out the contribution coming from bremsstrahlung and off - shell annihilation found recently in @xcite . \n + we should stress that the small coupling constant regime is an idealized situation . \n a more realistic coupling constant should not be so small . \n recall that photon emission is dominated by collinear emission , this occurs for almost on - shell quarks . hence quarks can be treated to a good approximation in a quasi - particle model , with masses derived from lattice calculation . \n this is under investigation @xcite .    9 , nucl . phys . * b * * 337 * , 569 ( 1990 ) ; e. braaten , r.d . \n pisarski , nucl . \n * b * * 339 * , 310 ( 1990 ) ; j. frenkel , j.c . \n taylor , nucl . \n * b * * 334 * , 199 ( 1990 ) ; j. frenkel , j.c . \n taylor , nucl . phys . \n * b * * 374 * , 156 ( 1992 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 980797061352, "RequestID": "878421f2a336662a63cda0e9e3e8bf835921acdb", "TotalTokens": 2703}

[ fig:1 ] ) . \n as a first step of analysis , we compared the interferometric data to commonly used analytic disk models with a simple temperature power - law ( @xmath12 , with @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) . using the assumption that each disk annulus radiates as a blackbody , we can compute the wavelength - dependence of the disk size corresponding to these analytic models and find that they can not reproduce the measured nir and mir - sizes simultaneously ( see fig . \n [ fig:2 ] ) .    therefore , we applied a more sophisticated modeling approach using the _ mcsim_mpi _ 2-d radiative transfer code ( ohnaka et  al.@xcite ) . for each model \n , we first check the agreement with the sed of mwc147 and then fit the spectro - interferometric visibilities ( see kraus et al . \n @xcite for details ) . \n the dust density distribution of the accretion disk in our models resembles a flared , keplerian - rotating disk with a radial density distribution of @xmath15 , which extends from the dust sublimation radius to 100  au . in order to reproduce the shape of the sed , we found that , in addition to the disk , an extended envelope is required , for which we use the radial density distribution @xmath16 .    ) \n indicates that passive disk models can be ruled out . \n , width=457 ]    fig . \n [ fig:3 ] shows model images , the sed , as well as the visibilities corresponding to our best - fit model of a passive , irradiated accretion disk . \n although irradiated disks are able to reproduce the sed of mwc147 , they predict visibilities which are much smaller than the measured visibilities ( @xmath17 ) and are therefore in strong conflict with our interferometric measurements .    in passive circumstellar disks , \n the infrared emission is generally assumed to originate almost entirely from dust ; the emissivity of the inner , dust - free gaseous part of the disk , at radii smaller than the dust sublimation radius , is negligible . in an actively accreting disk , on the other hand , viscous dissipation of energy in the inner dust - free gaseous part of the accretion disk can heat the gas to high temperatures and give rise to significant amounts of infrared emission from optically thick gas . \n the inner edge of this gas accretion disk is expected to be located a few stellar radii above the stellar surface , where the hot gas is thought to be channeled towards the star via magnetospheric accretion columns . \n while the magnetospheric accretion columns are too small to be resolved in our interferometric data ( 3  @xmath18 correspond to 0.09  au or 0.12  mas ) , infrared emission from hot gas between the dust sublimation radius and the stellar surface should be clearly distinguishable from the thermal emission of the dusty disk due to the different temperatures of these components and the resulting characteristic slope in the nir- and mir - visibilities .    ) , yielding good agreement ( @xmath19 ) . \n , width=457 ]    since mwc147 is a quite strong accretor ( @xmath20yr@xmath21 ; hillenbrand et  al . \n @xcite ) , significant infrared emission from the inner gaseous accretion disk is expected . \n muzerolle et al . \n @xcite found that even for smaller accretion rates , the gaseous inner accretion disk is several times thinner than the puffed - up inner dust disk wall and is optically thick ( both in radial as well as in the vertical direction ) . in order to add the thermal emission from the inner gaseous disk to our radiative transfer models \n , we assume the radial temperature power - law by pringle @xcite . including the accretion luminosity from an inner gaseous disk in the model \n strongly improves the agreement between model predictions and observed visibilities . with a flared disk geometry and an accretion rate of @xmath22yr@xmath21 , both the sed and the interferometric visibilities are reproduced reasonably well ( @xmath23 \n , see fig . \n [ fig:4 ] ) . \n our vlti interferometric observations of mwc147 constrain , for the first time , the inner circumstellar environment around a herbig  be star over the wavelength range from 2 to @xmath24 m . \n we find evidence that the nir emission of mwc147 is dominated by the emission from optically - thick gas located inside the dust sublimation radius , while the mir also contains contributions from the outer , irradiated dust disk . \n our study demonstrates the power of infrared spectro - interferometry to probe the inner structure of the disks around young stars and to disentangle multiple emission components . \n future investigations on yso accretion disks will benefit substantially from the proposed 2nd  generation vlti instruments , such as matisse , increasing not only the number of recorded baselines , but also expanding the spectral coverage to the @xmath2 and @xmath25 bands .", "StartTimeOffset": 998467384374, "RequestID": "d66a8f3a28e3f29eca3a8e2c288566cb28d0820d", "TotalTokens": 2052}

loss rate @xmath0 . \n the wind and infall collide supersonically , and a shocked shell forms . \n low speeds imply rapid cooling and a geometrically thin shell . \n the dynamics of such time - dependent , thin shells has been discussed in detail by @xcite . \n i include the inputs of mass and momentum from infall , the wind , and the gravitational force due to the protostar . \n for a given evolutionary time and ratio @xmath12 , i determine the minimum wind speed necessary to break out of the infalling flow . \n figure  [ fig : riseandfall ] shows an example calculation of a shell that fails to escape and falls back to the star . in this case , a modest increase in wind speed dramatically changes the outcome , permitting breakout of the shell from the infall region . \n i solved the problem in dimensionless form , which reduces the parameter space from six ( @xmath13 ) to three dimensions ( nondimensional time @xmath14 , wind speed @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) . as a result \n , the parameter space has been fully explored . \n figure  [ fig : nofit ] shows the critical wind speed for breakout . when the wind ram pressure exceeds the infall ram pressure at the stellar surface , the wind may initially push the shell upwards . \n but if the wind speed is less than the critical speed , the shell stalls and falls back . \n this is the trapped wind stage . in figure \n [ fig : nonsteady ] , its duration is the time between the dashed ( ram pressure balance ) curve and the solid one ( critical wind speed ) for a given ratio @xmath17 . \n the results of figures  [ fig : nofit ] and  [ fig : nonsteady ] may be easily scaled to apply to _ anisotropic _ winds , by comparing to an equivalent , isotropic wind having the same mass and momentum loss rates along the z -

third and one - fifth plateau , respectively @xcite . \n the isothermal entropy change can be calculated as a difference of the entropy at non - zero and zero magnetic field @xmath11 at the constant temperature . \n the molar entropy can be easily obtained from the exact results ( 6)-(10 ) presented in ref . \n @xcite for the gibbs free energy @xmath12 according to @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes avogadro s number . \n the adiabatic temperature change @xmath15 can be obtained from the transcendent equation @xmath16 which can be numerically solved by the bisection method . here , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and \n @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) denote the initial ( final ) temperature and magnetic field for a given adiabatic process . \n let us proceed to a discussion of temperature dependences of the isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising octahedron and dodecahedron . \n the isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron is plotted in fig . \n [ fig2](a ) for a few different values of the magnetic - field change . \n as one can see , the isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron is negative for arbitrary magnetic - field change independently of temperature . \n this result implies a substantial cooling performance of the ising octahedron in thermal contact with the heat bath . \n the zero - temperature asymptotic values of the isothermal entropy change are in agreement with the difference of ground - state degeneracy at zero and non - zero magnetic fields . \n if the magnetic - field change is lower than the saturation field of the ising octahedron @xmath21 , then , one finds a gradual increase of the working temperature interval with increasing of the magnetic - field change until roughly a midpoint of the one - third magnetization plateau is reached @xcite . \n however , the largest isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron can be found for the magnetic - field change , which is higher than the saturation field . \n the maximum value of isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron for @xmath22 is @xmath23 at low enough and moderate temperatures ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) , whereas one observes its gradual decrease at higher temperatures ( @xmath26 for @xmath27 at @xmath25 ) . \n the adiabatic temperature change of the ising octahedron linearly increases with temperature up to the threshold temperature , which corresponds to the residual entropy @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is universal gas constant ) of the ising octahedron for a given magnetic - field change , see fig . \n [ fig2](b ) . \n consequently , the ising octahedron achieves the absolute zero temperature during the adiabatic demagnetization process whenever the initial temperature is selected below the threshold temperature forming a cusp in the relevant temperature dependence . \n this result is apparently in contrast with one of the formulations of the third law of thermodynamics @xcite . on the other hand \n , there is a rapid decrease in the adiabatic temperature change above the threshold temperature , which indicates a less efficient cooling . \n the threshold temperature , which corresponds to the residual entropy for a given magnetic - field change , thus defines the working temperature interval of the ising octahedron that monotonically extends with increasing of the magnetic - field change \n .    the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising dodecahedron also shows large mce @xmath30 for most of the magnetic - field changes , see fig . [ \n fig3](a ) . \n the notable exception to this rule represent the field changes approximately equal to the saturation field @xmath31 , for which the inverse mce @xmath32 can be detected in a relatively wide temperature range . \n the most efficient cooling through a thermal contact with the ising dodecahedron can be thus achieved just for sufficiently high values of the magnetic - field change @xmath33 , because the maximal value of isothermal entropy change @xmath34 then persists up to moderate temperatures ( @xmath35 for @xmath36 ) . \n contrary to this , the isothermal entropy change decreases down to @xmath37 at much higher temperature ( @xmath38 for @xmath36 ) . \n the adiabatic temperature change of the ising dodecahedron has a similar behavior as that of the ising octahedron [ see fig.[fig3](b ) ] \n . for arbitrary magnetic - field change there exists the threshold temperature corresponding to the residual entropy @xmath39 , under which the ising dodecahedron reaches the absolute zero temperatures during the adiabatic demagnetization . \n contrary to the ising octahedron , the adiabatic temperature change of the ising dodecahedron may become negative at moderate temperatures as a result of the inverse mce . \n in addition , the adiabatic temperature change is at the same magnetic - field changes less than a half of the adiabatic temperature change of the ising octahedron . in this respect , \n the ising octahedron is more efficient refrigerant than the ising dodecahedron , since it provides a higher gain of the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change at the same values of magnetic - field change due to an absence of the inverse mce . \n in the present work we have exactly examined two basic magnetocaloric characteristics of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron : the isothermal entropy change and adiabatic change of temperature . it has been demonstrated that the largest isothermal entropy change can be found whenever the field change is greater than the saturation field of the relevant ising spin cluster . \n the adiabatic change of temperature confirms an outstanding cooling capability of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron , which may reach during the adiabatic demagnetization absolute zero temperature . \n the ising octahedron and dodecahedron can be therefore regarded as promising frustrated spin structures for magnetic refrigeration , whereas the maximum of the adiabatic change of temperature shifts to higher temperatures with increasing of the magnetic - field change . \n this work was financially supported by grant nos . \n vega 1/0043/16 , apvv-14 - 0073 and vvgs - pf-2016 - 72606 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1045892221746, "RequestID": "412da3da44e677524d54d1fa340474b10cf5cf10", "TotalTokens": 2050}

calibration of the instrument based on a independent energy scale . \n measuring the cosmic ray electron spectrum with an array of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) is , however , a significant challenge . \n the h.e.s.s . \n collaboration was the first to demonstrate that this is at all possible , by applying hard selection cuts ( four telescope multiplicity and a random forest approach )  @xcite . \n subsequently , these measurements were extended to lower energies for h.e.s.s . \n @xcite and now confirmed by magic  @xcite and veritas  @xcite . for current - generation instruments these measurements require long exposures : typically many hundreds of hours . \n spectral measurements for gamma - ray sources make use of background estimates established using regions in the field of view thought to be empty of gamma - ray emission . \n this approach is clearly not possible for electrons , which are close to isotropic . instead a model of the background in terms of some separation parameter ( for example the output of a neural network classifier ) \n must be established . \n this requires a detailed understanding of the development of hadronic cascades in the earth s atmosphere . \n significant differences exist ( at the @xmath4 level ) between hadronic interaction models ( or monte - carlo event / interaction generators ) due to underlying physical uncertainties , particularly in the production of pions with a large forward momentum in the energy range of interest @xcite . \n dedicated instruments at the lhc , such as lhcf and totem , as well as the general purpose atlas and cms detectors , have now significantly reduced the uncertainties in this energy range and models such as epos lhc and qgsjetii are currently being refined to reflect these developments  @xcite . \n the systematic uncertainties on electron spectrum extraction will therefore be much smaller in the near future than those presented in the existing iact publications . \n the next generation facility cta ( the cherenkov telescope array  @xcite ) will employ over 100 telescopes at two sites ( cta - north and cta - south ) , dramatically improving on the performance of current generation iacts . the wider field of view of cta telescopes ( @xmath08@xmath5 diameter ) , lower energy threshold ( @xmath020 gev ) , and very large collection area of the instrument ( typically an order of magnitude larger than current instruments for gamma ray analyses , and even more for electron analyses due to the hard cuts often used , at all energies )  @xcite combine to produce an electron rate after quality selection cuts that is two or more orders of magnitude larger than that measured by current arrays  @xcite at @xmath00.9 tev . furthermore , the background rejection power of cta will be superior to that of current generation instruments , allowing the extraction of the cosmic ray electron spectrum over a wide energy range in a short time , with modest systematic uncertainties  @xcite . \n cta will employ lidar - based atmospheric monitoring systems to measure variation in light propagation through the atmosphere ( @xcite , and references therein ) . whilst these measurements will be used to ensure realistic atmospheric treatment in the monte carlo simulation of the detector response , \n it is highly desirable to have a procedure for continuous confirmation that such measurement procedures have been successful , and as an independent means of deriving correction factors . \n in addition , instrumental effects may change the efficiency with which gamma - like showers trigger the array and pass selection cuts , and/or lead to systematic under or over estimation of photon energy . \n again , cta will make use of multiple methods to characterise such effects , but the approach of deriving the cosmic ray electron spectrum in a routine way for all observations without a significant diffuse gamma - ray component promises a convenient end - to - end method to establish correct performance or to derive correction factors . \n due to the lack of bright diffuse gamma - ray emission in the relevant energy range and the small angular size of point - like sources compared to the instrument field - of - view , the electron spectrum can be extracted from almost all potential cta extragalactic observations without the addition of an gamma - ray electron separation , simply by the removal of significant point sources from a given observation set ( typically 1 source per field in the current generation of telescopes ) .    here , \n we propose a method for a cta electron spectrum measurement and assess the timescales on which the flux normalisation and break energy can be found . \n we go on to discuss the systematic uncertainties associated with this approach and its merits for the array - level calibration of cta . \n to test the feasibility of using the electron spectrum as a means of high level calibration , electron spectral measurements were simulated using the cta - south `` production-2 '' monte carlo dataset  @xcite . \n array layout `` 2q '' was used , which contains 4 large sized telescopes ( 23 m diameter ) , 24 medium sized telescopes ( 12 m ) and 72 small sized telescopes ( 4 m ) . \n direction and energy reconstruction were performed using the cta baseline analysis , under the assumption that the events are diffuse electrons . to ensure the quality of the images that are used in the reconstruction \n , we apply cuts on the number of pixels and number of photo - electrons ( p.e . ) \n , these selection criteria were optimised for the nominal night - sky background rate ( extrapolated from measurements at the h.e.s.s . \n site ) and are summarised in table 1 for each telescope type . to improve the quality of the reconstructed air shower parameters we require that the reconstructed shower direction lies within 4@xmath5 of the telescope pointing direction and that a minimum of four telescopes participated in the reconstruction . \n an artificial neural network was created using the tmva package @xcite to perform classification of electrons from protons . \n the neural network was trained in five energy bins covering the full energy range of the cta instrument ( 0.02100  tev ) , using the following discriminating variables :    * mean scaled event width / length ( see e.g. @xcite ) * root mean square of scaled event width / length between telescopes * root mean square of event energy estimates between telescopes * reconstructed depth of shower maximum ( @xmath6 ) * spread of @xmath6 estimates between telescopes * mean time gradient across an image @xcite    [ tab - telcuts ]    .image cuts for the different type of telescopes . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once trained , an independent sample of simulated data was passed through the network to produce the expected classifier ( @xmath7 ) distributions of electrons and protons . combining these distributions with the correct normalisations to provide \n the expected distribution of events when observing a gamma - ray free region of the sky requires assumptions on the spectra of protons and electrons , for which we adopt the following functional form for protons ( based on data from @xcite ) :    @xmath8    with @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for electrons we have @xmath11^{(\\gamma_{2 } \n - \\gamma_{1})\\alpha}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( the h.e.s.s . \n measurement gives a limit of @xmath17 ) , consistent with measurements using fermi - lat @xcite , ams @xcite and h.e.s.s.@xcite respectively . \n the contribution of heavier cosmic - ray nuclei can be safely ignored , due to their lower expected fluxes and the extremely powerful background rejection for such events . \n this `` data '' distribution can then be scaled and poisson fluctuations added to represent any length of observation time . once this simulated observation expectation has been created , we use a component fitting technique similar to that used in @xcite , using the aforementioned particle classifier distributions to estimate the contribution of each particle type to a given energy bin ( see figure  [ fig - distribution ] ) . the number of electrons in a given bin ( @xmath18 ) can then be estimated by integrating the fitted electron component . \n figure  [ fig - distribution ] gives examples of simulated and fitted @xmath7 distributions , we selected one example below and one example above the energy at which the spectral break occurs . \n spectral fitting was performed using a forward folding technique @xcite , utilising the full energy migration matrix and effective area to produce the expected number of counts for a given spectrum . \n a minimisation was then performed using the minuit package to find the values of the spectral constants where the expected distribution best matches @xmath19 . \n figure  [ fig - spec ] gives illustrative reconstructed electron spectra on different timescales . \n to test the accuracy of the spectral reconstruction 1000 realisations of the @xmath7 distribution in each energy bin were created by adding random poisson fluctuations to the expected event distributions . a spectral fit \n was then performed on each realisation , with the spectral index before and after the break fixed , but with break energy @xmath20 and flux normalisation as free parameters . \n the standard deviation of the distribution of each parameter is taken as the uncertainty of that parameter for a given observation time . \n figure [ fig - accuracy ] shows the evolution of the fractional uncertainty in both the normalisation and break point of the spectrum as a function of observation duration . \n one can see that the uncertainty on the normalisation drops rapidly with time , reaching the 10% level after only @xmath211 minute . \n this rapid improvement in accuracy is achievable as it is possible to calculate the normalisation from only the low energy data , allowing high statistics observations to be made in a relatively short time period . \n the accuracy of the measurement of the break point improves more slowly , taking around 15 minutes to reach a 10% accuracy . \n this difference is due to the requirement of data points reconstructed above 0.9  tev in order to resolve the break . \n figure [ fig - accuracy ] also shows the break point determination is all spectral parameters are left free ( used for example for the measurement of the electron reference spectrum ) the time taken to determine the cut - off to the 10% level is almost a factor of 10 larger , demonstrating the power of having a well known spectral shape . \n further study of the accuracy when using only individual telescope subsystems , shows that the accuracy of this calibration in the most part derives from the mst subsystem , reaching 10% accuracy in almost the same time as the full system . \n this is most likely due to the large effective area in the region of the energy break of this subsystem . whereas the lst subsystem with its much smaller effective area takes around five times longer . while the sst subsystem can take over ten times as long to calibrate to the 10% level , due to the threshold of this system being close to the energy break point . \n [ sec : accuracy ]     dependence is expected , illustrated by the dashed lines . \n [ fig - accuracy ] , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    it should be noted that the current measurement of the electron spectrum has relatively large systematic and statistical uncertainties at high energies , which leads to fairly large uncertainties on the required timescales for determination of the break energy . \n for example , if the break energy is 20% higher than assumed here , the required observation time to reach a given accuracy would increase by a factor @xmath03 . \n the results of section  [ sec : accuracy ] indicate that rapid electron spectral reconstruction should be possible with a next generation iact array , such as the southern and northern cta arrays . however , it is important to consider the impact of systematics on the electron spectral measurement and consequently the use of cosmic ray electrons for calibration purposes . \n the model of calibration using this technique is first to construct a reference electron dataset based on the best atmospheric quality observations . \n this reference dataset can be used to generate a spectral model and if significant anisotropy exists in the reference set , or is established by calet on this timescale , a directional model as well . \n the model can then be compared to the nightwise spectrum , after correction for atmospheric effects . \n this comparison provides an important check of the stability of the cta spectral results over the lifetime of the array and under all atmospheric conditions . \n the absolute reference spectrum is affected by several systematic effects , but in general the relative calibration factors determined by comparison to the reference are much less susceptible to systematics . \n the primary systematic uncertainties are expected to be :    * uncertainties on the classifier distributions for proton showers , due to underlying uncertainties in * hadronic interactions*. such uncertainties will be reduced over the coming decades with data from the lhc , but are unlikely to become negligible . * \n * atmospheric uncertainties * in a given data set are of course one of the main targets of the electron calibration , but uncertainties in the average atmospheric conditions during best possible observing conditions lead to systematics in the reference spectrum . \n cta plans for a thorough characterisation of the atmosphere and hence such uncertainties should be greatly reduced with respect to current iacts . * * detector model / simulation uncertainties * can be reduced over time with careful monitoring as planned for cta , and an iterative approach with the many calibration tools available . \n such uncertainties can also affect the behaviour of the background rejection classifier ( for example in regions of high night sky background noise ) and care must be taken to ensure the stability of such classifiers using monte carlo simulations under different potential observing conditions . \n * any significant cosmic - ray electron * anisotropy * will clearly lead initially to calibration uncertainties for individual pointings , but once established can be modelled and accounted for . the only problematic case is small scale anisotropy at a level of several percent , something which is not to our knowledge predicted by any model . \n many systematic checks are possible to help understand any deviations of measured spectra from the reference , or the reference spectrum from space - based measurements . \n the available data can for example be split into zenith and azimuth bands , into different telescope sub - systems ( large , medium and small size telescopes ) and different seasons , due to the very high statistics obtained overall . \n the advantages of this approach over more traditional methods are the end - to - end nature of the calibration , sensitive to instrumental and atmospheric changes , the similarity of electrons to gamma rays and hence minimisation of systematics associated with extrapolation from the rather different hadronic showers , and the spectral feature , allowing collection area and energy - scale effects to be readily separated . additionally , due to the very high cosmic ray electron statistics available from cta it is possible to compare the electron spectrum reconstructed from arbitrary sub - sets of telescopes , allowing further systematic uncertainties to be probed ( e.g. differing atmospheric absorption across the array footprint ) . \n although not directly investigated here it should also be possible to perform such a calibration at the northern cta site , due to the dominance in the calibration of the msts which cta - north should have in similar numbers . \n the combination of data from ground - level muons with electrons is particularly powerful , with muons providing a means to calibrate individual telescopes  @xcite , and electrons the system as a whole . \n both muons and electrons will be collected during routine iact observations and hence the downtime of the observatory due to special calibration runs is minimised . \n tests of electron spectral reconstruction demonstrate that a measurement of the relative normalisation and energy scaling factor of the cosmic - ray electron spectrum is possible at the 3% level with under one hour of cta observations . \n such short timescale measurements make it possible to use the electron background seen in all observation runs as a `` standard candle '' , allowing the systematics of the gamma - ray spectral reconstruction of cta to be assessed over the lifetime of the instrument . \n this technique can be used in concert with the several absolute calibration techniques for the atmosphere , individual telescopes , and for the full array , that have been proposed for cta @xcite . \n together with point spread function verification using point - like gamma - ray sources ( for example blazar flares ) , this procedure can be used as a high level check of the `` health '' of the instrument over its expected 30 year operational lifetime , ensuring absolute data corrections remain consistent and spectral results are stable . \n this conclusion can of course be extended from cta to any instrument with substantially improved sensitivity and field of view with respect to current iacts . \n this work was done as part of a major simulations and calibration effort for cta , and hence draws on the work and expertise of many members of the cta consortium . \n this paper has gone through internal review by the cta consortium .", "StartTimeOffset": 1053883358010, "RequestID": "9113a720d7843ecb84d6684c72e2997277355cd9", "TotalTokens": 4090}

fig2 ] ( _ right _ ) shows that variations of these parameters for both ir lines have a notable correlation . unlike @xmath27 , \n the velocity of the blue wing edge @xmath29 of these lines does not correlate with @xmath28 . \n this confirms our assumption that the depression of the profile red wing is linked to the flow passing across the line of sight . \n we tried to determine the rotation period , @xmath2 , of hd104237 using a method based on fitting phase dependencies for each value of the trial period @xmath7 with a sinusoid for a wide range of @xmath2 ( 3.8  6.8 days ) with a step width of @xmath30 . \n the parameters of the sinusoid , such as amplitude @xmath31 , constant coefficient c , and initial phase @xmath32 were determined using a standard least - square method for each value of @xmath2 . \n [ ex - fig3 ] ( _ left _ ) illustrates the periodograms calculated for the parameter @xmath28 of the pa@xmath1 line , where @xmath33 is the standard deviation of values from the sine line . \n we calculated also the periodogram for the parameter @xmath34 which is the mean square value of the fractional remainder after dividing all time intervals between neighboring observations by a trial period @xmath2 . \n if the intervals are close to an integer number of @xmath2 , then @xmath34 is close to zero . in our case \n we have found @xmath2 = @xmath35 for the parameter @xmath28 of the pa@xmath1 line and have been convinced that this value does not correspond to a minimum of the parameter @xmath34 . \n therefore , our estimation of @xmath2 is not a result of the sampling dates . \n we plotted periodograms for parameters @xmath28 and @xmath27 for the lines hei @xmath05876 , @xmath010830 and pa@xmath1 : for isaac data ( 8 dates ) , x - shooter data ( 13 dates ) , and all of the dates together ( 21 dates ) . \n the total number of obtained periodograms was 14 , the parameters of the sinusoid @xmath31 and @xmath32 were determined for each case . \n after averaging , the results were : @xmath2 = @xmath36 , @xmath32 = @xmath37 . \n the phase dependencies of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath27 for different lines in the spectrum of hd104237 are illustrated in fig . \n [ ex - fig3 ] ( _ right _ ) . \n using standard formulas , we derived the inclination angle @xmath38 . \n several estimations of the stellar radius @xmath39 were given in @xcite with a mean value of @xmath40@xmath41 . \n the following values of @xmath42sin@xmath38 were published in different papers : @xmath43kms@xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45kms@xmath44 @xcite , and @xmath46kms@xmath44 @xcite . \n adopting @xmath42sin@xmath38=@xmath47kms@xmath44 , we derived @xmath4 .    for hd190073 , we had only 11 spectra in the ir region in the period 2010  2013 , which was not enough for a detailed study . \n the analysis of 51 optical spectra near the hei @xmath05876 line showed the presence of a large - amplitude variability on the timescale from 1 day to several years . \n we separated two main types of this variability , which is illustrated in fig . \n [ ex - fig4 ] ( _ left _ ) : _ a ) _ a global change of intensity of the line without variations in the shape of the profile ( type  i ) , and _ \n b ) _ a distortion of the red wing of the emission profile , as also observed for hd104237 ( type  ii ) . \n [ ex - fig4 ] ( _ right _ ) shows the correlations of @xmath27 and @xmath29 with the @xmath28 of the line . in the case of the @xmath29/@xmath28 dependency , \n a notable but rather weak correlation is observed ( @xmath48 ) . \n this correlation corresponds to the type  i variability . \n the @xmath27/@xmath28 correlation is much stronger ( @xmath49 ) , it corresponds to both variability types  i and ii . we can see that the contribution of the type  ii variability is rather strong in the global behavior of the hei @xmath05876 line profile variations in the spectra of hd190073 . \n unfortunately , other attempts to exactly determine the @xmath2 of hd190073 were not successful . \n however , the behaviour of the @xmath27/@xmath28 parameter confirms ( as in the case of hd104237 ) our assumption of a rotating accretion flow that distorts the red wing of the emission hei @xmath05876 profile . \n we assume that the magnetic field configuration of hd190073 can be more complex than a simple dipole , and the whole picture of spectral variability is less simple . \n magnetic field measurements were done using high - resolution spectra of hd104237 and hd190073 obtained using the harps instrument in polarimetric mode , installed at the 3.6-m eso telescope ( chile ) and retrieved from the eso archive . \n we used the multiline singular value decomposition ( svd ) method for stokes profile reconstruction @xcite . \n for hd104237 , we can see polarization features corresponding to the primary component ( rather marginal ) and to the secondary component of this binary system ( fig . \n [ ex - fig5 ] , _ left _ ) . \n the latter is quite notable with @xmath50 g . \n this is the first discovery of the magnetic field of the secondary of hd104237 . \n another situation is found for hd190073 . instead of one polarization feature corresponding to the svd absorption line , \n we see two features of opposite signs centered at emission wings around the central absorption ( fig . \n [ ex - fig5 ] , _ right _ ) . \n it is possible that the cs component has a significant contribution to the general configuration of the magnetic field of hd190073 . \n this work was supported by the basic research program of the presidium of the russian academy of sciences p-21 `` non -

{"ContextTokens": 3994, "GeneratedTokens": 353, "SynthesizedBody": "the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) portion of the solar spectrum is known to exert a significant influence on the earth s upper atmosphere , particularly during periods of increased solar activity @xcite . \n for example , fluctuations in the level of euv flux received at 1  au can generate changes in the ionospheric density . @xcite and ( * ? ? ? \n * and later @xcite ) quantified these changes using broadband sfd ( sudden frequency deviation ) ionospheric observations to show that the euv flux from 1103  nm ( 101030   ) rises and falls during solar flares in correlation with hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission , typically around 1020  kev . \n the authors concluded that this euv emission ( which comprises free - free , free - bound , and bound - bound emission ) originated in the solar chromosphere and was due to interactions with free electrons liberated by nonthermal particles accelerated during the flare s impulsive phase . \n in addition to being the source of the most geoeffective emission during solar flares , the chromosphere is also where the bulk of a flare s energy is radiated @xcite as well as the source of the high - temperature plasma visible in coronal loops via the process of chromospheric evaporation ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n euv ( and uv ) observations of the chromosphere are therefore an important diagnostic of the heating mechanism(s ) responsible for driving increased emission at these wavelengths . \n simulations by @xcite , using the radyn code of @xcite , which modelled the chromospheric response to both electron beam heating and backwarming from xeuv ( x - ray and euv ) photons , suggested that chromospheric emission is energetically dominated by various recombination ( free - bound ) continua , in particular , the lyman , balmer , and paschen continua of hydrogen , and the and continua , as opposed to line ( bound - bound ) emission . \n lccc & wavelength range & time of peak emission & total energy radiated + & ( nm ) & relative to goes peak ( 01:56 ut ) & from 01:4504:00  ut ( ergs ) + ly-@xmath0 line & 116.6126.6 & -0m38s & 1@xmath110@xmath2 + free -

bound emission during solar flares have been scarce in recent years as many modern space - based instruments do not have the sensitivity , wavelength coverage , or duty cycle required to capture unambiguous continuum enhancements during flares . during the 1970 s , \n chromospheric continuum observations were much more prevalent due to instruments onboard skylab and the orbiting solar observatory ( oso ) series of satellites ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n more recently , @xcite made a serendipitous detection of increased lyman continuum from an x - class flare via scattered light in the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) instrument onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) satellite . \n @xcite also made a fortuitous detection of increased lyman continuum emission during a stellar flare on an active m - type star with instruments onboard the extreme ultra - violet explorer ( euve ) . \n in addition , they presented tentative evidence for increased helium continuum emission blue - ward of the 50.4  nm recombination edge . understanding how different continua contribute to the overall energy of flares , including the depth of the atmosphere at which it is emitted and the mechanisms by which it is generated , are therefore crucial for corroborating solar flare models .    in this letter we present new observations from the euv variability experiment ( eve ; @xcite ) instrument onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; the first mission from nasa s living with a star program ) which show unambiguous , spectrally and temporally - resolved detections of the enhanced continua during the first x - class flare of solar cycle 24 which occurred on 2011 february 15 . here \n we focus on the free - free continuum , and on the free - bound continua of hydrogen and helium . \n eve was primarily designed to measure the variations in the solar euv irradiance on timescales from seconds to decades , and with high precision . \n however , our findings , in conjunction with x - ray observations from the ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; @xcite ) , highlight eve s ability to help answer long - standing , fundamental questions on solar flare energetics , in particular , the structure and dynamics of the lower solar atmosphere and the origins of white light emission . \n section  [ data_anal ] describes the eve data and their analyses , while section  [ results ] compares the eve data with those from goes and rhessi to discuss the timing and energetics of the continuum emission and possible heating mechanisms . \n section  [ conc ] discusses the implications of these findings and their importance for future studies . \n the eve instrument acquires full disk ( sun - as - a - star ) euv spectra every 10 seconds over the 6.537  nm ( 65370   ) wavelength range using its megs - a ( multiple euv grating spectrographs ) component with a near 100% duty cycle . \n its megs - b component , which covers the 37 - 105  nm wavelength range , and megs - p component , a broadband ( 10  nm ) diode covering the lyman-@xmath0 line at 121.6  nm , only acquire data for three hours per day , and 5 minutes every hour to minimize instrument degradation . \n however , for one or two days per month , particularly if the sun is active , megs - b and megs - p take data continuously to measure changes in the euv irradiance during the largest eruptive events . \n during one such campaign ( 2011 february 1416 ) , the first x - class flare of solar cycle 24 occurred ( an x2.2 flare which began at 01:44  ut ; sol2011 - 02 - 15t01:56 ) . \n figure  [ eve_spec ] shows sample eve spectra from both megs - a and megs - b taken just before the flare occurred . noted on the figure \n are the locations of the recombination edges of at 22.8  nm , at 50.4  nm , and the lyman edge at 91.2  nm . \n the current eve data products ( level 2 , version 3 ) are validated up to 75  nm  with an accuracy of about 10% . \n while the validation effort of the eve irradiance is on - going , the uncertainty of the megs - b irradiance values in the 75105  nm range is much larger , as much as an order of magnitude . \n however , for the purposes of this study , a cross - calibration with the thermosphere ionosphere mesosphere energetics and dynamics / solar euv experiment ( timed / see ; @xcite ) instrument was performed , which revealed a correction factor of @xmath5    where @xmath6 is in nm . \n this correction factor is only valid for megs - b data in the range 75  nm@xmath791.2  nm taken during february 2011 and allows the absolute irradiance from the lyman continuum to be measured . \n the corrected data are shown in orange in figure  [ eve_spec ] , and are not applicable to the continuum , the tail of which is visible above 91.2  nm . \n figure  [ plot_cont_fits ] shows portions of the eve spectrum taken near the sxr peak of the flare ( after subtracting out a 90-second averaged - from 01:00:1201:01:42  ut - pre - flare profile ) across the entire megs - a wavelength range ( panel @xmath8 ) , and around each of the three recombination edges ( denoted by the vertical dashed lines in panels @xmath9@xmath10 ) . \n these data show that the free - free emission , which spans the entire megs - a wavelength range , and the free - bound emission blue - ward of each recombination edge were clearly enhanced during the flare . to estimate the absolute increase in continuum emission due to the flare , the data were fit with exponential functions to approximate the contribution from each continuum . in order to reduce the influence of the myriad emission lines superimposed on each continuum , a synthetic spectrum for each wavelength range \n was generated using chianti , assuming its standard flare dem ( from @xcite ) , coronal abundances , the ionization fractions of @xcite , and an electron density of 10@xmath11  @xmath12 . \n although the standard chianti flare dem is only relevant to the decay phase of flares , this synthetic spectrum was used merely as a guide to identify spectral regions which were free of any emission lines ( at the eve resolution ) as denoted by the vertical dotted lines in figure  [ plot_cont_fits ] , rather than to infer any properties of the measured continua themselves . \n these regions were then averaged over and fit with the exponential functions . \n fits to the spectrum near the sxr peak of the flare are denoted by the solid colored lines overlaid on each panel in figure  [ plot_cont_fits ] ( _ see online material for a movie of these fits throughout the event _ ) .        the free - free emission shown in panel @xmath8 is probably due to bremsstrahlung radiation from free electrons in the corona , unlike the free - bound emission from and which is chromospheric in origin . \n superimposed on top of the free - free continuum , in addition to the multitude of emission lines formed between 10@xmath1310@xmath14  k , lies the free - bound continuum of ( denoted by the blue curve shortward of the edge at 22.8  nm ) . \n therefore , to accurately measure the contribution from the continuum , the free - free contribution must be subtracted from the data before fitting the data between 21 and 22.8  nm . \n the fit to the free - free subtracted data is shown in panel @xmath15 . \n the top panel of figure  [ eve_hsi_goes_ltc ] shows the total amount of irradiance emitted ( in w  m@xmath16 ) by each continuum process , estimated by integrating under the exponential fits described in section  [ data_anal ] for each 10 second interval throughout the flare . \n lightcurves of the 30.4  nm ( green curve ) and ly-@xmath0 121.6  nm ( purple curve ) lines are also included for comparison as these are believed to be significant radiators of the energy deposited by nonthermal electrons during flares @xcite . \n the goes 0.10.8  nm x - ray lightcurve is shown as the solid black curve . \n this plot shows that the ly-@xmath0 line clearly dominates the radiative output , generating over 10@xmath2  ergs throughout the event as indicated by the cumulative energy plot in the inset of the top right - and corner of the panel ( see also @xcite for a summary of previous ly-@xmath0 flare observations ) . \n the wavelength and time ranges over which the irradiance was integrated are listed in table  [ eve_time_energy ] , along with the time of peak emission and the total amount of energy emitted via each process during the course of the flare . \n the peak in the ly-@xmath0 lightcurve near 01:44 ut could be pre - flare enhancements , but is more likely due to measurement noise . \n the eve ly-@xmath0 channel measurement precision is only about 10% , versus about 1% for the other eve channels . \n consequently , the eve ly-@xmath0 measurements have more noise in their time series . \n in addition , this ly-@xmath0 channel is a photodiode versus a ccd for the megs channels , so the high energy particles in the sdo orbit cause spikes in the ly-@xmath0 data time series , versus just affecting a pixel or two on the ccd sensors . \n the data processing algorithms do attempt to make a correction for these spikes in the data time series , but not all of the spikes are successfully removed . \n the small peak of the ly-@xmath0 lightcurve near 01:44  ut could well just be effect of smoothing over one of these high energy particle spikes    of the three free - bound continua studied , the lyman continuum ( red curve , figure  [ eve_hsi_goes_ltc ] ) was found to be the most energetic . \n the time profile rose sharply at @xmath1701:47:30  ut ( denoted by the solid black vertical line ) , synchronous with the 2550  kev emission as observed by rhessi ( cyan curve , bottom panel ) , suggesting that the continuum emission was a result of hydrogen ions recombining with free electrons that were ionized in the chromosphere by nonthermal particles . \n the lightcurve also peaks around the time of the hxr bursts observed at 50100  kev ( vertical dashed red line ) . the total energy radiated by the lyman continuum over the course of the flare \n was calculated to be 4@xmath110@xmath3  ergs . \n the continuum showed a similar behavior to that of the hydrogen continuum , with an abrupt rise in step with the low energy hxrs , peaking with higher energy emission ( vertical dashed orange line ) . \n however the total energy emitted was an order of magnitude lower at 4@xmath110@xmath4  ergs . \n the free - free continuum ( cyan curve ) began to rise at the same time as the lyman continuum , but at a slower rate , and continued to increase after the lyman continuum had peaked . \n the free - free emission reached its maximum at @xmath1702:01  ut ; 5 minutes after the peak in goes sxrs , and remained elevated above its pre - flare level for longer . \n as such , more energy was emitted by the free - free process compared to any of the free - bound continua over the same time period ( 8@xmath110@xmath3  ergs ) . \n the continuum , which is superimposed on top of the free - free continuum , also showed a similar gradual rise phase and a later time of peak emission , although was 40 times weaker . \n however , the measured timing may be due to inaccuracies in the fitting , as the continuum is weak and noisy . \n it may also be biased by the underlying free - free emission which the helium emission had to rise above as the flare progressed .    finally , the 30.4  nm line also exhibited a shallower rise than that of the free - bound emission , but still peaked around the time of the hxr emission ( vertical dashed green line ) . \n the total energy radiated by this line was comparable to that of the lyman continuum at 3@xmath110@xmath3  ergs . \n the findings presented in this letter highlight the capability of the eve instrument to determine increases in euv continuum emission ( both free - free and free - bound ) during solar flares by giving the first comprehensive look at these diagnostically important emissions . from figure  [ eve_hsi_goes_ltc ] and table  [ eve_time_energy ] \n it is shown the free - free continuum emission dominated over the free - bound processes in terms of total energy emitted throughout the flare , although it peaked relatively later . by comparison the total energy emitted via emission lines ( bound - bound processes ) over the entire eve spectral range ( not including those listed in table  [ eve_time_energy ] ) was 4@xmath110@xmath2  ergs . comparing these energies with the compilation by @xcite \n it can be concluded that the total energy in the eve range amounts to a few per cent of the total flare energy . \n a comparison of the lightcurves derived from eve with those from rhessi indicate that the and continua are generated in the chromosphere as the hydrogen and helium ions recombine with free electrons ionized during the flare s impulsive phase . \n by contrast , the increase in free - free emission correlates well with goes sxr emission suggesting that it is coronal in origin . \n this free - free emission may also be a significant contributor to images taken with the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) instrument , also onboard sdo . \n aia comprises 7 passbands that lie within the eve / megs - a spectral range . as the free - free emission increases at shorter wavelengths , its contribution is likely to be greater in the higher temperature channels , such as 94    and 131 \n ( see also @xcite ) . \n these findings mark a significant advancement over the previous broadband ( 1103  nm ) observations of @xcite and @xcite , as now each continuum process can be individually resolved and determined as a function of time . as such \n , the continuum emission itself can be an important tool for diagnosing chromospheric heating when used in conjunction with x - ray observations from rhessi , and numerical simulations such as the radyn code of @xcite , which has been adapted by @xcite to include heating from nonthermal electrons and xeuv backwarming . \n future eve observations are therefore likely to provide a wealth of information on the structure and dynamics of the solar chromosphere , and its relationship to the flaring process . \n this research was a result of several stimulating discussions between participants at a meeting on chromospheric flares held at the international space science institute ( issi ) in bern , switzerland . \n rom is grateful to the leverhulme trust for financial support from grant f/00203/x . \n hsh was supported by nasa under contract nas5 -

{"ContextTokens": 3210, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "the aim of this study is to analyze the structure of the surface of a lennard jones frozen liquid ( within a depth of a few tens of lennard jones units ) . \n our lennard jones liquid may be compared to a model of glass for which the glass transition would have been obtained instantaneously from the liquid . \n different studies deal with the analysis of glass surface.they mainly concern the chemical nature of the surface . in the case of silicate and silica glasses , \n there are different numerical models , see for that the following references @xcite ; these previous references studied the structure , attack of water and the presence of free oxygen atoms on the surface of silicate glasses ( with dangling bonds , as there are lacking hydrogens ) as well as the variation of composition at the surface . \n but very few numerical study of the surface of simple models of liquids or glasses have been made up to now @xcite . \n stallons and iglesia @xcite studied the free surface of a simple model of silica glass using the stillinger weber potential and found that the surface of their glasses was less dense than the bulk . \n we deal here with the surface of a lennard jones frozen liquid . here \n the action of the atmosphere and the presence or not of dangling bonds have not been studied . \n we are interested in the change in the structure of the free surface of a simple model of frozen liquid ( lennard jones liquid ) without any external action , only the fact that there are no periodic boundary conditions in one direction : the free surface . after obtaining the lennard jones structure with a free surface by classical molecular dynamics computation \n , we analyzed the free surface structure with the calculations of structure factors corresponding to different depths within the sample . \n this analysis is completed by the computation of the density as a function of depth within the sample and by computation during melting , of the spatial correlation function in the bulk and at the surface .    the computational method used for the sample preparation as for the calculation of the structure factor curves \n are presented in section ii . \n section iii shows the results which are discussed . and \n finally , section iv is the conclusion . \n we used the classical molecular dynamics to compute a lennard jones liquid . \n the potential was a lennard jones 6:12 potential cut at a distance 2.5 lennard jones units . \n we began the simulation with a fcc structure which was melt in 2.5@xmath0 ( 250 molecular dynamics - md- steps ) . \n this is the time needed to obtain total melting ( i.e. no further melting ) . \n the computation was done out of equilibrium : i.e. due to the free surface we could not impose a nvt or npt equilibrium during melting . \n we chose an instantaneous cooling ( in 1 md step ) in order to prevent the sample from shearing phenomena which would rearrange the structure even at its surface . \n thus our sample is just a frozen lennard jones liquid . \n the sample has periodic boundary conditions in all directions except on two free surfaces on the bottom and on the top of it . as the aim of this study is the analysis of the free surface of lennard jones frozen liquids , we had to add these two free surfaces surrounded by vacuum . \n the initial box ( not taking into account the boundary conditions ) has a dimension of @xmath1 lennard jones ( lj ) units corresponding to 320000 lj particles .    in order to analyze only the action of the free surface on the corresponding structure factors \n , we had to cut the initial box containing the lj frozen liquid into two , according to its depth . \n unless , there would be action of the two free surfaces on the bottom and on the top of the simulated lj frozen liquid , and the resulting structure factor curves would be to difficult to analyze . \n furthermore it would not be a physical model of the surface of frozen liquids . \n the fact that we have a free surface before having melt and frozen the sample allows us to obtain a free relaxed surface on the top of the bulk of the lennard jones frozen liquid . \n we used a similar calculation as in reference @xcite to obtain the structure factor the difference is that the domain of computation is limited by the upper surface surrounded by vacuum and a given depth within the numerical sample . \n indeed , the wave vector may be written : @xmath2 the calculation of the structure factor curves is the following : @xmath3\\exp i { \\bf q}. { \\bf r}| ^2\\ ] ] where @xmath4 comes from the replacement of the integral by discrete sum over the lj particles , @xmath5 is the scattering volume ( in order to normalize all different results depending on the analyzed depth ) . \n @xmath6 is the concentration of the sample which we have calculated as function of the depth of the sample . \n this last feature ensures that @xmath7 tends to zero when @xmath8 tends to zero . \n then we introduce a double sum to expand the square , and , assuming isotropy in the plane ( but not in the depth of the sample ) , we average over all directions of @xmath8 to get : @xmath9+c^2 ) x \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 then , transforming the double sum into a sum over all possible values for the distance @xmath11 and separating the @xmath12 contribution from the others , we obtain : @xmath13 ) \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the mean number of lj particles at a distance @xmath11 of a given lj particle ( pair correlation function ) and where @xmath15 is the same quantity for a density equal to 1 . \n figure 1 exhibits the typical structure factor for different depths in lj units . at this scale \n it is not possible to make any difference between the curves . anyway , let us remark that the curves are typical of a glassy material with several peaks . \n the first peak located at approximately at @xmath16 i.e. at a distance equal approximately to 3 lj units . \n this result shows that there is , in our lennard jones frozen liquid , a short range order up to 3 lj units . \n however , the intensities of the structure factors have been normalized by the analyzed volume ( see section ii.b for details concerning this normalization ) . \n this last feature explains that we have no vertical shift for different structure factors . \n figure 2 presents a zoom of the previous curves ( figure 1 ) for @xmath17 lj units@xmath18 . \n one may see that there is a difference for the curve corresponding to a depth of 5 lj units compared to the others . \n figure 3 is also a zoom of the curves presented in figure 1 but for a different location than figure 2 , here @xmath19 lj units@xmath18 . \n one may see again that the curve corresponding to the depth equal to 5 lj units is different from the others .    finally , and in order to be able to understand our computed structure factor curves we plotted the number of lj particles as a function of the depth from the free surface of the sample ( see figure 4 ) . \n the numerical simulation box begins at height @xmath20 lj units but as explained in section ii , we cut the sample into two , so the bottom of the sample corresponds to @xmath21 lj units and the free surface of the sample to @xmath22 lj units . \n figure 5 exhibits the distribution of the lj particles whose center of mass is contained in the slice for @xmath23 . \n this may be compared to figure 6 which is the distribution of the centers of mass of the lj particles for @xmath24 , i.e. for the same width following @xmath25 . \n the fact that there are zones without particles in figure 6 is explained by the width of the analyzed slice : it is less than 1 lj unit . in figure 5 , the void zones are much larger , as expected from the variation of the number of particles presented in figure 4 . \n what can be observed is that distribution is rather homogeneous . in order to go further in this analysis , we computed the two points correlation function : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of particles in the slice and @xmath28 is the number of particles at distance @xmath11 from another particle . \n we computed the evolution of this two points correlation function as a function of computation times of the sample structure , during melting . \n we chose a depth of this slice equal to 0.3 because it corresponds to the depth where the surface has a lower density . \n although the depth of the slice is only 0.3 lj particles , we chose the slices at the surface and in the bulk so that we get half of a fcc elementary cell in the slice at the beginning of computation \n . figures 7-a ( left and right ) are the correlation functions at the beginning of computation ( for the fcc structure ) at the very surface and in the bulk . \n one may see a peaked distribution function . \n this is due to the crystalline structure of the fcc initial distribution . \n fig.7-b,7-c and 7d correspond respectively to 100 md time steps , 200 md time steps and 250 md time steps ( corresponding to the frozen liquid ) . \n we can observe that the right and left figures 7 are very similar and we will discuss the small differences between bulk and surface later in the discussion.the correlation function ( for times t=100 md and 200 md time steps ) becomes similar to a random packing except that there are one peak at a distance equal to 1 lj units . \n this means that there is short range correlation during melting and that aggregates most likely remain during melting . \n this peak almost disappears when the liquid is frozen for 250 md time steps . \n fig.7d shows that there is no more a short range correlation and that the lj particles are more equally distributed over the slice .    and \n finally , figure 8 is the plot of the number of particles per lj unit volume for a slice of depth 0.3 lj units at the very surface and in the bulk . \n we observed that the density of our lj frozen liquid near the surface is lower only at the very surface for a depth included between @xmath29 lj units . \n there is an increasing density for @xmath30 lj units and this is much less than the correlation length of about 3 lj units ( see above ) \n . therefore the mean density for a depth of @xmath31 lj units is lower than for larger depths for which the low density of the free surface is negligible by averaging the density over the volume . \n this explains that we have no differences between the structure factors for lower depths , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 lj units and very small differences for @xmath34 lj units . \n we cut the sample in the @xmath35 direction and checked that the density did not vary at @xmath36 and at @xmath37 compared to the bulk . \n to better understand the origin of these small differences it is interesting to compare the evolution of the density at the very surface and in the bulk during melting . \n the evolution of the density within the bulk and at the very surface , represented in figure 8 , shows that there is not a large difference between the two curves . \n this means that the lj particles belonging to the surface have sufficient connections with other particles in the bulk and within the surface to prevent them to lower the density at the very surface and to prevent them from evaporation . \n one can observe that in the bulk , the density decreases during the first md computation steps and remains constant for all others computation times . on the other hand \n , there is another lowering of density of the upper surface during the last freezing step . \n considering now the two points correlation function , and comparing the left curves of figure 7 ( at the very surface ) and right curves ( in the bulk ) , we can observe a few differences . \n first in figure 7b , there are regular oscillations for 100md time steps in the figure corresponding to the bulk , indicating that correlations between particles in the bulk remains on a larger time scale than at the very surface ; these last disappear for 200 md time . in figure 7d \n , one can observe that at the end of melting , there are more particles at shorter distances in the bulk than at the very surface . \n this is well evidenced in figures 5 and 6 . \n using data of figures 5 and 6 , we computed the mean distance between the particles eliminating the void zones ( i.e. : distances larger than 1.5 ) . \n we obtained almost the same mean distance for the bulk and for the surface of about 1.1 lj unit . \n the particles stop to move during melting when they reach a mean distance between particle of 1.1 lj unit which is the maximum of the attractive part of the lj potential ( if we eliminate the void zones ) . \n this means that the arrangement of particles are almost the same than in the bulk , but that there is a kind of `` roughness '' at the very surface due to large void zones . \n we can say that the free surface of a lj frozen liquid has also surface defects ( i.e. the surface is less dense as shown in figure 4 and as deduced from figures 2 and 3 ) . \n there are some larger `` voids '' at the very surface and a few particles rising above the mean surface . but \n these effects concern only the region very next to the surface ( for a depth lower than 1 lj unit ) . \n the effect of the free surface induce changes in the structure only for the first lj particles layer . \n moreover , the bulk conserves aggregates during melting while the surface loses this order more rapidly ( in figure 7 , the peak at abscissa 1 is smaller for the surface for 100md and 200md than for the bulk ) .    as a conclusion \n , the shape of the lj potential leads to a surface where the density is of course lower because of contact with vacuum . \n the surface has a structure of homogeneously distributed particles which interaction is the largest attractive possible with the lj potential surrounded by void zones : the surface is rough . \n we computed the structure factors as a function of the depth near the surface of a lennard jones frozen liquid . \n the results are that very close to the surface the density of the numerical frozen liquid is lower . \n this is compared with the analysis of the density as a function of depth into the numerical frozen liquid and explains the shift toward lower @xmath38 of the structure factor curves for lower depths . \n our lennard jones frozen liquid is less dense near its surface which means that the set up of the sample itself , i.e. with a free surface leads to a rearrangement of the lj particles without any external action ( like the attack of water on real glasses ) . \n the interesting conclusion of our work is that even in a lennard jones frozen liquid ( i.e. without any action of water : presence of atmosphere or without any presence of dangling bonds ) the density and structure modification induced by the free surface only concern a very small depth of the sample ( smaller than 1 lj unit ) . during melting in the lj fcc then lj liquid , the lj particle rearrange to become very rapidly a quasi two dimensional amorphous material on the surface .", "StartTimeOffset": 1087524713718, "RequestID": "a1885531a71f0159a85914e4af015d671612a201", "TotalTokens": 3364}

{"ContextTokens": 3471, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "on saturday , august 16th 2008 , usain bolt shattered the world record of 100 meter dash in the bird s nest at the beijing olympics 2008 . in a spectacular run dubbed `` the greatest 100 meter performance in the history of the event '' by michael johnson , bolt finished at 9.69 seconds , improving his own previous world record from earlier this year by 0.03 seconds . \n however , the most impressive fact about this run was the way in which he did it : after accelerating away from the rest of the field , he looked to his sides when two seconds and 20 meters remained , and when that noting he was completely alone , he started celebrating ! \n he extended his arms , and appeared to almost dance along the track .    despite this , he broke the world record by 0.03 seconds . \n but , needless to say , this celebration left spectators and commentators all over the world wondering about one big question : what would the world record have been if he had _ not _ celebrated the last 20 meters ? \n bolt s coach , glen mills , recently suggested at a press conference of the golden league tournament in zrich , that the record could have been 9.52 seconds , or even better . \n we wanted to check this for ourselves , by attempting to measure bolt s position as a function of time , and extrapolate from the dynamics before the celebration began , into the last two seconds of the race . \n based on ( hopefully ) reasonable assumptions , we could then obtain an estimate of the new world record .    in this paper \n we analyze footage of the run obtained from various web sites and the norwegian broadcasting corporation ( nrk ) , with the goal of estimating this `` hypothetical '' world record . the main technical difficulty in performing this analysis lies in obtaining accurate distance measurements as a function of time for each runner . \n fortunately , this task is made considerably easier by the presence of a moving camera mounted to a rail along the track . \n this rail is bolted to the ground at regular intervals , and thereby provides the required standard ruler . using the methods detailed in the following sections , and properly taking into account all major sources of statistical uncertainty , we believe that our measurements are sufficiently accurate and robust to support interesting conclusions . \n our analysis is based on the following simple steps :    1 . \n we first obtained several different videos of the race from the internet ( nbc and bbc ) and the norwegian broadcasting company ( nrk ) , and printed out @xmath3 screen shots at different times from these . \n we then constructed a standard ruler by counting the total number of bolts ( called `` ticks '' in the following ) on the rail of the moving camera along the 100 meter track ( see figure [ fig : screenshot ] ) . \n we assumed the distance between these to be constant . \n 3 .   next , we drew lines orthogonal to the track , using whatever means most accurate for a given screen shot . for early and late frames , lines in the actual track itself ( e.g. , starting and finishing lines ) were most useful , while for intermediate frames , the lower right edge of the camera mount was utilized ( figure [ fig : screenshot ] ) . \n 4 .   for a given frame , we then read off the positions of usain bolt and richard thompson , the runner - up , with the ruler , and recorded these together with the time from the screen clock . \n next , we assigned an uncertainty to each distance measurement , by estimating how many ticks we believed we were off in a given frame . \n for later frames , when the camera angle is almost orthogonal to the track , this uncertainty is smaller than in the beginning of the race because of the camera perspective . \n 6 .   based on these uncertainties \n , we fitted a smooth spline with inverse variance weights to the data . \n this provided us with a smooth approximation to the runners positions as a function of time , and also with the first and second derivatives , i.e. , their speeds and accelerations . \n 7 .   to make the projections , we consider two cases : \n first , we conservatively assume that bolt would have been able to keep up with thompson s acceleration profile in the end race after 8 seconds of elapsed time , and project a new finishing time . \n second , given his clearly stronger acceleration around 6 seconds , we also consider the case in which he is able to maintain a @xmath40.5 m/@xmath5 higher acceleration than thompson through to the end . \n the final goal is the new projected world record , which is found by extrapolating the resulting motion profile to 100 meters . \n we also estimate the uncertainty in this number by repeating the above analysis 10000 times , each time adding a random fluctuation with specified uncertainties to each time and tick count . \n ccccccl 0.0 & -7.0 & 0.0 & -7.0 & 0.0 &

cameras located along the finishing line at slightly different positions . \n specifically , the clips were obtained from nrk , nbc , and bbc . \n unfortunately , the nrk and bbc clips were filmed with cameras positioned fairly close to the track , and the rail of the moving camera therefore disappears outside the field - of - view after about 6 seconds . \n this is not the case for the nbc clip , which was filmed from further away . even though the quality of this version is rather poor \n , it is possible to count the number of ticks to the end .    using these data sets \n , we measured the position of usain bolt and richard thompson at 16 different times in units of ticks . \n these are all listed in table [ tab : data ] . \n there are three issues that must be addressed before the tick counts listed in table [ tab : data ] can be translated into proper distance measurements . \n first , the camera rail is not visible entirely to the starting line , as the very first part is obscured by a camera man . \n the tick counts in table [ tab : data ] are therefore counted relative to the first visible tick . \n fortunately , it is not very problematic to extrapolate into the obscured region by using the distance between the visible ticks , and knowing that the distance between the starting lines for the 100 meter dash and 110 meter hurdles is precisely 10 meters . \n we estimate the number of obscured ticks to be @xmath6 . \n second , the precision of the screen clock is only a tenth of a second , and the clock also appears to truncate the time , not round off . \n we therefore add 0.05 seconds to each time measurement , and define our uncertainty in time to uniform between -0.05 and 0.05 seconds . \n finally , the screen clock is not calibrated perfectly with the stadium clock . \n ( see figure 1 for an example frame . ) \n a little more than half of all frames appear to be synchronized , while in the rest the screen clock is lagging behind by 0.1 seconds . \n we assume that the stadium clock is the correct one , and re - calibrate the screen clock by adding an additional 0.04 seconds to each time measurement .    with these assumptions , \n it is straightforward to calibrate both the clock and distance measurements , and this is done in the corresponding columns in table [ tab : data ] . \n with calibrated distance information ready at hand , it is straightforward to make the desired predictions . \n first , we compute a smooth spline @xcite , @xmath7 , through each of the two runners measured positions . \n a nice bonus of using splines is that we automatically obtain the second derivatives of @xmath8 ( ie . , \n acceleration ) at each time step , and also the first derivatives ( ie . , \n speed ) , @xmath9    to obtain a well - behaved spline , we impose three constraints . \n first , we add two auxiliary data points at @xmath10 and @xmath11 seconds . \n these are not measurements , but included only in order to guarantee sensible boundary conditions at each end : the first one implies that the starting velocity is zero , while the last one leads to a smooth acceleration at the finishing line . \n thirdly , we adopt a smooth spline stiffness parameter of @xmath12 @xcite to minimize unphysical fluctuations . \n the results are fairly insensitive to the specific value of this parameter . \n the resulting functions are plotted in figure [ fig : evolution ] . some interesting points to notice \n are the following :    * bolt and thompson are virtually neck by neck up to four seconds , corresponding to a distance of 35 meters . \n * bolt s olympic gold medal is essentially won between 4 and 8 seconds . \n * at 8 seconds bolt decelerates noticeably , and thompson equalizes and surpasses bolt s speed . \n note however that thompson is also not able to maintain his speed to the very end , but runs out of power after about 8.5 seconds . \n still , his acceleration is consistently higher than bolt s after 8 seconds . \n we are now in the position to quantitatively answer the original question : how fast would bolt really have run , if he had nt celebrated the last 2 seconds ? to make this projection , we consider the following two scenarios :    1 . \n bolt matches thompson s acceleration profile after 8 seconds . 2 . \n bolt maintains a 0.5 m / s@xmath0 higher acceleration than thompson after 8 seconds . \n the justification of scenario 1 is obvious , as bolt outran thompson between 4 and 8 seconds . \n the justification of scenario 2 is more speculative , as it is difficult to quantify exactly _ how much _ stronger bolt was . \n still , looking at the acceleration profiles in figure [ fig : evolution ] , and noting that bolt traditionally was considered a 200 meter specialist , a value of 0.5 m / s@xmath0 seems fairly realistic . \n then , for each scenario we compute a new trajectory for bolt by choosing initial conditions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and an acceleration profile as described above . \n the computation of these trajectories are performed by simply integrating equation [ eq : v_and_a ] with respect to time , @xmath15    in figure [ fig : end_run ] we compare the projected trajectories , @xmath16 ( dashed red line shows scenario 1 , dotted red line shows scenario 2 ) , with the actual trajectory , @xmath7 ( solid red line ) . for comparison , \n thompson s trajectory is indicated by a solid blue line . \n the projected new world record is the time for which @xmath16 equals 100 meter . including 95% statistical errors estimated by monte carlo simulations as described in section [ sec : method ] , \n we find that the new world record would be @xmath1 seconds in scenario 1 , and @xmath2 in scenario 2 . \n glen mills , usain bolt s coach , suggested that the world record could have been 9.52 seconds if bolt had not danced along the track in beijing for the last 20 meters . \n according to our calculations , that seems like an good , but perhaps slightly optimistic , estimate : depending on assumptions about bolt s acceleration at the end of the race , we find that his time would have been somewhere between 9.55 and 9.61 seconds , with a 95% statistical error of @xmath17 seconds . clearly , the uncertainties due to the assumptions about the acceleration are comparable to or larger than the statistical uncertainties \n . therefore , 9.52 seconds does by no means seem to be out of reach .    in figure \n [ fig : manipulated ] we show an illustration of how such a record would compare to the actual world record of 9.69 seconds , relative to the rest of the field : the left version of bolt shows his actual position at @xmath18 seconds , while the right version indicates his position in the new scenarios .    of course \n , there are potential several systematics errors involved in these calculations . for instance , it is impossible to know for sure whether usain might have been tired at the end , which of course would increase the world record beyond our estimates . on the other hand , judging from his facial expressions as he crossed the finishing line , this does nt immediately strike us as a very plausible hypothesis . \n another issue to consider is the wind . \n it is generally agreed that a tail wind speed of 1 m / s improves a 100 meter time by 0.05 seconds @xcite . \n further , for iaaf ( international association of athletics federations ) to acknowledge a given run as a record attempt , the wind speed must be less than + 2 m / s . \n when bolt ran in beijing , there was no measurable wind speed at all , and one can therefore safely assume that the world record could have been further decreased , perhaps by as much as 0.1 seconds , under more favorable wind conditions .      first and foremost , we would like to thank christian nitschke smith at nrk sporten for providing very useful high - resolution footage of the beijing 100 dash run , and also bbc and nbc for making their videos available on their web pages . \n second , we thank the pizza guy from peppe s who provided us with a very good half - n - half `` thai chicken '' and `` heavy heaven '' pizza on a late friday night . this article has been submitted to the american journal of physics . \n after it is published , it will be found at http://scitation.aip.org/ajp .", "StartTimeOffset": 1106734013430,

{"ContextTokens": 3014, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "dust is common in high redshift ( @xmath0=46 ) quasars ( omont et al . 2001 , priddey & mcmahon 2001 ) , apparently implying that dust is widespread by this epoch . \n this presents a puzzle : how can so much dust be formed in the short time available ? \n wmap cosmology ( spergel et al . 2003 ) puts the age of the universe at z=6 to be only 0.95  gyr , and the age of first reionization ( and so the first stars ) at an age of @xmath10.2  gyr ( z@xmath120 ) . in our galaxy \n the primary source of dust lies in the winds of red giant stars , specifically asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . \n only stars with masses greater than 2  @xmath2 can reach the agb in the less than @xmath11  gyr available . \n another source of dust is thus required . \n normally this extra source is taken to be type  1 ( massive star ) supernovae . \n recent scuba results ( dunne et al . 2003 ) show that the 300  year old type  1 supernova remnant ( snr ) cas  a is rich in dust , lending credence to this picture . \n however , the possible destruction of snr formed dust in their shocks may not be fully resovled . here \n we point out another , seemingly inevitable , path for dust formation up to at least z=6 : _ quasar winds_.    the fate of outflowing broad emission line ( bel ) quasar gas constantly being ejected from quasars had previously not been considered . \n we examined that fate ( elvis , marengo & karovska 2002 ) in a manner that applies to any model in which the bel clouds move outward . \n we find that dust creation is a natural consequence . \n outflowing winds of highly ionized material are common in quasars [ see arav , shlosman & weymann ( eds ) 1997 ] . \n the gas emitting the prominent broad emission lines ( bels ) may well participate in these winds . \n the bels , which produce e.g. ly@xmath3 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , civ , nv ( e.g. krolik 1999 ) are doppler broadened to a few percent of the speed of light ( @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 ) . \n the gas producing these lines lies at temperatures of 10@xmath7  k and at the strikingly high densities of 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9  @xmath10 ( osterbrock 1989 ) . \n these densities are comparable to chromospheric values ( allen 1975 , korista 1999 ) . \n the kinematics of this bel gas - infalling , bound , or outflowing - is not well established ( peterson 1997 ) . moreover , \n the issue of how to prevent this high density gas from dispersing has been problematic . \n pressure confinement by a hotter surrounding medium would seem straightforward and a 2-phase medium is even predicted for gas irradiated by a hard quasar - like continuum ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) . \n however this model appeared to suffer unsurmountable problems ( mathews 1986 ) . \n most obviously the any bel ` clouds ' would be ripped apart by shear forces in less than one orbital time . as a result \n this model was abandoned . \n a bel wind has advantages . \n elvis ( 2000 ) showed how such a wind can include the bel gas as a cool phase in pressure equilibrium the warmer ( 10@xmath11  k ) wind medium . with this model \n a large number of other puzzling features of quasar phenomenology seem to fall into place . \n a wind in which both bel gas and the hotter confining gas are co - moving solves the cloud survival problem , and if the wind is non - spherical also solves the problem of the confining medium being thomson thick , which can not be the case as rapid x - ray variability is essentially universal in agns . \n but a wind requires us to ask what happens to the gas as it flows outward . in any outflow model with the bel region initially in pressure equilibrium with a surrounding warmer medium , the divergence of the outflowing warm wind ( even if only at the sound speed of the warm confining medium , @xmath1100  km  s@xmath6 ) will rapidly take the system out of pressure balance . \n the bel clouds will then begin to expand , limited by their sound speed ( initially @xmath110  km  s@xmath6 ) , and will cool to below 1000  k , at which temperatures dust will form _ if _ the pressure is still sufficiently high . could quasar bel gas then be the source of quasar dust at high redshift ? \n a full treatment of dust formation requires coupling the dust forming medium hydrodynamics with the full set of dust condensation chemistry equations ( sedlmayr 1997 ) . \n such an exercise is limited by our knowledge of the highly non - linear dust condensation chemical paths , and by the uncertainties related to the role of non - equilibrium chemistry . \n we therefore use a simple comparison between agn and cool star atmospheres , to derive reasonable estimates for the conditions of dust formation in the bel clouds .    the general scenario for dust formation \n is based on the concept of the `` dust formation window '' . \n effective dust condensation seems to take place whenever a chemically enriched medium has a sufficiently low temperature , and a large enough density , to allow dust grain condensation . \n the amount of dust produced , the chemical composition and the final size of the grains , depend on the length of time over which the conditions remain favorable . \n figure  1 shows the dust formation window in pressure - temperature space , for the chemical species that lead to the formation of dust in an o - rich cool star circumstellar envelope . \n the thin solid lines mark the phase transition region below which the most important dust precursor molecules are formed . \n the hatched area is the dust forming region in the circumstellar envelope of a cool giant star . \n the region is limited on the right by the thermodynamical path of a static outflowing wind typical for an agb star . \n the left side is obtained by increasing the maximum pressure in the envelope by a factor 100 , as during the propagation of pulsational shocks in the atmospheres of long period variables . \n dust formation in the envelopes of evolved giants occurs in the region between the two tracks , below the phase transition lines for each chemical species . \n a closely similar diagram can be drawn for c - rich gas . \n figure  1 shows adiabats for bel gas , assuming @xmath12 . \n clearly they pass through the dust formation window for plausible initial densities . \n the bel gas enters the dust formation window after expanding by a factor of three . \n this process resembles that which makes smoke in terrestrial settings . \n quasars are then dusty because they themselves create dust which , since carbon may be overabundant in quasars , may resemble soot . \n hence we called them ` smoking quasars ' . \n if quasar winds are driven by line radiation then the characteristic instability of such winds suggests that shocks may be common . in stars with ` p  cygni ' profiles ( ob stars and wolf - rayet stars ) such winds produce highly velocity - structured opacity ( e.g. stahl et al . \n , 1993 , owocki 2001 ) . \n quasars show similar structures ( turnshek 1988 ) , and are suggested by hydrodynamic modeling ( proga 2001 ) . in agb star \n winds these intermittent pressure enhancements boost dust production ( figure  1 ) , starting a nonlinear `` avalanche '' effect , as observed in miras and other long period variables ( hffner 1999 ) . \n this suggests that pressure fluctuations could greatly enhance the quasar dust creation rate . \n can the dust survive the radiation field from the quasar bh ? \n surprisingly a quasar wind provides a _ more benign _ environment for dust than an agb star wind , despite the quasar luminosity being much higher than the @xmath13  l@xmath14 luminosity of a typical giant star . \n the large flux of energetic photons from the quasar continuum might have overheated the newborn dust grains above their sublimation temperature , delaying the occurence of dust condensation , perhaps until it becomes impossible due to the ever decreasing gas density . \n however , due to the much larger geometrical dilution in quasars , the radiative flux reaching the bel clouds interior is actually lower than the stellar flux in the dust forming region of the giant s wind . for a quasar of luminosity @xmath15 \n erg s@xmath6 the flux density 3  pc from the quasar center is @xmath16  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath6 . \n this is at least one order of magnitude less than the @xmath18  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath6 in the stellar case . \n so the dust formation window of the bel clouds is determined by the polytropic expansion of the clouds gas , as we have assumed , and not by radiative transfer , as in the case of circumstellar envelopes ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) . \n other destruction mechanisms , such as dust sputtering by electrons and ions , or chemical sputtering , are not very effective at the rather low ( @xmath19  k ) kinetic temperature of the cloud medium . \n kinetic sputtering by the surrounding medium becomes effective ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) only for @xmath20  k. by the time the bel clouds start forming dust , they will be surrounded by a warm medium having a temperature @xmath21  k , which is already low enough to prevent their immediate destruction by sputtering . \n the total amount of dust that is formed , however , depends on the time spent by the clouds in the region favorable to grain condensation and growth . \n this is given by the cloud expansion time - scale @xmath22  yr , where @xmath23  km s@xmath6 is the initial sound speed of the cloud and @xmath24  cm ( peterson 1997 ) their initial average size . \n this timescale is comparable with the time spent by circumstellar grains in the region where dust growth is most active , suggesting that the efficiency in dust production of bel region and late type giant winds may be similar . \n the most luminous quasars , in which the highest dust masses are found ( omont et al . \n 2001 ) , have luminosities over 10@xmath25erg  s@xmath6 and so may have mass loss rates @xmath2610  m@xmath27  yr@xmath6 . \n assuming the same dust fraction as in agb stars gives @xmath110@xmath28  m@xmath27 of dust over a nominal 10@xmath29  yr lifetime . \n this approaches the amounts detected but is still short by about an order - of - magnitude . \n however , super - solar abundances are common in high redshift quasars , certainly in carbon ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) , providing a higher density of raw material for the formation of precursor molecules . \n dust condensation is highly nonlinear ( frenklach & feigelson 1989 ) , the amount of dust formed in any particular quasar is hard to predict , but the dependence on abundance is likely to be an @xmath30 process initially , allowing for more dust to be produced than in our simple estimate . as a result \n the infrared emission of quasars may not require the normally assumed large associated burst of star formation ( sanders et al . 1988 ) . \n quasar winds provide an economical explanation for high z dust . \n dust at z@xmath14 is observed primarily from observations of quasars and of sub - mm sources . \n if dust is everywhere and quasars illuminate this pre - existing dust then the total dust mass at z=4 is large . \n if the only dust at high z is manufactured in quasars , then far less dust is implied than if quasars simply illuminate pre - existing dust , which would then need to be distributed among all high  z galaxies , active or not . \n the metals in the dust must , of course , have been created by an earlier generation of massive stars , that go supernova quickly . to establish high quasar bel abundances , \n the star formation must be local to the quasar nucleus , again suggesting a more limited amount of high z star formation . \n high  z counterparts to sub - mm scuba sources seem to imply enormous starbursts , but conclusively distinguishing between a starburst and a quasar as the root power source heating the dust seen by scuba is extraordinarily difficult , leaving open the quasar option .    in this picture dust can be formed as soon as quasars form . \n quasar winds ( @xmath311000  km  s@xmath6 ) readily exceed the escape velocity from a galaxy ( v@xmath32200  km  s@xmath6 ) , or even a rich cluster of galaxies ( v@xmath321000  km  s@xmath6 ) . hence the dust they produce will be ejected into the intergalactic medium . \n dust is an important catalyst of star formation , as dust provides both shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation and an efficient cooling path for the surrounding medium . \n the early creation of dust by quasars may then be important for seeding star formation at slightly later times . \n in summary , dust will inevitably be created from the free expansion of quasar broad emission line clouds in an outflowing wind . \n the association of dust with quasars is not then _ necessarily _ linked with intense star formation around quasars , but may be a consequence of the quasar activity itself . \n the creation of dust in quasar winds may solve the puzzle of where the very first dust comes from , and in doing so suggests an unexpected role for quasars in cosmology .", "StartTimeOffset": 1121271927924, "RequestID": "7717becd7a8cd5e6e0917e78d3829e7af6023131", "TotalTokens": 3141}
{"ContextTokens": 3341, "GeneratedTokens": 156, "SynthesizedBody": "ce gru ( also known as grus v-1 and hawkins v-1 ) was discovered by hawkins ( 1981 , 1983 ) during a search for variable objects using uk schmidt plates . \n further observations by tuohy et al ( 1988 ) confirmed its binary nature ( an orbital period of 108.5 mins ) while cropper et al ( 1990 ) found strong circular polarisation \n a characteristic of the polar ( or am her ) class of cataclysmic variable . \n these objects are interacting binaries in which material flows from a dwarf main sequence star onto a magnetic ( @xmath210200 mg ) white dwarf . \n this strong magnetic field is high enough to force the spin of the white dwarf to be synchronised with the binary orbital period . \n tuohy et al ( 1988 ) demonstrated that there are two accretion poles which are characterised by different emission properties : one pole which is always in view and is stronger in blue light , while the other pole which is visible for only @xmath00.35 of the white dwarf spin period is stronger in red light . \n cropper et al ( 1990 ) showed that the pole always in view was positively circularly polarised , with the other being negatively polarised . \n the uk schmidt plates show that ce gru exhibits two distinct levels of brightness , ( @xmath218 and @xmath221 ) . in the fainter state \n the accretion flow is much reduced , or stopped altogether . \n this may be the reason why ce gru was not detected during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( verbunt et al 1997 ) . \n indeed , ce gru has never before been detected in x - rays . in this paper \n , we report the first x - ray detection of ce gru which were made as part of a survey of polars using _ xmm - newton_. \n the satellite _ xmm - newton _ was launched in dec 1999 by the european space agency . \n it has the largest effective area of any x - ray satellite and also has a 30 cm optical / uv telescope ( the optical monitor , om : mason et al 2001 ) allowing simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv coverage . \n ce gru was observed using _ xmm - newton _ on 2001 oct 31 . \n the epic instruments ( imaging detectors covering the energy range 0.110kev with moderate spectra resolution ) were operated in full frame mode ( the count rate was not high enough to cause pile - up problems ) . \n the rgs detectors ( high resolution spectrographs operating in the 0.32.0kev range : den herder et al 2001 ) were configured in the standard spectroscopy mode . \n we clearly detect ce gru in the x - ray band . \n om data were taken in two uv filters ( uvw1 : 24003400  , uvw2 : 18002400  ) and one optical band ( @xmath3 band ) . the observation log is shown in table [ log ] . \n the data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ _ science analysis software _ v5.2 . \n the rgs spectra were of low signal to noise and showed no evidence for significant line emission : we do not consider them further . for the epic pn detector ( strder et al 2001 ) , data were extracted using an aperture of 40@xmath4 arc sec centered on the source . \n background data were extracted from a source free region . for the epic mos detectors ( turner et al 2001 ) we extracted data in a similar way , but extracted the background from an annulus around the source . \n the background data were scaled and subtracted from the source data . in extracting the epic pn spectrum \n , we used only single pixel events and used the response file epn_ff20_sy9_thin.rmf . in the case of the mos data we used the response files m[1 - 2]_thin1v9q19t5r5_all_15.rsp \n the om data were analysed in a similar way using omichain and omfchain ( this latter task was not incorporated in sas v5.2 but will be in a later version ) . \n data were background subtracted and corrected for coincidence losses ( mason et al 2001 ) . \n the optical monitor data shows that ce gru had a mean brightness of @xmath3=17.9 and a maximum @xmath3=17.5 . since the @xmath3 band observations started at the descent from maximum its likely that its true maximum was brighter than this . assuming a similar colour to that found by tuohy et al ( 1988 ) ( @xmath5=0.53 ) this places ce gru in a high accretion state at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observations and a similar brightness to observed by tuohy et al ( @xmath618 ) . \n the length of the observation in the epic mos detectors covered just over 1 orbital cycle . \n the flux in the uv filters corresponds to : uvw1 @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 , uvw2 @xmath10 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 , ( based on om observations of isolated white dwarfs ) . \n the mean flux in the @xmath3 filter corresponds to @xmath11 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9  at 5000  . \n .the log of _ xmm - newton _ observations of ce gru . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 16,12 ) ( 0,12.8 )    ( 8.,13.2 )    ( -0.9,6.5 )    ( 7.7,6.6 )      in the bright phase the hard x - ray bolometric luminosity is @xmath12 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath13 . to place a very crude estimate on the distance to ce gru we compare this luminosity to the hard x - ray luminosity of am her ( whose distance is reasonably well determined ) . \n ishida et al ( 1997 ) observed am her using _ asca _ when it was in a high accretion state and find @xmath14 ergs s@xmath8using a distance of 75 pc . \n we find that ce gru would have to lie @xmath0400 pc distance to equal the @xmath15 found for am her . \n although ce gru was detected in x - rays for the first time and was clearly in a high accretion state , no distinct soft x - ray component was observed . on the face of it , this is surprising since a strong soft x - ray flux has long been considered one of the defining properties of polars . \n observations of polars using _ exosat _ ( eg osborne 1988 ) and _ rosat _ ( eg ramsay et al 1994 ) found a strong distinct soft x - ray component , and in general , the ratio @xmath16 . \n further , the ratio was correlated with the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf : a high field gave a high ratio . to account for the large ` soft x - ray excess ' seen in many polars , dense ` blobs ' of material which do not form a shock and radiate in soft x - rays were proposed ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 , frank , king & lasota 1988 ) . \n currently , four polars have been observed using _ xmm - newton_. of those systems observed in an intermediate or high accretion state , ww hor showed no distinct soft x - ray component ( ramsay et al 2001 ) while by cam has one pole which did show such a component and one which did not ( ramsay & cropper 2002 ) . \n indeed only one other system , dp leo , has shown a distinct soft x - ray component ( ramsay et al 2001 ) . \n even for those polars which showed the lowest ratios using _ rosat _ ( ef eri and am her ) a distinct soft x - ray component was still observed . \n a variation of the standard shock model has been proposed by heise & verbunt ( 1988 ) and gnsicke , beuermann & de martino ( 1995 ) who suggest that the reprocessed x - ray component lies in the euv band while the strong soft x - ray component seen in many polars originates from dense ` blobs ' of material which do not form an exposed shock . \n our data are consistent with this view if the temperature of the reprocessed component is @xmath17ev : below 2ev the flux of the reprocessed component is too small , while above 5ev it would be too high . \n a component with a temperature above 10ev would be evident in the spectrum ( figure  [ bb ] ) . \n the implication in this case is that the fraction of blobby accretion is small in ce gru . \n again this is consistent with the unfolded light curves ( not shown ) which do not show strong flaring seen in many systems ( such as by cam \n ramsay & cropper 2002 ) . \n the amount of irradiation that the white dwarf receives is a function of height in the post - shock region , with greater temperatures from higher up , but more overall flux ( even at higher energies ) from near the base ( cropper , wu & ramsay 2000 ) . on the other hand , because of the curved surface of the white dwarf , the illumination is decreasing , with slightly more than the square of the distance from the axis of the post - shock region . \n further , albedo varies as a function of temperature . although the effects of irradiating a white dwarf atmosphere have been explored to some extent ( williams \n et al 1987 , heise 1995 ) , this is an area which needs further work to determine how the temperature of the reprocessed spectrum is effected by parameters such as the accretion rate and magnetic field . \n we note , however , that higher specific accretion rates result in lower shock heights , and higher magnetic fields also reduce the height of the post - shock region ( see for example cropper et al 1999 ) , so the solid angle of emission from the post - shock flow intercepted by the white dwarf photosphere is increased . in these high - state data of ce gru , we have no reason to expect anomalously low specific accretion rates , and ce gru has a magnetic field strength typical of polars . \n therefore there is no obvious reason for the reprocessed component to have moved into the euv if it is normally in the soft x -

to - leading order ( nlo ) through the mandatory factorization of a collinear singularity , that arises from the splitting of the photon into a quark - antiquark pair and induces a mutual logarithmic factorization scale dependence in both processes . in close analogy to deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering , one can define a photon structure function f_2^(q^2)&=&_q 2 x e_q^2f_q/(q^2)+c_qf_q/(q^2 ) + c_gf_g/(q^2 ) + e_q^2c_that is related to the parton densities in the photon and has been measured in electron - positron collisions at lep . \n even the strong coupling constant @xmath0 that appears in the expression above can be determined rather precisely in fits to these data @xcite . \n a convenient modification of the @xmath1 factorization scheme consists in absorbing the point - like wilson coefficient c_(x)&=&2n_c c_g(x)=3 in the altarelli - parisi splitting function @xmath2 @xcite . \n while at lo hadronic jets are directly identified as final - state partons , their definition becomes subtle at higher orders , when several partons ( or hadrons ) can be combined to form a jet . according to the standardization of the 1990 snowmass meeting , particles \n @xmath3 are added to a jet cone @xmath4 with radius @xmath5 , if they have a distance @xmath6 from the cone center . however , these broad combined jets are difficult to find experimentally , so that several modifications ( mid - points , additional seeds , iterations ) have been successively applied by the various experiments . the deficiencies of the cone algorithm are remedied in the longitudinally invariant @xmath7 clustering algorithm , where one uses only the combination criterion @xmath8 for any pair of particles @xmath3 and @xmath9 . unfortunately , this algorithm scales numerically with the cubic power of the number @xmath10 of the particles involved . only recently \n a faster version has been developed making use of geometrical arguments and diagrammatic methods known from computational science @xcite . \n the publicly available fastjet code scales only with @xmath11 and is now rapidly adopted , in particular for the lhc , where the particle multiplicity is high . \n single ( inclusive ) jets benefit from high statistics and the presence of a single ( transverse ) energy scale @xmath12 , which makes them easily accessible experimentally and predictions for them theoretically stable . \n the @xmath12-distribution of the single -

mass hadronic state and a hard central system , qcd factorization is expected to hold for deep - inelastic scattering , so that diffractive parton densities can be extracted from experiment , but to break down for hadron - hadron scattering , where initial - state rescattering can occur . in photoproduction , these two scenarios correspond to direct and resolved processes , which are however closely related as noted in section 1 . \n it is thus interesting to investigate the breakdown of factorization in kinematic regimes where direct or resolved processes dominate . \n this can either be done by measuring the dependence on the photon virtuality @xmath21 ( transition from virtual to real photons ) @xcite , @xmath12 ( direct processes are harder than resolved photons ) , or @xmath22 ( = 1 for direct processes at lo ) . \n the latter distribution is confronted in fig.[fig:4 ] with the hypothesis of no ( or global ) factorization breaking ( left ) and with a suppression factor @xmath23 of 0.34 @xcite applied to resolved processes only ( right ) . \n note that the inter - dependence of direct and resolved processes requires the definition of a new factorization scheme with suppression of the scale - dependent logarithm also in the direct contribution @xcite m(q^2,s ) _ & = & - p_q_i ( z)+q_i^22 s + & &  - p_q_i(z ) . \n rapidity distributions of @xmath24-mesons and associated jets as measured by zeus and compared to massive ( fixed - order ) and massless ( variable flavor number scheme ) calculations @xcite . ] \n if individual hadrons are experimentally identified , the cross sections above have to be modified to include convolutions over fragmentation functions @xmath25 . for light quarks and gluons , these non - perturbative , but universal distributions \n must be fitted to @xmath26 data , but then produce successful predictions for hera data at nlo . for heavy quarks , the fragmentation functions can in principle \n be calculated perturbatively , if the heavy - quark mass is kept finite ( `` fixed - order scheme '' ) , although they must for large @xmath12 be evolved using renormalization group equations ( for example at `` next - to - leading logarithm '' ) @xcite . \n an alternative method is to fit the fragmentation functions for @xmath27- and @xmath28-mesons again to @xmath26 data at large @xmath12 ( `` variable flavor number scheme '' ) . \n if in addition the finite mass terms are kept in the hard coefficient functions , one moves from a `` zero - mass scheme '' to a `` general - mass scheme '' and can achieve a smooth transition from large to small @xmath12 @xcite . \n a comparison of both theoretical approaches to recent @xmath24+jet data from zeus is shown in fig . \n [ fig:5 ] . while the massive calculation with central scale choice clearly underestimates the data , the variable flavor number scheme allows not only for direct , but also for resolved - photon contributions and tends to give a better description of the data over the full rapidity range . \n note that both predictions have been multiplied by hadronization corrections modeled with monte carlo simulations . \n while several calculations for inclusive single - hadron production with real photons are available , a theoretical investigation of the transition region to virtual photons and of the production of two hadrons , for example in the forward region , is still needed . \n direct and resolved contributions to the color - singlet and color - octet @xmath29 energy distribution in photoproduction at hera @xcite . ] \n the production of heavy quark - antiquark bound states is still far from being understood theoretically . \n while color - singlet ( cs ) states are to some extent formed already during hard collisions , their contribution has been shown to be both theoretically incomplete due to uncanceled infrared singularities as well as phenomenologically insufficient due to an order - of - magnitude discrepancy with the measured @xmath30-spectrum of @xmath29-mesons at the tevatron . \n on the other hand , non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) allows for a systematic expansion of the qcd lagrangian in the relative quark - antiquark velocity and for additional color - octet ( co ) contributions with subsequent color neutralization through soft gluons . \n @xmath29-production in photon - photon collisions at lep can then be consistently described @xcite , as can be the photoproduction data from hera in fig . \n [ fig:6 ] . at hera , \n the color - octet contribution becomes important only at small momentum - transfer @xmath31 of the photon to the @xmath29-meson . \n unfortunately , recent cdf data do not support the prediction of transverse polarization of the produced @xmath29-mesons at large @xmath30 as predicted from the on - shell fragmentation of final - state gluons within nrqcd , so that further experimental and theoretical studies are urgently needed . \n factorization of photoproduction of prompt photons . ] \n the production of prompt photons in association with jets receives contributions from direct and resolved initial photons as well as direct and fragmentation contributions in the final state as shown in fig.[fig:8 ] . \n photons produced via fragmentation usually lie inside hadronic jets , while directly produced photons tend to be isolated from the final state hadrons . \n the theoretical uncertainty coming from the non - perturbative fragmentation function can therefore be reduced if the photon is isolated in phase space . at the same time \n the experimental uncertainty coming from photonic decays of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 mesons is considerably reduced . \n photon isolation can be achieved by limiting the ( transverse ) hadronic energy @xmath35 inside a cone of size @xmath5 around the photon to e_(t)^had<_(t ) e_(t ) , . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig:7 ] . \n recently an improved photon isolation criterion _ \n i e^had_(t),i ( -r_i ) < \n e_(t ) , , has been proposed , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is now the isolation cone @xcite . \n this procedure allows the fragmentation contribution to vanish in an infrared safe way . \n various distributions of photoproduction of prompt photons in association with jets as measured by h1 and compared to two different qcd calculations @xcite . ] \n photoproduction of prompt photons and jets has been measured by the h1 collaboration and compared with two qcd predictions , which differ in their inclusion of nlo corrections to the resolved and fragmentation contributions . only after modeling hadronization corrections and multiple interactions with monte carlo generators , the measured distributions shown in fig . \n [ fig:9 ] agree with the qcd predictions , showing the particular sensitivity of photon final states to hadronic uncertainties . \n photoproduction processes have been abundantly measured at hera and stimulated many different theoretical studies , ranging from the investigation of the foundations of qcd as inscribed in its factorization theorems , over the determination of its fundamental parameter , the strong coupling constant , to improvements in our understanding of proton and photon structure as well as light and heavy hadron formation .    with the shutdown of hera on july 1 , 2007 \n , many questions will remain unanswered , in particular in the diffractive and non - relativistic kinematic regimes , and this for quite some time until the eventual construction of a new electron - hadron collider such as erhic or an international linear collider . \n photon - induced processes in ultraperipheral heavy - ion collisions may offer a chance to continue investigations in this interesting field , opening in addition a window to nuclear structure , if these processes can be experimentally isolated . \n the author thanks the organizers of the trento 2007 workshop for the kind invitation and for the creation a particularly stimulating atmosphere . \n 10 for an extensive theoretical review of hard photoproduction , see e.g.  klasen m 2002 _ rev . \n phys . _ * 74 * 1221 kessler p 1975 _ acta phys . \n austr . _ * 41 * 141 albino s , klasen m and sldner -

1.2 mev . \n results of the fit are shown in the table and figure 3 . \n both the mass and width are consistent with pdg vacuum values . for both decay channels , @xmath6 and @xmath13 are highly correlated , when they are both allowed to vary in the fit . \n the data are then divided into bins of @xmath7 , corrections are made for acceptance and efficiencies and a fit is done to obtain the yield . because of the good signal to background in the kk channel , systematic errors are considerably smaller than in the electron channel . \n the systematic errors are dominated by the range in @xmath7 over which the fit was done , the run -

particularly from background normalization in the electron channel . \n phenix also sees a clear @xmath16 signal , which , with a shorter lifetime than the @xmath1 will increase the number of decays in the fireball . \n in addition , effects in au - au collisions could be considerably stronger since energy densities are higher . \n further in the future , upgrades to phenix such as the hadron blind detector ( hbd ) will significantly enhance our capabilities to reject conversion and dalitz pairs which are the dominant source of background . \n this will open up the possibility of studying the @xmath17 as well as thermal di -

{"ContextTokens": 1687, "GeneratedTokens": 169, "SynthesizedBody": "in standard models of active galactic nuclei , seyfert 2 galaxies are interpreted as systems viewed at sufficiently high inclination angles that the central continuum source is obscured by the surrounding dusty torus ( e.  g. , krolik 1999 ) . however \n , residual soft x - ray emission is observed from many of these systems . \n this must originate in the unobscured nuclear vicinity , or perhaps in other regions of the galaxy . \n while one expects some soft x - ray emission to be produced by reprocessing of the strong continuum flux in the circumnuclear environment , collisionally - heated gas associated with starburst regions might also provide an important contribution ( e.  g. , wilson et  al . \n 1992 ) . \n high resolution x - ray spectroscopy provides the least ambiguous means of distinguishing between these two interpretations . \n discrete spectral features formed in collisional plasmas are qualitatively different from those formed in photoionized gas ( liedahl 1999 ) . in collisional plasmas , \n emission lines are primarily produced by electron impact excitation from the ground state , which favors strong resonance transitions . \n fe l - shell transitions are especially prominent . in photoionized plasmas , \n the electron temperature and density are too low for excitation by electron impact , and the lines are produced mostly via radiative cascades following recombination , which favors the lowest - lying multiplet levels , thereby producing forbidden transitions . \n also , fe l lines are much weaker than hydrogenic and heliumlike k - shell transitions of lower z elements . \n another characteristic difference involves the radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) . in collisional plasmas , these are broad weak features , barely discernible above the bremsstrahlung continuum . in photoionized plasmas , \n the rrc are much narrower and far more prominent ( liedahl and paerels 1996 ) . \n the grating experiments on chandra and xmm - newton have provided the first x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 s with sufficient resolution and sensitivity to investigate these issues in detail . here \n we present chandra hetg spectra of markarian 3 and xmm - newton rgs spectra of ngc 1068 . \n the data are consistent with all emission arising in photoionized gas . \n we can use these spectra to derive sensitive constraints on the structure of the circumsource environment . \n the chandra hetg spectrum of markarian 3 is shown in figure 1 ( sako et  al . \n a variety of narrow features are readily discernible and are explicitly labeled in the figure . \n these include ly series transitions of hydrogenic o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe , heliumlike complexes of o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and fe , near - neutral fluorescence k@xmath0 lines of mg , si , s , and fe , and a few weak fe l lines for a range of charge states ( fe xvii through xxiv ) . \n the he@xmath0 complexes are especially interesting . for o vii , \n the forbidden line is clearly the strongest , and the relative line ratios agree with the values expected for pure recombination ( porquet & dubau 2000 ) . for both ne ix and si xiii , \n the resonance lines are roughly comparable to the forbidden lines , but the ratios are still not as high as expected for electron impact excitation . \n this suggests possible contributions from both recombination and collisional excitation emission from the same plasma or spatially - distinct plasmas . \n the presence of the fe l features might also bolster that interpretation .    however , we are firmly convinced that this is _ not _ what is happening in this spectrum . \n both the heliumlike resonance lines and the fe l lines are not produced collisionally , but instead are photoexcited by the central continuum radiation . \n two major clues lead us to this interpretation : ( 1 ) the fe l lines are too weak relative to the heliumlike resonance lines to be consistent with electron impact excitation , unless we significantly reduce the iron abundance in the putative collisional component . \n ( 2 ) the specific fe l lines observe are all 3d2p and 3p2s . \n these have high oscillator strengths , and are the most prominent features expected for photoexcitation . \n there are no accompanying 3s 2p transitions , which have much lower oscillator strengths . in collisional plasmas , \n the two sets of transitions have near comparable line intensities .    at low to intermediate line \n optical depths , photoexcitation and recombination provide comparable contributions to the x - ray line spectrum of photoionized gas . \n this interpretation suffices for markarian 3 . \n we see no conclusive evidence for a contribution from collisional gas . \n the xmm - newton rgs spectrum of ngc 1068 is shown in figure 2 ( kinkhabwala et  al . \n we see a very line - rich spectrum dominated by hydrogenic and heliumlike lines ( c through si ) , accompanied by weak fe l - shell transitions . \n in addition , we see very prominent rrc . \n all rrc for the hydrogenic and heliumlike charge states of c , n , o , and ne are detected . \n the narrow rrc provide unambiguous evidence that most of the x - ray emission we are observing is produced in photoionized gas . \n this conclusion is supported by the he@xmath0 complexes , in which the forbidden line is brighter than the resonance . \n the ratios of the forbidden line intensities to the rrc intensities agree with expectations for recombination cascades . \n nevertheless , as for markarian 3 , recombination alone does not provide a good quantitative fit to the entire ngc 1068 spectrum . \n the heliumlike resonance lines are still too bright relative to the forbidden lines , and the fe l lines are brighter than would be expected for purely recombining gas . here \n again , we can explain all of these features by allowing for additional contributions from photoexcitation . \n conclusive evidence for this comes from the hydrogenic line series : the higher series lines are observed to be significantly brighter relative to ly@xmath0 than is expected for either recombining gas or collisionally - excited gas . \n this is a natural consequence of photoexcitation at intermediate optical depths due to saturation of the highest oscillator strength lines . \n we have developed a fully self - consistent model for the ngc 1068 spectrum in terms of a photoionized medium which correctly accounts for both the photoexcitation and radiative recombination contributions ( kinkhabwala et  al . \n 2001a , behar et  al . \n individual column densities and velocity distributions for each ion are left as free parameters . \n the model provides an amazingly good fit to these high statistics data . \n fits to the earlier chandra hetg spectra of markarian 3 , ngc 4151 ( ogle et  al . \n 2000 ) , and the circinus galaxy ( sambruna et  al . 2000 ) as well as to a recent observation of ngc 4507 yield similar results ( kinkhabwala et  al . \n 2001b ) . in particular , we find that the ogle et  al . \n ( 2000 ) conclusion that the ngc 4151 spectrum indicates the presence of hot collisional gas is incorrect . \n all of the features in the spectra of all seyfert 2 galaxies so far observed with chandra and xmm are consistent with fluorescence of cold gas and photoexcitation and recombination cascades in photoionized gas . \n the high resolution x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies display a wealth of emission features produced by fluorescence , photoexcitation , and recombination cascades in radiatively - driven gas . \n there is no evidence for measureable contributions from hot collisionally - ionized gas in any of the sources which have been studied to date . \n further observations of this kind should be very helpful in elucidating the nature of the circumsource medium in active galactic nuclei .", "StartTimeOffset": 1151049083730, "RequestID": "8ca1fd48761dcd90958a8391dc2ac7ad2c7a286d", "TotalTokens": 1856}
{"ContextTokens": 2719, "GeneratedTokens": 89, "SynthesizedBody": "modern cosmology is nowadays settled on observations concerning mainly the distribution of matter and the dynamics of the expansion of the universe . on the one hand , there are now various cosmological observations supporting a matter distribution that is homogeneous on large scales of order @xmath0 h@xmath1mpc . \n nevertheless , at late times , the matter distribution is highly structured on smaller scales , with the presence of clusters of galaxies , filaments and voids . moreover \n , the statistical isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation supports the idea that the universe is highly isotropic on average , on large scales . facing these observational issues \n , one assumes in the standard cosmological framework that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on all scales , resulting in a spacetime described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , the inhomogeneities being perturbations around this homogeneous and isotropic background . \n then , all the observables of the universe on large scales can be deduced from a single degree of freedom : the scale factor of the metric , and the dynamics of the inhomogeneities is well described as long as the density contrast in the matter fields remains small .    on the other hand \n , many recent observations strongly favor a universe whose expansion has been accelerating in the recent past and may be accelerating today . in the frw context \n this necessarily requires the introduction of exotic sources as for example a cosmological constant or quintessence fields , or a modification of gravity , generally implying the so - called coincidence problem : why is the expansion accelerating approximatelly at the same time when the universe becomes structured , that is when the density contrast in the matter field is no longer small on a wide range of scales \n ?    regionally averaged relativistic cosmologies may be able to answer this question by linking the dynamics of the universe on large scales to its structuration on smaller scales ; see interesting discussions of that topic in rsnen ( 2006 ) . \n it consists in defining cosmologies that are homogeneous on large scales without supposing any local symmetry , thanks to a spatial averaging procedure . \n it results in equations for a volume scale factor that not only include an averaged matter source term , but also additional terms that can be interpreted as the effects of the coarse - grained inhomogeneities on the large scales dynamics . \n these additional terms are commonly named backreaction .    in this paper , after introducing the formalism of regionally averaged cosmologies in the first part , we shall propose a correspondence between regionally averaged cosmologies and friedmannian scalar field cosmologies in the second part , the scalar field being interpreted in this context as a mean field description of the inhomogeneous universe , that can play the role of a quintessence field . \n then , in the third part , as an example of the correspondence , we explicitly reconstruct the mean field theory for the particular class of scaling solutions of the regionally averaged cosmologies , and discuss its properties . \n this correspondence has been proposed and discussed in buchert et al . \n in this paper , since we are interested in the late time behavior of the cosmological model , we restrict the analysis to a universe filled with an irrotational fluid of dust matter with density @xmath2 . \n the more general case of an irrotational perfect fluid can be found in buchert ( 2001 ) . \n following buchert ( 2000 ) we foliate the spacetime by flow - orthogonal hypersurfaces with the 3-metric @xmath3 . \n the line element then reads @xmath4 . \n the large scale homogeneous model is built by averaging the scalar part of the general relativistic equations on a spatial domain @xmath5 with a spatial averager applied to any scalar function @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the volume of the domain @xmath5 and @xmath9 . \n then , one can define a volume scale factor @xmath10 , and applying the averager [ averager ] to the hamiltonian constraint and raychaudhuri s equation when @xmath11 has been set to @xmath12 leads to : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the averaged spatial 3-ricci scalar , and @xmath15 is known as the kinematical backreaction term . \n this backreaction is given in terms of the well - known adm variables that are the local expansion rate @xmath16 and the rate of shear @xmath17 by : @xmath18 . \n one can notice that this additionnal term is the spatial variance over the domain @xmath5 of these quantities . \n in other words , the more the matter distribution is structured , with collapsed regions and voids , the more this term may contribute to the dynamics , except of course if the two parts , i.e. expansion and shear fluctuations compensate each other . \n the third equation of the system [ averagedsystem ] is simply an integrability condition that expresses the compatibility of the first two equations . \n the system [ averagedsystem ] characterizes the properties of the universe on large scales . \n it preserves the main feature of the standard frw universe , that is the fact that the properties of the universe on large scales can be deduced from a single scale factor , but this scale factor now obeys dynamical equations that differ from the frw equations for a dust field because of the additional source terms @xmath19 and @xmath14 . \n these terms arise because the averaging and the time derivatives do nt commute . \n of course the curvature is also present in frw equations , but it reduces to a constant curvature term , whereas in averaged cosmologies , it is coupled to the backreaction term through the last equation of [ averagedsystem ] . \n we will see below that this coupling is essential to explain the cosmic acceleration in averaged cosmologies . in analogy with frw cosmology , \n we introduce @xmath20 , and we can define a set of cosmological parameters : @xmath21 as well as an effective deceleration parameter : @xmath22 .    to emphasize the difference between the mean curvature @xmath14 and the friedmannian constant curvature @xmath23 , one should note that they differ by a term representing the effect of the whole history of the universe since the beginning of the dust dominated phase : @xmath24 . \n so , when the backreaction term does nt vanish identically , the mean curvature does nt behave like a constant curvature term . \n finally , it is important to note that the system [ averagedsystem ] is not closed : it has four unknown quantities , but only three independent equations . in order to close it , it is then necessary to introduce another relation that can be either a mathematical ansatz or a physical statement . \n in order to constrain and understand the dynamics of averaged cosmologies , it could be interesting to benefit from the well - known properties of the friedmannian cosmologies , so we will develop in this section a correspondence between the backreaction effect , and the simplest mean field model , that is a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field @xmath25 with a self - interaction potential @xmath26 . \n let s parameterize @xmath19 and @xmath14 as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 for a standard scalar field and @xmath29 for a phantom scalar field . \n then , the system [ averagedsystem ] becomes : @xmath30 except for the dependence on the domain @xmath5 , these are exactly the equations for a homogeneous cosmology in presence of a dust field and a minimally coupled scalar field . because this scalar field appears as a mean field description of the morphology of the structures in the universe , we call it the morphon field. \n the correspondence established in the previous section can be used in two different ways . the first one , and probably the more useful would be to consider particular models of scalar field cosmologies and to deduce the characteristics of the corresponding backreaction and mean curvature ; this will be the subject of a forthcoming work . in this short contribution , as an illustration of the correspondence , we will conversely focus on constructing the mean field model from a particular class of backreaction . \n we consider the large class of scaling solutions : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the initial values of @xmath19 and @xmath14 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real numbers . inserting this ansatz in the third equation of [ averagedsystem ] , one obtains two different kinds of solutions . for @xmath36 , \n the only solution is : @xmath37 that is a near - friedmannian solution because it reduces to a constant curvature for @xmath38 . \n it corresponds to the case where the backreaction and the mean curvature evolve independently . on the contrary , the solutions for @xmath39 : @xmath40 entail a strong coupling between the backreaction and the mean curvature \n this case is an extreme one , but the coupling must be considered a generic property . \n the parameter @xmath41 that is constant for the scaling solutions is the conversion rate of the mean curvature into backreaction ; it plays a very important role in the mechanism responsible for the cosmic acceleration : it only occurs if @xmath420,-1[$ ] , that is if the mean curvature converts sufficiently into backreaction that then decays slowly enough or even grows ( @xmath43 ) . in the following \n we will focus on this class of strongly coupled solutions [ neqp ] . \n one can then reconstruct the potential for the scalar field associated with the scaling solutions [ neqp ] . \n a straightforward calculation provides : @xmath44    the potential [ pot ] is known in the literature about scalar field type dark energy ( sahni et al . \n 2000 , sahni & starobinskii 2003 , urena - lopez & matos 2000 ) . \n it corresponds to dark energy with a constant equation of state , here given in terms of the parameters of the averaged cosmology by @xmath45 . \n this result is consistent only under some restrictions on the parameters : we must have @xmath46 and @xmath28 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 with @xmath29 in @xmath42 - 1,-1/3[$ ] and @xmath28 if @xmath50 . \n all these conditions show that scaling backreaction can reproduce a wide variety of cosmological scalar fields such as standard quintessence , phantom quintessence , a cosmological constant . \n they can be classified as cosmic states in the phase diagram @xmath51 of figure [ fig : cosmicstates ] . \n case a are phantom dark energy models ; cases b and c are standard scalar field models in a decreasing potential ; case d are standard scalar fields in a well - type potential , and case e are standard scalar fields rolling in a negative potential that is not bounded from below . \n the green line represents the scalar field model inferred from the snls best fit model with @xmath52 ( astier et al . \n the arrows in each sector represent the evolution of the models in time : the einstein - de sitter model @xmath53 appears as a saddle point for the dynamics . \n the mean field description of backreaction effects through a scalar field does not only provide a rephrasing of the kinematics of backreaction , but it also justifies the existence of the cosmological effective scalar field , that may be responsible for the cosmic acceleration , on the basis of an underlying fundamental theory , that is einstein general relativity : the cosmic quintessence emerges in the process of interpreting the real universe in a homogeneous context . \n the study of scaling solutions allowed to understand that the cosmic acceleration is only possible if the mean curvature is strongly coupled to the backreaction and converts into it to maintain it at a high level . \n nevertheless , more realistic solutions , with a varying conversion rate must be investigated . \n finally , in order to firmly establish that backreaction effects are the source of the acceleration of the expansion , it will be necessary to explicitly compute these effects from generic relativistic models and observations of the large - scale structures of the universe . \n astier p. & al 2006 , a&a , 447 , 31 buchert t. 2000 , gen . \n grav . , 32 , 105 buchert t. 2000 , gen . \n grav . , 33 , 1381 buchert t. , & larena j. , & alimi j. m. 2006 , gr -

{"ContextTokens": 3800, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "advances in satellite instrumentation , e.g. , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , and the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) , are greatly stimulating and guiding theoretical research on accretion physics . \n the recent discovery of khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , extends the frequency range over which these oscillations occur into timescales associated with the innermost regions of the accretion process ( for a review see van der klis 1996 ) . \n stella and vietri ( 1997 ) have proposed that observed low frequency qpos in neutron star x - ray binaries correspond to the precession of the accretion disk , i.e. , the lense - thirring effect . \n this could be the first evidence for a genuinely general relativistic effect , i.e. , the dragging of inertial frames , in such systems . \n morgan , remillard and greiner ( 1997 ) identified a 67 hz qpo in the black hole candidate grs 1915 + 105 which may be associated with relativistic trapped inner disk oscillations ( nowak et al . \n recently , cui , zhang and chen ( 1998 ) have extended the interpretation of stella and vietri to black hole binaries . within this model , gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 \n are found to spin at a rate close to the maximum theoretical limit . \n moreover , in extragalactic sources , spectroscopic evidence ( broad iron emission lines ) increasingly points to ( rotating ) black holes being the accreting central objects ( tanaka et al . \n 1995 ; kormendy and richstone 1995 ) . \n recently , bromley , miller and pariev ( 1998 ) placed a limit on the inner edge of the accretor giving rise to the iron k@xmath0 emission in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 at about 2.6 schwarzschild radii . \n their estimate is that the black hole is rotating at a rate which is about @xmath1 % of the allowed maximum . \n early theoretical studies indicated that a rotating black hole in the presence of an accretion disk must be spinning at nearly the maximal rate ( thorne 1974 ) . \n rotation increases the available energy in the near - horizon region : the binding energy per unit mass of a test particle can reach up to @xmath2 and the innermost stable circular orbit approaches the horizon ( bardeen , press and teukolsky 1972 ) and coincides with it ( at least in areal coordinates ) in the extreme case @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the mass of the hole and @xmath5 its specific angular momentum ) . in the rotating case , \n motions away from the equatorial plane are affected by the dragging of inertial frames , while motions in the ergo - region may ( more speculatively ) extract rotational energy from the hole . \n accretion theory is primarily based on the study of stationary flows and linearized perturbations thereof . establishing the nature of flow instabilities , \n though , will almost certainly require highly resolved and accurate , time - dependent , non - linear numerical investigations . \n especially intriguing is the possibility of establishing features of the accretion process that are reflecting the nature of the spacetime . \n such numerical probes rely crucially on adequate and consistent approximations of the geometry . for a wide range of accretion problems , a newtonian theory of gravity _ \n is _ adequate for the description of the background gravitational forces . \n the extensive experience with newtonian astrophysics suggests that the first explorations of the relativistic regime could benefit from the use of _ model potentials _ ( paczyski and wiita 1980 ) . \n this constitutes the _ newtonian paradigm _ , which is still being developed ( e.g. , nowak and wagoner 1991 ; artemova , bjrnsson and novikov 1996 ) . \n for comprehensive numerical work , a full ( i.e. , three - dimensional ) formalism is required , able to cover also the maximally rotating hole . in rotating spacetimes \n the gravitational forces can not be captured fully with scalar potential formalisms . \n a vivid example is provided by the wave systems examined in chandrashekhar ( 1983 ) , in which rotation introduces _ frequency _ dependent potentials . \n additionally , geometric regions such as the ergo - sphere would be very hard to model without a metric description . \n whereas the bulk of emission occurs in regions with almost newtonian fields , only the observable features attributed to the inner region may crucially depend on the nature of the spacetime . \n pioneering numerical efforts in the study of accretion onto black holes ( wilson 1972 ; hawley , smarr and wilson 1984 ; hawley 1991 ) , established the relativistic framework , the so - called _ frozen star paradigm _ of a black hole . in this , the time  slicing \" of the spacetime is synchronized with that of asymptotic observers far from the hole . \n this is a powerful approach , leading to a very economical description of the geometry and can , _ in principle _ , be used to capture all the interesting effects of the spacetime curvature . \n we focus here on the limitations of this approach which further motivate this _ letter_. the shortcomings are due to the poor choice of coordinates near the black hole horizon and , hence , manifest themselves only in its neighborhood . \n we have argued , though , that this is precisely the region of most interest . \n a set of consistency problems arises from the need for correct boundary conditions at the horizon . \n such conditions are easily imposed on simple supersonic inflows , but become murkier for co - rotating accretion disks on rapidly - rotating kerr black holes . \n in addition , imposing boundary conditions on magnetic fields is problematic . addressing this issue \n has led to the development of the so - called _ \n membrane paradigm_. starting with the description of the black hole processes in a non - singular coordinate system ( damour 1978 ) , this approach endows an _ approximate _ horizon ( a timelike worldtube ) with special electric and magnetic properties and then reverts back to the frozen star picture for the description of the rest of the spacetime ( thorne and macdonald 1986 ) . \n however , the computation is still performed in the original singular system . imposing boundary conditions near the horizon \n becomes a demanding practical task , as the singular coordinate coverage of the horizon leads to an unphysical blowup of coordinate dependent quantities . \n in papadopoulos and font ( 1998 ) ( pf hereafter ) we put forward the idea of numerically computing accretion flows onto a black hole in a coordinate system adapted to the horizon . \n there , we used simple spherically symmetric flows to establish its basic feasibility . \n in addition , we computed axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic accretion onto _ schwarzschild _ black holes . \n we noticed that even the stiff adiabatic index case @xmath6 was computable , illustrating one of the advantages of a regular coordinate system . in the remainder of this _ \n letter _ we demonstrate , using a model calculation , the functionality of our framework to study accretion flows onto rapidly - rotating black holes . \n coordinate systems attached to physical observers are generically regular at the horizon , but lack the important practical property of stationarity . \n if , besides regularity , we impose the additional requirements of a stationary metric and spacelike foliation we obtain what we call _ horizon adapted coordinates_. a comprehensive family of those systems for the kerr spacetime can be obtained with the following transformation from the standard boyer - lindquist ( bl ) @xmath7 to the new coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 dr$ ] , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a non - negative integer which parametrizes the family ( natural units are used throughout , @xmath15 ) . \n all members of the family are regular at the horizon , hence the algebraically simplest choice ( @xmath16 ) is preferred . \n this corresponds to the so - called kerr - schild ( ks ) form of the kerr metric . with this choice \n the line element becomes @xmath17 d\\tilde{\\phi}^2 . \n \\label{ksform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the regularity at the horizon , which is located at the largest root of the equation @xmath18 , is manifest . a more extensive discussion , in particular of the wider range of choices available in the non - rotating case , is given in pf . \n the central aspect of our computational paradigm is that the integration domain includes , in a natural way , the event horizon of the black hole . \n in fact , it extends _ inside _ the horizon and can be truncated at an arbitrary inner radius . this prescription solves , at once , both conceptual and practical problems in the near horizon region . \n boundary conditions for fields can be imposed in an unambiguous manner , whereas there is a sharp reduction in the spatial gradients of the solution . \n the first benefit arises from the nature of the horizon as a one way ( ingoing ) membrane . in the absence of good boundary conditions even \n poor \" conditions would be acceptable , provided they allow a stable and converging computation . for example , unphysical reflections or numerical heating will never re - emerge from the horizon , since the characteristic speeds for such processes are necessarily slower than @xmath19 . \n the reduced resolution requirements arise from the fact that the projections of four - vectors onto the three - dimensional integration space is everywhere regular , given the regular coordinate system . \n the regularization of the horizon introduces two new non - zero metric elements . \n however , this additional algebraic complexity should not be much of a concern for relativistic integration algorithms which must be designed to handle a general metric . \n on the other hand , it is a fact that considerable intuition and mathematical tools have been obtained in the simpler frozen star form of the kerr metric . \n this background work can still be used by transforming geometric quantities back and forth . for stationary accretion patterns \n this process is entirely straightforward and we include a demonstration of such transformations below . \n the generic astrophysical scenario in which matter is accreted in a non - spherical way by a compact object is the one suggested originally by bondi and hoyle ( 1944 ) . \n the astrophysical importance of this process has led to its detailed numerical investigation ( see e.g. , benensohn , lamb and taam 1997 and references therein ) . \n recently , the relativistic version of the bondi - hoyle accretion has been extended to the non - axisymmetric , non - rotating black hole case ( font and ibez 1998b ) . \n its generalization to account for rotating black holes remains still unexplored . \n we take here the first step in that direction , investigating the problem adopting a simple geometrical scenario . at the same time \n , this scenario offers an adequate test - bed calculation to demonstrate the proposal of horizon adapted coordinates for accretion onto _ rotating black holes_.    in performing the computation , we adopt the  infinitesimally thin \" accretion disk setup . \n this is motivated by simplicity considerations , before attempting three - dimensional studies . \n this initial setup has been used to some extent in newtonian simulations of wind accretion in cylindrical and cartesian coordinates ( see , e.g. , matsuda et al 1991 , benensohn , lamb and taam 1997 and references therein ) . in our setup \n we use a restricted set of equations , where the vertical structure of the flow is assumed not to depend on the polar coordinate . \n this assumption requires that in the _ immediate neighborhood _ of the equator , vertical ( polar ) pressure gradients , velocities and gravity ( tidal ) terms vanish . \n those conditions are strictly correct at the equator for flows that are reflection symmetric there . hence , despite the obvious reduction of generality , important insights into the accretion process can be obtained in a simplified framework . in particular , as will be apparent from the discussion of the flow morphology below , our dimensional simplification still captures the most demanding aspect of the kerr background , which is encoded in the large azimuthal shift vector near the horizon . \n this is most relevant for the issues discussed in this work .    for the computation we use the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations \n as presented in banyuls et al . \n hence we take advantage of the explicit knowledge of the characteristic fields in order to build up a linearized riemann solver to handle discontinuous solutions . \n the formulation of the equations in schwarzschild coordinates and the numerical algorithm can be found in font and ibez ( 1998a ) . \n tests of the code can be found in font et al ( 1994 ) ( for the subclass of special relativistic flows ) and banyuls et al ( 1997 ) ( for general relativistic flows in schwarzschild backgrounds ) . to perform the simulation we present below \n , we specialize the equations to the ks form of the metric , eq . \n ( [ ksform ] ) . \n specific details , including the description of the time - dependent variables , fluxes and source terms of the equations in bl and ks coordinates , as well as a comparative study of the accretion flows in those systems will be reported in a forthcoming paper ( font , ibez and papadopoulos 1998b ; fip hereafter ) . \n the initial state of the fluid is completely characterized by the asymptotic conditions upstream the accretor . \n we choose as free parameters the asymptotic velocity @xmath20 , the sound speed @xmath21 and the adiabatic index @xmath22 . \n in addition , as the accretor is a rotating black hole , we have an extra parameter , @xmath5 , its angular momentum per unit mass . \n we choose a rapidly - rotating hole with @xmath23 . \n the simulation is performed in the equatorial plane ( @xmath24 ) using an ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) grid of @xmath27 zones . \n representative results of our simulations are plotted in fig .  1 , where we show isocontours of the logarithm of the density at the final time @xmath28 \n . the hole is rotating counter - clockwise . \n this simulation employs ks coordinates , with the innermost grid radius placed at @xmath29 , i.e. , _ inside _ the horizon , @xmath30 , which for our model is @xmath31 . \n the outermost radius corresponds to @xmath32 . \n the dotted line indicates the position of the horizon . \n the simulation is characterized by the presence of a well - defined tail shock . \n the flow pattern reaches a steady - state around @xmath33 , which was confirmed computing the time evolution of the mass accretion rate as described in fip . \n the transformations to horizon adapted coordinates are non - trivial , from a geometric point of view , in the sense that a new _ time _ \n coordinate is involved . \n there is no one - to - one correspondence between snapshots of evolutions in the two different systems . \n still , for accretion flows that relax to a stationary state , the time dependence is , by definition , factored out and a direct comparison is possible by transforming four dimensional tensor quantities appropriately ( details are given in fip ) . making use of the final stationarity of the flow , we plot in fig .  2 how the accretion pattern would look like were the computation performed in bl coordinates . \n the transformation induces a noticeable wrapping of the shock around the central hole . \n the shock would wrap infinitely many times before reaching the horizon , due to an additional coordinate pathology of the bl system . as a result , \n the computation in bl coordinates , although in principle possible , would be much more challenging than in ks coordinates , particularly near to the horizon . \n genuine effects , such as frame dragging are expected in the case of accretion not on the equatorial plane . \n since the last stable orbit approaches closely the horizon in the case of maximal rotation , the interesting scenario of co - rotating extreme kerr accretion would be severely affected by the strong gradients which develop in the strong - field region . \n this will most certainly affect the accuracy and , potentially , also the stability of numerical codes . \n an example of instabilities possibly related to coordinate issues has been reported recently ( igumenshchev and beloborodov 1997 ) . \n we have shown the feasibility of a new geometrical approach to the numerical study of accretion flows onto rotating black holes . \n our procedure relies on the use of _ horizon adapted coordinate systems _ in which all fields , i.e. , metric , fluid and electromagnetic fields , are free of coordinate singularities at the event horizon . among the large family of those systems we propose the use of the kerr -

{"ContextTokens": 3467, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "with the increasing popularity of technologies such as digital television , internet streaming video and video conferencing , video compression has became an essential component of broadcast and entertainment media . among various kinds of approaches , block - based motion estimation and compression \n are most widely accepted ones . \n the _ block - matching algorithm_(bma ) for _ motion estimation_(me ) has been adopted in many international standards for digital video compression , such as h.264 and mpeg 4@xcite . in the framework of video coding \n , the statistical redundancies can be categorized by either temporal or spatial . for the purpose of reducing the temporal redundancies among frames , \n motion estimation was applied@xcite . \n block - based matching algorithms consider each frame in the video sequence formed by many nonoverlapping small regions , called the marcoblocks(mb ) which are often square - shaped and with fixed - size(@xmath0 or @xmath1 ) . \n let @xmath2 represents the @xmath3th mb and @xmath4 the number of blocks , and @xmath5 ; let @xmath6 be the entire frame and the partition into mbs should satisfy @xmath7 and @xmath8@xcite . \n given a mb @xmath2 in the anchor frame , the motion estimation problem is to determine a corresponding matching mb @xmath9 in the target frame such that the matching error between these two blocks is minimized . \n then , a motion vector is computed by subtracting the coordinates of the mb in the anchor frame from that of the matching mb in the target frame . instead of sending the entire frame pixel - by - pixel , a set of motion vectors \n is transmitted through the channel which greatly reduces the amount of transmission . in the decoder side \n , a motion compensated procedure is applied to reconstruct frames using the received motion vectors and the anchor frame . referred to many researches , \n the motion estimation and encoding part consumes nearly @xmath10 percent of the total amount of computation in the whole video compression procedure thus making it an active research topic in the last two decades . \n there are many proposals of bmas in literature . \n the most basic one is the _ exhaustive search_(es ) , also known as full search which simply compares the given mb in the anchor frame with all candidate mbs in the target frame exhaustively within a predefined search region . \n previous research showed that es can obtain high matching accuracy but requires a very large amount of computation thus infeasible to implement in real - time video applications . to speed up the search , various fast algorithms for block matching which reduce the number of search candidates \n have been developed . \n well known examples are _ \n 2-d logarithmic search_(logs)@xcite , _ three step search_(tss)@xcite , _ four step search_(4ss)@xcite , _ diamond search_(ds)@xcite which is accepted in the mpeg-4 verification model and widely implemented in vlsi , and the recent proposed _ adaptive rood pattern search_(arps)@xcite which is almost two or three times faster than ds and even achieves higher _ peak signal - to - noise ratio_(psnr ) than that using ds .    from the optimization point of view \n , block - based methods can be described by the following minimization@xcite , @xmath11 :    @xmath12 - i_{k-1}[\\mathbf{n}+\\mathbf{d}_{m}])\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the target frame ; @xmath14 is the anchor frame ; @xmath15 is the matching error ; @xmath16 are the motion vectors and @xmath17 is the search area to which @xmath18 belongs , defined as @xmath19 . \n sign of @xmath20 is positive when motion of the block is towards positive direction from @xmath21th frame to @xmath22th frame . and negative when motion of the blcok is in negative direction from @xmath21th frame to @xmath22th frame . \n @xmath23 is an @xmath24 size mb with the top - left corner coordinate at @xmath25 . \n the goal is to find the best displacement motion vector @xmath26 for each mb @xmath23 , in the sense of the criterion @xmath27 . \n _ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) was originally proposed by kennedy and eberhart in 1995@xcite . \n it is widely accepted and focused by researchers due to its profound intelligence background and simple algorithm structure . \n currently , pso has been implemented in a wide range of research areas such as functional optimization , pattern recognition , neural network training , fuzzy system control etc . and obtained significant success . like _ \n genetic algorithm_(ga ) , pso is also an evolutionary algorithm based on swarm intelligence . \n but , on the other side , unlike ga , pso has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation@xcite . in pso , \n the potential solutions , called particles , fly through the solution space by following the current optimum particles . the original intent was to graphically simulate the graceful but unpredictable choreography of a bird flock . through competitions and cooperations , \n particles follow the optimum points in the solution space to optimize the problem . \n many proposals indicate that pso is relatively more capable for global exploration and converges more quickly than many other heuristic algorithms@xcite . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . \n section ii introduces the pso algorithm and we propose the pso - zmp block - matching algorithm for motion estimation in section iii . \n simulation results and analysis on five video sequences are given in section iv . \n section v concludes the paper . \n particle swarm algorithm is a kind of evolutionary algorithm based on swarm intelligence . \n each potential solution is considered as one particle , and these particles are distributed stochastically in the high - dimensional solution space in the initialization period of the algorithm . through following the optimum discovered by itself and the entire group , each particle periodically updates its own velocity and position . \n @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where , @xmath31 is the number of particles and @xmath32 is the dimensionality ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 $ ] is the velocity vector of particle @xmath35 which decides the particle s displacement in each iteration . \n similarly , @xmath36 , @xmath37 $ ] is the position vector of particle @xmath35 which is a potential solution in the solution space . \n the quality of the solution is measured by a fitness function ; @xmath38 is the inertia weight which decreases linearly during a run ; @xmath39 are both positive constants , called the acceleration factors which are generally set to 2.0 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two independent random number distributed uniformly over the range @xmath42 $ ] ; and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the best solutions discovered so far by the group and itself respectively .    in the @xmath45 time iteration , particle @xmath35 uses @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the heuristic information to updates its own velocity and position . \n the first term in eq.[vid.original ] represents the diversification , while the second and third intensification . \n the second and third terms should be understood as the trustworthiness towards itself and the entire social system respectively . \n therefore , a balance between the diversification and intensification is achieved based on which the optimization progress is possible . \n in this paper , an algorithm based on _ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) and _ zero - motion prejudgment_(zmp ) is proposed to reduce the computation and obtain satisfied compensated video quality . \n the pso - zmp algorithm consists of three sequential routines . \n 1)zero - motion prejudgment ; 2)predictive image coding ; 3)pso matching . instead of distributed stochastically in the entire matching space \n , we also devise a novel distribution pattern for particle initialization to bear the center - biased characteristics of common motion fields . \n as widely adopted , we measure the amount of computation and the quality of compensated video sequence by _ computation _ and _ peak signal - to - noise ratio_(psnr ) . \n computation is defined as the average number of the error function evaluations per mv generation . due to the minimum computational cost \n , we choose _ summed absolute difference_(sad ) as the error function which is defined as follows :    @xmath46    where the size of a mb is @xmath24 . \n + the motion estimate quality between the original @xmath47 and the compensated video sequences @xmath48 is measured in psnr which is defined as :    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the number of frames in the video sequence . \n zero - motion prejudgment(zmp ) was firstly introduced in @xcite . \n data shown in @xcite represented that in most of test sequences , more than 70% of the mbs are static which do not need the remaining search . \n so , significant reduction of computation is possible if we perform the zmp procedure before the follow - up predictive coding and pso matching routine . \n we first calculate the matching error(sad in this paper ) between the mb in the anchor frame and the mb at the same location in the target frame and then compare it to a predetermined threshold , saying @xmath52 . \n if the matching error is smaller than @xmath52 , we consider this mb static which do not need any further motion estimation , and return a @xmath53 $ ] as its motion vector(mv ) .      based on the center - biased characteristics in video sequences , that is , \n certain mbs are highly correlated in local regions of the frame , the encoder creates a prediction of a region of the current frame based on previously encoded and transmitted frames . \n if the frame is processed in raster order , the current - encoded mb should have four patterns of _ region of support_(ros ) that consists of the neighboring blocks whose mvs will be used to compute the predicted mv for prediction in fig . \n [ pre.pattern ] due to the limited computational cost . experiment mentioned in @xcite shows there is little psnr difference using these four ros patterns in the predictive coding routine , and ros type d consumes least amount of computation because of its simplest structure . \n thus , ros pattern d is adopted in this paper .      due to the spatial correlation characteristics between mbs in one frame , during the initiation period of the pso matching routine , we distribute the particles in four specific patterns(fig .  [ pattern.all ] ) with a view to reduce the computational cost but to achieve higher psnr . \n since frames are processed in raster order , the mb in the top - left corner in the frame , can not be predictive coded because there is no reference mb for prediction in the current - encoded frame . \n thus , for this condition , we simply skip the predictive coding and begin pso searching routine directly with the initial positions of particles in the pattern type b in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] .    for those mbs located at the leftmost column of frames , \n their reference mbs used in predictive coding are in the other side of the frame , thus may not be highly correlated and inefficient in prediction . \n so , we also solely perform the pso searching routine in this case , with the pattern type d in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] . and , for the last leftmost \n mb been processed in the frame , that is , the mb in the bottom - left corner , we use the pattern type c in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] instead . \n otherwise , pattern type a in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] is adopted . \n we put four particles in a rood shape with size zero(size refers to the distance between any vertex point and the center - point ) in the adjacent mbs and four particles in a rood shape with size one , and then rotate it by angle @xmath54 . with two rood shape in difference size \n , we try to balance the global exploration and local refined search in order for broader searching space as well as higher matching accuracy . \n moreover , we distribute particles equally in all directions(8 particles in 8 directions ) with a view to , in stochastic condition , find the matching mb in each direction with equal possibility . \n notably , if the position of a particle in the during initialization and a pso run is out of the boundary of the image frame , we simply put the particle in the position nearest to its intended position . \n generally , there are two widely adopted stopping criteria . \n fixed - iteration _ , that is , given a certain iteration time , saying @xmath31 , the search stops after @xmath31 times of iteration \n . the other is _ specified - threshold_. during a pso run , the most - fitted value found by the entire group @xmath55 , called the \n _ best so far _ \" value will be updated by the particles . for minimization problems , we specify a very small threshold @xmath56 , and if the change of @xmath55 during @xmath57 times of iteration is smaller than the threshold , we consider the group best value very near to the global optimum , thus the matching procedure stops . due to the center - biased characteristics of real - world motion fields , \n we adopt the fixed - iteration method in this paper for reducing the computational cost . \n we incorporate the zmp , the predictive coding and the pso matching routines together and propose a block - matching algorithm for motion estimation based on pso and zmp . \n the algorithm can be summarized in the pseudocode below : + \n we ve tested our pso - zmp algorithm on five test video sequences : akiyo , container , mother & daughter , news and silent within 100 image frames(except 90 frames in akiyo due to the limitation of the sequence length ) . \n pso matching is the core routine in our algorithm . in this paper , to balance between computational cost and compensated video quality , we adopt the standard pso with inertia weight@xcite which is widely considered as the defacto pso standard . \n we use the fixed - iteration stopping criterion with max 5 iterations . \n the max velocity is set to 5 . \n the inertia weight @xmath38 decreases linearly from 0.9 to 0.4 during a pso run and two acceleration factors @xmath58 , @xmath59 are set to 2.0 , as commonly did . \n * we divide a whole image frame into @xmath60 mbs in the simulation . * \n we select a zmp threshold @xmath52 for each test video sequence correspondingly based on data obtained in experiments . \n the parameters are shown in table  [ zmp.table ] . \n * we do not restrict the range of candidate matching mbs rigidly by a search window @xmath17 . instead , through the fixed - iteration and the setting of max velocity , particles search for the matching mb in an area more flexible and adaptable .    .zmp \n threshold @xmath52 for five test video sequences [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in this paper , we have proposed a fast block - based motion estimation algorithm based on _ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) with novel particle initiation patterns . applied successfully in many functional and combinatorial optimization problems \n , pso is proved to have a relevant stronger ability in global exploration . \n in addition , a _ zero - motion prejudgment_(zmp ) routine is incorporated into the pso bma to further reduce the computational cost of the algorithm . \n simulation results show that the pso - zmp bma proposed requires less amount of computation and achieves psnr in a acceptable degree of drop . while close and acceptable psnr performance compared to \n widely accepted arps and ds bma . \n moreover pso just consumes a few lines of codes due to its simplicity which makes the pso -

{"ContextTokens": 2291, "GeneratedTokens": 182, "SynthesizedBody": "during several years , it was believed that the existence of free - standing two dimensional crystals was impossible , because they would be unstable and ultimately return to a three dimensional object@xcite . \n however , it appeared recently that isolated sheets of graphene could be obtained by mechanical exfoliation of a graphite crystal , which therefore proves the predictions of ref . to be inaccurate@xcite . \n the experimental accomplishment of synthesizing two - dimensional crystals has lead to the emergence of a truly new physics , since the particular properties of graphene can be considered as a bridge between quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and condensed matter physics@xcite . \n indeed , near the @xmath1 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , the one - particle energy dispersion is linear with the momentum , and therefore the corresponding quasiparticles could be described by a dirac - like hamiltonian . \n then , qed properties can be studied by investigating the electronic structure of graphene . \n later on , it was shown@xcite that the same technique could be used to obtain other compounds , opening the path to the investigation of a large number of two dimensional crystals . \n however , it seems that most of the experimental and theoretical efforts in this area are still focusing exclusively on graphene , primarily because of the high quality of samples that could be obtained . in the present paper , we investigate by means of ab - initio calculations the electronic structure of mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , as they have been synthesized experimentally@xcite , as well as hypothetical two dimensional hexagonal crystals ( with a graphene like structure ) made of si and ge . \n to perform the calculations , we have used density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite as implemented in the code vasp ( vienna ab - initio simulation package)@xcite , within the framework of the paw ( projector augmented waves ) method @xcite . \n the local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) as well as the perdew burke ernzerhof@xcite variant of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) were used for the exchange - correlation potential . \n a cut - off of @xmath2 ev was used for the plane - wave expansion of the wave function to converge the relevant quantities . for brillouin zone integrations , \n a mesh of @xmath3 @xmath4-points@xcite was used for mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , while a mesh of @xmath5 was sufficient to describe two - dimensional silicon and germanium .    concerning the crystal structure mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 we used the experimental bulk values since it was noticed in ref . \n that @xmath6d crystals in these cases remains very close to their 3d parents . in this case , \n gga was used . \n for the two dimensional hexagonal crystals made of si and ge , we optimized the lattice parameter using either the lda or the gga \n . moreover , it appeared that the band structure obtained using either lda or gga were very similar , so we have chosen to show only results corresponding to lda . \n for all studies here , the c parameter was taken to be large enough to ensure that no interaction remains between layers , making them effectively isolated @xmath6d objects . \n there is a big interest in transition metal dichalcogenides , since due to their layered structure , they have extremely anisotropic properties , and therefore an intercalation process is easy to conduct . in particular , mos@xmath0 is used in the technology of li batteries . \n to investigate purely two - dimensional mos@xmath0 , we have used the bulk lattice parameter ( a @xmath7  ) , as reported in ref . \n since reduced dimensionality can sometimes leads to magnetic behavior in systems which are not magnetic in bulk , we checked the possibility to have a spin - polarized ground - state , but it was found that two - dimensional mos@xmath0 remains in a non - magnetic state .    . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n [ fig : dos - mos2 ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    our calculated dos is presented in fig [ fig : dos - mos2 ] . \n as for three - dimensional mos@xmath0 , the two - dimensional variant of this compound is semiconducting : the bands on each side of the band gap are derived mainly from the mo - d states , which is what a calculation of three dimensional mos@xmath0 also shows@xcite . also , a large gap exists in the occupied states , separating the s - s states ( between -14 and -12 ev ) and the hybridized mo and s - p states ( between -6 and 0 ev ) .     the band structure of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig . \n [ fig : bnds - mos2 ] , we present the energy bands of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 . we see again a lot of similarities with three dimensional mos@xmath0 : the bands around the band - gap are relatively flat , as expected from the d character of the electron states at these energies . \n the band gap , which has a value of 1.78 ev , is direct , and occurs at the high - symmetry point @xmath1 , whereas for three dimensional mos@xmath0 the band gap is indirect@xcite . \n as for mos2 , the nbse@xmath0 structure is strongly layered , with each nb layer being sandwiched between two se layers , where weak van der waals forces are holding the whole geometry together . \n nbse@xmath0 is known to be a prototype to study charge density waves ( cdw ) , and is also a superconductor . here \n we focus only on the electronic structure of two - dimensional nbse@xmath0 and a lattice constant of @xmath8 @xcite was used to perform the calculation .    . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n [ fig : dos - nbse2 ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    as for mos@xmath0 , we have checked the existence of a magnetic solution , since the non spin - polarized dos ( fig . \n [ fig : dos - nbse2 ] ) is very peaked at the fermi level , but we found again a non - magnetic ground state . \n however , contrary to mos@xmath0 , two dimensional nbse@xmath0 is metallic , just like the three dimensional version of this compound . \n the dos of two - dimensional nbse@xmath0 shows a lot of similarities with the one of mos@xmath0 , with a large hybridization between nb and se states . \n in addition , the band state which is pinned at the fermi level is derived primarily from nd d - orbitals , and this band state becomes separated in energy from all other states ( fig . \n [ fig : bnds - nbse2 ] ) .    . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n [ fig : bnds - nbse2 ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ] \n with four sp electrons in the valence band , silicon and germanium ( possibly together with bn ) are probably the closest to carbon from a chemical point of view . \n therefore , it is of interest to see if in their two - dimensional form they could present some similarities with graphene , and we have investigated this possibility here .    . \n lattice parameters of hexagonal si and ge computed with either lda or gga . [ tab : lattice ] [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]      , scaledwidth=70.0% ]     , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in table [ tab : lattice ] , we present our computed lattice parameters ( see computational section ) for hexagonal si and ge . \n as expected , they are larger than the one of graphene ( @xmath9  ) because of the larger radius of si and ge in comparison with c. also , because of the well - known overbinding of lda , gga gives lattice parameters which are larger than the ones given by lda . \n , scaledwidth=70.0% ]     , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we used these lattice parameters for the calculation of the corresponding densities of states and band structures . \n as seen in figs [ fig : dos - si ] and [ fig : bnds - si ] , two - dimensional silicon shows a lot of similarities with graphene : in particular the gap is also closing at the k point of the brillouin zone , and the dispersion around this point is linear . \n in contrast , two - dimensional germanium is quantitatively different from graphene : a conduction band is partially filled by electrons around the @xmath10 point and therefore the bands at the @xmath1 point are shifted up in energy , so that two - dimensional germanium is not a zero - gap material , but rather a poor metal . for three dimensional germanium , it is known that lda / gga gives a non band - gap behavior , and a more advanced technique like the gw approximation@xcite is required to obtain a band gap . \n however , our calculations with dft show that two - dimensional germanium is much more metallic than three - dimensional germanium , and therefore the metallic nature is here much more robust and is likely to be preserved even if a quasiparticle theory ( like the gw approximation ) would be used . \n we have studied by means of ab - initio calculations the electronic structure of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , as well as hypothetical graphene like structures of si and ge . \n we have found that two - dimensional silicon might from an electronic structure point of view be equivalent to graphene , with a linear dispersion of the electronic structure around the k - point . \n the possible advantage with si in this regard is that it probably is more easily interfaced with existing electronic devices and technologies . \n the obvious disadvantage is that sp@xmath11 bonded si is much less common than for c , and the synthesis of si in a graphene like structure is extremely demanding and is likely to represent a meta - stable material . \n the electronic structure of ge in the graphene structure results in a metallic behavior , and the electronic structure of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 is quite similar to that of the three dimensional counterparts , with mos@xmath0 being a gapped system with a direct gap and nbse@xmath0 a metal . \n s.l . acknowledges financial support from anr pnano grant anr- 06-nano-053 - 02 and anr grant anr - blan07 - 1 - 186138 , as well as cines / ccrt for computer time . \n o. e. is grateful to snac and vr for support and to a kof initiative at uppsala university .", "StartTimeOffset": 1200892054020, "RequestID": "80c04de56ab18b01821cb6dd5421d48ff1c29c42", "TotalTokens": 2473}

magnetic flux quasi - particles . although absent in the simplest version of the cf theory , the presence of discrete degrees of freedom , such as spin and valley , ushers in a rich variety of phenomena . for many years , \n understanding the spin polarization of the various fqhe states has been a topic of great interest among experimentalists and theorists alike . in the case of exotic states such as the one formed at landau level filling factor @xmath1 , \n the determination of spin - polarization is valuable for deducing the nature of the ground state as its possible non - abelian statistics has promising consequences for topological quantum computing . \n @xcite for other states , e.g. those which form around @xmath2 1/2 and 3/2 , numerous transport , @xcite optical , @xcite and nuclear spin resonance and relaxation @xcite studies have aided the understanding of the role of spin in the cf picture . \n @xcite    it was recently shown @xcite that cfs which form at @xmath3 in alas quantum wells possess a valley degree of freedom which in principle is analogous to spin . in this study \n , we use in - plane strain to tune the energy of the occupied valleys , and measure the valley splitting energy needed to completely valley polarize the cfs at and around @xmath0 . \n we find remarkably good agreement between our results and the existing theory which was developed to explain the spin - polarization of cfs in ( single - valley ) gaas . \n @xcite however , the polarization energy , normalized to the coulomb energy , is found to depend on the 2d electron density ( @xmath4 ) , a feature not explained by the cf theory . \n we report measurements on two samples ( a and b ) which are 12 and 15 nm - wide alas quantum wells grown using molecular beam epitaxy . \n details of sample growth are given in ref . \n a standard hall bar is fabricated using photolithography , geauni alloy is used as contact , and metallic front and back gates are deposited on the sample which allow us to control @xmath4 . \n studies were done both in a @xmath5he cryostat and a dilution refrigerator at base temperatures of about 0.3 k and @xmath6 mk , respectively and using standard low - frequency lock - in techniques . \n the band structure of bulk alas has three ellipsoidal conduction band minima ( valleys ) at the x - points of the brillouin zone . in quantum wells wider than 5 nm , only two valleys with their major axes lying in the 2d plane are occupied . \n @xcite their in - plane fermi contours are anisotropic and are characterized by transverse and longitudinal band effective masses , _ m@xmath7 _ = 0.205__m@xmath8 _ _ and _ m@xmath9 _ = 1.05__m@xmath8 _ _ , where _ m@xmath8 _ is the free electron mass . \n the degeneracy between these two valleys can be broken by the application of strain which we accomplish by gluing the sample to a piezoelectric stack ( piezo ) , as shown in fig . \n a voltage @xmath10 applied to the piezo induces a strain @xmath11}-\\epsilon_{[010]}$ ] where @xmath12}$ ] and @xmath13}$ ] denote strains along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] crystal directions respectively . \n @xcite this strain causes a transfer of electrons from one valley to another . \n the resulting valley splitting energy is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the deformation potential which in alas has a band value of 5.8 ev . \n @xcite although the above picture of valley occupation was first chalked out for the case of electrons , @xcite a similar approach for cfs was recently demonstrated . \n @xcite      for the density range under study , the band parameters for alas electrons are such that the zeeman energy is larger than the cyclotron energy . since there are two valleys available for occupation near @xmath16 , the first two electron landau levels ( lls ) have the same spin . \n since the cfs near @xmath0 form in the second electron ll , this cf system is effectively single - spin and two - valley . \n this is in contrast to the energy level diagram for gaas electrons which involves only one valley ; however the band parameters in the gaas system are such that the zeeman energy is small and the second electron ll is of the opposite spin . \n thus , in gaas , the cfs formed around @xmath0 form a single - valley , two - spin system . in either case \n , the cf sea at @xmath0 is formed by hole - flux composite particles . \n @xcite these cfs no longer feel the externally applied perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath17 . \n instead , they feel an effective magnetic field given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the field at @xmath0 . \n the various fqhe states formed around @xmath0 are taken to be the integer qhe states of these cfs . \n each fractional electron filling factor ( @xmath20 ) has an integer cf counterpart ( @xmath21 ) . @xcite \n in fig . 1(c ) we show magnetoresistance traces for sample a taken at different values of @xmath22 . at @xmath16 , the fqhe minima at @xmath23 and 7/5 are very weak or absent while the minimum at @xmath24 is strong . as we move away from @xmath16 \n various minima become weak and strong as a function of @xmath22 . for example , the traces shown in purple ( @xmath16 ) and blue ( @xmath25 ) show the weakest minima for @xmath26 while those in red ( @xmath27 ) exhibit the weakest minima for @xmath24 . \n this behavior can be qualitatively understood by following the simple cf energy fan diagram shown in fig . \n 1(b ) . at @xmath16 \n each of the cf lls is doubly ( valley ) degenerate . \n this degeneracy is broken as we apply strain and the two valleys separate in energy . \n there are specific values of @xmath22 at which the lls of cfs undergo an energetic `` coincidence '' thereby causing the gap at the fermi energy ( @xmath28 ) to vanish . for example , the @xmath26 state ( _ p _ = 3 ) is weak at @xmath16 and undergoes one coincidence as @xmath22 increases before becoming completely valley polarized at large @xmath22 . in transport measurements , \n these coincidences show up as the weakening of the fqhe minima . at high enough strains \n all the states become fully valley polarized . \n note here that as we apply strain , both the electron and cf lls split in energy . \n it is important to realize that in the range of @xmath22 depicted in fig . \n 1 , it is the cfs that become valley polarized ; much larger values of @xmath22 are needed to valley polarize the @xmath29 lls . \n @xcite this two - valley nature of the electron lls is critical for justifying the description of the cfs as being formed in a `` two - valley , single - spin '' system .     to [ 010 ] valley in response to strain is also shown . \n ( b ) simple energy fan diagram in the cf model for a two - valley , single - spin system . \n the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] valleys are degenerate in energy at @xmath16 and the degeneracy is lifted as strain is applied . \n ( c ) magnetoresistance traces taken at @xmath30 = 300mk , at different values of strain ( shown on the right in units of @xmath31 ) for @xmath32 @xmath33 . \n the traces are offset vertically for clarity . ] \n note that the data in fig . \n 1(c ) were taken at @xmath30 = 300 mk . \n we repeated these measurements at @xmath35 mk in a second cooldown in a different cryostat and the results are shown in fig . \n the behavior is qualitatively the same , but we note that resistance minima at some higher order fractions , for example @xmath36 and 10/7 are better developed .    to demonstrate the response of the various minima to @xmath22 , we hold @xmath17 fixed at a particular @xmath20 and sweep @xmath22 . in figs . \n 3(a ) and ( b ) , we show results for sample a at @xmath30 = 300 mk and 50 mk respectively . \n the peak positions are observed to be temperature independent . \n note the symmetry between the positive and negative values of @xmath22 . \n this is because the current in this sample is flowing along the [ 110 ] crystal direction with respect to which the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] valleys are symmetric . in each trace of fig . \n 3 the phase and number of oscillations are consistent with the fan diagram in fig . \n the high quality of this sample is evident from the appearance of higher order fractions ( up to @xmath37 ) . \n the oscillations at the higher order fractions are particularly interesting since the field sweeps show only weak evidence of their existence . \n similar measurements in sample b are shown in fig . \n 4(a ) . \n our piezorsistance data allow us to determine the onset of cf valley polarization at exactly @xmath0 also . \n notice the piezoresistance trace taken at @xmath0 in fig . \n 4(a ) ; for comparison , we also show a trace at @xmath17 = 0 in fig . \n the @xmath17 = 0 trace can be explained qualitatively in a simple model where the conductivities of the two anisotropic valleys add in parallel , leading to an increase in the resistance as the electrons are transferred from one valley to the other . \n the piezoresistance can also stem from a loss of screening as the electrons become valley polarized and lose their valley degree of freedom ; this is analogous to the @xmath39 exhibited by 2dess as the electrons become @xmath40 polarized in a parallel magnetic field . \n @xcite the `` kink '' in the piezoresistance and the near - saturation of the resistance at sufficiently large @xmath22 signal the full valley polarization of the electrons , @xcite again , in analogy with the magnetoresistance data . \n @xcite now , as shown in fig . \n 4(a ) , we observe a qualitatively similar behavior at @xmath41 . \n the resistance at @xmath0 exhibits a minimum when the two valleys are balanced , increases as the valley degeneracy is broken and saturates once the cfs are fully valley polarized . \n we take the kink position , marked by an arrow in fig . \n 4(a ) , to signal the complete valley polarization of the cfs . \n @xcite we note that very recent experimental data @xcite for gaas cfs at @xmath42 also show an enhancement , followed by a near - saturation , of the resistance as the cfs become @xmath40 polarized .    the energy needed to completely valley \n polarize the cfs , @xmath43 , can be obtained directly from figs .  3 and 4 . \n for @xmath44 , 3 and 4 , complete polarization is signalled by the outer - most peaks in piezoresistances as these occur at the last coincidence ( see e.g. , the red square and blue circle in fig.1(b ) ) . \n for the case of @xmath0 , the kink position in the piezoresistance trace is taken as the point of full valley polarization ( shown in fig . \n 4(a ) with an arrow ) with the upper and lower excursions included in the error bars . in all cases , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the measured threshold strain and @xmath15 = 5.8 ev .      . \n data are shown for both samples at comparable @xmath4 . \n theoretical phase boundaries ( originally worked out for two - spin system ) based on the microscopic cf theory ( black circles ) and @xmath48 model ( solid line ) from ref . \n 18 are also shown . ]    in fig . \n 5 we plot @xmath43 for various @xmath20 in units of the coulomb energy @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dielectric constant of alas and @xmath51 is the magnetic length . \n data from both samples ( obtained from figs \n . 3(b ) and 4(a ) ) are shown at comparable values of @xmath4 . \n @xcite also shown are small black circles ( joined with a dotted line ) , taken from ref . 18 which is the theoretical calculation @xcite using a microscopic cf - wavefunction . \n note that the theoretical phase boundary is independent of @xmath4 . \n this is not surprising since the cf - hamiltonian comprises entirely of the coulomb interaction term . \n hence all relevant energy scales in the problem should scale as @xmath52 . \n since the calculations are not done for negative values of @xmath21 , we compare our experimental data points to a simpler , one - parameter model which is obtained in ref . \n 18 as follows . \n the points obtained from the microscopic cf theory for positive @xmath21 are extrapolated to @xmath53 ( 1/@xmath21 = 0 ) to obtain an intercept of @xmath54 . \n since this value corresponds to the complete polarization of the cf sea at @xmath0 , we have @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 in units of @xmath57 . \n @xcite @xmath48 is defined to be the _ polarization mass _ of the cfs . \n @xcite for a given @xmath21 , the condition of complete polarization can be written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the valley splitting of the cfs and @xmath60 is the cf cyclotron energy . using @xmath61 and the fact that @xmath62 , the phase boundary can be obtained in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath48 . \n the final result , @xmath63 , is shown as two solid curves separating the partially- and fully - polarized cfs . \n although there is no inherent mass in the cf hamiltonian , this simple one - parameter model is found to be valuable in interpreting experimental data . \n @xcite    there is overall good agreement between the experimental data points and the theoretical phase boundary , given that there are no adjustable parameters . \n not only are the values very close to each other , but also the asymmetry of the phase boundary about @xmath64 is reflected in the data . \n for example , @xmath65 and 8/5 both correspond to @xmath66 . \n the corresponding values of @xmath43 , however , are theoretically expected to be different . \n consistent with this , our data shows that @xmath43 for @xmath67 is always larger than the value for @xmath24 . \n however , this agreement might be fortuitous . first , both the experiment and the theory have errors . \n some causes of error in the theoretical calculations for the ideal 2d system are examined in ref . \n our experiment carries an overall uncertainty in the @xmath68-axis of up to 10@xmath69 arising from our strain calibration . \n second , and more importantly , the experimental phase boundary for the full valley polarization of cfs depends on @xmath4 , in contrast to the theoretical expectation .    to bring out the @xmath4-dependence of the phase boundary \n , we repeated similar measurements for a range of @xmath4 in both samples and the results are summarized in fig . 6 . the data for sample a were taken at 300 mk ( during the first cooldown ) and data for sample b at 50 mk . \n the theoretical predictions based on the single @xmath48 model are also shown as dotted lines . \n our experimental results show that there is a small , but measurable variation of the normalized polarization energy as a function of @xmath4 . here \n we emphasize that , for a given sample , the trend observed as a function of @xmath4 is unaffected by the @xmath70 error in our strain gauge calibration .     for samples a and b. \n the dotted horizontal lines are theoretical predictions based on the @xmath48 model for the various @xmath20 as indicated . \n when not shown , error bars are comparable to the symbol size . ]    the density dependence that emerges from our data demands a better theoretical understanding . note \n that residual interactions between cfs can not be blamed for the trend we observe . \n this is clear from the @xmath4-independent nature of the phase boundary obtained from the microscopic cf theory , which in principle includes effects of interaction . \n @xcite however , ref . \n 18 deals with an ideal 2d electron system with no thickness , ll mixing or disorder . in ref . \n 19 , an attempt was made to address the role of finite layer thickness . \n a simple way is to replace the bare coulomb potential @xmath71 with an effective potential @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the characteristic thickness of the electron wavefunction . in our samples , \n where electrons are confined to square quantum wells , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath73 is constant or that it slightly increases with increasing density . either way , theory expects the value of @xmath74 to decrease as a function of increasing @xmath4 , opposite to the trend observed in our experiments . \n the effects of ll mixing and disorder are unclear at the moment . \n we thank the nsf for financial support . \n part of this work was done at the nhmfl , tallahassee , which is also supported by the nsf . \n we thank e. palm , t. murphy , g. jones and j.h . \n park for assistance and j.k . \n jain and k. park for illuminating discussions . \n sample a exhibits a peak instead of saturation near the valley polarization strain at @xmath0 . \n the cause is unclear , although it might be due to enhanced intervalley scattering near cf valley depopulation , similar to what is seen in 2dess near subband depopulation [ h.l . \n stormer , a.c . \n gossard and w.  wiegmann , sol.stat .  commun . \n * 41 * 707 ( 1982 ) ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 1213450632648, "RequestID": "c73006a2bd41ab28a750c78ed8df485b71f774eb", "TotalTokens": 4132}
{"ContextTokens": 2973, "GeneratedTokens": 311, "SynthesizedBody": "semi - regular variables ( srvs ) are a sub - class of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars which also include long period variables called mira variables . \n these objects show a large amplitude visual variability ( v@xmath1 2.5 ) with well defined periods of 300 - 400 days . on the other hand srvs have smaller variability amplitude ( v@xmath2 2.5 ) and periods range from 10 to 1000 days . \n srvs are also less studied than mira variables . \n there is a speculation that srvs could be the progenitors of mira variables , but needs confirmation ( bedding & zijlstra , 1998 ) . \n the boundary between these two subclasses is not well defined . \n several stars which were classified as mira variable , have been reclassified as srv ( srb ) after observing irregularity in there periods ( ragland et al . , 2006 ) . \n asymmetry in agb variables , particularly in miras , have been observed earlier with high angular resolution techniques like lunar occultations ( lo ) , long baseline interferometry ( lbi ) , and aperture masking interferometry ( mondal & chandrasekhar , 2002 ; ragland et al . \n , 2006 ; weiner et al . , 2006 ) . \n the departure from spherical / circular symmetry may be due to stellar rotation , non - radial pulsation or bright hot / cold spots in the outer layers of the atmosphere . \n multi - epoch angular diameter measurements of the same source using lo technique are important in this context as they provide angular diameter values at different position angles across the occulted stellar source . \n any significant variation in the angular diameter values is an indication of asymmetric brightness distribution in the occulted source . \n such asymmetric brightness distributions have been reported earlier in several miras . in a study using hst images , karovska et al . \n ( 1997 ) reported asymmetry in mira a atmosphere at 0.5 @xmath0 which they ascribed to bright spots on the surface of the star , while the asymmetry observed in uv - band is explained as mira a s interaction with mira b. asymmetric structure in a mira variable , u ori , has been seen using lo technique by mondal and chandrasekhar ( 2004 ) . \n this spatial asymmetry was attributed to pulsational mass - loss in a preferred direction . \n asymmetry in mira variables often changes over their pulsation periods which is because of directional mass - loss in different pulsation periods .    in an extensive study , ragland et al . \n ( 2006 ) observed 56 agb variables using the three - telescope infrared optical telescope array ( iota ) interferometer at near infrared h - band ( 1.65 @xmath0 ) to study asymmetry in the source brightness distribution . \n their sample includes 35 mira variables , 18 srvs and 3 irregular variables . \n asymmetric brightness distribution has been detected in 29% of the sources . \n they also speculated that 75% of the mira variables in their sample could be asymmetric , but are beyond the spatial resolution of the detector system they used . among the 16 sources which show asymmetric brightness distributions , 3 are srvs , namely , uu aur , v hya and y cvn . \n all of the srvs are carbon stars and have uniform disk ( ud ) angular diameters of 10.9 milliarcsecond ( mas ) , 21.2 mas and 14.1 mas respectively . \n the cause of the asymmetry is not clearly known . \n they explained that it is unlikely for these stars to have rotational asymmetry or non - radial pulsation unless they have a relatively massive companion ( @xmath3 0.1 m@xmath4 ) . \n these stars are large in size and harbour massive envelopes around them . \n hence , they can not have sufficient angular momentum to develop asymmetry without a binary companion . though convective cells can stimulate non - radial pulsations , but that will be on a smaller scale . however , they speculated that the asymmetry seen in mira variables is due to the formation of an inhomogeneous translucent molecular screen located at about 1.5 to 2.5 stellar radii . \n agb variables generally develop molecular layers in the atmosphere which may cause different optical depth in different wavelengths . \n wittkowski et al . \n ( 2011 ) performed spectro - interferometry on four mira variables in the near - infrared ( nir ) k - band and found wavelength dependent angular diameter . \n they also found a significant deviation from the point symmetry in h@xmath5o band near 2.0 @xmath0 , which was interpreted as inhomogeneities or presence of clumps within water vapour . \n another aspect to be investigated while studying asymmetry in srvs is the polarization of the source . \n radiation from the luminous agb variables is often found to be linearly polarized , generally 1 - 5% . \n asymmetric radiation field due to localized hot / cool spots or deformed shape of the envelope may provide an overall polarization . in case of agb variables polarization arises from purely scattering phenomena . in a recent paper , neilson , ignace & henson ( 2013 ) \n has shown that mira v - band polarization varies only 0 - 1% over last 40 years but the variation in position angle corresponding to it is from 0@xmath6 to 150@xmath6 . \n they suggest that these variations in polarization as well as position angle of mira are due to convective hot spots . on the otherhand in a srv ( v cvn ) \n , they found variability in the polarization of 0 - 7% with a nearly constant position angle . \n the constant position angle of polarization suggests a long term asymmetry along the direction of polarization . \n polarization in very cool stars have been studied for a longtime ( serkowski , 1966 ; dyck , forbes & shawl , 1971 ; kruszewski & coyne , 1976 ) . \n kruszewski & coyne ( 1976 ) reported polarization measurement of 18 cool stars ( including uz ari ) in the visible and nir bands in the spectral range of 0.3 - 1.0 @xmath0 . \n they made polarization observations with the steward observatory 229 cm reflector on the kitt peak and the 154 cm reflector of the mt . \n lemmon observatory . \n they found a good correlation of degree of polarization with [ 3.5 - 11 @xmath0 ] colour which characterizes the dust envelope of the star . on the otherhand \n , a weak correlation is found for polarization with nir ( i - k ) colour which characterizes the stellar photosphere . \n in addition to polarization , maser emission also is not an uncommon phenomena among the late type giants . \n circular polarization observations of these masers have revealed the strength and structure of the magnetic field through out the circumstellar shell . \n kruszewski & coyne ( 1976 ) found a good correlations between the degree of polarization and the separation between 18 cm oh - maser line components . \n the authors concluded that the polarization is produced in the extended stellar atmosphere where the infrared excess and oh - maser emission also originate . \n however , the source of our interest uz ari , does not have any oh - maser emission detection till date , though water maser at 22 ghz has been seen sporadically ( engels , schmid - burgk & walmsley , 1988 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3847, "GeneratedTokens": 192, "SynthesizedBody": "the electric dipole moment of the neutron ( nedm ) is a very sensitive probe for cp violation beyond the standard model of particle physics @xcite . \n the most precise experiments today use ramsey s resonance method and ultra - cold neutrons ( ucns ) @xcite . \n further progress is presently limited by systematics @xcite and the low density of ucns available . here \n we discuss an alternative approach based on spin rotation in non - centrosymmetric crystals . \n the statistical sensitivity of any experiment to measure the nedm is determined by the product @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the duration of the neutron interaction with the electric field @xmath5 and @xmath6 the number of the counted neutrons . \n new projects to measure the nedm with ucns aim to increase the ucn density and thus @xmath6 by orders of magnitude ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) . \n in contrast , experiments with crystals exploit the electric field inside matter , which for some crystals can be by a few orders of magnitude higher than the electric field achievable in vacuum . \n edm experiments with absorbing crystals were pioneered by shull and nathans @xcite . \n their experiment was based on the interference of the electromagnetic amplitude with the imaginary part of the nuclear one . \n abov with his colleagues @xcite were the first who paid attention to the presence of a spin dependent term due to the interference of nuclear and spin - orbit parts of the scattering amplitude in the interaction of neutrons with a non - centrosymmetric non - absorptive crystal . \n spin - rotation in non - centrosymmetric crystals due to such interference effects as a way to search for a nedm was first discussed by forte @xcite . the corresponding spin - rotation effect due to spin - orbit interaction \n was experimentally tested by forte and zeyen @xcite . \n the authors of @xcite have shown that the interference of the nuclear and the electromagnetic parts of the scattering amplitude leads to a constant strong electric field , acting on a neutron during all time of its movement in the non - centrosymmetric crystal . \n this field was measured in a laue geometry diffraction experiment @xcite , in agreement with the calculated value . \n the spin rotation can be measured in bragg @xcite and laue @xcite diffraction geometry . in this paper , we compare both geometries and present preliminary results of a test experiment in bragg geometry . \n we show that the sensitivity of an optimized experiment in bragg geometry can compete with the most sensitive published ucn nedm measurements . \n a detailed recent study of a nedm measurement in laue geometry can be found in @xcite . \n the main advantage of this scheme is the possibility to increase the time @xmath4 of neutron passage through the crystal using bragg angles @xmath7 close to @xmath8 @xcite . in this way , times close to the time of neutron absorption @xmath9 ms were obtained in short crystals @xcite . \n however , in order to suppress systematic effects due to the schwinger interaction ( spin - orbit coupling ) , the method relies on an effective depolarization of the neutron beam by schwinger - rotating the two components of the neutron wave by @xmath10 . \n this fixes the thickness of the crystal to @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 is the electric field affecting the neutron for the exact bragg condition for the crystallographic plane @xmath13 ( @xmath13 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) and @xmath14 the proton mass @xcite . \n therefore the sensitivity of the method can not be increased by using crystals with a higher electric field @xmath12 since the crystal length and thus the time @xmath4 would need to be reduced . on the other hand , it is impossible to increase the sensitivity using bragg angles extremely close to @xmath8 , because of a resulting decrease of the neutron count rate for such angles @xcite . in the experiment @xcite , \n also a strong sensitivity of the method to crystal deformations was found . \n the main advantage of the bragg diffraction scheme @xcite is that the electric field acting on the neutron depends on the deviation of the neutron trajectory from the bragg condition . \n this allows us to control value and even sign of the electric field and makes new tests of systematic effects possible . on the other hand , \n the time @xmath4 that the neutron spends in the crystal can not be increased by using bragg angles close to @xmath8 as it depends on the total neutron velocity @xmath15 and not on the velocity component parallel to the crystallographic planes as in the laue case . \n however , this disadvantage can be obviated by increasing the crystal thickness , in principle . \n a first experiment in bragg geometry was reported in @xcite , measuring the neutron spin rotation due to schwinger interaction in quartz . \n the experimental value of the spin rotation angle was a few times less than the theoretical expectation @xcite . \n the main experimental difficulty was to obtain monoenergetic neutrons with a well - defined small deviation from the bragg condition . \n this was solved by placing the monochromator in a strong magnetic field , but this field may cause systematic errors .    here \n we propose and use a very simple solution of the problem to obtain these monoenergetic neutrons . \n let s consider the symmetric bragg diffraction case . \n a neutron falls on the crystal in a direction close to the bragg one for the crystallographic plane @xmath13 . \n the deviation from the exact bragg condition is described by the parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energies of a neutron in the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .    in this case \n the neutron wave function inside the crystal in first order of perturbation theory can be written @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the @xmath24-harmonic of the neutron - crystal interaction potential . \n for simplicity we consider the case @xmath25 , permitting to use perturbation theory . \n the electric field acting on the neutron in the crystal is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the interplanar electric field for the exact bragg condition . \n a nonzero nedm @xmath28 results in neutron spin rotation by the angle @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the length of the crystal and @xmath31 the component of the neutron velocity perpendicular to the crystallographic plane . \n obviously , sign and value of the electric field ( [ e ] ) are determined by sign and value of the deviation from the exact bragg condition @xmath32 . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] . \n the presence of the electric field will lead to the appearance of a schwinger magnetic field @xmath33/c,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the neutron velocity . \n the corresponding spin rotation angle is @xcite @xmath35    note that the schwinger effect disappears for bragg angles of @xmath8 as @xmath36 in this case : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the component of the neutron velocity parallel to the crystallographic plane . \n this can be used in the nedm experiment to suppress systematic effects due to schwinger interaction .    in the experiment \n @xcite the effect of neutron spin rotation in neutron optics for large ( @xmath39 bragg widths ) deviations from the exact bragg condition have been observed . \n the measured effect has coincided with the theoretical expectation .    in order to tune the electric field \n @xmath40 , we have to select neutrons with a well - defined deviation @xmath41 from the bragg condition . for this purpose , \n we use two separate crystals in parallel orientation ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . by heating or cooling the second ( small ) crystal the interplanar distance @xmath42 changes and , therefore , the energy of the reflected neutrons . \n the second crystal selects only the neutrons corresponding to its own bragg condition from the whole beam passing through the first crystal . \n the deviation parameter and , accordingly , value and sign of the electric field having affected these neutrons in the first crystal depend directly on the temperature difference between the two crystals ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) . \n and @xmath43 ) in a non - centrosymmetric crystal : the electric field has a pole for neutrons exactly fulfilling the bragg condition . by choosing the deviation from the bragg condition \n , value and sign of the electric field can be selected . \n we use bragg reflection in a second crystal with a different temperature @xmath44 to select neutrons with a certain deviation.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the value of the bragg width @xmath45 for the ( 110 ) quartz plane ( @xmath46 ) is @xmath47 . to shift the reflected wavelength by one bragg width \n , @xmath48 should have the same value , corresponding to a temperature difference of @xmath49 ( linear coefficient of thermal expansion for quartz @xmath50 ) . \n note that a common variation of the two crystals temperatures in itself does not influence the value of the electric field ; only the temperature difference between the two crystals needs to be controlled .     for the neutrons reflected by the small crystal \n is determined by the temperature difference @xmath51.,scaledwidth=80.0% ] \n a test experiment was carried out at the facility for particle physics with cold neutrons pf1b @xcite of the institut laue - langevin . \n the scheme of the experiment is shown in fig . \n [ fig:12 ] . \n we used the ( 110 ) reflex of quartz . \n the length of the main crystal was 14  cm . as mentioned above the backscattering geometry ( bragg angle close to @xmath52/2 ) \n allows us to suppress effectively the schwinger effect .    to measure the nedm we should direct the initial neutron spin along the x axis ( see fig . \n [ fig:12 ] ) and investigate the dependence of the y component of the final polarization vector ( i.e. the element @xmath53 of the polarization tensor ) on the temperature difference between the two crystals . \n the main systematic error of this experiment is due to the residual schwinger effect . \n it can be investigated by measuring the polarization component along the z axis ( elements @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the polarization tensor ) . therefore the measurement of a single projection of the final polarization vector only is not sufficient . \n we used the 3-d polarization analysis device cryopad @xcite to measure the whole polarization tensor . in first order the measured difference of the polarization tensor after reversing the electric field is @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the times the neutrons stay in the crystal for the positive and the negative electric field , respectively . \n @xmath61 are the components of the residual magnetic field and @xmath62 the components of the schwinger magnetic field @xmath63 . \n @xmath64 is the neutron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath65 the effective magnetic field corresponding to the electric field @xmath5 and the nedm @xmath28 . for @xmath66 \n v / cm and @xmath67  e@xmath68 cm , @xmath69  g.    he spin filter . \n the analyzer crystal back - reflects neutrons according to its bragg condition . \n the pyrolytic graphite pg ( 002 ) with about 50 % reflectivity directs the reflected neutrons to the npsd . \n it also unavoidably reflects a part of the beam after the spin filter which was used to monitor the beam intensity . \n , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    two main effects can simulate a nedm :    1 .   schwinger effect . \n it results in nonzero components @xmath70 and @xmath71 but does not contribute directly to the components @xmath72 related to the nedm . \n however , false effects can arise from imperfections of the 3-d polarization analysis device . \n these effects can be investigated by measuring the residual schwinger effect via @xmath73 or @xmath74 . \n for example , if the angular accuracy of the 3-d analysis is @xmath75 and the schwinger effect is suppressed down to a level of @xmath76  g ( quite realistic numbers ) , then the residual false effect will be on the level @xmath77  g , corresponding to @xmath78  e@xmath68 cm . \n 2 .   residual magnetic field . \n effects due to nonzero magnetic field do not compensate in the difference tensor since the neutrons for both signs of the deviation parameter @xmath41 have slightly different energies and thus spend slightly different times in the residual magnetic field : @xmath79 . in our case @xmath80 . \n therefore the residual magnetic field in the polarization analysis device needs to be small : @xmath81    the main idea to control the contribution of the schwinger effect to the nedm matrix element @xmath82 is to measure the angular , i.e. the spatial distribution of the polarization tensor by a position sensitive neutron detector ( npsd ) because the nedm and schwinger effects have different angular dependences for bragg angles close to @xmath8 . \n the nedm effect is constant , see ( [ eq : fid ] ) , whereas the schwinger one is proportional to @xmath83 , see ( [ eq : fis ] ) and would be visible in a spatial dependence of the components @xmath82 and @xmath84 . \n between the two quartz crystals.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the measured dependence of the integral intensity of neutrons reflected by the second crystal on the temperature difference @xmath51 between the two quartz crystals is shown in fig . \n [ fig:13 ] . \n the intensity minimum corresponds to equal interplanar distances in the two crystals . \n the observed difference of interplanar distances for the two crystals at @xmath85 is probably due to impurities .    in the previous measurements @xcite we found the temperature differences corresponding to maximal electric fields acting on the neutron : @xmath86  k and @xmath87  k ( arrows in fig . \n [ fig:13 ] ) . \n the corresponding electric field was determined from the slope of the spatial dependence of @xmath74 ( see @xcite for the graph ) : @xmath88 this value coincides with the preliminary result obtained for the bragg angle @xmath89 @xcite . \n the analysis of the spatial dependence of matrix element @xmath84 showed no contribution from the schwinger effect within the present statistics . summarizing all data \n , we find the value for the angle of neutron spin rotation related to the nedm : @xmath90 from this value , we derive the preliminary result @xmath91 the error is only statistical . \n however , from the preliminary analysis of systematic errors we expect that the result is limited by statistics . \n the main contributions to the systematic uncertainty are due to the schwinger effect , the residual magnetic field inside cryopad , a small misalignment between the two crystals , and the curved exit window of cryopad . \n the experiment described above used existing equipment . \n the count rate in the `` gray '' position of the polarization measurements was only @xmath92 60 n / s and the statistical sensitivity to the nedm was @xmath93  e@xmath68 cm per day . \n the main limitations were :    * limited divergence acceptance . \n the beam divergence accepted by the installation was about @xmath94 only \n . however , the beam divergence after the polarizer is about @xmath95 . by installing neutron guides between the different elements , by shortening the installation , and by using a cryopad with larger angular acceptance a factor of @xmath96 in statistical sensitivity can be gained . * \n limited beam size . \n the used beam cross - section 5.5  @xmath97 was limited by the size of the monochromator , the windows of cryopad , and the size of the crystals used . in a dedicated setup and using larger available crystals , a beam cross - section of @xmath98 is feasible , yielding a factor of @xmath99 in statistical sensitivity . \n * limited crystal length . \n the interaction time of the neutrons with the electric field can be increased up to the absorption time constant in quartz , by using one large single crystal or a sequence of shorter crystals . \n we aim for a crystal length of 50  cm compared to 14  cm used in the experiment . taking into account the absorption \n , this will yield a factor of 2.8 in statistical sensitivity . \n * background , polarization analysis . \n optimization of background and polarization analysis can yield a factor of 1.5 in statistical sensitivity .    with these improvements \n , we expect an improvement of a factor of about 65 in statistical sensitivity , yielding a sensitivity of about @xmath100  e@xmath68 cm per day . \n this is comparable to state - of - the - art nedm measurements using ucns . \n we have measured the nedm by crystal diffraction in bragg geometry . \n our preliminary result is @xmath101 ( only statistical error ) . \n the statistical sensitivity of the test experiment was @xmath102  e@xmath68 cm per day . \n it can be improved by a factor of 65 in a dedicated setup and can reach @xmath103  e@xmath68 cm per day for available quartz crystals and neutron beam flux . \n the present scheme of the experiment allows to control systematic effects related to the schwinger effect on - line with an accuracy better than the statistical one . \n the technical requirements ( e.g. accuracy of 3-d polarization analysis , alignment of crystals ) for a systematic uncertainty on the level of @xmath104  e@xmath68 cm seem achievable @xcite . \n the authors would like to thank the personnel of the ill reactor ( grenoble , france ) for the technical assistance in the experiment . \n this work was supported by rfbr ( grants no 06 -

process nucleosynthesis@xcite ) . \n the @xmath69 likelihood region of lsnd , combined with the @xmath69 confidence limits from e776 and the bugey reactor experiment@xcite allow @xmath70 and @xmath71 , giving @xmath72 and @xmath73 . \n the upper end of the range of @xmath8 is reasonably close to our expectation of @xmath74 . \n if is found to be in the lower end of this range , then the mixing of the charged leptons must be supressed from its expected hierarchical value for almost any conceivable neutrino mass scenario .    for the atmospheric deficit , \n the relevant probability is @xmath75 this has the same effect as a two flavor @xmath76 oscillation with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . \n maximal mixing is allowed by the combined frejus , nusex , imb , kamioka sub - gev , and kamioka multi - gev zenith angle dependent data for @xmath79@xcite , giving @xmath80 ( milli - ev ) . \n there is a small probability @xmath81 of oscillation into @xmath2 . \n matter effects are insignificant . \n the vacuum disappearance probability for @xmath2 is @xmath82 this is too small an effect for the solar neutrino deficit , so we assume a @xmath83 small angle msw mechanism . \n the allowed parameters are @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , giving @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n note the similarity in the scales of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . \n the dirac neutrino masses are plotted in figure [ hierarchy ] . \n we note in passing the possibility of extending the hierarchies to a fourth generation . \n three of the particles would have suggestively similar masses . \n it turns out that to be consistent with weak neutral current data@xcite , the fourth up - type quark would have to have a similar mass to the other three particles , in conflict with the existing hierarchy . \n the probabilities for @xmath92 appearance experiments are @xmath93 each expression contains terms where @xmath94 will be large for any conceivable experiment . \n for those terms , @xmath95 will average to @xmath96 over the finite @xmath54 and @xmath56 resolution of an experiment . \n thus we may estimate the probabilities as @xmath97 and @xmath98 . \n currently the best limits for large @xmath65 are @xmath99 and @xmath100 from the e531 experiment at fermilab@xcite . \n @xmath101 gets its scale from @xmath102 . thus , while the parametrization ( [ wolf ] ) is viable , maximal hierarchical mixing with @xmath103 is ruled out for any scenario with @xmath104 . \n maximal hierarchical mixing is not constrained in the @xmath25-@xmath105 channel . \n upcoming experiments may be able to distinguish this scenario from the other possibilities in the next few years . \n the prediction that the atmospheric deficit is caused by @xmath106 oscillations with maximal mixing is unique to this scenario . \n the mixing angle could be pinned down with further atmospheric neutrino data . \n chooz@xcite and san onofre@xcite can eliminate the possibility that the atmospheric deficit is @xmath107-@xmath25 by directly measuring @xmath2 disappearance probabilities . and \n icarus@xcite and minos@xcite might be sufficient to rule out @xmath107-@xmath105 . \n this would leave @xmath107-@xmath108 as the only alternative . \n an mev @xmath92 is then almost inevitable to save bbn since there would be at least four active neutrino flavors at the time of nucleosynthesis . \n observations of the solar neutrino spectrum can firmly establish the mass splitting and mixing angle for the neutrinos responsible , and karmen@xcite can confirm the lsnd result , which would eliminate @xmath107-@xmath25 as a possibility for the solar deficit since the mass splitting would be too large . \n an observation of @xmath107-@xmath105 oscillations at chorus@xcite , nomad@xcite , or cosmos@xcite would then firmly establish @xmath107-@xmath108 for the solar channel . while chorus and nomad themselves have a chance of observing @xmath107-@xmath105 \n , cosmos is very likely to observe this channel , but very unlikely to see @xmath25-@xmath105 . \n it is clear that the next few years will be very exciting for neutrino physics . \n we have shown how neutrino masses appropriate for the various oscillation data can be fit into a hierarchical mass scenario analogous to the hierarchies in the quark and charged lepton sectors . \n small mass splittings and small mixing angles result from the interplay of dirac and majorana mass terms . \n the scenario satisfies all experimental and astrophysical constraints . \n it is unique among proposed solutions in that the atmospheric oscillations are @xmath107-@xmath108 with maximal mixing , a prediction which could be tested experimentally in upcoming experiments . \n t.  yanagida , in _ proceedings of the workshop on unified theory and baryon number of the universe _ , edited by o.  sawada and a.  sugamoto ( kek , tsukuba , japan , 1979 ) ; m.  gell -

{"ContextTokens": 3323, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of nuclear matter properties at high densities and at finite temperature has become an important problem since a large variety of data , where matter is being tested at extreme conditions of density , pressure and non - zero temperature , are becoming available in the modern experimental facilities which are already operational . \n moreover , the constitution of the interior of neutron and protoneutron stars is also a problem which is receiving much attention in the recent literature . \n the crust of the stars , where density is relatively low , can be adequately described by hadronic models . \n the correct calculation of the star properties as the radius and the mass depend on the accuracy of the equation of state ( eos ) used to describe its matter . \n we have checked that different models , either with constant or with density dependent meson - nucleon couplings present different features at subnuclear densities of nuclear asymmetric matter by comparing the regions of uniform unstable matter @xcite . \n the parametrizations of these models generally take into account saturation properties of nuclear matter and properties of stable nuclei . \n extensions of the models for very asymmetric nuclear matter or to finite temperatures show different behaviors . \n another topic of great interest is the in - medium modification of vector meson properties . \n it is well known that the hadron masses are much larger than the sum of its constituents . \n one possible explanation for the large masses is that they may be generated dynamically @xcite . \n spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is also related with the hadron masses . at high temperature and/or dense matter this symmetry \n is expected to be at least partially restored , which modifies the hadron masses and the decay widths @xcite,@xcite . \n experimental signature of the in - medium modifications of the vector mesons have been found very recently @xcite . in @xcite \n the in medium modifications of the @xmath1 meson were investigated in photoproduction experiments and its mass was found to be lowered . in @xcite \n the vector masses were verified to decrease by ten percent in medium . \n other experimental results were also reported in the same direction @xcite and still some experiments have been proposed to detect in - medium modifications in a near future @xcite . in order to take into account the in - medium modifications of the hadrons , density dependent relativistic models are certainly more useful than models with fixed parameters . in 1991 \n brown and rho ( br ) @xcite proposed an in - medium scaling law for the masses and coupling constants for effective chiral lagrangians . \n our proposal here is to study hadronic properties under extreme conditions using lagrangians which incorporate br scaling since this has been successfully applied to describe meson properties . \n as argued in the literature the br scaling describes the behavior of the light mesons in extreme conditions very accurately . \n for example the enhancement of dilepton production observed in heavy ion collisions ( s+au ) in the ceres collaboration and ( s+w ) in the helios-3 is most economically and beautifully described by a chiral lagrangian with br - scaled meson masses @xcite . \n the strategy is to assume that the in - medium effective lagrangian has the same structure as in free space accordingly to the qcd constraints but with parameters which are modified in the medium . \n so , using this approach we obtain an effective theory with density dependent parameters including many - body correlations in a practical framework . \n it has also been shown that it is possible to obtain a relation between the effective parameters of chiral lagrangians in medium and landau fermi liquid parameters@xcite . \n so , a link between the effective theory of qcd at mean field level and the many - body theory of nuclear matter is achieved . using this reasoning \n the authors in @xcite proposed an effective lagrangian whose parameters scale in nuclear medium according to the brown - rho ( br ) scaling . \n we have already shown that one of these density dependent models , to which we refer as tw model @xcite , originally derived at @xmath2 can be extrapolated to finite temperatures once the thermodynamical consistency remains unaltered @xcite . \n the important range of temperature which is discussed lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 mev since the liquid - gas phase transition takes place around @xmath3 mev , the phase transition from hadronic to quarkionic matter around 150 mev and the relevant temperatures in the cooling of a protoneutron star after a supernova explosion takes place go up to approximately 40 mev @xcite . in this work \n we discuss another possible application of the formalism we have derived in @xcite in order to incorporate temperature effects in the study of lagrangians with br scaling . \n it is well known that the same relativistic models used in order to explain data coming from heavy ion collisions at finite temperature , with appropriate parameter sets , also provide eos which can be used in the solution of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff differential equations @xcite for the calculation of stellar properties such as mass , radius and central energy density . \n recent measurements of gravitational redshift of spectral lines provided direct constraints on the mass - to - radius ratio @xcite . in this second case , however , the interpretation of the absorption features as atomic transition lines is controversial @xcite . in recent works \n @xcite we have checked that there are relativistic models which can be accommodated within these constraints . \n hence , astrophysical observations can help in the choice of appropriate models to describe hadronic matter . \n the most common relativistic model used in the description of hadronic matter is the non linear walecka model @xcite . \n when applied in nuclear astrophysics , this model is normally extended with the inclusion of hyperons , which are expected to appear at high densities . \n it was shown in @xcite that a low effective mass at saturation density makes the model inappropriate once hyperons are included . \n the inclusion of hyperons makes the scalar meson interaction stronger and hence the proton and neutron effective masses decrease more rapidly with density , acquiring a negative value . as a test of the br scaled model , \n we also extend it to incorporate the eight lightest baryons and enforce @xmath0 equilibrium plus charge neutrality by accommodating the two lightest leptons as well . \n the same extension is done within the tw model so that both density dependent models can be compared . \n hence , the present work is organised as follows : in section ii the formalism for the br scaled model and its extension to finite temperature are presented , the results are compared with the ones obtained with other relativist models and a discussion is included . in section \n iii the br scaled model is modified so that hyperons can be incorporated and @xmath0 equilibrium and charge neutrality are enforced so that an eos can be obtained and applied to compact stars . in the same section the tw model is also considered so that the results from two density dependent models are compared . in section \n iv a discussion on the role played by the rearrangement term in different models is presented . finally , in the last section , the conclusions are drawn . \n in its simplest version the lagrangian density reads @xcite & = & | + & & + ( _ ^-m_s^2 ( ) ^2 ) -_^+ m_v^2 ( ) _ ^ + & & -_^+^2 _ ^ , [ brlag ] . \n where in the notation of @xcite @xmath5 is the nucleon field , @xmath6 the isoscalar vector field , @xmath7 an isoscalar scalar field , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the vector isovector field , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the isospin operator and the masses with asterisk are br - scaled as introduced in @xcite : = = = = ( ) . \n [ br ] the scalings of the vector coupling constants are given by = ,   = ,   = , where @xmath12 is the nuclear saturation density . \n in the original papers @xcite , @xmath13 was simply taken constant and equal to @xmath14 and hence , not density dependent and , with this simple choice a good description of the ground state was obtained . moreover , \n ( ) = , [ phirho ] with @xmath15 in such a way that @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 and @xmath18 were taken equal or tly greater that @xmath19 . in this work \n we propose another possible parametrization , based on the works @xcite , where ( ) = 1-y , [ phirho2 ] with @xmath20 in such a way that a decrease of the meson masses in medium at the saturation point is ten percent , as found experimentally @xcite . \n it is also worth mentioning that , as far as we know this is the first work where asymmetry is taken into account by the appropriate inclusion of the @xmath21 meson in a br scaled model . \n one would bear in mind that we are using the letter @xmath21 for both the meson and for the total baryonic density . \n as those are common definitions in relativistic models we do not believe it may cause any confusion . \n one can see that the lagrangian in ( [ brlag ] ) is of the form of a walecka - type lagrangian and all the finite temperature formalism that we have developed for the density dependent hadron field theory ( ddhft ) @xcite can be immediately applied to these lagrangians . \n the thermodynamics of effective lagrangians with br scaling has been studied in @xcite for zero temperature . \n the study of the validity of the br scaling hypothesis for the non - zero temperature case is demonstrated in what follows . from the euler - lagrange equations we obtain the field equations of motion in the mean field approximation for infinite matter , where the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values . in this approximation , the expectation value of the @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 meson fields \n are called @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . the coupled equations \n read @xmath26 \\psi&=&0 , \\label{dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rearrangement term @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and the scalar and baryonic densities are defined as @xmath29 notice that if the original parametrization for the br - scaled model is used , @xmath30 is a constant and the last term of the rearrangement vanishes . in the following discussion we consider nuclear matter in the the mean - field approximation . due to \n translational and rotational invariance the lagrangian density reduces to @xmath31\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2 } { m_s^*}^2 \\phi_0 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2 } { m_v^*}^2 v_{0}^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } { m^*_\\rho}^2 b_{0}^{2 } \\label{lag2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 for protons and neutrons respectively . \n the conserved energy - momentum tensor can be derived in the usual fashion @xcite : @xmath33   \\label{tem } .\\ ] ] note that the rearrangement term included above and defined in eq.([rearr ] ) assures the energy - momentum conservation , i.e. , @xmath34 . from \n the energy - momentum tensor one easily obtains the hamiltonian operator : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is identified as the effective nucleon landau mass and @xmath37 is the volume of the system . \n notice that the energy density does not carry the rearrangement term because it cancels out in a mean field approximation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the distribution functions for particles and anti - particles respectively and are calculated next . following the notation in @xcite , the thermodynamic potential can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the entropy of a classical fermi gas , @xmath43 is the temperature , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the proton ( neutron ) chemical potential and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the proton and neutron densities , calculated in such a way that @xmath48 . \n we have @xmath49 where the distribution functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 for particles and anti - particles have to be derived in order to make the thermodynamic potential stationary for a system in equilibrium . \n after straightforward substitutions , eq.([omega1 ] ) becomes @xmath50 for a complete demonstration of the above shown expressions obtained in a thomas - fermi approximation for the non - linear walecka model , please refer to @xcite . \n at this point , eq.([omega2 ] ) is minimized in terms of the distribution functions for fixed meson fields , i.e. , @xmath51 for the particle distribution function , the above calculation yields @xmath52 where @xmath53 . a similar equation , with a sign difference is obtained for the anti - particle distribution function . \n it is important to point out that the fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on the distribution function which appear in the definition of @xmath54 , @xmath21 and @xmath55 and hence , the whole calculation is performed self - consistently . \n the effective chemical potentials are then defined as @xmath56 and the following equations for the distribution functions can be written : @xmath57}\\ ; , \\quad i = p , n . \\label{disfun}\\ ] ] in the above calculation we have used @xmath58 and @xmath59 . within the thomas - fermi approach \n the pressure becomes @xmath60 it is worth mentioning that the thermodynamical consistency which requires the equality of the pressure calculated from the thermodynamical definition and from the energy - momentum tensor , discussed in @xcite , is also obeyed by the temperature dependent brown - rho scaled model .      at this point , \n the parameters used in the br method have to be fixed . through out \n this paper the nucleon mass will be @xmath61 mev , the @xmath1 meson mass @xmath62 mev and the @xmath21 meson mass @xmath63 mev . \n three different sets are used in @xcite . in what follows we use the parameter set called s3 in @xcite and define another one which we call ma , whose bulk properties are more similar to the nl3 @xcite parameter set but with a larger effective mass at nuclear saturation density . while s3 is a parametrization for the original br scaled model given by equation ( [ phirho ] ) , ma is a parametrization for the new scaling , given in equation ( [ phirho2 ] ) . in table \n [ tab1 ] we show the s3 and ma constants and in table [ tab2 ] we display the nuclear matter bulk properties described by the different models used in this work . \n it is important to point out that the value for the saturation density ( vide * in table ii ) was not given in @xcite . for the saturation density value shown in table [ tab1 ] , \n the compressibility is slightly different from what is stated in @xcite ( 260 mev ) . \n this is probably a consequence of the fact that the authors in @xcite have not included the rearrangement term in their calculations . \n notice that we distinguish the @xmath64 from the @xmath65 values . in the br scaled models it is the landau mass that should be identified with the nucleon effective mass determined by the qcd sum rule @xcite and its value should lie in between 0.55 m and 0.75 m.", "StartTimeOffset": 1283730692700, "RequestID": "85ab3ed84ab8d12fac961a0ce2aa5d94f6b461ee", "TotalTokens": 3529}

detrimental to the accelerator , for example in an ante - chamber . \n finally , one may modify the surface to produce less than one secondary electron per incident electron . \n this can be done , for example , by using a rough surface , by using an emission suppressing coating , or by cleaning the surface in - situ ( thermal treatment , plasma glow discharge etc ... ) to remove high sey adsorbed gas and oxide layers . \n these remedies can also be mixed together to give the best results for solving the problem in an existing machine or to be applied in a forthcoming accelerator where the ece problem is expected to occur . \n of course , lowering the circulating beam intensity can retard cloud formation but that also affects luminosity . in this summary , \n we report sey measurements obtained at slac on flat surfaces , aluminium , tin , tizrv non evaporable getter ( neg ) and ticn . \n the system used to measure the sey is shown in fig.[figsketchsetup ] . the experimental methodology used to measure \n the secondary electron yield has been described in @xcite    1 analysis chamber -

situ bakeout . however , to be efficient the bake should be above 150@xmath7c . \n nevertheless , any increase of surface temperature has an effect on the sey @xcite . on some materials like cu or ag , certain oxides have an sey below that of the atomically clean metal . \n hence , growing an in - situ oxide by heating the surface , in presence of oxygen , is also a possibility @xcite . \n many examples can be found in the literature , and an excellent summary is available @xcite . \n another way of processing a surface to lower its sey is to expose it to energetic particles : photons , electrons or ions . \n usually the sey of metals obtained after exposure to energetic particles is close to that of an atomically clean surface . \n this trend seems also not to be observed in the case of exposure to very energetic ions , mev range per nucleons @xcite .    in the laboratory \n we have quantified the reduction of the sey as a function of electron or ion bombardment . by ion bombardment we mean an ion beam , not a plasma glow discharge . \n a plasma glow discharge is very effective in cleaning the surface in a few minutes , but plasma gas pressure required for a stable discharge is above a mtorr @xcite . \n moreover , performing an in - situ glow discharge of in an accelerator vacuum beam pipe is far from trivial . \n tin and activated tizrv getter coatings are good candidates for suppressing the ece . \n tin coating is known to have a sey max ( @xmath8 ) below or close to 1 when freshly deposited @xcite . however \n , when the `` as - deposited '' film is exposed to air , its sey maximum varies between 1.5 to 2.7 @xcite . \n sputtering of air exposed tin by ar@xmath0 ions or exposing it to a high dose of electrons will return @xmath8 to around 1 @xcite .    in the ece \n the energy gain of the secondary electrons is typically lower than 300  ev . in the case of the international linear collider ( ilc ) \n positron damping ring , the average energy was computed to be 130 ev @xcite . \n the effect of 130  ev electron conditioning on the sey and @xmath8 are shown in fig.[figseylblall ] and [ figseymaxelectron ] , respectively . \n it can be seen that after a surface has been cleaned by a bake ( fig.[figseylblall ] ) or by electron conditioning the sey will increase even when the surface is left under a good vacuum ( 5.10@xmath9 torr ) , fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] . \n any scrubbed or `` clean '' surface will adsorb molecules from the residual gas . \n the increase of the sey is linked to the oxidation of the surface by the presence of oxygen atoms in these molecules . \n this was directly verified by observing the evolution of the xps ( x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ) carbon spectrum of tizrv during exposure to residual gas @xcite .    during the passage of the circulating positron beam \n , ions will be created from the residual gas . \n their energy , for the ilc damping rings , is less than 200  ev . \n bombardment from these ions can also contribute to sey reduction . to probe this effect , \n we have submitted three surfaces to ion bombardment . \n the results are summarized in table.[tabseyiondose ] . \n the experimental parameters are described in @xcite . \n energy@xmath10 & dose @xmath11 + ticn & h@xmath12 & 1.29 & 280 & 1.11 + tin & n@xmath12 & 1.09 & 260 & 3.39 + tizrv & n@xmath12 & 1.15 & 300 & 2.29 +    [ tabseyiondose ]    comparing the effect of conditioning to tin , a gas -

exposed technical aluminium surfaces and observed that the sey decreases at first and then re - increases . \n results shown in fig.[figseyalu ] are similar for the two other samples @xcite .    during conditioning the xps spectra \n show the c1s peak shifting toward lower binding energy ( be ) ) , signaling reduction of the oxide surface . with further conditioning , \n the trend stops and the peak broadens . \n atomically clean al shows one peak at 73  ev ( metallic ) and another , al@xmath12o@xmath16 , at 76  ev . \n two of our samples show this double peak structure . \n thus , during conditioning , the peaks evolve from oxide to clean al and then reverse again . \n the third sample was extremely oxidized but , again , the broad peak shifted to lower be and then broadened further , consistent with the other samples @xcite . \n activated getter surfaces @xcite , like st707@xmath17 , tizr and tizrv have a @xmath8 below 1.3 @xcite . \n they also provide linearly - distributed pumping capacity . \n the main interest in tizrv coating over the other neg alloys is that its activation temperature is lowest , 180@xmath7c @xcite . during residual gas pumping the sey of neg increases ( fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] ) , just as it does for initially - clean tin . \n the sey increase of neg was followed with xps measurement by monitoring the evolution of the carbon peak @xcite . \n significantly , during residual gas atmosphere saturation of neg , the @xmath8 exceeds 1.3 , the maximum value obtained when saturating neg with individual common residual gases present in an accelerator environment @xcite . \n this behaviour is seen for a freshly activated neg as well as from a 11.2  mc / mm@xmath15 electron conditioned surface , fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] . \n this suggests that fast saturation by a single species is different from slow saturation by multiple species , i.e. , that time may play a role or co - adsorption of multiple species , may enhance the surface oxidation mechanism , as it can be seen in some surfaces @xcite . \n the residual gas composition of a baked uhv is mainly composed of h@xmath12 which readily diffuses into the neg , co , co@xmath12 , h@xmath12o , and ch@xmath18 which is negligibly - pumped by tizrv @xcite . \n the co - adsorption of the three oxidizing species enhances oxidation , similar to an air - oxidation , compared to oxides formed by dosing with a single specie . \n thicker surface oxide has generally higher sey . \n the process involved in building this thick oxide might be somewhat equivalent to cryogenic co - adsorption @xcite . \n it is planned to test this hypothesis in our setup . \n we have investigated a series of flat surface materials for suppressing the ece . \n the most promising remedies are ti - based coatings . \n tin has historically been the choice for successfully reducing multipacting . upon conditioning exposure to low energy ions or electrons , \n its atmosphere - oxidized surface @xmath8 returns to 1 . \n ticn was developed as an oxidation - resistant replacement for tin ; however , it behaves similarly to tin . \n another coating option is low temperature activated neg , tizrv . following an activating - bake \n , its @xmath8 is 1.2 . as a bonus , \n neg coating provides distributed beam chamber wall pumping . while pumping toward film gas saturation , the @xmath8 increases . to return the sey to low value and restore the pumping capacity , \n the film can be thermally re - activated multiple times . \n the sey of the surface itself may also be restored by electron or ion bombardment , which will also recreate some surface pumping capacity . \n technical al surfaces were investigated under electron exposure . \n we found that @xmath8 will not go consistently below 1.8 . \n however , the behaviour at very large doses , above 3.10@xmath19  @xmath20 , was not measured . \n the sey may increase further , stabilize or oscillate .    in an accelerator environment , \n synchrotron radiation , ions and electrons not only desorb molecules but also produce electrons which can lead to the formation of the ec . \n as we have seen , electron exposure is very efficient in reducing the sey . \n however , as the ec conditions the surface , the number of secondary electrons diminishes , hence the ec can oscillate between being on or off . \n nevertheless , photons and ions directly created by the beam may ensure that an ec does not develop , but only direct measurements in beam chambers will confirm this @xcite . \n most of the thin film sample were graciously produced by d. lee and a. wolski at lbnl , p. he and h.c hseuh at bnl . \n our first tizrv getter was produced at cern , thanks to v. ruzinov of the est group .", "StartTimeOffset": 1288332673272, "RequestID": "2855272e723adcff26f9b1bc30578632826fba33", "TotalTokens": 2882}

the value of @xmath58 is determined by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the electron cooling time . \n nominally , @xmath58 is about 30 . \n as seen in figure [ fig : el - p5a ] , the actual spectral shape is much different from this conventional expectation . \n the flat @xmath0-ray spectrum in @xmath62 hz in the @xmath63-@xmath64 plot is the result of these k - n effects .    the optical depth for photon absorption against electron - positron pair production \n is calculated @xcite . \n the optical depth is much smaller than unity and @xmath0-rays escape without absorption . \n the time variability of emission spectra from blazars is quite common . \n 3c 279 also shows time variation from radio to @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) . to understand the jet formation mechanisms and particle acceleration processes , it is important to understand the mechanism that causes the time variability . @xcite and @xcite show how flare light curves behave according to the shock - in - jet models , which assume that blobs with different speeds collide and that the kinetic energy of the bulk motion is dissipated . \n @xcite interpreted the time variability of 3c 279 as being the result of various values of @xmath5 , although they assumed a broken power - law spectrum of electrons without solving the kinetic equation . \n we apply the internal shock model , by which @xcite will explain the time variability of mrk 421 , to a flare observed from 3c 279 . without considering the details of the collision process \n , we simply assume that a coalesced blob has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath65 and that various physical quantities scale with @xmath5 . \n we examine whether or not the flares are explained by a change in @xmath5 , keeping a constant opening angle for the jet cone . \n the distance of the collision location from the base of the jet , @xmath66 , scales proportional to @xmath67 , while the lateral size of the observed region behaves as @xmath68 , which is roughly equal to the shell thickness in the comoving frame , because the angle from the line of sight is limited by @xmath69 . \n the soft photon energy density changes as @xmath70 . \n we assume that the kinetic and poynting powers scale proportional to @xmath67 so that the total number flux remains constant . \n thus , the injection rate in the comoving frame , @xmath71 , scales proportional to @xmath72 , and the magnetic field scales proportional to @xmath73 . \n we also assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not depend on @xmath5 . \n the value of @xmath74 scales proportional to @xmath5 because of the doppler effects . using this scaling \n , we calculate a flare spectrum . assuming that the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : sed - p5a ] is in a quiescent state , the spectrum observed between 1996 january 30 and february 6 \n is fitted . here \n the bulk lorentz factor in figure [ fig : sed - p5a ] is denoted as @xmath75 , and that of a shocked blob is given by @xmath65 . when @xmath76 , the @xmath0-ray spectrum is fitted fairly well by our model ( figure [ fig : sed - p5b ] ) , although there are some minor discrepancies : the slope in the optical - uv regime is slightly different ; the flux between @xmath46 and @xmath47 hz is underestimated ; and the flux between @xmath47 and @xmath77 hz is overestimated . \n we used the kinetic equations of photons and electrons to calculate emission spectra from 3c 279 , assuming that the emission is from a relativistically moving blob almost along the line of sight . \n our numerical solution shows that the @xmath0-rays are produced by inverse compton scattering of external soft photons , which is consistent with previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n however , we found that the electron spectrum is not a broken power law with a steeper spectrum above a break energy . \n although electrons are cooled before escape ( except those in the lowest energy range ) , the cooling efficiency for high - energy electrons decreases because of the k - n effects . as a result \n , a flat gev @xmath0-ray spectrum is obtained in the @xmath63-@xmath78 plot . \n it should be noted that there is an alternative model of gev emission that assumes different soft photon sources , i.e. , the accretion disk and broad line regions @xcite . in their model , because of the different temperatures of soft photons , a broad gev emission is formed by inverse compton scattering . \n our result of @xmath42 ev seems to be a little high compared with the conventional value of around 10 ev . \n however , the spectra of ionizing radiation that form the broad line clouds are not directly constrained observationally but should extend to energy high enough to multiply ionize atoms of heavy elements . from a theoretical point of view , even the emission from the accretion disk is known to deviate from the blackbody because of scattering effects . \n thus , our choice may be suitable . \n recently , it was suggested that ir radiation from dust might be important , if the energy dissipation occurs mainly far away from the central region @xcite ; although we have not examined this case , the k - n effects will be weaker for this component . \n the kinetic energy density of nonthermal electrons in the blob is an order of magnitude larger than the magnetic energy density , which is the same result as for tev blazars ( ktk ) . as a result , the particles transfer more energy in the jet from the central region to the outer region than the magnetic fields do . \n we demonstrated that the flare observed between 1996 january 30 and february 6 is explained fairly well by the internal shock model with simple scaling laws described by a change in the bulk lorentz factor . \n it is remarkable that the flare is fitted with those simple assumptions . \n it was pointed out by @xcite that the bulk motion of cold electrons / positrons in the jet scatters the external photons , resulting in observed emission peaking at energy @xmath79 . our model with @xmath35 and \n @xmath42 ev implies @xmath80 kev ( @xmath81 hz ) . \n the observed luminosity of bulk compton ( bc ) scattering is estimated as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the thomson cross section , @xmath84 is the number density of cold electrons / positrons , and the integration is done over the blob volume . for 3c 279 with luminosity distance @xmath85 mpc , where the hubble constant @xmath86 is assumed , @xmath78 at @xmath87 is @xmath88 @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the number density of nonthermal electrons shown in figure [ fig : el - p5a ] . \n the value of @xmath91 is unknown , and unless it is about 100 or more , the bc spectrum is not observable ; note that the observed value is @xmath92 at @xmath80 kev . \n regions between the base of the jet and the blob may contribute to bc scattering because more cold electrons may exist there than in the blob . \n let us assume that the bulk lorentz factor is constant and that the number density of the cold electrons behaves as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the distance from the central region and @xmath96 is the critical distance where the bulk lorentz factor saturates or the jet becomes optically thin . if we assume that @xmath21 scales proportional to @xmath97 , the predicted value of @xmath98 is @xmath99 times larger than that of equation ( 4 ) , noting that @xmath100 is measured in the comoving frame of the blob . \n even if there are no cold electrons is the blob , in the inner - jet regions there should exist a corresponding number of cold electrons to relativistic electrons in the blob . \n thus , we obtain the constraint of @xmath101 . if @xmath91 in the blob is more than 100 , too much bc emission is predicted , which probably means that @xmath102 does not increase much with a decrease in @xmath95 . in this case some modifications of our model are needed . \n this work has been partially supported by scientific research grants ( m.k . and f.t . \n : 13440061 ;

{"ContextTokens": 2527, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of the effects of noise is a well established subject in several different disciplines ranging from physics , to chemistry and to biology @xcite . \n the essential role of the noise in theoretical ecology however has been recently recognized . \n some key questions in population ecology are related to the understanding of the role that noise , climatic forcing and nonlinear interactions between individuals of the same or different species play on the dynamics of the ecosystems @xcite . \n more recently noise induced effects on population dynamics have been investigated @xcite . in this paper \n we study the dynamics of two and three interacting species in the presence of multiplicative noise and a periodic driving force . \n specifically we consider : ( a ) two competing species and ( b ) three interacting species . \n the multiplicative noise models the interaction between the species and the environment , and the driving force mimics the climatic temperature oscillations . in case ( a ) \n the interaction parameter between the species is a stochastic process which obeys an ito stochastic differential equation . \n the noise induces spatio - temporal patterns , quasi - deterministic oscillations , stochastic resonance ( sr ) phenomenon @xcite and noise delayed extinction , which is akin of the noise enhanced stability @xcite . in case ( b ) \n we find noise induced spatial patterns whose time evolution is strongly dependent on the initial conditions . \n specifically we consider two different initial conditions : ( i ) an uniform initial distribution which gives rise to anticorrelated spatio - temporal patterns between the two preys , and ( ii ) a peaked initial distribution which gives rise periodically to a strong correlation between the patterns of the three species . \n time evolution of two competing species is obtained within the formalism of the lotka - volterra equations  @xcite using the ito scheme    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is gaussian white noise with zero mean and @xmath2@xmath3 = @xmath4 . \n the multiplicative noise models the interaction between the environment and the species . \n the interaction parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are characterized by a critical value corresponding to @xmath7 . \n we choose @xmath8 . for @xmath9 a coexistence regime of the two species \n is established , while for @xmath10 an exclusion regime takes place , i.e. in a finite time one of the two species extinguishes . \n the two regimes correspond to stable states of the deterministic lotka - volterra model . \n it is then interesting to investigate the time evolution of the ecosystem for @xmath11 varying around the critical value @xmath12 in the presence of fluctuations , due to the significant interaction with the environment . \n the interaction parameter @xmath11 therefore can be described by a stochastic process which obeys the following differential equation    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is a bistable potential ( see fig.1 )    @xmath15    @xmath16 is a gaussian white noise with the usual statistical properties : @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n we perform simulations of eqs . \n ( 1 ) and ( [ lotvol ] ) by using a bistable potential @xmath14 centered at @xmath19 , i.e. in the coexistence region . \n we consider as initial value of the interaction parameter @xmath20 , which corresponds to the left minimum of the potential well ( see fig.1 ) . \n we fix the intensity of the multiplicative noise at a constant value @xmath21 , and we vary the intensity of the additive noise . for low noise intensity \n the two species coexist all the time , while by increasing noise one species dominates the other one for a random time and quasi - deterministic oscillations take place . by increasing even more the noise intensity the coherent response to environment variations \n is lost ( see figs.2(a),(b ) and ( c ) ) . \n these time variations of competing populations are due to noise induced phenomena , namely quasi - deterministic oscillations and stochastic resonance . in fig.2(d ) we report the snr of the squared difference of population densities @xmath22 . at a finite noise intensity @xmath23 \n the snr exhibits a maximum , which characterizes the sr phenomenon . \n now we consider the effect of the additive noise @xmath24 in eq.([beta_eq ] ) on the extinction time of the species and we neglect the multiplicative noise and the periodical forcing . because of the initial condition , the ecosystem is in the coexistence region , then the deterministic extinction time of both species is infinity . by introducing noise , exclusion takes place and a finite mean extinction time ( met ) appears . by increasing the noise intensity \n we obtain a noise delayed extinction : both species survive because of the noise \n . then the average extinction time grows reaching a saturation value , which corresponds to the absence of the barrier of the potential @xmath14 . \n the met as a function of the noise intensity @xmath24 takes a minimum at a finite noise intensity @xmath25 . \n we perform 1000 realizations of eqs . \n ( [ lotvol ] ) and the results are shown in fig.3 . \n in this section we study the effects of the noise on the spatial distribution of interacting species . \n in particular we analyze the spatial distribution of two different ecosystems : ( a ) two competing species , ( b ) three interacting species , one predator and two preys . to study the spatial effects we consider a discrete time evolution model , which is the discrete version of eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) with diffusive terms , namely a coupled map lattice  @xcite . \n the time evolution of the spatial distribution for the two species is given by the following equations    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the densities of the species in the site _ \n ( i , j ) _ at the time step _ \n n _ , @xmath29 is the interaction parameter at the same time , _ d _ is the diffusion constant and @xmath30 indicates the sum over the four nearest neighbors . \n the @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance unit . \n the interaction parameter @xmath33 is a stochastic process obtained by solving iteratively eq.([beta_eq ] ) . \n the bistable potential is centered at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which corresponds to the minimum of the left well . \n the results of our simulations are shown in fig . \n +    we observe periodical formation of correlated patterns . \n after 600 time steps the spatial distributions of the two species appear almost independent . after 3000 time steps the anticorrelation between the two species densities increases \n . a further evolution of the system produces again spatial distributions which are independent after 4800 time steps and anticorrelated after 5400 time steps . \n the two competing species tend to occupy different spatial places periodically without overlap . \n finally we analyzed an ecosystem composed by three species : two preys and one predator . \n we use the same coupled map lattice model of the previous section    @xmath36 + \\sqrt{\\sigma_z}z_{i , j}^n z_{i , j}^n + d\\sum_\\delta ( z_{\\delta}^n - z_{i , j}^n),\\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath37 are respectively the densities of preys _ x _ , _ y _ and of the predator _ z _ in the site _ ( i , j ) _ at the time step _ \n _ , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the interaction parameters between preys and predator and d is the diffusion coefficient . \n the interaction parameter @xmath11 between the two preys is a periodical function whose value , after _ \n n _ time steps , is given by    @xmath40    with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . \n we consider two different initial conditions : ( i ) a homogeneous initial distribution and ( ii ) a peaked initial distribution . in the first case we find exactly anticorrelated spatial patterns of the two preys , while the spatial patterns of the predator show correlations with both the spatial distributions of the preys ( see fig . \n the preys tend to occupy different positions as in the case of two competing species . in the second case we use delta - like initial distributions for the two preys and a homogeneous distribution for the predator . \n after @xmath44 steps we find strongly correlated spatial patterns of the preys which almost overlap each other . \n the maximum of spatial distribution of the predator is just at the boundary of the spatial concentrations of the preys , so that the predator surrounds the preys ( see fig.6 ) . \n the preys now tend to overlap spatially as it occurs in real ecosystems when preys tend to defend themselves against the predator attacks . \n we analyzed the role of the noise on the spatio - temporal behaviors of two ecosystems composed by two and three interacting species . \n we use lotka - volterra generalized equations with multiplicative noise , climatic periodic forcing and random interaction parameter . \n the main conclusions of this work are : ( i ) in the case of two interacting species the appearance of noise induced phenomena such as quasi - deterministic oscillations , stochastic resonance , noise delayed extinction and spatial patterns ; ( ii ) in the case of three interacting species the formation of dynamical spatial patterns exhibiting correlations which are strongly dependent on the initial conditions . \n our population dynamical model could be useful to explain spatio - temporal experimental data of interacting species strongly interacting with the noisy environment @xcite \n . a more detailed study of the dynamics of spatial patterns through stochastic partial differential equations will be the subject of future investigations . \n this work has been supported by intas grant 01 -

{"ContextTokens": 1928, "GeneratedTokens": 122, "SynthesizedBody": "particle physics candidates for dark matter abound , the most popular being the lightest neutralino of supersymmetric models such as the minimal supersymmetic standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions . on the other hand , \n non - supersymmetric models also have their own dark matter candidate , the most popular one being the axion . introduced by peccei and quinn @xcite long ago to solve the strong cp problem , the axion has required an extra global @xmath1 symmetry , attached to the fields of the standard model ( sm ) . \n its inclusion in a supersymmetric lagrangean has also always required the introduction of an extra global symmetry , together with a supersymmetric partner ( the axino ) . to bring both components ( the axion and the neutralino ) under the spell of the gauge principle requires , quite likely , a gauging of the axionic symmetries . \n the study of axionic symmetries and of their gauging is an important aspect of string theory at lower energy , being connected with the presence , in these effective models , of several moduli fields , deprived of a potential and derived from geometrical compactifications . \n the attempt to match these descriptions with effective models ( with or without supersymmetry and gravity ) based on ordinary quantum field theory and supersymmetry ( in flat space ) is pursued in several works @xcite @xcite , where the role of the anomalous interactions and of light pseudoscalars is investigated under the tenets of gauge invariance and unitarity @xcite . \n in general , these effective field theories are characterized by the presence of higher dimensional operators to correct for the exposed ( axial ) anomaly ( in the form of wess - zumino terms with stckelberg axions ) @xcite . \n their gauge structure , in fact , requires at least one extra anomalous @xmath1 interaction . \n the presence of gauge couplings and of a mass for this axion not related by the same suppression scale ( @xmath2 ) - which is of the order of @xmath3 gev for a traditional ( ungauged ) axion - makes this new axion a very attractive dark matter candidate . \n however , building axion models with gauged axionic symmetries is rather challenging from the field theory point of view since it requires a grasp of the unusual features of the chiral anomaly , from the organization of the effective action(s ) to the presence of anomaly poles that challenge the consistency of the s - matrix in some of their scattering amplitudes @xcite . \n one of the realizations of field theories which contain axion - like particles in their spectrum is the minimal low - scale orientifold model ( mlsom ) @xcite , based on a construction involving charge assignments obtained from intersecting branes . \n these models introduce one stckelberg axion for each anomalous @xmath1 present in the gauge structure . in @xcite \n it is shown that the physical spectrum of the mlsom contains always one physical axion , independently of the number of anomalous u(1 ) s . \n supersymmetric extensions of these class of models have been discussed rather recently @xcite , using a superpotential which is the one typical of the ussm @xcite , extending previous studies respect to the mssm , the ussm contains an extra singlet superfield and an extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry , which is anomaly free . in the ussm - a model of @xcite , which is the theory proposed as a possible supersymmetric extension of the mlsom , \n this symmetry has been left anomalous , and the bosonic mechanism of cancellation of these anomalies , which is enforced via the inclusion of wess - zumino ( counter)terms , has been generalized . \n these models contain a combined higgs - stckelberg mechanism for the generation of the mass of the anomalous gauge bosons . \n a physical axion state ( the axi - higgs ) appears quite naturally , together with its supersymmetric partner , the axino . \n this second state becomes a component of the fermionic neutralinos , after diagonalization of the mass matrix of the neutral fermion sector . \n compared to other constructions , in which the axion disappeares from the physical spectrum being just a goldstone mode , in the ussm - a the presence of the extra singlet superfield allows a physical projection of the stckelberg axion of the model on the axi - higgs ( @xmath4 ) . \n therefore this physical state inherits direct axion - like couplings ( such as @xmath5 ) to the gauge fields , becoming a gauged supersymmetric axion @xcite . \n the particle is massless in the absence of peccei - quinn - breaking potentials , in which the axion appears as a phase , while the instanton vacuum can naturally lift its mass up to @xmath6 ev as in the peccei quinn ( invisible axion ) case .    in the non - supersymmetric version of these theories , i.e. in the mlsom , one of the special features of these theories is the presence of anomalous trilinear gauge interactions , which are totally absent in the standard model ( sm ) due to anomaly cancellation @xcite . \n we just recall that in the sm these interactions are suppressed and appear only away from the chiral limit in @xmath7 diagrams ( for instance in @xmath8 vertices ) . \n we show in fig . 1 results for the production of two axions @xmath9 in the mlsom at the tevatron ( left panel ) and at the lhc ( right panel ) , as a function of the invariant mass @xmath10 of the final state , obtained from a recent analysis . \n the gluon fusion chnnel is the most important one for their study . \n the processes involve the usual triangle diagrams as for the production of the higgs sector . in our case \n we have considered two higgs doublets @xmath11 in the cp - even sector . \n the s - channel exchange involves either an @xmath12 , a @xmath13 or a @xmath4 . \n we have selected a mass of the @xmath14 gev and of @xmath15 gev for the @xmath13 , with @xmath16 gev . \n the search for light ( gauged ) pseudoscalars is for sure a challenge for the experimental acvitity at the lhc @xcite , requiring precise evaluation of the qcd background . \n however , while the detection of anomalous extra z prime which modify the neutral current sector of these theories remains difficult , the identification of a light pseudoscalar ( in the mass range of 1 to 10 gev ) , which is their second signature , is more favoured . \n we thank roberta armillis and luigi delle rose for discussions . \n this work was supported ( in part ) by the european union through the marie curie research and training network `` universenet '' ( mrtn -

standing question of how and where high energy emission emerges from the pulsar .    _ \n polar cap _ models ( for review of the models see @xcite ) assume that particles are accelerated right above the neutron star surface and that @xmath0 rays emanate from curvature radiation or inverse compton induced pair cascades in a strong magnetic field . on the other hand _ \n outer gap _ models consider particle acceleration which occurs along null charge surfaces in the outer magnetosphere where @xmath0-rays result from photon - photon pair production - induced cascades . \n these two types of basic models make rather different predictions , particularly of the spectral characteristics of pulsed @xmath0-ray emission . \n detection and study of this high energy emission , which is closely tied to the primary population of radiating particles , seems to be a good discriminant between pulsar models . \n the _ high energy stereoscopic system _ ( h.e.s.s . ) of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes with a low energy threshold of 100  gev at zenith and below 1% crab flux sensitivity for long exposures @xcite was used for observations of three young pulsars : the crab and vela pulsars , and psr  b1706 -

down energy loss rate , and @xmath3 is the distance determined from the dispersion measure to the object . \n the spectra of the egret - detected pulsars can be described quite well by simple power laws with spectral indices in the range 1.39 - 2.07 @xcite . \n some of the spectra show clear evidence for a drop in flux at high energy , above few gev , whereas others have rather large uncertainties in the 4 - 10  gev band , which prevent the clear identification of a similar cutoff . \n the measured crab spectrum is a straight power law . \n extrapolation of egret spectra into the dynamic range of h.e.s.s . suggested that high energy pulsed emission might be observable from these objects within a reasonable exposure time @xcite . \n the outer gap model also supplements pulsed tev emission via inverse compton scattering by gap -

300  gev reported here for three young pulsars after rather limited exposures with h.e.s.s . \n appear to be still above the predictions by the polar cap and outer gap models at these energies . \n therefore , these upper limits can not be used to discriminate between two competing models . \n however , they can severely restrain the luminosity of pulsed @xmath0-ray emission . \n in addition , for the vela pulsar the outer gap model predicts a rather flux emission via inverse compton scattering at tev energies @xcite , which is inconsistent with the model - independent h.e.s.s . \n upper limits reported here . \n the inverse compton flux level depends on the emission spectrum mainly in the infra - red band , which is difficult to measure in most pulsars . \n thus the h.e.s.s . \n upper limits in particular for vela pulsar constrain the density of local soft photon field in the gap . \n * acknowledgement . \n * the support of the namibian authorities and of the university of namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of h.e.s.s . is gratefully acknowledged , as is the support by the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) , the max planck society , the french ministry for research , the cnrs -

pressure physics will also be studied with the fair facility at gsi darmstadt within the laplas project , see  @xcite .    in this paper \n we present new results for the eos of dense hydrogen within the chemical picture . \n we treat the reactions pressure dissociation and ionization self - consistently via respective mass action laws . \n we identify the region of thermodynamic instability and calculate the phase diagram as well as the reflectivity in order to verify the corresponding nonmetal - to - metal transition . \n the eos data is used to model the interior of jupiter within a three - layer model . the agreement with astrophysical constraints such as \n the core mass and the fraction of heavier elements can serve as an additional test of the theoretical eos . \n warm dense hydrogen is considered as a partially ionized plasma in the chemical picture . \n a mixture of a neutral component ( atoms and molecules ) and a plasma component ( electrons and protons ) is in chemical equilibrium with respect to dissociation and ionization . \n the eos is derived from an expression for the free energy of the neutral ( @xmath0 ) and charged particles ( @xmath1 ) , see  @xcite : @xmath2 the first two terms consist of ideal and interaction contributions and can be written as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n @xmath5 contains interaction terms between charged and neutral components caused by polarization  @xcite .    applying fluid variational theory ( fvt ) , \n the eos is determined by calculating the free energy @xmath6 via the gibbs - bogolyubov inequality  @xcite . \n this method has been generalized to two - component systems with a reaction  @xcite so that also molecular systems at high pressure can be treated where pressure dissociation occurs , e.g.  h@xmath7 2h for hydrogen . in chemical equilibrium , @xmath8 is fulfilled , and the number of atoms and molecules can be determinded self -

like particles can not penetrate into the volume occupied by atoms and molecules . \n this leads to a correction in the description of the ideal gas of the charged component  @xcite so that the ideal free energy of protons and electrons @xmath12 is dependent on the reduced volume @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ratio of the volume which can not be penetrated by point - like particles to the total volume . \n it is derived from hard sphere diameters obtained within the fvt self - consistently . the free energy density @xmath16 is given by fermi integrals which take into account quantum effects . \n in order to avoid an intersection of pressure isotherms , which is important for modelling planetary interiors , a minimum diameter @xmath17 has been introduced . \n it was determined starting at low temperatures where it remains almost constant up to 15.000  k , then it increases up to 20.000  k and remains constant again for higher temperatures , see fig . \n [ fig : dmin ] . \n these values are in the range of the results for the diameter of the hydrogen atom derived from the confined atom model  @xcite . \n consequently , the reduced volume concept changes the chemical potential of each component drastically at higher densities and results in pressure ionization . \n this is due to the fact that additional terms appear in the chemical potential , which is the particle number derivative of the free energy , and thermodynamic functions of degenerate plasmas are very sensitive to changes in density . \n this current model fvt@xmath18 includes all interaction contributions to the chemical potentials , thus being a generalization of earlier work  @xcite where only ideal plasma contributions have been treated ( fvt@xmath19 ) .    in fig . \n [ fig : compo ] the composition of hydrogen derived from the present approach is shown for two temperatures . \n hydrogen is an atomic gas at low temperatures ( left ) and low densities . with increasing densities molecules \n are formed due to the mass action law . \n pressure dissociation and ionization can be observed in the high - density region . \n the nonideality corrections to the free energy force a transition from a molecular fluid to a fully ionized plasma . at higher temperatures \n ( right ) the formation of molecules is suppressed and pressure ionization becomes the dominating process . at low densities and high temperatures a fully ionized plasma \n is produced due to thermal ionization . \n we show pressure isotherms over a wide range of temperatures and densities in fig . \n [ fig : piso ] . at low densities \n the system behaves like a neutral fluid . between densities of 10@xmath20 g/@xmath21 and 10@xmath22 g/@xmath21 nonideality corrections to the free energy of atoms and molecules \n lead to a nonlinear behavior of the isotherms . for still higher densities \n a phase transition occurs which is treated by a maxwell construction . \n the thermodynamic instability vanishes with increasing temperatures , and the critical point is located at 16.800  k , 0.35  g/@xmath21 , and 45  gpa .    the critical point and the related coexistence line are shown in fig . \n [ fig : pt ] and compared with results of other eos . \n the critical point itself lies within the range of other predictions , whereas the coexistence line is lower than most of the other results . for a comparison of data concerning the ppt , \n see table  [ tab : cp ] . \n new shock -

temperature plane . \n optical properties are calculated within the drude model . \n the reflectivity @xmath23 is given in the long - wavelength limit via the dielectric function @xmath24 which is determined by a dynamic collision frequency @xmath25 or , alternatively , by the dynamic conductivity @xmath26  @xcite : @xmath27 }   = 1+\\frac{\\text{i}}{\\varepsilon_0\\omega}\\sigma(\\omega ) , \\\\ \n \\sigma(\\omega)&= & \\sigma(0)\\left [   1-\\frac{\\text{i}\\omega}{\\varepsilon_0\\omega_{\\text{pl}}^2 }   \\sigma(0 ) \\right]^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath28 is the plasma frequency of the electrons . \n the reflectivity was determined along the hugoniot curve and is compared with experimental results  @xcite and those of the earlier model fvt@xmath19  @xcite in fig . \n [ fig : reflex ] . \n the results of the current model show a much better agreement with the experiment . \n the characteristic and abrupt rise with increasing pressure was reproduced more accurately . \n this drastic increase appears due to pressure ionization in the vicinity of the criotical point of the ppt . as a result \n , the reflectivity advances from very low values to metallic - like ones almost instantly . \n modelling the interiors of giant planets and comparison with their observational parameters offers an alternative tool besides laboratory experiments of probing the eos of the components the planets are predominantly made of . \n giant planets such as jupiter and saturn consist mainly of hydrogen and , in decreasing order , of helium , water and rocks , covering a wide range of pressures and temperatures . independently from the h - eos used for modelling , the simplest interior structure that is compatible with the observational constraints requires at least three homogenous layers with a transition from a cold molecular fluid in the outer envelope to a pressure ionized plasma in the deep interior and a dense solid core of ices and rocks . \n a solid core may be explained as a result of the formation process and the seperation into two fluid envelopes with different particle abundances by an existence of a ppt as provided by the fvt@xmath18 eos . \n the constraining observational parameters are the total mass of the planet @xmath29 , its equatorial radius @xmath30 , the temperature @xmath31 at the outer boundary , the average helium content @xmath32 , the period of rotation @xmath33 and the gravitational moments @xmath34 . from measurements of the luminosity \n it has been argued @xcite that the temperature profile should be adiabatic . for a given eos , \n the interior profiles of pressure @xmath35 and density @xmath36 are calculated by integration of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath37 along an isentrope defined by the outer boundary . \n the first term on the right hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq_hydrostatgg ] ) is the gravitational potential and the second term the centrifugal potential assuming axialsymmetric rotation . \n we apply the _ theory of figures _ \n @xcite up to third order to solve this equation and to calculate the gravitational moments . \n they are defined as the coefficients of the expansion of the gravitational potential into legendre polynomials , taken at the outer boundary . \n being integrals of the density distribution weighted by some power of the radius , they are very sensitive with respect to the amount and distribution of helium and heavier elements within the planet .    in accordance with previous calculations @xcite , mixtures of hydrogen with helium and heavier elements have been derived from the eos of the pure materials via the additive volume rule . \n it states that the entropy of mixing can be neglected .    assuming a three - layer structure , we present results for jupiter for the profiles of temperature , density , and pressure along the radius in fig . \n [ fig - profilejup ] using two different h - eos , the standard sesame table 5251 for hydrogen  @xcite and the fvt@xmath18 model presented above . \n the profiles of temperature appear very similar , meaning a small uncertainty about the real profiles . \n contrary , the density and pressure profiles exhibit more differences and require some explanation . in the fluid part of jupiter , the presence of a ppt leads to a jump in density between the envelopes . since the gravitational moments as integrals over the density have to be the same for both h - eos , the density profile of a h - eos with ppt has to be smaller in the outer envelope and larger in the inner envelope . the different size and composition of the core for these specific h - eos \n are a consequence of their different compressibility in the regime of pressure ionization at about 1  mbar , where the gravitational moments are most sensitive to the density distribution .    in case of a stiff h - eos like sesame \n , a larger amount of heavy elements is needed in the two fluid envelopes to compensate for the smaller hydrogen density at a given pressure . as a result \n , this material is added to the well - known density - pressure relation of degenerate electrons in the deep interior , leaving less material for the core . \n thus , in case of the sesame - eos , the amount of heavy elements becomes with 10% very large and an unlikely solution with a very small core of light material ( e.g.  water ) can be found .    in case of the fvt@xmath18 eos which is more compressible than the sesame eos at about 1  mbar \n , the helium content is below the value of 27.5% for the protosolar cloud in order to reproduce the lowest gravitational moment @xmath38 . \n furthermore , the next gravitational moment @xmath39 can not be reproduced correctly because the transition to the metallic envelope occurs already at about 90% of the radius and , thus , at too low densities . for opposite reasons , \n both the sesame and fvt@xmath18 eos applied in a three - layer model of jupiter are not compatible with _ all _ of the observational constraints . \n while sesame is probably too stiff , the fvt@xmath18 model is likely too soft in the wdm region at about 1  mbar . \n in this paper , we have extended the earlier chemical model fvt@xmath40 to calculate the eos of dense hydrogen . \n the current model fvt@xmath18 includes nonideality corrections to the free energy of each commponent of the partially ionized plasma . \n we have shown results for the composition and the thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen . \n the ppt was located in the phase diagram , its critical point coincides with earlier results . \n furthermore , we have determined optical properties such as reflectivity and conductivity , within linear response theory using the program package comptra04 . \n the calculated reflectivity along the experimental hugoniot curve shows a good agreement with the experiments . \n however , application of the fvt@xmath18 eos to the interior structure of jupiter indicates that the behavior at about 1  mbar is probably too soft . \n the same conclusion can be drawn from a comparison with shock - wave experiments that indicate the existence of a ppt  @xcite . \n fvt@xmath18 predicts the ppt at too low pressures as well as at too low densities . \n further efforts to solve this problem , especially concerning the reduced volume concept , are necessary . \n we thank p.  m.  celliers , w.  ebeling , v.  e.  fortov , v.  k.  gryaznov , w .- d . \n kraeft , and g.  rpke for stimulating discussions . \n this work was supported by the dfg within the sfb 652 strongly correlated matter in radiation fields and the grk 567 strongly correlated many particle systems .", "StartTimeOffset": 1322140616034, "RequestID": "672382f3a4c892d549cbfe12155b1d8a352d6c53", "TotalTokens": 3510}
{"ContextTokens": 1249, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "-0.1 in    dynamically cold , large galaxy disks seen today appear to have formed early or gradually ; they are easily destroyed through strong interactions or mergers . \n for example , wyse ( these proceedings ) argues the milky way has not suffered a major merger in the last 10 gyr . \n the nearly constant co - moving number of large disks out to @xmath1 ( e.g. lilly et al . \n 1998 ) and the subtle changes with redshift in the scaling relations for large , field spirals corroborate a picture of early formation or slow , quiescent growth , but infrequent death . \n the mass accretion rate onto disks is not known directly , however , at any epoch . \n direct measurements of disk mass as a function of time , e.g. , from measurement of disk scale - heights and stellar velocity dispersions , are desirable , but currently unavailable  except for a handful of local systems . \n photometric estimates of disk mass based on colors are uncertain and incomplete . \n another approach is to use the evolution of the zeropoint and scatter in disk scaling - relations as a diagnostic of _ changes _ in mass accretion rates . \n here we focus on the correlations with , and cause of the scatter in the tully - fisher relation .    for gradual formation , we assume that discrete , but small accretion events perturb otherwise axisymmetric systems . were we to obtain a complete census of galaxies at difference epochs , the relative number of perturbed systems should then reflect changes in the minor - merger rate . \n zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) estimated the minor - merger rate for nearby galaxies by comparing the amplitude of photometric @xmath2 modes to @xmath3 and offsets in luminosity from a fiducial tf relation . \n kinematic measures of disturbance would be preferred , however , since the long - term morphological perturbation may be subtle ( haynes 2000 ) , and photometric effects may evolve with look back - time due to changing gas fractions and star - formation rates ( mihos , these proceedings ) . here \n we give two examples of how spatially resolved kinematics can directly link disk asymmetries to scatter in the tf relation . \n this , in turn , points to a tractable method for measuring the growth rate of spiral disks . \n 0.15 in    -0.15 in    -0.35 in \n -0.1 in    using high signal - to - noise , integral - field , echelle spectroscopy and surface photometry of seven apparently face - on spirals , we have been able to construct h@xmath4 velocity fields out to 3 scale lengths , and compare kinematic to photometric position angles , and kinematic inclinations to photometric axis - ratios ( andersen et al . \n 2000 , and these proceedings ) . from mismatches between these quantities \n , we find that normal , non - barred , intermediate - type spiral disks are non - circular , with a model - dependent estimate of mean ellipticity at the 6% level . considering the effects of our observed distribution of intrinsic ellipticity only on the inferred photometric inclination , we estimate this accounts for @xmath5 mag of scatter in the tf - relation for samples selected within @xmath6 ( figure 1a ) , consistent with franx & de zeeuw s expectations ( 1992 ) . \n evidence that intrinsic ellipticity predominantly effects photometric but not kinematic measures of inclination is shown in figure 1b . \n we establish a tight , @xmath7-band tf relation for galaxies with @xmath8 by using kinematic inclinations . not only is our zeropoint in agreement with courteau ( 1997 ) , but our scatter is smaller ( albeit with a much smaller sample ) . \n hence , it is now possible to study the tf relation for nearly face - on samples , where photometric projection effects and internal extinction are minimized , and the perpendicular component of the disk velocity dispersion can be measured to estimate disk mass . \n -0.1 in    an outstanding question is whether local disk non - circularity is caused primarily by small amounts of lopsided matter accretion , triaxial halos , or other dynamical processes . in principle \n one might hope to determine this from a detailed analysis of disk velocity fields . alternatively \n , we look here to higher - redshift systems to see if greater ellipticity or asymmetry is evident , as we might expect if minor mergers are the dominant source of this perturbation . \n we recently acquired high - resolution , wiyn telescope images of a representative sample of luminous , field spirals at intermediate redshifts for which we have h@xmath4 rotation - curves ( e.g. , bershady et al . 1999 ) . \n we find that significantly over - luminous galaxies in the @xmath9 @xmath10-band tf relation tend to appear optically distorted in the wiyn images  something we were unable to determine during the selection process based on lower - resolution images . \n our definition of `` over - luminous '' accounts for the well - exhibited correlation of tf offsets with color ( figure 2b ) . \n some of the most extreme outliers exhibiting pronounced optical distortions are even accompanied by clear signatures of kinematic asymmetry . \n a representative sequence is shown in figure 3 . \n the physical connection arising here is between bluer colors and higher luminosity ( i.e. enhanced star - formation ) , which is accompanied by increased asymmetry at extreme offsets from a fiducial tf relation . the next step is to establish a statistical trend with redshift of increased asymmetry and tf offsets above and beyond changes in stellar m / l . \n to do so requires further observations . at intermediate redshifts , \n higher angular resolution is needed to detect and quantify the asymmetry in less extreme systems ; precision bi - dimensional spectroscopy is needed to determine reliable inclinations . \n locally , representative kinematic surveys are needed to understand the link between tf scatter and asymmetry .", "StartTimeOffset": 1331972626746, "RequestID": "5d8821a74be36c0b8a5ee6c3c5c300aa395ef91d", "TotalTokens": 1477}

omegaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . \n ( the reason for introducing an electric field will become apparent in the next section . ) \n the experimentally measured numbers are the muon spin frequency @xmath32 and the magnetic field , which is measured with proton nmr , calibrated to the larmor precession frequency , @xmath33 , of a _ \n free _ proton . \n the anomaly is related to these two frequencies by @xmath34 @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . \n the tilde over @xmath32 means it has been corrected for the electric - field and pitch ( @xmath37 ) corrections  @xcite . \n the ratio @xmath38 is determined experimentally from the hyperfine structure of muonium , the @xmath39 atom  @xcite . as mentioned above , \n the recommended value of @xmath38 has changed slightly since the final results of e821 were published  @xcite , increasing the value of @xmath40 by @xmath41 , which is reflected in eq . \n ( [ blr - eq : amue821 ] ) .      in the 2001 data set , \n the systematic errors on the magnetic field were reduced to @xmath43  ppm . \n a number of contributions went into this small error , but one which we wish to emphasize here is the average magnetic field experienced by the muon ensemble . \n the magnetic field in eq . \n ( [ eq : blr - omegaa ] ) is an average that can be expressed as an integral of the product of the muon distribution times the magnetic field distribution over the storage region . \n since the moments of the muon distribution couple to the respective multipoles of the magnetic field , either one needs an exceedingly uniform magnetic field , or exceptionally good information on the muon orbits in the storage ring , to determine @xmath44 to sub - ppm precision . thus traditional magnetic focusing used in storage rings , which involves magnetic quadrupole and higher multipoles , will cause large uncertainties in the knowledge of @xmath44 . \n this problem was mitigated in the third cern experiment@xcite , and in e821 , by using electrostatic quadrupoles to provide the vertical focusing , freeing the magnetic - field design to be as close to a uniform dipole field as possible . \n examination of eq . \n ( [ eq : blr - omegaa ] ) shows that for @xmath45 , called `` the magic @xmath42 , '' an electric field will not contribute to @xmath32 . \n the electric - field effect vanishes for particles with the central momentum equal to @xmath46  gev / c , and is a small ( sub - ppm ) correction for other stored muons  @xcite . \n the cern experiment used a rectangular aperture , which at their 7.3  ppm level of precision did not cause problems in determining the average field . \n however , the large moments of a rectangular beam were not acceptable for the bnl experiment , which aimed at a factor - of - twenty improvement . \n thus a circular beam aperture was chosen for e821 , which resulted in a systematic error on @xmath44 of 0.03  ppm , certainly adequate for the experiment now proposed at fermilab . \n the experiment consists of repeated fills of the storage ring , each time introducing an ensemble of muons into a magnetic storage ring , and then measuring the two frequencies @xmath32 and @xmath33 . \n the muon lifetime is given by @xmath47s , and the data collection period is typically @xmath48 muon lifetimes in the ring . \n the @xmath0 precession period is 4.37  @xmath7s , and the cyclotron period is 149  ns . as the @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) decay , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are emitted in the decay @xmath53 . \n the high - energy decay electrons ( positrons ) carry information on the muon spin direction at the decay . \n thus as the spin turns relative to the momentum , the number of high - energy decay electrons is modulated by the frequency @xmath32 , as shown in fig . \n [ fg : blr - wiggle ] . \n the e821 storage ring was constructed as a `` super - ferric '' magnet  @xcite , meaning that the iron determined the shape of the magnetic field . \n thus @xmath54 needed to be well below saturation and was chosen to be 1.45  t. the resulting ring had a central orbit radius of 7.112  m , and 12 detector stations were placed symmetrically around the inner radius of the storage ring . \n the detector geometry and number were optimized to detect the high - energy decay electrons , which carry the largest asymmetry , and thus information on the muon spin direction at the time of decay . in this design , \n many of the lower - energy electrons miss the detectors , reducing background and pileup . \n the electrostatic quadrupoles  @xcite cover 43% of the ring , leaving significant gaps for the fast muon kicker@xcite and other objects in the ring . \n while alternate schemes for measuring @xmath1 have been proposed , the magic @xmath42 technique has a number of things in its favor . \n one of the most important is that since e821 , it is quite well understood and offers a straightforward path to a 0.1  ppm measurement , or perhaps somewhat beyond . \n its features are :    * high muon polarization and decay asymmetry ; * large storage ring with ample room for detectors , field mapping , kickers , etc . ; \n * muon injection , which has been shown to work ; * rates in the detectors that are easily handled with conventional technology ; \n * data are fit over many @xmath0 cycles , which is a powerful tool to unmask systematic errors that depend on time ; * precision magnetic field techniques which are well understood ; * well understood systematic errors . \n the fermilab proposal  @xcite uses the magic @xmath42 in the precision storage ring developed for e821 , with new detectors , electronics , along with improved magnetic field measurement and control . \n central to the new proposal is the use of features unique to fermilab that will provide copious proton bunches of @xmath55 protons at 10 to 20  ms intervals . \n this compares with @xmath56 protons per bunch at bnl , with a maximum of 12 bunches per machine cycle time of 2.7  s. the effective fill rate at bnl was 4.4  hz , compared with a projected rate of 18  hz at fermilab .    at bnl , pions 1.7% above the magic momentum decayed in an 80  m long fodo line , \n producing a beam that contained an equal number of pions , muons and electrons . \n a large hadronic `` flash '' accompanied the injection into the ring causing a significant baseline shift in the detectors near the injection point .    at fermilab , \n the recycler ring will be used to re - bunch each proton batch from the booster into four bunches with @xmath55 protons each . \n these will be extracted one at a time to a production target at the location of the present antiproton target . \n the antiproton debuncher ring will be used as a 900  m long pion decay line . \n the resulting pion flash will be decreased by a factor of 20 from the bnl level , and the muon flux will be significantly increased because of the ability to take zero - degree muons . the stored muon - per - proton ratio will be increased by a factor of 5 to 10 over bnl . \n segmented detectors  @xcite and new electronics should easily be able to handle the increased data rates per fill of the ring . \n the plan is to move the e821 muon storage ring to fermilab , and install it in a new building near the existing ap0 hall . \n the proposal was well received by the fermilab program advisory committee , but funding has not yet been secured . \n an optimistic schedule has the ring moved , re - assembled and shimmed by 2014 . \n we estimate that in two years of running on @xmath50 , we could achieve the goal of the @xmath57  ppm error . \n most of this running would be simultaneous with nova , using the extra booster batches that can not be used by the main injector program . \n if the main injector program is down , then @xmath0 can use the full booster beam . with further running \n we might be able to approach the 0.1  ppm level . during the project x era \n , we could achieve a a comparable error for @xmath49 . \n the muon anomalous magnetic moment has played an important role in the development of the standard model , and in constraining theories of physics beyond the standard model . \n e821 at the brookhaven lab ags achieved a factor of 13.5 in precision over the famous cern experiments of the 1970s , and reached a relative precision of @xmath3  ppm . \n the new muon @xmath0 collaboration has proposed to improve the error by a factor of four at fermilab . given the sensitivity of @xmath1 to a number of proposed extensions to the standard model , a more precise measurement , especially when combined with improvements in the knowledge of the hadronic contribution that are on the horizon , will provide valuable information for the interpretation of new phenomena that might be discovered at lhc . \n 90                      j. prades , e. de rafael and a. vainshtein , in _ lepton dipole moments _ , advanced series on directions in high energy physics -vol.20 , ed . \n b. lee roberts and william j. marciano , world scientific , p. 303 , ( 2010 ) ; and arxiv:0901.0306 , jan . \n 2009 . \n dominik stckinger , in _ lepton dipole moments _ , advanced series on directions in high energy physics -vol.20 , ed . \n b. lee roberts and william j. marciano , world scientific , p. 393 , ( 2010 ) ; and j. phys . * g 34 * , r45 ( 2007 ) .    andrzej czarnecki and william j. marciano , in _ lepton dipole moments _ , advanced series on directions in high energy physics -vol.20 , ed . \n b. lee roberts and william j. marciano , world scientific , p. 11 , ( 2010 ) ; and phys . rev . * \n d 64 * , 013014 ( 2001 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1339368812166, "RequestID": "fb768d36e2c8f2ce7578b0e61fd927a99966445d", "TotalTokens": 3549}

{"ContextTokens": 3408, "GeneratedTokens": 283, "SynthesizedBody": "we live in a time where people increasingly turn to the web for help . \n our needs , however , often go far beyond mere information from existing webpages and we need help from real people . for example , we ask for answers to specific questions on _ stackoverflow.com_ , for donations on _ donorschoose.org_ , or for help on online social communities such as _ reddit.com_. in each of these cases a user performs a request , which we define as an act of asking formally for something . \n all these communities rely heavily on their members to help satisfy the request . yet \n , the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request remain largely unknown . \n understanding the dynamics and factors of successful requests has the potential to substantially improve such communities by educating users about better formulating requests and promoting likely - to - succeed requests @xcite . \n in addition to these practical benefits , understanding the factors that make a request successful has implications for questions in social psychology and linguistic pragmatics .    studies on the popular crowdfunding platform kickstarter have shown that the success of a request depends most crucially on _ what _ is being requested , that is , whether it is a small favor like an answer to a simple question or a large financial contribution @xcite . \n many other factors need to be controlled as well ; what the giver receives _ in return _ , _ when _ they are asking , and even group dynamics , since people are more likely to give to projects that others are already giving to @xcite . \n satisfying a request on peer - to - peer lending or crowd - funding platforms can also bring a reward , and this also can drive the selection process . \n it is extremely difficult to disentangle the effects of all these factors in determining what makes people satisfy requests , and what makes them select some requests over others .    in this paper \n , we develop a framework for controlling for each of these potential confounds while studying the role of two aspects that characterize compelling requests : _ social _ factors ( _ who _ is asking and how the recipient is related to the donor and community ) and _ linguistic _ factors ( _ how _ they are asking and what linguistic devices accompany successful requests ) . with the notable exception of @xcite ( @xcite ) , \n the effect of language on the success of requests has largely been ignored thus far . \n our goal is to understand what motivates people to give when they do not receive anything tangible in return . \n that is , we focus on the important special case of _ altruistic _ requests in which the giver receives no rewards . \n this controls for the incentive to obtain attractive rewards commonly offered on crowdfunding sites such as kickstarter ; the absence of external factors such as tangible rewards also makes the language itself all the more important in persuading others to help . in this domain \n we also do not need to consider crowdfunding - related marketing strategies such as emphasizing limited time offers ( scarcity ) or showing that other people made the same decision already ( social proof ) @xcite , which are known to manifest themselves in language @xcite . \n second , we focus on requests that a single user can fulfill , thereby additionally eliminating group behavior effects such as herding @xcite or completing donation biases @xcite . finally , we focus on one community in which _ what _ is being asked for is held constant . \n this allows us to explore a large number of different requests of different individual users , at different times , that all have the same goal . \n controlling for the request goal therefore allows us to study how to optimize a particular request solely by optimizing its presentation , and helps provide a direct practical benefit to the requester ( by contrast , advising a requester who needs something to instead ask for something different may be advice of limited practical use ) . \n we therefore chose to study donations in `` random acts of pizza '' , an online community devoted to giving away free pizza to strangers that ask for one . \n random acts of pizza ( raop ) is a community within the social news and entertainment website _ \n reddit.com_. users can submit requests for free pizza and if their story is compelling enough a fellow user might decide to send them one , `` _ _ because ... who does nt like helping out a stranger ? the purpose is to have fun , eat pizza and help each other out . \n together , we aim to restore faith in humanity , one slice at a time . \n _ '' a typical post might sound something like this : `` _ _ it s been a long time since my mother and i have had proper food . \n i ve been struggling to find any kind of work so i can supplement my mom s social security ... a real pizza would certainly lift our spirits _ _ @xcite . '' \n this platform addresses many of the potential confounds that complicate other platforms or studies : all requests ask for the same thing , a pizza , there are no additional incentives or rewards , each request is satisfied by a single user , users and requests are embedded in a social network within reddit , and requests are largely textual . \n this dataset thus provides us with an unusually clear picture of the effect of language and social factors on success . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : inspired by studies in crowdfunding , user - to - user evaluations in social networks , and helping behavior in social psychology , we introduce a variety of textual and social factors that are potentially associated with successful requests . \n we use topic modeling and automatic detection to extract a particularly complex factor , the _ narrative _ structure of requests . \n we employ a logistic regression framework to test what factors matter in the community , showing that narratives are significantly correlated with success , and that signaling gratitude , the intention to reciprocate in the future , supporting the narrative with additional evidence , as well as a high status of the user within the community further increase the chance of success . \n we do not find any support for theories predicting that positive sentiment , politeness , and user similarity are associated with success . \n thus , drawing from social psychology literature , our extracted high - level social features operationalize the relation between recipient and donor . \n we then demonstrate in a prediction task that the proposed model generalizes to unseen requests and significantly improves over several baselines . \n our dataset contains the entire history of the random acts of pizza subreddit from december 8 , 2010 to september 29 , 2013 ( 21,577 posts total ) . to compute user features \n we further crawled the entire lifetime history of posts and comments across all subreddits for all users involved in the raop subreddit ( 1.87 m submissions total ) . \n the community only publishes which _ users _ have given or received pizzas but not which _ requests _ were successful . in the case of successful users posting multiple times it is unclear which of the requests was actually successful . \n therefore , we restrict our analysis to users with a single request for which we can be certain whether or not it was successful , leaving us with 5728 pizza requests . \n we split this dataset into development ( 70% ) and test set ( 30% ) such that both sets mirror the average success rate in our dataset of 24.6% . \n all features are developed on the development test only while the test set is used only once to evaluate the prediction accuracy of our proposed model on held - out data . \n for a small number of requests ( 379 ) we further observe the identity of the benefactor through a `` thank you '' post by the beneficiary after the successful request . \n this enables us to reason about the impact of user similarity on giving . \n previous work on crowdfunding , helping behavior and user - to - user evaluations in social networks have pointed to a number of textual and social factors that could influence the success of a request . \n a person experiencing gratitude is more likely to behave prosocially towards their benefactor and others @xcite . \n however , gratitude is only one component of politeness @xcite . \n other indicators include deference , greetings , indirect language , apologizing and hedges . \n we ask a more general question : does a polite request make you more likely to be successful ? \n in social psychology , _ reciprocity _ refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action . \n people are more likely to help if they have received help themselves @xcite . since in altruistic domains \n , there is no possibility of direct reciprocity , we hypothesize that recipients might pay the kindness _ forward _ to another community member , a concept known as `` generalized reciprocity '' @xcite . \n feelings of gratitude can elicit this behavior @xcite . \n we hypothesize that the community would be more willing to fulfill the request of someone who is likely to contribute to the community later on . \n while many requests are fairly negative , talking about lost jobs , financial problems , or relationship breakups , some of them are positive , asking for pizza for birthday parties and other celebrations . helping behavior literature predicts that positive mood is associated with a higher likelihood of giving @xcite . \n while these studies refer to the sentiment or emotional state of the benefactor , the most closely related linguistic feature that is available in this setting would be the sentiment of the text . \n thus , the literature would predict that very positive requests are more likely to succeed . \n we additionally expect that very negative requests could be more successful , too , since they most likely describe very unfortunate situations of the requester . \n studies on the success of research grant proposals have shown that the simple factor of request length can be significantly related to funding success even when controlling for a variety of other factors @xcite . \n we hypothesize that longer requests will be interpreted as showing more effort on the side of the requester and giving them the opportunity to provide more evidence for their situation . \n studies on crowdfunding have shown that the size of the social network of the project creator is associated with success @xcite . \n work on user - to - user evaluations in online social networks suggests that the success of a request depends on who you are as a user and particularly that notions of user status and user similarity could be influential in the process @xcite . \n we study both status and similarity in this work . \n the textual part of a request , the narrative , has been shown to significantly influence the outcome in peer - to - peer lending platforms @xcite . in order to understand the nature and power of different narratives without coding them manually @xcite , we explore automatic methods of narrative extraction . \n consider the following two pizza requests :          to identify the different kinds of stories we draw on previous literature suggesting that narratives can be automatically extracted using topic modeling and related techniques @xcite . \n we therefore perform topic modeling through non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite of a tf - idf weighted bag - of - words representation @xcite of the requests in our dataset . \n we additionally enforce sparsity on the topic distribution for each request to shape the topics in a way that captures most of a given request , and restrict ourselves to nouns ( using the stanford part - of - speech tagger ) . \n we choose to use 10 topics and use a svd - based initialization for nmf @xcite . \n the resulting topics are shown in table [ table : topic_modeling ] along with descriptive names , the 15 highest - scoring terms and the success rate ( fraction of requests that successfully obtained pizza ) . \n we observe that many topic clusters follow a specific theme and that their success rates vary dramatically ( the average success rate is 24.6% ) . \n topics money1 and money2 focus on money , and the high success rate of topic money1 ( 32.3% ) suggests that this is a particularly successful narrative . topic job is similarly successful ( 31.9% ) and features job related terms . a large number of requests further seem to come from college students talking about studying for classes and finals , their roommates , and the university ( topic student ) . \n another narrative in the data are requests for and about family ( topics time&family and money2 ) . \n this narrative can be identified by the usage of words indicating family relationships like kid , husband , family , mother , wife , and parents ( not all of them are included in the top 15 terms ) . \n topic friend stands out since it noticeably worse than any other topic ( 17.0% ) . \n it captures requests asking for pizza for a friend that is in town , to cater for parties , or to provide culinary support for a night of movie watching with the girlfriend . \n we hypothesize that stories of this topic display little actual need for pizza ( particularly compared to stories talking about money and job problems ) and simply communicate a pizza craving by the requester . \n we further recognize that many requests employ previously defined factors such as gratitude ( `` thanks in advance '' in topic gratitude ) , providing pictures as additional evidence , and the intention to `` pay it forward '' . \n online platforms have created a new mechanism for people to seek aid from other users . \n many online communities such as question & answer sites and online philanthropy communities are created for the express purpose of facilitating this exchange of help . \n it is of critical importance to these communities that requests get addressed in an effective and efficient manner . \n this presents a clear opportunity to improve these online communities overall as well as improving the chance of success of individual requests . \n however , the factors that lead to requests being fulfilled are still largely unknown . \n we attribute this to the fact that the study of _ how _ \n one should ask for a favor is often complicated by large effects of _ what _ the requester is actually asking for . we have presented a case study of an online community where all requests ask for the very same contribution , a pizza , thereby naturally controlling for this effect and allowing us to disentangle what is requested from textual and social factors .    drawing from social psychology literature \n we extract high - level social features from text that operationalize the relation between recipient and donor and demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success . \n we show that we can detect key narratives automatically that have significant impact on the success of the request . \n we further demonstrate that linguistic indications of gratitude , evidentiality , and reciprocity , as well as the high status of the asker , all increase the likelihood of success , while neither politeness nor positive sentiment seem to be associated with success in our setting . \n we link these findings to research in psychology on helping behavior ( see table [ table : helping_behavior_link ] ) . for example , our work extends psychological results on offline communities to show that people behave pro - socially in online communities toward requestors who are of high status , display urgency , and who offer to pay it forward . \n other novel contributions of our work include the finding that linguistic indications of gratitude lead to pro - social behavior , and the result that higher status users are more likely to demonstrate generalized reciprocity . \n our results thus offer new directions for the understanding of pro - social behavior in communities in general , as well as providing a basis for further analysis of success in social media systems . \n we must recognize a number of limitations : a shortcoming of any case study is that findings might be specific to the scenario at hand . while we have shown that particular linguistic and social factors differentiate between successful and unsuccessful requests we can not claim a causal relationship between the proposed factors and success that would guarantee success . \n furthermore , the set of success factors studied in this work is likely to be incomplete as well and excludes , for instance , group behavior dynamics . despite these limitations , we hope that this work and the data we make available will provide a basis for further research on success factors and helping behavior in other online communities . \n we thank christina brandt and jure leskovec for many helpful discussions , niloufar salehi and tuan nguyen for helping with computing user similarity and statistical analysis , and julian mcauley for the original idea to use the raop dataset . \n we also thank reddit user `` jimwll '' who generously provided pizza when we most needed it and the anonymous reviewers for their altruistic comments . \n this work was supported in part by nsf iis-1016909 . \n gore , k.  y. ; tobiasen , m.  a. ; and kayson , w.  a. 1997 . \n effects of sex of caller , implied sexual orientation of caller , and urgency on altruistic response using the wrong number technique . \n 80(3):927930 . \n yinon , y. , and dovrat , m. 1987 . \n the reciprocity -

{"ContextTokens": 3192, "GeneratedTokens": 169, "SynthesizedBody": "understanding when and how massive galaxies form is one of the most outstanding problems in cosmology and galaxy formation . \n galaxies are predicted in cold dark matter based models of structure formation to form gradually with time through the merging of smaller systems ( e.g , . \n cole et al . \n 2001 ) . while there is some evidence for this process , in terms of galaxies ( e.g. , patton et al . 2002 ; conselice et al . \n 2003 ; bridge et al . \n 2007 ) , many details are still lacking . alternatively , \n massive galaxies , which are mostly ellipticals in today s universe ( e.g. , conselice 2006a ) , may have formed very rapidly in ` monolithic ' collapses .    a such , massive galaxies are the dominant test - bed for galaxy models , and understanding their evolution observationally is an important goal . \n most massive galaxies at @xmath7 are red and passively evolving , yet star formation and merging activity have been seen in ellipticals from @xmath8 to @xmath1 ( stanford et al . 2004 ; lin et al . 2004 ; teplitz et al . 2006 ; conselice et al . \n 2007a , b ) - thus it is unclear when or how massive galaxies finally assembled . \n we must study this process at high redshift since the ages of stars in nearby galaxies can not reveal their entire formation history , as the assembly of mass is likely decoupled from the formation of stars ( e.g. , conselice 2006b ; trujillo et al . \n 2007 ) . \n observational evidence suggests that passively evolving massive galaxies exist at @xmath1 , and likely at even early times , at @xmath9 ( daddi et al . \n 2004 ; saracco et al . 2005 \n ; bundy et al . 2006 ; conselice et al . \n recent claims also exist for the establishment of the full massive galaxy population by @xmath1 ( e.g. , drory et al . 2005 ; bundy et al . \n however , what is not yet clear is if number densities measured in these surveys are able to rule out evolution at @xmath7 after considering uncertainties in measuring stellar masses , number densities , and cosmic variance .    on the other hand , at @xmath10 \n it appears that there are significantly fewer massive galaxies than at @xmath3 ( e.g. , drory et al . 2005 ) . \n observationally , the most massive galaxies at @xmath10 are undergoing major mergers , which are able to construct the stellar masses of massive galaxies rapidly ( conselice 2006b ; conselice et al . \n the situation at @xmath3 is not as clear , with observations inconclusive on whether there is evolution in the massive galaxy population at @xmath7 ( e.g. , brown et al . 2006 ) . \n we argue here that by using a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies the number and mass densities of massive galaxies are consistent , within their errors , with no evolution at @xmath3 , yet there is observable evolution when examining in detail the physical processes occurring within these galaxies . up to 50% of galaxies with m@xmath0 \n are undergoing star formation at @xmath1 , and roughly one major merger occurs within these systems at @xmath11 . \n we assume throughout a standard cosmology of h@xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , and @xmath14 . \n the most basic method for calculating the evolution of galaxies is measuring how their number densities and integrated stellar mass densities change as a function of time . \n recent work on measuring densities suggests that within the measurement uncertainties galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath0 , are largely in place at @xmath1 ( bundy et al . \n 2005 , 2006 ) . \n figure  1 shows the most up to date version of how the number and mass densities of galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath15 and @xmath16  @xmath17  m@xmath18 evolve out to @xmath19 , as seen in the 1.5 deg@xmath20 palomar observatory wide - field infrared survey ( powir ; conselice et al . 2007a ; conselice et al . \n 2008b ) covering the deep2 fields \n ( davis et al . 2007 ) from conselice et al . ( 2007b ) using a chabrier imf . \n the number density evolution of these massive galaxies shows that statistically there is very little to no evolution at @xmath7 for the m@xmath0 systems . \n this appears to support the idea that nearly all massive galaxies are present by @xmath1 ( e.g. , bundy et al . \n 2006 ) . \n however , as can be seen within the observational errors of figure  1 , there is potentially evolution in number densities for m@xmath0 selected galaxies between @xmath21 . \n galaxies with m@xmath0 show an increase in number densities between @xmath22 to 0.4 of a factor of 2.7@xmath23 . \n this is however significant only at the @xmath24 level , considering all uncertainties ( conselice et al . \n a similar result is found for the mass densities of galaxies with m@xmath0 , and it is impossible to rule out that massive galaxies with m@xmath0 are all in place at @xmath25 ( conselice et al . \n however , as for the star - formation downsizing described in e.g. , bundy et al . \n ( 2006 ) there is also a stellar mass downsizing , such that lower mass galaxies are formed after higher mass ones . \n the number densities of systems with @xmath16 @xmath17 m@xmath26 increases by a factor of 2.2@xmath27 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , a result significant at @xmath30 4  @xmath31 . just as for the most massive systems , this evolution occurs completely at @xmath32 ( conselice et al . \n 2007b ) . taken as a whole \n , we calculate that the scenario whereby the stellar mass and number densities of massive galaxies does not evolve between @xmath33 to @xmath34 can be rejected at @xmath35 @xmath31 confidence . through a careful analysis of number densities \n it does not appear that high mass galaxy formation , with the possible exception of m@xmath0 systems , is complete by @xmath33 . \n there could be a factor of @xmath36 evolution in the mass and number densities for massive galaxies at @xmath7 due to measurement uncertainties . \n we note that the millennium simulation underpredicts the densities of these massive galaxies by a large factor ( figure  1 ) , demonstrating how difficult it is to model these systems . \n one way to understand the star formation history of massive galaxies is to examine their position on color - magnitude diagrams . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find that 35@xmath44% of galaxies with m@xmath0 at @xmath1 are blue in color and not on the red sequence , and thus must be undergoing unobscured star formation . \n previous studies have examined the increase in the amount of stellar mass on the red - sequence , finding as much as a factor of two increase since @xmath1 ( faber et al . \n 2007 ; brown et al . 2007 ) \n . however , this increase is due to galaxies appearing on the red - sequence , which were previously blue , and not due to in - situ growth on the red - sequence itself due to e.g. , dry mergers . \n this can be seen through massive galaxies gradually moving onto the red - sequence with time , as the number of blue massive galaxies declines at @xmath7 ( e.g. , bundy et al . \n 2006 ; conselice et al . \n 2007b ) .    quantifying the ongoing rate of star formation in massive galaxy samples can be done in several ways , including rest - frame uv emission , emission line fluxes , and spitzer mips 24@xmath37 m data \n . a surprisingly higher fraction of massive galaxies are detected in the mid - infrared compared with the fraction which are blue . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find that @xmath3840% of the m@xmath0 systems at @xmath39 are detected in 24@xmath37 m mips data after removing those systems which are detected by chandra . \n a total of 37@xmath40% of the systems at m@xmath0 are detected at 24 @xmath37 m , with an average star formation rate of 70 yr@xmath13 . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find , similar to previous studies utilising ir star formation indicators , a decline with redshift in star formation occurring within the massive galaxy population . for systems with m@xmath0 the star formation rate declines as @xmath41 , and for systems with @xmath17 m@xmath42 @xmath17 as @xmath43 . \n the overall decline in the entire galaxy population s star formation history can be parameterised as @xmath44 . \n it appears that while the @xmath17 m@xmath42 @xmath17 galaxies have a similar decline as the overall field , the highest mass galaxies decline at a faster rate . \n the number and mass densities of the most massive galaxies are significantly lower at @xmath9 than at lower redshifts . while the star formation rate in these massive galaxies may be low ( e.g. , krick et al . \n 2006 ) , mergers are likely the major method for forming these galaxies . examining the structural cas and other parameters ( conselice et al . \n 2000,2002 ; conselice 2003 ; ravindranath et al . \n 2006 ) for galaxies at @xmath45 reveals that mergers produce the rapid growth in massive galaxies at @xmath46 ( conselice et al . \n 2003 , 2005 ; conselice 2006b ; conselice et al . \n 2008a ) . \n what is not yet clear is the role mergers play in massive galaxy formation at @xmath3 , particularly dry mergers that are not easily identifiable through structure . \n one method of measuring the amount of merging is by examining changes in the number and mass densities of galaxies as a function of time after accounting for growth due to star formation ( figure  2 ; conselice et al . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find that 12% of galaxies with  @xmath17  m@xmath47  merge between @xmath48 , and enter the higher mass bin . at @xmath49 \n this merger fraction drops to 8% . \n this is consistent with the cas merger fractions ( e.g. , conselice et al . \n 2003 ) for the same galaxies , and previous published results using smaller galaxy samples ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2003 \n ; lin et al . 2004 ; bridge et al . 2007 ) . \n this corresponds to a merger rate giving n@xmath50 mergers for m@xmath0 systems at @xmath39 , roughly doubling the mass of these galaxies during this time . \n while massive galaxies can be identified up to @xmath51 using deep nir imaging , the evolution of these galaxies is difficult to measure within a factor of 2 - 3 using simply luminosity or mass functions . by examining the change in the mass function , and through structural parameters and mips 24 @xmath37 m and [ oii ] line emission \n we show that massive galaxies are still undergoing some evolution , with at least as much as a factor of two increase in stellar mass at @xmath11 from star formation and merging . \n bridge , c. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 659 , 931 brown , m.j.i . , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 654 , 858 bundy , k. , et al . 2006 , apj , 651 , 120 cole , s. , lacey , c. baugh , c. , frenk , c. 2000 , mnras , 319 , 168 conselice , c.j . , bershady , m.a . , \n jangren , a. 2000 , apj , 529 , 886 conselice , c.j . \n 2003 , apjs , 147 , 1 conselice , c.j . , \n bershady , m.a . , \n dickinson , m. , papovich , c. 2003a , aj , 126 , 1183 conselice , c.j . , \n gallagher , j.s . , \n wyse , r.f.g . \n 2002 , aj , 123 , 2246 conselice , c.j . \n , blackburne , j. , papovich , c. 2005 , apj , 620 , 564 conselice , c.j . \n 2006a , mnras , 373 , 1389 conselice , c.j . \n 2006b , apj , 638 , 686 conselice , c.j . , et al . 2007a , apj , 660 , 55l conselice , c.j . , \n 2007b , mnras , 381 , 962 conselice , c.j . , \n et al . 2008a , mnras , 386 , 909 conselice , c.j . \n . 2008b , mnras , 383 , 1366 davis , m. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 660 , 1l drory , n. , et al . \n 2005 , apj , 619 , l131 faber , s. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 665 , 265 krick , m. , et al . \n 2006 , apj , 649 , l71 lin , l. , et al . \n 2004 , apj , 617 , 9l patton , d.r . , \n 2002 , apj , 565 , 208 ravindranath , s. , et al . \n 2006 , apj , 652 , 963 stanford , s.a . , et al . \n 2004 , aj , 127 , 131 teplitz , h.i . \n 2006 , aj , 132 , 853 trujillo , i. , et al . \n 2007 , mnras , 382 , 109", "StartTimeOffset": 1363497314304, "RequestID": "bc86df7e213c6236101e996c10f92cbd6aa88f03", "TotalTokens": 3361}

like behaviour with an equation of state @xmath47 . inflation driven by heat flux was demonstrated by maartens _ \n et al_@xcite in which they showed that the heat flux serves to ` balance ' the decrease in energy density while the pressure of the cosmic fluid steadily decreases . \n in order to determine the deviation of the cosmic fluid from hydrostatic equilibrium we calculate the covariant dimensionless ratio @xmath48 -

cattaneo form given by@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 projects into the comoving rest space , @xmath58 is the local equilibrium temperature , @xmath53 ( @xmath59 ) is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is the relaxational time - scale which gives rise to the causal and stable behaviour of the theory . \n the noncausal fourier heat transport equation is obtained by setting @xmath62 in ( [ causalgen ] ) . for the metric ( [ a1 ] ) , equation ( [ causalgen ] ) becomes @xmath63where @xmath64 represents the temperature gradient . note that on setting @xmath62 , we regain the eckart heat transport equation @xmath65 which was utilised by singh and beesham to obtain noncausal temperature profiles . \n following triginer and pavon@xcite , we assume the thermal conductivity is that for a radiation fluid interacting with matter @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant and @xmath68 is the mean collision time . the mean collision time is related to the particle number density @xmath69 via @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an arbitrary constant . \n the particle conservation equation @xmath72 which yields @xmath73 . \n we can finally write @xmath74 where @xmath71 is another constant . since @xmath75 is the only natural time scale of the cosmological fluid , we define the relaxation time as follows @xmath76 where @xmath77 can be viewed as a causality switch. by setting @xmath78 we regain the noncausal eckart transport equation . the mean collision time is related to the relaxation time via ( [ col1 ] ) , ( [ col2 ] ) and ( [ col3 ] ) \n . we can write @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant . \n utilising ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) in ( [ col3 ] ) we obtain @xmath81 which corresponds to constant relaxation time . from ( [ col4 ] ) , we can immediately write @xmath82 . we can conclude that the assumption made in ( [ col3 ] ) holds to good approximation in the early evolution of the cosmological fluid when temperatures are sufficiently high @xcite . \n the causal heat transport equation ( [ causal ] ) becomes @xmath83 which easily integrates to    @xmath84x   + { \\cal { f}}(t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath85\\ ] ] the above equation is readily solved to give us the noncausal temperature profiles for the two cases that we have investigated thus far . \n for @xmath30 which corresponds to the case of constant deceleration parameter @xmath86 yields @xmath87x+{\\cal { f}}_2(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is a function of integration . note that ( [ temptemp ] ) does not guarantee @xmath89 . \n requiring @xmath89 on physical grounds will constrain the free parameters appearing in ( [ temptemp ] ) . \n the noncausal temperature is obtained by setting @xmath78 in ( [ temptemp ] ) . \n this would imply ( from ( [ col3 ] ) ) that thermal equilibrium is achieved instantaneously which is one of the pathologies of the eckart theory . \n it has been pointed out that entropy of the universe behaves like a an ordinary system and tends to a maximum value of the order of @xmath90 as @xmath91 @xcite . \n the rate of entropy production is given by @xmath92}{3c^3l } - 8lt]}{c^8\\sqrt{-24\\frac{c^4k_1x\\exp[-4lt](1 + ( -2 + k_1\\exp[-3lt]/c^3)\\beta)}{c_0 } } + { \\cal f}_2(t)},\\ ] ] which vanishes as @xmath93 for an appropriate choice of @xmath94 . \n let us consider the temperature profile for the case @xmath42 . \n figures 1 and 2 show the evolution of the causal and noncausal temperature profiles respectively . in order to generate these plots we chose the following parameters : @xmath95 . \n figure 1 corresponds to the case @xmath96 giving the noncausal temperature . \n figure 2 corresponds to the case @xmath97 representing the causal temperature profile . \n it is evident that the causal temperature is everywhere greater than its noncausal counterpart . in the infinite past \n both the causal and noncausal temperatures are at a maximum and decrease as the fluid evolves with time . \n the drop - off in the temperature is greater in the causal case than the noncausal case indicating that cooling is enhanced by relaxational effects . \n we have successfully obtained the causal temperature profile for an lrs bianchi type - v cosmological fluid with constant deceleration parameter . \n our results generalise the thermodynamical results obtained by singh and beesham @xcite . \n our investigation show that relaxational effects within the cosmic fluid leads to a higher temperature . \n we also found that the rate of entropy production decreases as the universe evolves in time , tending to zero for late times . \n it would be interesting to investigate the evolution of the temperature profile for the lrs bianchi type - v universe with dissipation by employing a full causal heat transport equation . \n work in this direction has been initiated . \n the authors are thankful to the comments and suggestions made by the anonymous referee which helped clarify some of the results of this paper . \n r. maartens , _ phil . \n _ a * 369 * , 5115 ( 2011 ) . \n p. dunsby , n. goheer , b. osano and j -

[ \n fig : scal_smooth_rough ] . \n we define the ti averaged over the pipe area as :    @xmath15    for @xmath16 , the smooth and rough pipe values are almost the same . however , when @xmath7 increases , the ti of the rough pipe increases compared to the smooth pipe . \n we have not made fits to the rough wall pipe measurements because of the limited number of datapoints . \n the fits shown in fig . [ fig : scal_smooth_rough ] are :    @xmath17    the blasius smooth pipe ( darcy ) friction factor @xcite is also expressed as an @xmath7 power - law :    @xmath18    the blasius friction factor matches measurements best for @xmath19 ; the friction factor by e.g. gersten ( eq . ( 1.77 ) in @xcite ) is preferable for larger @xmath7 . \n the blasius and gersten friction factors are compared in fig . \n [ fig : fric_fac ] . \n the deviation between the smooth and rough pipe gersten friction factors above @xmath20 is qualitatively similar to the deviation between the smooth and rough pipe area ti in fig . \n [ fig : scal_smooth_rough ] . for the gersten friction factors \n , we have used the measured pipe roughnesses .        for the smooth pipe \n , we can combine eqs . \n ( [ eq : ti_scal ] ) and ( [ eq : blasius_scal ] ) to relate the pipe area ti to the blasius friction factor :    @xmath21    the ti and blasius friction factor scaling is shown in fig . \n [ fig : new_ti_fric ] .        for axisymmetric flow in the streamwise direction , \n the mean flow velocity averaged over the pipe area is :    @xmath22    now we are in a position to define an average velocity of the turbulent fluctuations :    @xmath23    the friction velocity is :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the wall shear stress and @xmath26 is the fluid density .    the relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : fluc_fric ] . from the fit \n , we have :    @xmath29    which we approximate as :    @xmath30    eqs . \n ( [ eq : rms_fric_fit ] ) and ( [ eq : rms_fric_approx ] ) above correspond to the usage of the friction velocity as a proxy for the velocity of the turbulent fluctuations @xcite .    in @xcite , \n another definition was used for the ti averaged over the pipe area . \n we provide results using that definition in [ app : alt_def_ti ] . \n ( [ eq : avrg_v_rms ] ) and ( [ eq : rms_fric_approx ] ) can be combined with eq . \n ( 1.1 ) in @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the pressure loss , @xmath33 is the pipe length and @xmath34 is the pipe diameter \n . this can be reformulated as :    @xmath35    we show how well this approximation works in fig . [ \n fig : new_comp_fric_ti ] . \n overall , the agreement is within 15% .    ) \n is included for comparison.,width=529 ]    we proceed to define the average kinetic energy of the turbulent velocity fluctuations @xmath36 ( per pipe volume @xmath37 ) as :    @xmath38    with @xmath39 so we have :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the fluid mass . \n the pressure loss corresponds to an increase of the turbulent kinetic energy . \n an overview of turbulent velocity fluctuations can be found in @xcite . \n our quantification of the ratio @xmath42 as a constant can be placed in the context of the attached eddy hypothesis by townsend @xcite @xcite . \n our results are for quantities averaged over the pipe radius whereas the attached eddy hypothesis provides a local scaling with distance from the wall . \n the attached eddy hypothesis has provided the basis for theoretical work on e.g. the streamwise turbulent velocity fluctuations in flat - plate @xcite and pipe flow @xcite boundary layers . \n a scaling between the average kinetic energy of the turbulent velocity fluctuations and the friction velocity squared has been identified in @xcite for @xmath43 . \n this corresponds to our eq . \n ( [ eq : e_kin ] ) .    at this point \n it is interesting to note that a correspondence between the wall - normal reynolds stress and the friction factor has been shown in @xcite . \n those results were found using direct numerical simulations . \n the main difference between the cases is that we use the streamwise reynolds stress . \n however , for an eddy rotating in the streamwise direction , both a wall - normal and a streamwise component should exist which connects the two scaling observations .    other related work can be found beginning with @xcite where the diagnostic plot was introduced . in following publications \n a version of the diagnostic plot was brought forward where the local ti is plotted as a function of the local streamwise velocity normalised by the free stream velocity @xcite . \n ( 3 ) in @xcite corresponds to our @xmath44 , see eq . \n ( [ eq : ti_prof_equation ] ) in [ app : ti_prof_fits ] . \n we have compared ti profiles for smooth- and rough - wall pipe flow measurements made in the princeton superpipe . \n the change of the ti profile from hydraulically smooth to fully rough flow exhibits propagation from the pipe wall to the pipe axis . the tir at @xmath45 scales linearly with @xmath7 . \n the scaling of ti with @xmath7 - on the pipe axis and averaged over the pipe area - shows that the smooth- and rough - wall level deviates with increasing reynolds number . \n we find that @xmath46 . \n this relationship can be useful to calculate the ti given a known @xmath47 , both for smooth and rough pipes . \n it follows that given a pressure loss in a pipe , the turbulent kinetic energy increase can be estimated . \n we thank professor a.j.smits for making the superpipe data publicly available @xcite . \n as we have done for the smooth pipe measurements in @xcite , we can also fit the rough pipe measurements to this function :    @xmath48 + \\left [ \\delta \\times |{\\rm ln}(1-r_n)|^{\\varepsilon } \\right ] , \\end{array } \\label{eq : ti_prof_equation}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fit parameters . \n a comparison of fit parameters found for the smooth- and rough - pipe measurements is shown in fig . \n [ fig : smooth_rough_fits ] . overall \n , we can state that the fit parameters for the smooth and rough pipes are in a similar range for @xmath54 . \n the min / max deviation of the rough pipe fit from the measurements is below 10% ; see the comparison to the smooth wall fit min / max deviation in fig . \n [ fig : smooth_rough_deviations ] \n .         the core and wall fits for the smooth and rough pipe fits are compared in fig . \n [ fig : core_wall_fits ] . both the core and wall ti increase for the largest @xmath7 . \n the position where the core and wall ti levels are equal is shown in fig . \n [ fig : equal_ti_core_wall ] . \n this position does not change significantly for the rough pipe ; however , the position does increase with @xmath7 for the smooth pipe : this indicates that the wall term becomes less important relative to the core term . \n in the main paper , we have defined the ti over the pipe area in eq . \n ( [ eq : ti_area_ad ] ) . in @xcite \n , we used the arithmetic mean ( am ) instead :    @xmath55    the am leads to a somewhat different pipe area scaling for the smooth pipe measurements which is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : scal_smooth_rough_ad ] . compare to fig . \n [ fig : scal_smooth_rough ] . \n the scaling found in @xcite using this definition is :    @xmath56    the am scaling also has implications for the relationship with the blasius friction factor scaling ( eq . \n ( [ eq : blasius_ti_rel ] ) ) :    @xmath57    we can now define the am version of the average velocity of the turbulent fluctuations :    @xmath58    the am definition can be considered as a first order moment equation for @xmath3 , whereas the definition in eq . \n ( [ eq : avrg_v_rms ] ) is a second order moment equation . \n again , we find that the am average turbulent velocity fluctuations are proportional to the friction velocity . however , the constant of proportionality is different than the one in eq . \n ( [ eq : rms_fric_fit ] ) , see fig . \n [ fig : fluc_fric_ad ] . the am case can be fitted as : \n @xmath59    which we approximate as :    @xmath60    to conclude , we can state that :    @xmath61 \n 00    hultmark m , vallikivi m , bailey scc , smits aj . \n turbulent pipe flow at extreme reynolds numbers . \n phys rev lett 2012;108:094501 . \n hultmark m , vallikivi m , bailey scc , smits aj . \n logarithmic scaling of turbulence in smooth- and rough - wall pipe flow . \n j fluid mech 2013;728:376 - 395 . \n princeton superpipe ;

factor of eq . \n compared with a cosine - factor in ref . \n @xcite . a calculation with the @xmath2-type basis functions alone \n would , because of this sine - factor , predict suppressed ionization of n@xmath0 compared with the companion ar atom  in contrast to experimental and theoretical findings  @xcite . \n thus having pointed out the importance of working with properly symmetrized basis function , we now confront the _ ad hoc _ single lcao approch  @xcite with our hf calculations . clearly , but contrary to the approach in ref . \n @xcite , one can not expect the basis functions themselves to be eigenfunctions , instead the eigenfunctions are linear combinations of basis functions . \n in ref .  @xcite we used the gamess  @xcite program for our quantitative hf calculations of n@xmath0 with a @xmath31 $ ] cartesian gaussian basis  @xcite . the way we specify \n our basis is standard in the quantum chemistry literature  @xcite , but is recalled here for completeness . \n the wave function is expanded in 11 @xmath27 and 6 @xmath2 orbitals centered on each atom . \n these basis orbitals all have different exponentials in the radial parts . \n the orbitals of our hf calculation are obtained by a variation of the expansion coefficients until the energy is minimized . \n this procedure is equivalent to an iterative diagonalization of matrix representations of the fock operator . with little loss of accuracy but significant gain in computational speed , \n the optimization procedure can be simplified with a contracted basis set . \n this means that all the expansion coefficients are not varied independently , contrary a fixed relationship is kept between some of the coefficients . \n such a simplification is used in most quantum chemistry software . \n five coefficients corresponding to @xmath27 orbitals and three coefficients corresponding to the @xmath2 orbitals are optimized independently . in order to describe the asymptotic behavior we augment the basis by adding an extra diffuse @xmath27 and @xmath2 orbital . in total , the wave function is effectively expanded in a basis of six @xmath27 and four @xmath2 orbitals on each atom denoted by @xmath26 $ ] basis .    in fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ] we show results of our calculations for the @xmath1 homo of n@xmath0 [ fig .  [ \n fig : n2homo ]  ( c ) ] and in its decomposition of @xmath27 [ fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( a ) ] and @xmath2 [ fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( b ) ] type basis functions . \n we see that the orbital is composed of both types of basis functions . at first sight \n the @xmath2 contribution alone seems to resemble the orbital quite well . \n however , in the proximity of the nuclei , it is the @xmath27 contribution that dominates , since the @xmath2 functions have nodes on the nuclei . \n it is the @xmath27 type contribution that dominates the momentum space wave function at low momenta . \n this fact becomes clear in figs . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( d)-(f ) , where we show the fourier transforms of the functions in figs . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( a)-(c ) . \n it is clear that both the @xmath27 and @xmath2 type of basis functions contribute significantly to the momentum wave function . \n therefore , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : mo ] , it is insufficient to consider each type exclusively : the @xmath27 and @xmath32 basis orbitals are not separately eigenfunctions of the fock operator , contrary , the mixture turns out to be essential . at this point \n the authors of ref .  @xcite introduce an oversimplification by considering the homo to be constructed only from a single linear combination of two @xmath2-orbitals . \n in the mo - sfa one calculates the transition rate from the homo to a continuum volkov state through absorption of @xmath33 photons . for a linearly polarized , monochromatic field of frequency @xmath34 and field strength @xmath35 , \n the velocity gauge result for the angular differential ionization rate in atomic units is  @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 the number of electrons occupying the homo , @xmath38 the momentum , @xmath39 the ponderomotive energy , @xmath40 the ionization potential of the homo ( @xmath41 in the case of n@xmath0  @xcite ) , @xmath42 the momentum space wave function and @xmath43 a generalized bessel function  @xcite .    according to the discussion in sec . \n [ sec : hf ] , it is important to apply the correct momentum space wave function in the evaluation of eq .  . \n to illustrate this fact , we consider the total ionization rate integrated over all angles of the outgoing electron and summed over all numbers of accessible photon absorptions . \n we present this total ionization rate for different angles @xmath44 between the internuclear axis and the polarization axis for the homo @xmath1 orbital of n@xmath0 . \n we consider three descriptions of the molecular orbital : ( i ) using @xmath27-type basis functions only , ( ii ) using @xmath2-type basis functions only and ( iii ) using the self - consistent hf solution . \n clearly the approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) only give a very poor description of the homo and therefore these results deviate from the result obtained by using the true homo .     of the homo of n@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) as a function of the angle @xmath44 between the internuclear axis and the polarization axis at ( a ) 800  nm  @xcite and ( b ) 795  nm  @xcite . \n the short - dashed and solid curve are the calculations with the hf wave function derived from a grid calculation and with the @xmath26 $ ] basis set in fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( f ) , respectively . \n the long - dashed curve with a maximum and the chained curve are obtained with the @xmath27 [ fig . \n [ fig : n2homo](d ) ] and @xmath2 [ fig . \n [ fig : n2homo](e ) ] contributions only , respectively . all rates are normalized to parallel @xmath45 geometry . ]    in fig . \n [ fig : ratetheta ] we present the results for the three cases at ( a ) 800  nm  @xcite and ( b ) 795  nm  @xcite . additionally , we show in fig .  [ \n fig : ratetheta ] the results obtained with an initial homo derived from a grid - based hf calculation  @xcite . \n the excellent agreement with the @xmath26 $ ] basis - state calculation proves the convergence of the latter approach . \n we note that panels ( a ) and ( b ) are very similar and hence the differences between the results in  @xcite and  @xcite are not due to the slight difference in wavelength .    from fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( d ) we see that the momentum wave function in case ( i ) is nearly spherically symmetric , and hence , in fig . \n [ fig : ratetheta ] the ionization rate in this case is nearly independent of the molecular orientation . in case ( ii ) \n we use the momentum function from fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( e ) . \n although exceptions occur , as evident from fig . \n [ fig : bessel](a ) below , the generalized bessel functions are typically maximized when @xmath46 is nearly parallel to the polarization direction [ fig . \n [ fig : bessel](b ) ] . in a qualitative analysis \n , one may therefore expect that the maximum rate is obtained , when the polarization axis coincides with a direction where @xmath47 is large . \n correspondingly , in case ( ii ) we see from fig . \n [ fig : ratetheta ] that the rate is maximized when @xmath48 , i.e. when the polarization is horizontal in fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( e ) and overlaps with a large value of the momentum wave function . finally , we turn to the full wave function in case ( iii ) which is the coherent sum of @xmath27 and @xmath2 contributions , fig . \n [ fig : n2homo ]  ( f ) . \n it is the low momenta that contribute mostly to the total rate . at these small momenta , we see from fig .  [ \n fig : n2homo ]  ( f ) that the absolute square of the momentum wave function is maximized along the direction perpendicular to the molecular axis and therefore the rate is maximized with the molecule aligned perpendicularly to the laser polarization , @xmath49 . \n this result is also shown in fig .  [ fig : ratetheta ] verifying the result of ref .  @xcite . \n note that the rate using the total wave function is not the sum of rates of the @xmath27 and @xmath2 contributions since their contributions to the wave function should be added coherently and with the correct self - consistent amplitudes before entering @xmath42 in eq .  . \n we note that the admixture of atomic s and p orbitals for the description of the homo of n@xmath0 was also recently pointed out in related work on high - harmonic generation  @xcite .    in refs . \n @xcite , the values of the generalized bessel function in eq . \n do also not agree . \n figure  [ fig : bessel](a ) shows our previous result for the square of the generalized bessel function corresponding to 18 photon absorption at 800  nm and at an intensity of @xmath50 w/@xmath51 . \n panel  ( b ) shows the corresponding result at 795  nm  @xcite . \n hence , panel  ( b ) corresponds to fig . \n 2(a ) of ref . \n @xcite ( since @xmath52  @xcite ) and by comparison we see that the results agree \n . we may therefore attribute the difference between the generalized bessel functions in @xcite and @xcite to stem from the difference in the wavelengths used . \n it is clear from fig . \n [ fig : bessel ] that the values of the generalized bessel function are very sensitive to the exact value of the arguments \n .     squared for @xmath50 w/@xmath51 , and ( a ) 800  nm  @xcite , ( b ) 795  nm  @xcite . \n the polar angle @xmath53 is measured from the horizontal line . ] \n we reproduce the values for the generalized bessel function given in ref . \n @xcite with the input parameters used therein , and we therefore believe that our previous and present calculations of the generalized bessel function are correct . due to the excellent agreement at 795  nm with the bessel functions of ref . \n @xcite we likewise believe that the latter are evaluated correctly . \n in conclusion , the velocity gauge mo - sfa when based on a transition to the continuum from an initial homo , determined by a hf calculation using standard quantum chemistry software , gives the wrong prediction for the orientation - dependent rate . in this approximation only the length gauge mo - sfa ( and the molecular tunneling theory )  @xcite give the observed minimum  @xcite in the rate for the perpendicular geometry . \n this conclusion contrasts the findings in a recent work  @xcite . in that work , however , only a single lcao of two @xmath2-orbitals ( of wrong symmetry ) was considered for the description of the homo and no self - consistent wave function was applied . from fig . \n [ fig : ratetheta ] we clearly see , that an application of a too simple wave function , e.g. , one with only @xmath2 basis functions , leads to a prediction accidentally in qualitative agreement with experiment  @xcite . if one nevertheless would be encouraged by this agreement to believe that the single lcao of @xmath2 orbitals describes the physics well , one should note that such a wave function due to the presence of the sine - factor in   would predict suppressed ionization in n@xmath0 compared with ar which is in contrast with experiments and theory  @xcite . in closing \n we note that also in the atomic case , the length gauge version of the sfa was recently shown to be superior to the velocity gauge version when compared with results obtained by integrating the time - dependent schrdinger equation  @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1390697859498, "RequestID": "c1b5ef40dbe3b6263127980683b24eaf75cf0d01", "TotalTokens": 4214}

order terms . \n it makes the standard feynman diagram technique practically unreliable in the case . on the other side , \n the nonlinear character of the problem involved in realistic situations can not be ignored simply . a naive solution of this difficulty may be to assume that under certain conditions , the coupled atom - radiation field system can be approximated by a system composed of a harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to the radiation field through some effective coupling constants . \n thus , a significant number of works have been sparked to the study of cavity qed . \n another motivation to study the radiation field system in cavity comes from the cosmology . \n astronomical observations@xcite-@xcite have provided plenty of supports to the cosmological principle@xcite , which states that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on large scales . \n this principle implies that we can build up a comoving coordinate system , in which the spatial part has a maximal symmetry . in general \n , there are three types of global symmetry for the three - dimensional maximally symmetric space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \n usually , they are called the flat , closed and open universe , respectively . in order to understand the evolution of the universe , the whole distribution and activity of matters ( including radiations ) in space have to be taken into account . and we would like to point out that , if properties of matters in space as a whole are to be studied , the difference of global symmetries should not be neglected . in particular , we know that the early epoch of the universe was governed by the radiation fields \n . therefore , a careful study of radiation fields in a compact space is necessary .    in free space , \n it is well - known that the radiation fields can be described by an ideal gas model ( a thermodynamic system consisting of free massless particles ) . \n however , one can not extend this idea to the case of compact space straightforwardly . in order to investigate the quantum statistical properties of radiation fields in a compact space , we begin with constructing of the representation of one - particle states . \n we notice that the space - time @xmath4 is a conformally deformed de sitter space - time . \n this space - time has a translation symmetry in the time direction and six rotation symmetries in the spatial part . \n that is to say , the isometry group of the space -

body radiation system in free space , which is proportional to the square of energy ( @xmath48 ) . \n the photons obey the bose - einstein statistics . \n the mean number of photons on an eigen - state with energy @xmath41 \n is@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the temperature of this system to be zero and hence @xmath51 . ] . \n immediately , we obtain a modified planck distribution for the radiation fields in the compact space @xmath6 , @xmath52 the distribution function represents the amount of radiation energy in the spectral interval @xmath53 and a unit volume . in picture * 1 * , we give a sketch for this modified planck distribution comparing with the ordinary one in free space . \n [ pic ]     ( real line , @xmath54 ) and the ordinary distribution of a black - body radiation system in free space ( dashed line).,width=377,height=264 ]    the total number of photons of the radiation system can be expressed as @xmath55 when the parameter @xmath56 runs to infinity , we recover the familiar result of the black - body radiation system in free space . in the follows \n , we will calculate quantities by expanding them in terms of @xmath57 to see clearly the deviation from those got in free space . \n the thermodynamic quantity of total energy is @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the riemann zeta - function . \n the free energy and thermodynamic potential can also be calculated easily , @xmath61 we know that the volume of the three - dimensional sphere with radius @xmath8 is @xmath62 . \n hence the radiation pressure is @xmath63 furthermore , by making use of the relations among thermodynamic quantities @xmath64 we can obtain the entropy of radiation fields @xmath65    in an adiabatic process experienced by the radiation fields , the entropy does nt change . \n so the product @xmath56 can be viewed as a constant in the process . \n the total number of photons is also kept invariant in the adiabatic process . but the other thermodynamic quantities will vary with the geometrical parameter @xmath8 as follows , @xmath66 to discuss the equation of state of this radiation system , we now calculate the density of thermal energy , @xmath67 the equation of state of the radiation fields in the compact space can be read out from eqs . \n ( [ total - pressure ] ) and ( [ density - energy ] ) , @xmath68 it is obvious that , in the case of a large radius of the compact space , the ordinary equation of state for the radiation fields in free space can be recovered . \n a good understanding of the resonant effect and spontaneous emission rate difference in cavity requires first to know the full space dependence of the cavity - induced damping and level shifts . \n however , we know that it is a really difficult mathematical task . thus , many useful approximation methods have been developed . as a first step on the way of getting an exact solution of the problem , we suggested working on a compact space of finite size instead of a cavity . by making use of the representation theory of the @xmath5 group \n , we studied the kinematics for a free photon propagating in the space - time @xmath69 . \n the explicit geometrical parameter dependence of statistical properties of the radiation fields was presented . \n results showed remarkable differences from that of the black - body radiation in free space . \n the resonant effects associated to the coupling of atoms with strong radiofrequency field as well as the spontaneous emission rate can also be computed in a straightforward way . \n it is expected that the nonlinear character of the coupled atom - radiation field may be attributed to the geometrical parameters of the compact space . \n these results will be published in a forthcoming paper . \n in fact , the statistical properties of radiation fields in a compact space are crucial to the evolution of the early universe . in the early universe , \n radiation field is the dominant matter \n . a bit difference of statistical properties of the radiation system can generate observable effects on our present cosmology . \n all of these studies are in progressing . \n * acknowledgement : * + one of us ( c.b.g ) would like to thank dr . \n yu -

related spatial oscillations sometimes observed when a flare occurs , to determine the magnetic field . \n they assume that the oscillation is due to a global standing kink wave , and hence the magnetic field is related to the period of the oscillation , the density of the loop , and the length of the loop . in the case of @xcite \n they found the magnetic field to be 13@xmath29 g . \n the errors on this are large due to errors on the determination of density , loop length and period . \n @xcite suggest that the oscillations are due to a sudden displacement of the magnetic field at the surface which causes an oscillatory relaxation of the field . \n recent work by @xcite suggests that the oscillations are second standing harmonics of acoustic waves tied to the loop length . \n the model gives a relationship between the oscillation period , the loop length and the average plasma temperature , all of which can be independently observed on the sun . \n waves are observed across the electromagnetic spectrum on the sun . \n however , observations on other stars are rare . \n one reason for this is that on the sun , we have the spatial resolution to zoom in on small regions . \n for example , the transverse trace loops that have been observed are away from the main flare site , and hence have lower emission measure . \n analysing an x - ray light - curve , for example , would be unlikely to provide evidence of waves if the emission was averaged over the whole sun . \n oscillations have been observed for optical stellar flares ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . \n @xcite found a period of 220  s in the decay phase of a white - light flare on the rs cvn binary . using this they determine a magnetic field of 1200  g. @xcite again found oscillations in x - ray active red dwarfs . \n they compared their observations to the possibility that they were observing p - modes . on the sun p - \n modes give rise to 5-minute oscillations on the surface . \n they concluded that p - modes could not produce the amplitudes they observed and that it must be coronal oscillations , which have , until now , not been observed .    in this work \n we observe for the first time an oscillation in the corona of . \n we measure the periodicity , and hence determine the magnetic field . \n this is the first observation of an x - ray oscillation during a stellar flare . \n ( ) is an m - type binary dwarf , with both stars of the same spectral type ( dm4.5e+dm4.5e ) . \n both components of the binary flare frequently . \n the radius of given by @xcite is @xmath3 , using a stellar distance of 8.14  pc ( @xcite ) . correcting for the newer value for the distance from hipparcos ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) , using that the stellar radius is proportional to the stellar distance for a given luminosity and spectral class , \n we obtain a stellar radius of @xmath5 . \n the mass of given by @xcite is @xmath6 . \n for our analysis we used the _ xmm - newton _ observations of on 16 october 2000 during revolution 156 . \n @xcite have analysed this data spectroscopically , obtaining elemental abundances , temperatures , densities and emission measures , while a comparative flare analysis between x - ray and simultaneously observed ultraviolet emissions can be found in @xcite . here , we solely used the 0.212  kev x - ray data from the pn - european photon imaging camera ( epic - pn ) . \n figure [ figure ] shows the light curve . \n the observation started at 00:42:00 and lasted for 25.1  ks ( @xmath7 7  h ) . \n there is one large flare , starting @xmath7 4  h into the observation , increasing the count - rate from flare onset to flare peak by a factor of 1.7 , and lasting for 1  h  25  min . \n it shows a steep rise ( rise time @xmath8 ) and decay ( decay time @xmath9 ) . \n there is an extended peak to this flare , which shows clear oscillatory behaviour . \n the amplitude of the oscillation is around 16% . \n applying multi - temperature fitting , @xcite obtain a mean flare temperature @xmath10 and a quiescent temperature @xmath11 , and from the line ratio a flare and quiescent electron density of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . \n the total flare and quiescent emission measures are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . \n one of the reasons why we concentrated on this observation is that following the rise phase of the flare there was a period of approximately 40 minutes when the light curve stayed at a high intensity level and showed strong oscillations . \n the oscillatory activity can be clearly seen by eye ( see fig .  [ figure ] ) , and shows behaviour suggestive of damping . \n this character is much different from solar flares where the flare reaches a peak rapidly , followed by a slow decay . \n for example , @xcite shows solar flare light curves and a flat top is not seen . \n an alternative to oscillations for this flare is that repeated and rapid flaring is occurring . \n we do not consider this option in this paper , and assume for our analysis that we are observing a coronal oscillation . \n the purpose of our analysis is to determine through wavelet analysis the period and amplitude of the oscillation . \n we determine the magnetic field and loop length of the coronal loop assuming that the oscillation is due to an acoustic wave . as a validity \n check the value of loop length was compared to the value determined from a radiative cooling model . \n to investigate periodicities during the observation , we applied a continuous wavelet transformation to the 10s - binned - data , using a morlet wavelet ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the wavelet coefficients with the lowest periods are displayed in fig . \n [ figure ] . \n the flare oscillation is picked up with a 5@xmath16 significance level . \n the local maximum with the shortest period and a significance of more than 5@xmath16 is simultaneous with the flare top and identifies the oscillation , which , at the local maximum , has a period of @xmath17 . \n the period interval where the wavelet coefficients have a significance of 5@xmath16 or more , is [ 730,920 ]  s.      interpreting these oscillations as the second spatial harmonics of an acoustic wave within the flare ( @xcite ) , we can then determine the flare loop length from @xmath18 \\approx \\frac{1}{6.7 } \\cdot p\\ [ { \\rm s } ] \\cdot \\sqrt{t\\    [ { \\rm mk}]}. \\label{ll}\\ ] ] inserting the above obtained period @xmath19 and a flare temperature @xmath20 , we obtain a loop length @xmath21 . \n note that the temperature carries a @xmath22 error of @xmath23 , therefore the error of @xmath24 is at least 8% ( @xmath25 ) . \n it is not straightforward to calculate the corresponding @xmath22 error of @xmath26 . with these numbers , \n the inferred speed of sound is @xmath27 . \n the loop length can also ( and independently of any oscillation ) be estimated from rising and cooling times obtained from the temporal shape of the flare , applying a flare heating / cooling model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we follow the approach by @xcite who investigated a flare on ad leo observed in the extreme ultraviolet . \n the shape of this flare is very similar to our flare on , but roughly 10 times larger ( in duration as well as in the increase of the count rate ) . \n it also shows a flat top with a possible oscillation . \n the flare loop energy equation for the spatial average is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 the volumetric flare heating rate , @xmath30 the optically thin cooling rate and @xmath31 the time rate change of the loop pressure . during the rise phase , \n strong evaporative heating is dominant ( @xmath32 ) , while the decay phase is dominated by radiative cooling and strong condensation ( @xmath33 ) . at the loop top \n , there is an equilibrium ( @xmath34 ) . \n the loop length can be derived as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rise time , @xmath37 the flare decay time ( indicated in fig .  [ figure ] with the vertical dotted lines ) , @xmath38 the apex flare temperature and @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the peak count rate and @xmath41 the count rate at the end of the flare . inserting these values \n , the loop length becomes @xmath42 , which is about a factor of 2 smaller that the loop length inferred from the oscillation . \n interpreting the oscillations in terms of global standing kink waves , @xcite derive a relation for the magnetic field @xmath43 with @xmath44 the mass density inside , and @xmath45 the mass density outside the loop . \n note that there is a correction factor of 0.64 in the equation as presented by @xcite ( @xcite ) . \n we can simplify eq . \n ( [ mag ] ) by inserting eq . \n ( [ ll ] ) and using @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the proton mass . \n then , the magnetic field is given by @xmath49 inserting the temperature and densities from the spectroscopy results , we obtain a magnetic field of @xmath50 . \n note that the large error is resulting mainly from the density uncertainty . using the loop length from the radiative cooling approach ( sect . \n [ radcool ] ) and eq . \n [ mag ] , the magnetic field is @xmath51 .      to maintain stable flare loops \n , the gas pressure of the evaporated plasma must be smaller than the magnetic pressure @xmath52 knowing the flare density and temperature , we get a lower limit for the magnetic field @xmath53 . \n again , there is a large error because of the large uncertainty for the density . \n @xcite assume pressure balance and give equations for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( their eqs  7a , b ) . \n using these relations , we obtain a magnetic field of @xmath56 and a loop length of @xmath57 . \n we have used three different approaches to determine the loop length of the flare and two different approaches for the magnetic field . the loop length derived in sect . \n [ oscill ] from the flare oscillation is the largest with @xmath58 , while the loop length derived from radiative cooling times ( sect . \n [ radcool ] ) is somewhat smaller by roughly a factor of 2 , @xmath42 . \n the loop length derived from pressure balance ( sect . \n [ pressbal ] ) is similar to the latter one , @xmath57 . \n the loop length derived by assuming that the variations seen are due to oscillations is a factor of 2 different to the loop length determined by more usual methods . considering the assumptions that have to be made , \n this is good agreement , and gives us confidence that we are , for the first time , observing a stellar coronal loop oscillating . \n the magnetic field ranges from 50  g ( radiative cooling ) to 115@xmath256  g ( oscillation ) , with the value from pressure balance in between with 70@xmath240  g. again , these three values are all consistent . \n this was the first time that an oscillation during flare peak was observed in x - rays in a stellar flare and flare loop length and magnetic field derived from it . \n the values are consistent with other flare models . \n we acknowledge financial support from the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) . \n umk would also like to thank the european space agency ( esa ) and the university college london ( ucl ) graduate school for financial assistance to attend the cool stars 13 conference .", "StartTimeOffset": 1398837797598, "RequestID": "439d7b370b86af527198399a225e6890576ce195", "TotalTokens": 3082}

( [ sch1 ] ) can be approximated by shifting the solutions in eq.([states ] ) by the factor @xmath64 . \n the resulting single particle current density then takes the form @xmath65 where the current is no longer zero as in the previous case . \n the total current per particle in @xmath20-direction and in the lowest landau level , becomes @xmath66/(4q!)\\approx \\beta\\sqrt{\\alpha_0\\ell}/(4\\sqrt{q})$ ] . \n this also shows that the velocity goes like @xmath67 since the single particle state is centred at @xmath68 , hence the flow is irrotational . on the level of our approximations \n the current does not depend on which landau level is occupied . \n therefore the current depends nontrivially on the particle number which manifests itself as a jump in the derivative with respect to particle number or magnetic field . in fig . \n [ fig : current ] we show the total current , @xmath69/(2(n-1)!)\\approx \\beta\\sqrt{\\alpha_0\\ell n}/2 $ ] , as a function of particle number @xmath51 . \n the physics of the lowest completely filled landau level is in itself an interesting concept and shows some rather intriguing scenarios both from a fundamental and experimental point of view @xcite . \n one of the most important questions concerning the atomic quantum hall state is what to measure ? for a gas described by the completely filled landau level , the density is going to be homogeneous , since the density is effectively built up by shifted gaussians corresponding to the different angular momenta as can be seen in eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) . \n this also means we have added an external potential in order to have @xmath70 . \n this is not necessary but makes the situation simpler and more intuitive . \n consequently , if there is no probe beam carrying orbital angular momentum propagating through the gas , the atoms will be subject to an external harmonic trap and hence will show a density profile quadratic in @xmath61 , clearly different than the filled landau state , see inset in fig . \n ( [ expansion ] ) . from an experimentalist s point of view a direct observation of the density of the cloud in the trap is not necessarily the most convenient way of observing the atoms . \n another possibility is to consider the free expansion of the cloud .     and \n its derivative clearly show the transition between the landau levels at @xmath71.,width=321 ]    since the trapped fermions can be considered noninteracting we can calculate the dynamics of the freely expanding cloud using the single particle propagator , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the rescaled time @xmath74 and @xmath61 is in units of @xmath75 . after a straightforward integration we obtain the dynamics of the freely expanding cloud using the states in eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) , see fig . \n ( [ expansion ] ) . \n the dynamics of the cloud described by the single completely filled landau level is self similar and is captured by the scaling parameter @xmath76 . in fig . \n ( [ expansion ] ) we show the mean width defined as @xmath77 which can readily be calculated using the states in eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) . \n the lowest completely filled landau level is found to expand as @xmath78 @xcite .    clearly \n the expansion of a single completely filled lowest landau level compared to the situation with also the second landau level filled , is not going to be much different , since the expansion is still self similar , apart from contributions from the edge states . \n the density of the trapped cloud is going to be homogeneous and will remain so when expanding . \n this is seen from the energy spectrum in eq . \n ( [ strong ] ) . for an energy corresponding to the second landau level we can have @xmath79 and @xmath80 but also @xmath81 and @xmath82 . \n but this correction is only of the order of a single particle and will not be measurable , hence the expansion dynamics will be the same as the lowest landau level . \n there will , however , be a significant difference if we consider the two extreme situations with a fermi gas described as a completely filled lowest landau level and the situation when the effective magnetic field is weak . \n if the magnetic field is weak the trapped fermi gas is well described by spherical bessel functions corresponding to the eigenfunctions of a cylindrically trapped fermi gas . \n the expansion dynamics can still be calculated with the free particle propagator in eq . \n ( [ prop ] ) . \n the important difference is evident in the expansion which is no longer going to be self similar . \n figure ( [ expansion ] ) shows the mean width of the cloud as function of time compared to the completely filled lowest landau level . \n the broken self - similarity is most clearly seen in a series of snap - shots of the density compared to the density of the completely filled landau level . \n the lowest landau level states expand much faster than states belonging to higher landau levels corresponding to the weak magnetic field case . \n this is easily understood since the lowest landau level states are pure angular momenta states with no radial excitation , whereas the gas with a weak magnetic field contains states with radial excitations but lower angular momenta , hence lower kinetic energy . \n throughout this paper we have considered a two - dimensional trapped fermi gas . \n it is important to remember that a two - dimensional fermi gas poses some rather strict conditions on the external trap configuration . \n the two - dimensionality is preserved if the fermi energy is lower than the relevant transversal groundstate energy . \n the relevant energy scale is here the effective cyclotron frequency which for typical radii of the cloud ( a few tens of microns ) can be of the order of a hundred hz , hence the transversal trap frequency needs to be significantly stronger than this . \n such traps are indeed readily available @xcite . \n the effective magnetic field relies on the stability of the dark state . as discussed in ref . \n @xcite , with typical experimental parameters , the dark state will be stable for times significantly longer than the normal life time for a trapped cloud , making the effective magnetic field created by optical orbital angular momentum a feasible technique for achieving strong magnetic fields . \n clearly from an experimental point of view , the biggest challenge is found in the detection of the mass current in the cloud . \n there are however powerful techniques based on slow light propagation and the dragging of the light @xcite which will identify a mass current in the cloud _ in situ_. another possibility is to measure the shape oscillations which should be affected by the current .    in this paper \n we have investigated the concept of completely filled landau levels in trapped fermi gases . \n the effective magnetic field was created using light with orbital angular momentum . \n the recent advances in creating exotic light beams where both phase and intensity can be manipulated , allows us to consider many different forms of the effective magnetic field . \n we have restricted ourselves to the `` textbook '' scenario with a homogeneous effective magnetic field . \n it is important to note here that this scenario is different from other techniques where filled landau levels are considered . in the case of bosons in a harmonic trap \n , the gas is stirred to create many vortices resulting in an angular momentum which would correspond to the trap groundstate energy . in our case \n the situation is much simpler . \n only a static external trap needs to be added which matches the corresponding cyclotron frequency . \n if the frequency of the added harmonic trap does not match the cyclotron frequency , the important degeneracy will be lifted , but as long as @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the preferably small deviation , the atoms which fill the lowest landau level will not mix with the higher levels . \n this work was supported by the royal society of edinburgh , the alexander von humboldt foundation and the marie -

integral equations for parton distributions @xmath18 change after the mellin transform into simple differential and diagonalised ones in the moment space @xmath19 . \n the only problem is knowledge of the input parametrisation for the whole region @xmath20 what is necessary in the determination of the initial moments of the distribution functions . using truncated moments \n approach one can avoid uncertainties from the unmeasurable @xmath12 region and also obtain important theoretical results incorporating perturbative qcd effects at small @xmath0 , which could be verified experimentally . \n truncated moments of parton distributions in solving dglap equations have been presented in @xcite . \n authors have shown that the evolution equations for truncated moments though not diagonal can be solved with a quite good precision for @xmath3 . \n this is because each @xmath19-th truncated moment couples only with ( @xmath21)-th ( @xmath22 ) truncated moments . in @xcite \n the truncated moments method has been adopted to double logarithmic @xmath23 resummation . \n there is a number of papers in which the most known methods for solving the @xmath8 evolution equations for parton distributions have been reviewed ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) . \n authors compare the dglap framework for the full mellin moments method with brute - force or laguerre - polynomial approaches , used for @xmath0-space version of the evolution equation . in this paper \n we compare the solutions of lo dglap @xmath8 evolution equations written for the truncated mellin moments of the structure functions with those , obtained by using the chebyshev - polynomial method in the @xmath0-space . in both these approaches \n we compute the truncated moments @xmath24 . as a test structure function \n @xmath25 we take two different spin - like nonsinglet parton distributions . \n we perform the computations for a wide range of the truncation point @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the next section we briefly recall an idea of the evolution equation for truncated moments of parton distributions . \n the main topic of our paper i.e. the comparison of the chebyshev - polynomial and truncated moments techniques in solving the lo dglap evolution equation for the nonsinglet structure function is presented in section 3 . \n finally , section 4 contains conclusions . \n for ( full ) mellin moments of parton distributions @xmath27 @xmath28 the dglap evolution equation can be solved analytically . \n this is because one obtains in the moment space @xmath19 simple diagonalised differential equations . \n the only problem is the knowledge of the input parametrisation for the whole region @xmath29 , what is necessary in the determination of the initial moments @xmath30 : @xmath31 using the truncated moments approach one can avoid the uncertainties from the region @xmath12 , which will never be attained experimentally . the derivation of the dglap equations for truncated moments of parton distributions has been presented in @xcite . \n the evolution equations for truncated moments @xmath32 are not diagonal and therefore solving this problem is not so easy like in a case of the full - moments technique . \n nevertheless this method has an advantage over other approaches , based not only on the cut - off for unphysical region @xmath12 . \n the technique of truncated moments within dglap approximation enables namely to study scaling violations without making any assumption on the shape of the input parametrisation of parton distributions . \n while the solution of the evolution equations in the @xmath0-space requires knowledge of inputs @xmath33 with many parameters ( fitted in detailed comparison with the data ) , the initial values of truncated moments can be obtained directly by data . following the authors of @xcite , \n we have found the lo dglap evolution equation for the truncated at @xmath4 mellin moment of the nonsinglet structure function @xmath34 in a form : @xmath35 @xmath36 is the truncated at @xmath4 moment of the nonsinglet structure function : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 the kernel @xmath41 is simply equal to the anomalous dimension @xmath42 : @xmath43 \n expanding the @xmath44 in taylor series around @xmath45 , one has @xmath46\\sum\\limits_{p=0}^{k}\\frac{(-1)^p y^p}{p!(k - p)!}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] truncating the above expansion at order @xmath7 and using the following relation @xmath47 one can find that the evolution equation ( [ r3.4 ] ) becomes @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the evolution equations for truncated moments ( [ r3.9 ] ) , ( [ r3.10 ] ) are not diagonal but each @xmath19-th moment couples only with ( @xmath51)-th ( @xmath52 ) moments . as it was shown in @xcite the series of couplings to higher moments \n is convergent and furthermore the value of ( @xmath51)-th moments decreases rapidly in comparison to the @xmath19-th moment . hence one can retain from ( [ r3.9 ] ) the closed system of @xmath53 equations : @xmath54 @xmath55\\ ] ] @xmath56 @xmath57\\ ] ] @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 denotes the lowest moment in calculations . \n the above system can be solved numerically like a standard coupled differential equations using the runge - kutta method . \n we have also found an analytical solution of ( [ r3.11 ] ) in the form : @xmath61 for @xmath62const and @xmath63 for the running @xmath64 . \n matrix elements @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given in appendix b. for details about properties of triangular matrices like @xmath67 see also @xcite . \n we have made sure that the results ( [ r3.12])-([r3.13 ] ) agree with the solutions obtained with the help of the runge - kutta method . in the forthcoming chapter \n we compare predictions for the truncated moments @xmath36 obtained by solving eq.([r3.11 ] ) with those , computed in the chebyshev polynomial approach . \n we solve the system of evolution equations for truncated moments ( [ r3.11 ] ) and compare the results with predictions , obtained in the chebyshev polynomial approach . \n the chebyshev polynomials technique @xcite was successfully used by j.kwieciski in many qcd treatments e.g. @xcite,@xcite . using this method \n one obtains the system of linear differential equations instead of the original integro - differential ones . \n the chebyshev expansion provides a robust method of discretising a continuous problem . \n this allows computing the parton distributions for `` not too singular '' input parametrisation in the whole @xmath68 region . \n more detailed description of the chebyshev polynomials method in the solving the qcd evolution equations is given in appendix a. in this paper we use two spin - like input parametrisations of the parton distribution @xmath69 at @xmath70 , namely : @xmath71 where constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 are determined by the appropriate sum rules . \n more singular at small-@xmath0 input ( [ r4.2 ] ) incorporates the latest knowledge about the low-@xmath0 behaviour of the polarised structure functions @xcite . \n we start our analysis with a simple test , where the truncation point @xmath40 \n . then the results should be of course equal to the analytical ones : @xmath74 @xmath75 is the running coupling and @xmath76 depends on the number of the quark flavours @xmath77 : @xmath78    .test of the chebyshev polynomial method : comparison with analytical results of n - th ( full ) moments @xmath79 for different @xmath8 and input functions @xmath69 . [ \n cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that with increasing @xmath7 the accuracy of the truncated moments method systematically though slowly increases . \n this improvement of the accuracy breaks however for larger @xmath7 ( @xmath80 at @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 ) because of increasing numerical errors . \n all presented above results concern the running coupling @xmath75 . \n we have found also , that for the constant @xmath64 the error function @xmath84 ( [ r4.3a ] ) grows approximately proportionally to the strength of @xmath64 : @xmath85 summarising , the lo dglap evolution of any truncated at @xmath10 moment of the parton distribution can be reproduced with the satisfactory accuracy , where the relative error @xmath86 . \n analysis of the qcd @xmath8 evolution equations for truncated moments of parton distributions is very interesting both from the theoretical and experimental point of view . \n the truncated moments technique is complementary to the existing methods for solving the evolution equations , based on the full moments or @xmath0-space approaches . \n apart from it refers directly to the physical values - moments ( rather than to the parton distributions ) , what enables to use a wide range of deep - inelastic scattering data in terms of smaller number of parameters . in this way , \n no assumptions on the shape of parton distributions are needed . dealing with truncated at @xmath4 mellin moments : \n @xmath87 one can also avoid uncertainty from the unmeasurable very small @xmath12 region .    in this paper \n we have compared the solutions of lo dglap @xmath8 evolution equations written for the truncated mellin moments of the structure functions with those , obtained by using the chebyshev - polynomial technique . in both these approaches \n we have calculated numerically and semi - analytically the truncated moments @xmath88 . as a test structure function @xmath25 \n we have taken two different spin - like nonsinglet parton distributions . \n the computations have been performed for a wide range of @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath2 ) . treating the chebyshev results as exact \n , we have found that the truncated moments method is very promising , for any moment , together with the first one . \n the precision of the truncated moments approach is perfect for higher moments ( @xmath3 ) and not too large the truncation point @xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) , even for small @xmath6 . \n larger values of @xmath7 ( e.g. @xmath9 ) enables to obtain a quite satisfactory accuracy ( the relative error @xmath89 ) also for the first truncated moment . \n the original truncated moments technique @xcite has been developed in @xcite , what could improve the numerical efficiency . \n this technique can be a valuable tool e.g. in determination of the contribution to the moments of the gluon distribution from the experimentally accessible region . \n we think that the method of truncated moments can be useful in further theoretical and experimental qcd investigations . \n in order to solve the integro - differential evolution equation @xmath90 one has to expand functions @xmath26 into the series of the chebyshev polynomials : @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 is the chebyshev polynomial , defined as @xcite : @xmath95 and @xmath96 are nodes ( zeros ) of the @xmath97 : @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 in ( [ ra.3 ] ) and ( [ ra.6 ] ) is the smallest value of bjorken @xmath0 , involved in the analysis . in our computations \n . transformation ( [ ra.3 ] ) converts the physical @xmath0-region : [ @xmath102 into the @xmath103 $ ] one , suitable for the chebyshev approximation . \n integration over @xmath104 in the evolution equation ( [ ra.7 ] ) with @xmath26 expanded according to ( [ ra.1 ] ) leads to the system of linear differential equations : @xmath105 this system can be solved by using the standard runge - kutta method with initial conditions given by the input parametrisation @xmath106 . \n @xmath107 in the polynomial expansion ( [ ra.1 ] ) is equal to 20 . \n the closed system of @xmath53 dglap evolution equations for truncated moments @xmath36 ( [ r3.11 ] ) can be rewritten in the form : @xmath108 @xmath109\\ ] ] @xmath110 @xmath111\\ ] ] @xmath58 @xmath112 @xmath60 denotes the lowest moment in calculations and the matrix elements @xmath113 are related to the @xmath114 ( [ r3.10 ] ) via @xmath115 @xmath67 is a triangular matrix and therefore ( [ rb.1 ] ) can be solved analytically using the diagonalising matrix a : @xmath116 in this way one obtains the recurrence solutions ( [ r3.12]),([r3.13 ] ) . \n v.n.gribov , l.n.lipatov , _ sov . \n phys . _ * 15 * , 438 and 675 ( 1972 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 1180, "GeneratedTokens": 136, "SynthesizedBody": "the scientific goal of applying the doppler imaging technique to ap stars , is to derive observational constraints on the diffusion mechanism in the presence of a stellar magnetic field . \n theoretical studies ( michaud et al , 1981 ; mgessier , 1984 ) which predict that certain elements raise , sink or move horizontally in magnetic stellar atmospheres need to be verified . this can only be achieved if an unambiguous correlation between the elemental abundance structures and the magnetic field geometry is obtained . however , two major problems are responsible for difficulties in reaching that goal . \n firstly , doppler imaging can ( presently ) only be applied to stars which have a fairly weak magnetic field and hence only the variation of the integrated longitudinal field strength ( effective field , @xmath0 ) is usually determined . \n this sets only weak limits to the ` real ' magnetic geometry . for objects with stronger fields \n the spectral line profiles are severely influenced by zeeman broadening and are not mainly caused by abundance variations . \n this limitation can be avoided by obtaining all four stokes parameters as a function of the stellar rotational phase . \n then zeeman doppler imaging codes ( donati , 1995 ) can be applied to calculate the magnetic field strength and surface orientation in combination with the abundance distribution . \n but these measurements of the stokes parameters are not yet available , though strong efforts are made to get them from polarimetry . \n secondly , in the past , only a few elements were mapped , mostly silicon , rarely iron and chromium , not even all of them for each object . \n furthermore , these maps were based on inversions from single ` unblended ' spectral lines , which are difficult to find , especially in cooler ap stars . \n this introduced uncertainties leading to a questionable reliability of the derived maps and weakening their relevance to theoretical modelling . \n considering this situation , we focused our programme on the production of abundance maps of up to five and more elements on the surface of each of our target stars . a brief report on the stars and \n the progress of our project is given hereafter , followed by the presentation of results obtained for the magnetic ap star cu virginis . \n as pointed out before , one crucial limitation of doppler imaging in the past was that only a few elements were mapped , mostly silicon and occasionally iron and chromium . \n furthermore , the number of stars studied was not sufficient to draw general conclusions by relating the abundance maps to the approximate magnetic field structure , thereby providing new constraints on theory ( hatzes 1995 ) . \n in particular , the abundance maps of elements which are pushed upwards by radiatively driven diffusion should look severely different from those of elements that have a tendency to sink .        the helium map ( fig . \n 1 ) is characterized by a dominant spot which appears to be at the approximate position of the positive magnetic pole ( phase 0.5 ) . only in the central part of this spot \n does helium reach the solar abundance ; on all other parts of the stellar surface , it is depleted by about 1.5 dex . \n this result confirms theoretical predictions by vauclair et al . \n ( 1991 ) which have been obtained by modelling helium abundance in main sequence magnetic stars by introducing a weak wind of ionized metals at the magnetic poles , where the field lines are vertical .    in total contrast to that , \n silicon ( fig . \n 2 ) is strongly depleted in the helium spot but overabundant on the remaining visible surface . in these regions \n the magnetic field lines are mainly horizontal and as predicted by e.g. mgessier ( 1994 ) , silicon accumulates at the magnetic equator band . chromium and iron \n have surface structures very similar to that of silicon , but both elements are less enhanced compared to their solar abundances \n .    however , the magnesium ( fig . \n 3 ) distribution differs much from that of the other metals . \n the main feature is a ring centred at the helium spot ( magnetic pole ) , but with an the overall abundance deficiency of about 1 dex and much less contrast than all other elements . \n the helium spot distribution of cu vir was already found by hiesberger et al . \n ( 1995 ) , on the basis of data obtained in 1980 , which is an evidence for the high reliability of this result . \n also , the silicon abundance structure confirms earlier results published by hatzes ( 1995 ) . \n furthermore , there are strong indications that cu virginis has slowed down its rotation rate abruptly in the year 1985 ( pyper et al , 1998 ) . \n this effect has not been found in any other ap star and no theoretical explanation can be given at the moment .    nevertheless , the doppler imaging results for cu virgins are a good demonstration of how important it is to obtain the surface distribution of different elements for the same star . \n cu virginis is one of the very few objects for which a correlation of the abundance structures and the magnetic field geometry can be given with high significance . \n furthermore , it is planned to obtain the abundance distributions for elements like c , n , o and some rare earth species . \n this should complete the picture and may lead to a detailed theoretical modelling of diffusion processes interacting with the magnetic field of this star . \n donati , j .- f . : 1995 , in _ stellar surface structure , iau symp . \n 176 _ , eds : k.g . \n strassmeier and j.l . \n linsky , kluwer , dordrecht , 53 hatzes , a.p . : 1995 , in _ stellar surface structure , iau symp . \n 176 _ , eds : k.g . \n strassmeier and j.l . \n linsky , kluwer , dordrecht , 305", "StartTimeOffset": 1421270923824, "RequestID": "750ae6b1a6e590559dd11567f924398ba52b43ca", "TotalTokens": 1316}
{"ContextTokens": 4020, "GeneratedTokens": 186, "SynthesizedBody": "the fact that bell inequalities are violated in increasingly convincing experiments @xcite led the majority of the physics community to accept that nature is able to display nonlocal behaviors . \n in addition , the violations are such that the predictions of quantum mechanics are strictly observed , and , the so far unbeaten theory is itself said to be nonlocal . but how nonlocal ? \n although one feels compelled to quantify any resource that becomes relevant in both , basic science and technology , this program is very hard when one deals with nonlocality . \n let us begin with a remark on entanglement , a related but distinct concept . \n supposing that the entanglement content of multipartite mixed systems can be characterized by a finite set of numbers , it is not too risky to say that most of us , if not all , would agree on one point : these numbers should be a property of the quantum state alone . \n this means that in a hypothetical full - fledged theory of entanglement quantification , no context descriptions should be necessary whatsoever . \n for this reason entanglement measures would not be influenced by the fact that quantum mechanics is contextual . \n not even this starting point is clear in the case of nonlocality . \n many consider that also in this case an ultimate measure should depend only on the state . \n but this a less defendable position . nonlocality by its very definition refers to space - time , whose features do not enter in bell s inequalities for intrinsic degrees of freedom ( spin , polarization , etc ) . \n most importantly , even from a theoretical perspective , to asses nonlocality one must consider some kind of measurement , which makes unavoidable to face the contextual character of quantum mechanics . \n thus , it is not unreasonable to suppose that the nonlocality of a quantum state should display some dependence on the context ( e. g. , on the number and orientations of stern - gerlach apparatuses being employed ) . \n one possibility in this direction is to quantify the amount of nonlocality with respect to the setup required to investigate violations of a particular bell s inequality @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the limit imposed by local causality . \n a common procedure to induce an ordering in the hilbert space is as follows . \n consider a particular state @xmath4 and the bell function associated to the chosen inequality , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of parameters that can be varied in the measurement ( it is important to stress that we are restricting our analysis to rank-1 projective measurements ) . \n then , a state @xmath7 is said to be more nonlocal than @xmath8 if @xmath9 . \n the maximum of the bell function is obtained by visiting all setting parameters . \n this relation certainly means that @xmath7 is more correlated than @xmath8 , both being correlated beyond any classical system could be . \n but , does it make sense to use this criteria as a measure of nonlocality ? \n consider that there are quantum states for which @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the maximum value of @xmath12 according to quantum mechanics . \n for definiteness , suppose that @xmath13 and consider two states such that @xmath14 with @xmath15 being a positive number that can be made arbitrarily small . \n assume , for simplicity , that these values are attained for the same set of parameters ( e. g. , a particular set of directions ) . \n for this fixed situation what makes one states that @xmath7 is more nonlocal ? \n perhaps , since the violation by @xmath8 is weaker , the subsystems in this case should be farther away in comparison to those described by @xmath7 in order to enable violations . \n another possibility is to think of superluminal signaling . \n perhaps , the minimal signal velocity for @xmath7 must be larger than the analogous quantity for @xmath8 : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the speed of light , and @xmath18 is the minimum signal velocity for each state . \n however , none of these points can be sustained by facts . \n in particular , it is not true that @xmath19 , no matter how small is @xmath15 . since the distance between the subsystems do not enter in the inequalities and \n can be arbitrarily large , one would need @xmath20 even if @xmath21 . \n the truth is that , for the fixed set of parameters , the two states are equally nonlocal , because the action at a distance required to explain the quantum correlations must be equally `` spooky '' in the two cases . \n it is instructive to look at this question from the opposite perspective . \n consider two non - violating states @xmath22 and @xmath23 . \n is it reasonable to say that , because @xmath24 regarding some particular setting , @xmath22 is more _ local _ than @xmath23 ? \n of course not . \n if two states are local , nothing else needs to be added . \n there are no gradations of locality . \n note carefully that it is not being implied that @xmath9 has no meaning with regards to nonlocality . to see this , \n let us vary by a small amount some of the parameters so that the violations are no longer maximal : @xmath25 now , state @xmath8 is local while @xmath7 is still nonlocal , for sufficiently small @xmath15 , with respect to the new setting parameters . \n so , it may be appropriate to look at violations for all possible parameters . \n what is proposed in reference @xcite is that , for a fixed set of parameters , there should be no gradations of nonlocality , and that it should be assessed only when all experimental situations are considered . in this context \n , the state @xmath7 is more nonlocal than @xmath8 if the former violates local causality , no matter by what extent , for a larger number of experimental configurations than the latter . \n this consideration led to the definition of the volume of violation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the subset of @xmath28 containing al violating configurations and @xmath29 . \n the measure @xmath30 is such that every configuration is equally important as will become clear in the example of the next section . \n note that , according to the above definition , @xmath31 , since @xmath32 , meaning , as expected , that all non - violating states are equally local . \n we stress that this definition aims at quantifying the nonlocality of a physical situation , i. e. , of a state @xmath7 under the specific measurements required to test some fixed bell s inequality . \n the nonlocal content of a state under a certain kind of measurement , as described by the volume of violation , has been applied to a problem that became known as the `` anomaly '' in the nonlocality @xcite . \n it consists in the fact that the collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality @xcite is maximally violated by a state that is not maximally entangled for two entangled qutrits . \n it turns out that the supposed anomaly disappears when the volume of violation in used , that is , @xmath33 attains its maximum for the maximally entangled state . \n of course , nonlocality and entanglement are distinct quantities , e. g. , the latter is more fragile against noise than the former . \n what the referred result seems to indicate is that the difference is not as evident as some results , like the anomaly , initially suggested . \n the integrations involved in the determination of the volume of violation for two three - level systems under cglmp measurements required a fully numeric approach , thus , not being very illustrative on how to determine these volumes in detail . in what follows \n we show that , at least in the simplest case , that of a spherically symmetric state subjected to a test of the first bell s inequality , the volume of violation can be computed analytically . \n in his milestone paper , bell showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics would be , in certain testable situations , in conflict with any theory preserving local causality @xcite . \n this fundamental conflict appeared in the form of an inequality for correlations between spin-1/2 measurements made by two parties @xmath34 and @xmath35 sufficiently far apart . \n the relation that should be satisfied by any theory compatible with local causality reads @xmath36 is the average value of the product of the result of spin measurements obtained by @xmath34 along direction @xmath37 and by @xmath35 along direction @xmath38 . denoting the possible outcomes by @xmath39 and @xmath40 we get @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the probability for results @xmath39 in @xmath34 and @xmath39 in @xmath35 , and so on . \n hereafter we will address the singlet state @xmath43 ) with @xmath44 being the eigenstates of @xmath45 for _ any _ direction @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 denoting the pauli matrices . \n this greatly facilitates our task . \n since there are no privileged directions , without loss of information , we can assume that one of the measurement directions is fixed in the space , say , @xmath49 . \n furthermore , the correlations assume a particularly simple form for the singlet , namely , @xmath50 . \n the inequality ( [ bell1 ] ) becomes @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 $ ] are the azimuthal angles of @xmath54 and @xmath38 , respectively , and @xmath55 @xmath56 $ ] is the difference between the corresponding polar coordinates \n . the complementary variable @xmath57 $ ] does not enter in the inequality . \n we , thus , have a four -

   even with the simplifications brought by spherical symmetry , the volume of violation regarding the settings of the chsh inequality amounts to a five - dimensional integration , which , so far , we were not able to carry out analytically . \n the main goal is to compare this volume to that of the popescu - rohrlich box @xcite . \n since we are arguing that the numeric value of a bell function is being overrated , the fact that these probability boxes can yield @xmath126 for the chsh inequality , does not necessarily mean that they are more nonlocal than quantum mechanics , at least in the framework of our proposal . \n the author thanks a. p. pereira da costa and e. a. fonseca for useful discussions on this problem . \n the author would like to thank the anonymous referee for bringing to his knowledge the references @xcite . \n this work received financial support from the brazilian agencies conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) , coordenao de aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior ( capes ) , and fundao de amparo  cincia e tecnologia do estado de pernambuco ( facepe ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1426258121232, "RequestID": "167789281629065502b8af592c8ffaff3eba5f44", "TotalTokens": 4206}

frobenius operator @xmath40    by introducing the zeta function @xmath41 the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 can be expressed as a contour integral @xmath42 where the small contour @xmath43 encircles the origin in negative direction . \n the expansion of the zeta function to a power series is usually referred to as a _ cycle expansion_. @xmath44 this representation converges up to the leading singularity , unlike the product representation ( [ eqn : zzdef ] ) which diverges at ( nontrivial ) zeroes . \n if the zeta function @xmath45 is analytic in a disk extending beyond the leading zero @xmath46 , then the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 , and hence the survival probability @xmath47 , will decay asymptotically as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the escape rate . \n we will introduce intermittency in connection with a specific model . \n we then consider an intermittent map @xmath50 with two branches @xmath51 , and where @xmath0 is chosen as the unit interval : @xmath52 the map is intermittent if @xmath53 and allows escape if @xmath54 . \n the map is shown in fig . \n [ fig : themap ] , together with some of its partitions . \n the right edge of the left branch @xmath55 , denoted @xmath56 , is implicitly defined by @xmath57 . \n the particle is considered to escape if @xmath58 . \n the intermittent property is related to the fact that the cycle @xmath59 is neutrally stable @xmath60 . \n consequently , cycle stabilities can no longer be exponentially bounded with length . \n this loss of hyperbolicity makes it difficult to relate the survival probability @xmath47 to the periodic orbit sums @xmath36 . indeed , eq . ( [ eqn : absiq ] ) \n is brutally violated in some cases , as can been realized from the following example . \n the problem of intermittency is best represented by the family of periodic orbits @xmath61 . \n it follows from eqs . \n ( [ eqn : recrule ] ) and ( [ eqn : themap ] ) that @xmath62 . \n it can be shown @xcite that @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 which should be compared with the asymptotic behavior of the stabilities @xmath65    the difference in power laws seems to spoil every possibility of a bound like ( [ eqn : boundhyper ] ) . however , eq . ( [ eqn : absiq ] ) is not necessary for that purpose . \n it suffices if the ratio @xmath66 stays bounded . that it to say that it suffices if the average size of the intervals along a cycle can be related to the stability , rather than each interval separately . here \n @xmath67 denotes the shift operator . \n we check this numerically on two sequences : @xmath61 and @xmath68 , the former being most sensitive to intermittency . \n the result is plotted in fig . \n [ fig : bounds ] . \n we note that for both sequences , @xmath69 appear to tend to well defined limits , where @xmath61 lead to the largest deviation from unity . \n indeed , it is reasonable to assume that the sequence @xmath61 provides a lower bound @xmath70 in view of this , the numerical results strongly suggest that @xmath69 stays bounded , and that , for this particular system , @xmath71 in eq . \n ( [ eqn : boundhyper ] ) can be chosen as @xmath72 and @xmath73 presumably close to unity . \n this is a surprisingly low price to pay for the complication of intermittency . \n the sizes of the intervals @xmath74 has no relation whatsoever to the stability of the cycle @xmath59 , which is unity . we exclude the intervals @xmath74 from our considerations by _ pruning _ the fixpoint from the zeta function @xmath75 the contribution from @xmath74 to @xmath47 can be added separately if required . \n since the result rely on summation along periodic orbits , it might break down for some choices of the initial distribution @xmath20 were such a summation is not carried out . \n after having argued that the survival probability @xmath47 still can be bounded close to periodic orbit sums @xmath76 we turn to the problem of computing the asymptotics of these periodic orbit sums . \n the coefficients of the cycle expansion ( [ eqn : cycexp ] ) for the map ( [ eqn : themap ] ) decay asymptotically as @xmath77 which induces a singularity of the type @xmath78 in the zeta function @xcite . \n if @xmath79 is an integer , the singularity is @xmath80 .    to evaluate the periodic orbit sum it is convenient to consider a resummation of the zeta function around the branch point @xmath81 . \n @xmath82    in practical calculations one has only a finite number of coefficients @xmath83 , @xmath84 of the cycle expansion at disposal . here \n @xmath85 is the cutoff in ( topological ) length . in @xcite \n we proposed a simple resummation scheme for the computation of the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 in ( [ eqn : genseri ] ) . \n we replace the infinite in ( [ eqn : genseri ] ) sums by finite sums of increasing degrees , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and require that @xmath90 one expands @xmath91 in binomial sums ( series ) . \n if @xmath92 this leads to a solvable linear system of equations yielding the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 . \n it is natural to require that @xmath93 so that the maximal powers of the two sums in eq . \n ( [ eqn : genserf ] ) are adjacent . \n if the zeta function is entire in the entire @xmath94 plane ( except for the branch cut ) the periodic orbit sum can be written @xmath95 the sum is over all zeroes @xmath96 of the zeta function ( assuming they are not degenerated ) and the contour @xmath97 goes round the branch cut in positive direction \n . if poles and/or natural boundaries are present , expression ( [ eqn : periodic orbit sumsplit ] ) must be accordingly modified . \n the leading asymptotic behavior is provided by the vicinity of the branch point @xmath81 , and is found to be @xcite @xmath98    the relevant ratio @xmath99 , obtained from the resummation scheme , versus cutoff length @xmath85 is plotted in fig . \n [ fig : ratconv ] . in all numerical work \n we have used the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 . and computed all periodic orbits up to length 20 . \n there is also a pair of complex conjugate zeroes , @xmath102 close to the branch cut . \n they contribute both to the sum over zeroes and to the integral around the cut in ( [ eqn : periodic orbit sumsplit ] ) . \n but since their imaginary part @xmath103 is small , they will , in effect , contribute a factor @xmath104 to the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 . \n this zero will dominate @xmath36 in some range @xmath105 before the asymptotic power law sets in .    in fig . \n [ fig : convergence ] we study the convergence of the real and imaginary part of @xmath46 obtained from the resummation scheme above , for different cutoffs @xmath85 . \n the zero is computed by newton - raphson iteration of the left hand side of ( [ eqn : genserf ] ) , after the resummation has been done . \n again we note that the analytic continuation technique works quite satisfactorily . \n the probability of escaping at iteration @xmath10 is @xmath106 we get for this distribution @xmath107 here we have neglected the interval @xmath74 , having the same asymptotic decay law as the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 . due to the uncertainty in the bounds ( [ eqn : boundhyper ] ) it can be neglected . \n the crossover @xmath108 takes place when the two terms in ( [ eqn : cross ] ) are of comparable magnitude . for our standard set of parameters ( @xmath101 , @xmath100 ) \n it is found to be @xmath109 . \n the check our predictions we run a simulation of the system . \n the result can be seen in fig . \n ( [ fig : simulation ] ) . \n we note that the slope of the exponential , the power and magnitude of the power law , as well as the crossover time agrees very well with our predictions . \n a reader still in any doubt on the effectiveness of cycle expansions should consider the following . \n the simulation in fig . \n [ fig : simulation ] averaged over @xmath110 initial point , yet , in itself the result would not very conclusive . a direct evaluation of the periodic orbit sum up to say @xmath111 would require roughly @xmath112 periodic orbits . \n we have not bothered to perform such a cross check ! but a resummed cycle expansion provides reliable answers with a length cutoff as low as @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 prime cycles . admittedly , we benefitted from knowing the asymptotic power law of the cycle expansion . however , if this is not the situation , this power law is easily extracted if one uses stability ordering @xcite . \n the occurrence of a dominating zero beyond the branch point is , in fact , very natural . \n consider the one - parameter family of zeta functions . @xmath115 for @xmath116 small enough \n there is a leading zero @xmath117 within the domain of convergence @xmath118 . \n this is related to the topological pressure @xcite according to @xmath119 . \n for instance @xmath120 is the topological entropy . for a certain @xmath116 ( actually the fractal dimension of the repeller ) the zero collides with the branch point @xmath81 , splits into two , and continue to move out beyond the branch point . in fig . \n [ fig : pressure ] we plot the logarithm of the leading zero ( @xmath121 ) versus @xmath116 . \n it is obtained from a resummation analogous to the one discussed above , cf.@xcite . \n it can be interpreted as the topological pressure only as long it is real . \n the particular form of the distribution of escape times does depend on the initial distribution @xmath20 . in this paper \n we have restricted ourselves to a uniform initial distribution . \n to model chaotic scattering \n one must imagine that particles can be injected according to any distribution . \n for example , one can construct a chaotic scatterer from a bounded billiard by drilling holes wherever on the boundary and injecting particles from different angles . \n this may even effect the asymptotic power law @xcite . \n periodic orbit theories can also account for other initial distributions than uniform . \n however , the preceding discussions about relating periodic orbit sums to survival probabilities warns us to be cautious when doing so for intermittent systems . \n an immediate application concerns conductance fluctuations in quantum dots @xcite . \n the fourier transform @xmath122 of the correlation function @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the transmission as function of the fermi wave number , can , after several approximations , be related to the escape distribution @xmath125 @xcite @xmath126 if there is a crossover to a power law in @xmath125 there will be an associated crossover in @xmath122 . \n for an intermittent chaotic systems , the crossover time may be very long - the quasi regular region component of phase space will not make itself noticed until very long times . if the elastic mean free path of electrons is much shorter than the length corresponding to the crossover time , the quasi regular component will never ve detected in this type of experiments . or the other way around , a small deviation from an integrable structure induces chaotic layers in phase space . \n this chaotic layers may lead to exponential escape for small times , and the experimental outcome may very well resemble predictions for fully chaotic systems .    in experiments a ( weak ) magnetic field is a more natural control parameter than the fermi energy . \n instead of the distribution of dwelling times one has to consider the distribution of enclosed area , a related but more subtle concept which we plan to address in future work . \n one has observed lorentzians shape ( predicted for chaotic systems ) of the so called weak localization peak even in near integrable structure @xcite . \n this has been attributed to naturally occurring imperfections @xcite and rhymes well with the classical considerations above . \n admittedly , we have now moved far from our original intermittent map and entered the realm of speculations . \n what we do want to point out in this letter is that these kind of problem are well suited for periodic orbit computations - zeta functions is a powerful tool for making long time predictions , even for intermittent chaos , once the problems of analytical continuation can be overcome . \n i am grateful to hans henrik rugh for pointing out an inconsistency , in an early version of this paper , and to carl dettmann for critical reading . \n i would like to thank karl -

{"ContextTokens": 3706, "GeneratedTokens": 110, "SynthesizedBody": "among the capabilities enabled by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite or related phenomena are high precision magnetometery , lasing without inversion , and slowing @xcite and stopping of light pulses @xcite . \n these possibilities opened new avenues for optical information storage and quantum information processing . \n recent experiments based on dynamic eit have demonstrated the reversible mapping of single - photons or qubits @xcite and of quantum continuous variables @xcite . \n these seminal demonstrations spurred intense experimental and theoretical efforts to improve the efficiency of such processes and extend them to new enabling photonic technologies . \n an important effort concerns indeed the modeling of the eit process in the non - ideal case . \n the eit configuration is usually modeled by a generic @xmath0-type three - level system , most relevant for quantum memory schemes @xcite : two atomic ground states are connected to an excited state via two optical fields , a probe and a control field . however , in many optically dense media , the relevant energy structure is more complex and can strongly modify the eit features . \n a typical case is the use of ensembles of alkali - metal atoms in which experiments have been most performed @xcite . \n the hyperfine interaction in the excited state introduces several levels , which can simultaneously participate in the coherent interaction . \n the deviation from the @xmath0-type approximation can be very significant when the inhomogeneous broadening is comparable with the separation between these excited levels , such as for example in the d@xmath1-line of atomic cesium at room temperature . \n the observed transparency is generally lower than predicted @xcite and can eventually disappear for large broadening @xcite . \n the broadening also leads to a narrowing of the transparency window @xcite . \n various numerical analysis have investigated particular regimes , such as double-@xmath0 system @xcite or off - resonant raman transition in a broadened medium @xcite . however , to date no full study of eit in inhomogeneously broadened medium with multiple excited levels has been performed .    in the present paper , \n we report measurements that provide a detailed picture of eit in a doppler broadened medium . in agreement with the general model recently developed in ref . \n @xcite , we evidence the process leading to a reduced transparency and we experimentally demonstrate how to mitigate this effect . \n our observations are made possible by identifying atoms from specific velocity classes that absorb the light in the process and by then reshaping accordingly the atomic velocity distribution . \n this procedure enables to recover a significant transparency . \n in a @xmath0-type system , the susceptibility of the medium is strongly modified when a driving field is applied to one of the transition . in the absence of broadening , the transmission of a probe field exhibits two symmetrical absorption peaks as a function of its detuning from the resonance , defining a transparency window at resonance . in an \n inhomogeneously broadened medium , the absorption spectrum of the various atoms differs from this description as they are involved in off - resonant processes , drastically modifying the susceptibility and the eit spectrum . \n specifically , in a doppler broadened medium , the atoms are distributed over a wide range of velocity classes . for an atom moving with velocity @xmath2 and copropagating control and probe fields , \n the two laser frequencies are doppler shifted in the atom rest frame by approximately the same detuning @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the wave - vector of the fields . \n the two - photon detuning , defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the field frequencies and @xmath8 the splitting between the two ground states , does not depend on the velocity either . \n figure [ schema_3d](a ) gives the absorption as a function of the two - photon detuning for different doppler shifts when the control field is resonant for atoms at rest . \n we have considered the case of velocities opposite to the laser propagation direction ( @xmath9 ) . while for atoms at rest one can observe the usual autler - townes doublet , the spectrum is modified when the doppler shift increases , i.e. the two absorption peaks are not symmetrical anymore . \n the peak with @xmath10 corresponds to the one - photon absorption resonance and the second peak ( @xmath11 ) corresponds to the raman absorption process , and it is stark shifted from the zero two - photon detuning . when the doppler detuning increases , this raman peak gets closer to @xmath12 without reaching this point . as a result \n , transparency is preserved at the zero two - photon detuning for all the velocity classes . \n the integration over the whole distribution thus preserves the transparency at resonance but leads to a reduction of the transparency window width . \n when one takes into account the presence of other levels , additional stark shifts appear that move the raman resonance from the position described in the @xmath0 configuration . \n based on the model developed in @xcite , fig . \n [ schema_3d](b ) shows the case of two excited levels , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . \n the strong modification of the susceptibility can be understood as follows . in this scheme \n , two velocity classes now see the control field on resonance but for different levels : @xmath13 for zero doppler shift and @xmath14 for a shift equal to the separation between the two levels * @xmath15*. these two classes exhibit a quasi - symmetrical autler - townes doublet centered close to their respective atomic transition , i.e. on the zero two - photon detuning shown on fig . \n 1(b ) . for atoms with intermediate velocities , \n the raman absorption undergoes stark shifts due to the two excited states and eventually crosses the transparency window of atoms with zero doppler shift , as illustrated in fig . \n [ schema_3d](b ) . while transparency was always preserved at resonance in the @xmath0 model , here \n there is no longer any value of the detuning for which atoms are transparent independently of their velocity . \n consequently , if the broadening is comparable with the hyperfine splitting , the integration over all the velocity classes can result in a total disappearance of the eit , as shown here . \n we find that in our case the atomic velocity classes to be removed for optimal eit recovery correspond to doppler detunings 35mhz@xmath1645mhz ( appendix a ) . by excluding these specific atoms from the interaction process \n , the eit can be recovered , as we will show . \n the experiment is sketched in fig . \n [ schema_manip ] . \n the optically dense medium is obtained from a vapor of @xmath17cs heated at 35@xmath18c in a paraffin - coated cylindrical glass cell ( 3 cm long and 3 cm in diameter ) . at this temperature , the doppler broadening reaches a half - width equal to 160 mhz . \n the cell is placed in a longitudinal magnetic field produced by sets of coils and the system is enclosed into a magnetic shield . \n the scheme of the interaction is given in the inset of fig . \n [ schema_manip ] . the two ground states @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the two zeeman states @xmath21 and @xmath22 separated by 1.25 mhz . \n the excited state @xmath13 is the zeeman state @xmath23 . \n as explained previously , this simple @xmath0 system is strongly influenced by the other excited states , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 which are respectively 151 mhz and 352 mhz from the @xmath13 state . \n the control field is @xmath26-polarized and resonant with the transition @xmath27 for non - moving atoms , while the probe field is @xmath28-polarized and addresses the transition @xmath29 of the f=3 level . \n however , off - resonant pumping through the excited state @xmath24 in the presence of large doppler shifts can eventually drive all the atomic population into the @xmath30 dark state . to prevent this depumping , \n an additional @xmath26 repump field is used on the transition @xmath31 . in this way \n , a significant fraction of the atoms is maintained in @xmath32 @xcite . \n control and probe fields are collimated ( 5 mm diameter ) and with respective powers of 200 mw and 150 nw . \n they are combined on a polarizing beam splitter and then pass through a @xmath33 to enter the cell with circular polarization . \n the probe field is then extracted using a @xmath33 and a glan polarizer with high extinction ratio ( @xmath34 ) . \n the repump beam has a slightly larger beam size and its power is adjusted during the experiment to keep the optical density constant .    as explained above \n , the disappearance of the eit is predicted to be due to some specific velocity classes . in order to exclude these atoms from the interaction , we use one or two additional depumping beams detuned by @xmath35 from the @xmath36 transition for non - moving atoms . \n they enable to burn specific holes in the velocity distribution . for experimental convenience , they are contra - propagative with the control and probe fields , with an angle around 3@xmath18 . in order to remove atoms that see the probe field frequency shifted by @xmath37 , a counterpropagating depumping beam must have a frequency detuned by @xmath38 . \n the atoms are then efficiently pumped into the hyperfine ground state f=4 and do not contribute anymore to the interaction . \n transmission spectra are obtained by scanning the probe detuning , which corresponds to scanning the two - photon detuning @xmath39 . \n figure [ courbe_exp_theo](a ) gives the spectrum , with and without reshaping of the atomic velocity distribution . \n curve ( 1 ) shows a very weak eit peak near @xmath12 as expected in such a broadened medium with several excited states . \n we then send a depumping beam . \n a broad peak , corresponding to the hole burnt in the velocity distribution , appears in the transmission spectrum ( curve ( 2 ) ) . \n as can be seen , the eit peak is significantly enhanced . \n the best transparency is obtained for detunings close to the predicted value of @xmath40 40 mhz , confirming that the eit is recovered when the detrimental effect of these atoms is suppressed . \n the depth of the hole created in the distribution by the depumping beam at 40 mhz being saturated for a power of about 6mw , we tested the effect of a second depumping beam , detuned from the optimal frequency and corresponding to atoms with @xmath4085 mhz . \n as shown by curve ( 3 ) , the transparency is slightly increased , since this beam removes some more atoms which have non - zero absorption in the eit window . \n these results are in very good agreement with the transmission curves calculated from the model developed in ref . \n @xcite and given in fig . \n [ courbe_exp_theo](b ) . in this case \n , we have used the velocity distributions extracted from the experimental data to compute the susceptibility of the atomic ensemble , as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ courbe_exp_theo](b ) . even in the absence of depumping beams , \n the distribution is non gaussian , since it is strongly modified by the control and the repump beams @xcite . \n it can be seen that the effect of one and two depumping beams on the eit is correctly reproduced . \n because of the distorted velocity distribution , this model also correctly predicts a small eit feature in the absence of depumping , in contrast to the model of fig . \n [ schema_3d](b ) . \n finally , in order to quantify the eit enhancement , we introduce an eit contrast @xmath41 defined as the ratio @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the probe transmittance at the maximum and on the side of the eit peak . in our experiment , @xmath41 is increased by a factor 5 , which can be shown to yield a decrease of the group velocity by a factor of the same order of magnitude . \n this shows the potential of our method for efficiently improving eit - based processes . \n we note that the full theoretical model @xcite predicts an enhancement factor around 8 . \n the main limitation in our experimental demonstration is coming from the contrast of the hole burned in the velocity distribution . a detailed study of the hole burning dynamics is expected to bring further enhancement of the eit feature @xcite .    in summary \n , we have reported a detailed experimental characterization of the eit properties of a medium with doppler broadening and multiple excited levels . \n it can be shown that some specific velocity classes are mainly causing the suppression of transparency . \n we have proposed a procedure to remove these atoms from the interaction via a well - designed reshaping of the atomic velocity distribution . \n our observations confirmed the general mechanism and enabled to demonstrate a strong enhancement of the transparency . \n this study may bring new applications and offer significant improvements in various settings based on eit or related effects , including in quantum information science and metrology . \n moreover , beyond the specific medium used here , i.e alkali - metal atoms at room temperature , our method , which allows an efficient engineering of the eit properties of an inhomogeneously broadened medium , can be extended to various atom - like physical systems presenting simultaneously large broadening and multiple levels , e.g. in rare - earth doped crystals , quantum dots or nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamonds . \n the simplified model given in the text enables to identify the atoms which strongly modify the eit and to calculate their doppler shift @xmath37 . with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the dipole elements for @xmath47 and @xmath48 transitions and @xmath15 the splitting in the excited state \n , @xmath37 can be obtained from : @xmath49 this equation states that the raman absorption resonance , displaced by the stark shifts due to the two excited levels ( left hand side ) is centered at the same frequency as the eit window for atoms with zero doppler shift , itself shifted due to level @xmath14 ( right hand side ) . \n this equation has two solutions that do not depend on the control field rabi frequency . \n the solution that introduces the largest absorption is @xmath37=48mhz , marked by arrows in fig . [ \n 1 ] .    with a full model @xcite taking into account the hyperfine structure of atomic cesium , and the variation of the height of the raman absorption resonance with doppler detuning \n , we find that in our case the atomic velocity classes to be removed for optimal eit recovery correspond to doppler detunings 35mhz@xmath1645mhz , which is consistent with the simplified    we thank d. felinto , j.  ortalo and s.  burks for fruitful discussions . \n this work is supported by the ec under the ict / fet project compas . \n mishina acknowledges the financial support of the ile - de - france programme ifraf . \n j. laurat is member of the institut universitaire de france . \n t. chanelire , d.n . \n matsukevich , s.d . \n jenkins , s .- y . \n lan , t.a.b . \n kennedy , and a. kuzmich ,  storage and retrieval of single photons transmitted between remote quantum memories , \" nature * 438 * , 833 ( 2005 ) . \n a.m. akulshin , s. barreiro , and a. lezama ,  electromagnetically induced absorption and transparency due to resonant two - field excitation of quasidegenerate levels in rb vapor , \" phys . \n a * 57 * , 2996 ( 1998 ) . \n k. li , l. deng , and m.g . \n payne ,  realization of a single and closed @xmath0-system in a room - temperature three - level coherently prepared resonant medium with narrow d1 hyperfine splittings , \" appl . \n phys . lett . * \n 95 * , 221103 ( 2009 ) . \n hossain , s. mitra , s. chakrabarti , d. bhattacharyya , b. ray , and p.n . \n ghosh ,  study of width and height of eit resonance in a doppler broadened five - level system with varying probe power , \" eur . \n j. d * 53 * , 141 ( 2009 ) . \n sheremet , l.v . \n gerasimov , i.m . \n sokolov , d.v . \n kupriyanov , o.s . \n mishina , e. giacobino , and j. laurat ,  quantum memory for light via a stimulated off - resonant raman process : beyond the three - level @xmath0-scheme approximation , \" phys . \n a * 82 * , 033838 ( 2010 ) . \n mishina , m. scherman , p. lombardi , j. ortalo , d. felinto , a. s. sheremet , a. bramati , d.v . \n kupriyanov , j. laurat , and e. giacobino ,  electromagnetically induced transparency in an inhomogeneously broadened @xmath0 transition with multiple excited levels , \" phys . \n a * 83 * , 053809 ( 2011 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1437176508204, "RequestID": "1f2e67c6679e4b58da767402db114b00c9ca2a80", "TotalTokens": 3816}

also all the decision is made only through local interactions between neighboring nodes . \n this paper provides case studies taking account of various scenarios ; while analyzing the simulation results , we will discuss the capability of the discoord algorithms . \n in discoord algorithms , there are @xmath3 nodes , and each node is able to generate energy within some specified lower and upper boundaries . \n the nodes are interconnected for energy exchanges and for communications each other . to make the problem clear , the following symbols are provided . \n [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      the combination of the set of nodes and set of edges is called a graph , i.e. , @xmath4 . \n thus , the overall topology of the system is defined by the graph @xmath5 . \n the discoord algorithms seek to solve the following problem @xcite . \n [ prob1 ] given initial and desired energies of each nodes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , generate energies @xmath6 and exchange energies , @xmath7 , with neighboring nodes such that @xmath8 , by relying upon only local interactions .    in the above problem , \n the energy generation should be done with the constraints of @xmath9    for the energy generation , the node @xmath10 can exchange a certain type of information only with its neighboring nodes . \n it is supposed that the information is exchanged through communication layer network ( or cyber - layer network ) @xcite . \n the energy exchange means the energy flow between the neighboring nodes ; so the energy exchange is done in physical - layer network . \n it is also important to notice that there is a relationship between the desired energies and initial and generated energies . \n that is , the sum of the desired energies should be less than the sum of initial energies and the maximum energy that can be generated by the nodes . \n it can be constrained as follows : @xmath11    eventually , the discoord algorithms should generate the energies @xmath12 such as @xmath13 which is called the supply - demand balance . \n so , given the desired energies of individual nodes , one of the key constraints in the discoord algorithms is to satisfy the supply - demand balance during the generations of @xmath12 . \n the purpose of energy generation is to generate @xmath12 only using local neighboring interactions under the constraints of ( [ generation_constraint ] ) and ( [ supply_demand_balance ] ) . \n the algorithm is composed of three steps . in the following algorithm , \n the interim parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used .    1 \n .   initial values +  @xmath16 +  @xmath17 2 . \n find the steady state solutions from the following dynamic equations + \n @xmath19 + where @xmath20 is the cardinality of the set @xmath21 . \n let the steady - state solutions of the above equations denote as @xmath22 and @xmath23 . \n energy generation of nodes + \n @xmath24    note that in the above @xmath25nd step , for the update of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the node @xmath10 needs information of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are the values of neighboring interim parameters . \n so , to compute @xmath6 at the node @xmath10 , it needs to communicate with the neighboring nodes . \n since @xmath20 and @xmath30 are fixed and can be exchanged by initial local interactions , it is simply assumed that they are available to neighboring nodes . \n the purpose of the energy distribution is to make the level of energy of each node become @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath31 by the energy flows @xmath7 . this algorithm is also composed of three steps . in the following algorithm , the interim parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are used .    1 \n .   initial values +  @xmath34 + \n @xmath35 + where @xmath6 is computed from the @xmath36-rd step in the energy generation algorithm . \n 2 .   find the steady state solutions from the following dynamic equations +  @xmath37 + \n @xmath38 + where @xmath39 . let the steady - state solution of the above equation denote @xmath40 . \n energy flow from @xmath10-th node to the @xmath41-th node + \n @xmath42    note that in the above @xmath25nd step , for the update of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the node @xmath10 needs information of @xmath45 from the neighboring nodes . \n since @xmath46 are fixed and can be also exchanged by local interactions initially , it is assumed that they are available to neighboring nodes . \n the convergence of algorithms has been completely proved in @xcite . \n it is assumed that the desired energy of individual node is given as ( [ desired_constraint ] ) . \n the energy generation algorithm computes @xmath6 ; and then @xmath6 is used for the computation of @xmath2 at the energy distribution algorithm . \n it is also noticeable that the solutions of the energy generation and energy distribution algorithms are computed through communications among neighboring nodes . \n so , after obtaining the solutions @xmath6 and @xmath2 , each node generates physical energy and distributes energy to the neighboring nodes simultaneously . \n in this case , the sum of the desired energies of all nodes is well given as @xmath47 . for the balanced case , we consider the following scenario : +  six nodes : @xmath48 , and @xmath49 +  seven undirected edges : @xmath50 +  initial energies : @xmath51 , and @xmath52 +  desired energies : @xmath53 , and @xmath54 +  lower boundaries of generation capability : @xmath55 for all @xmath10 +  upper boundaries of generation capability : @xmath56 and @xmath57    clearly , since @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , the supply - demand balance is satisfied . now using the discoord algorithms given in the previous section , \n we obtain +  the generated energies : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 +  energy flows : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 + from the above result , we see that the total amount of energy flows is @xmath74 . as shown in fig . \n [ case11 ] , the desired energies have been well achieved after energy distribution . fig . \n [ case12 ] shows the overall variation in energy level of each node , and overall energy flows in the graph .    : \n desired energies(upper figure ) and achieved energies(lower figure ) . ]    : upper figure - initial(blue ) , desired(aqua ) , generated(yellow ) , and initial@xmath75generated(red ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3744, "GeneratedTokens": 216, "SynthesizedBody": "a fundamental theoretical challenge in strongly correlated systems lies in understanding the behavior of frustrated quantum magnets , whose properties often bear little resemblance to those of their classical counterparts . in the most exotic scenario , \n quantum fluctuations are sufficiently strong to disorder the system even at zero temperature , and a spin liquid ground state emerges . \n historically , anderson originally suggested that the spin-1/2 heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet may realize such a quantum - disordered ground state.@xcite it is now recognized that with only nearest - neighbor exchange the true ground state on the triangular lattice is the magnetically ordered @xmath0 phase , though the order is significantly diminished relative to the classical state.@xcite it is conceivable , then , that a spin liquid may arise with not too drastic perturbations to the model , and the triangular lattice has thus remained a prominent setting in the search for two - dimensional spin liquids . \n recent experiments on the spin-1/2 anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet  stimulated renewed interest in possible spin - liquid phases proximate to the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model.@xcite this material is accurately modeled by an anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian supplemented by a weak  interaction.@xcite although long - range spiral order develops at temperatures @xmath1k , the dynamical structure factor measured via neutron scattering exhibits `` critical '' power laws at intermediate energies , both in the ordered phase and in a range of temperatures above @xmath2 . \n this unusual power law behavior in the excitation spectrum is highly suggestive of spinon deconfinement that is characteristic of spin liquids . \n a variety of theoretical approaches have been employed to capture spin liquids on the triangular lattice . \n kalmeyer and laughlin exploited a mapping between the spin-1/2 heisenberg model and hard - core bosons in a magnetic field to obtain a `` chiral '' spin liquid which breaks time - reversal symmetry.@xcite their arguments were subsequently reformulated by yang _ et al_.,@xcite who arrived at the chiral spin liquid by fermionizing the spins using chern - simons flux attachment@xcite and expanding around a `` flux - smeared '' mean - field state . using a slave - boson representation of the spin operators , sachdev explored an sp(@xmath3 ) generalization of the heisenberg model , and in the large-@xmath3 limit obtained a z@xmath4 spin liquid ground state , which breaks no symmetries.@xcite the z@xmath4 spin liquid was later realized microscopically in a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice.@xcite finally , a large class of spin liquids was studied by zhou and wen using a slave fermion representation of the spins.@xcite whereas excitations in both the chiral and z@xmath4 spin liquids are gapped , the slave fermion mean - field approach can give rise to so called `` algebraic spin liquids '' , which admit _ gapless _ spin excitations and power - law spin correlations .    in this paper \n we pursue an alternate approach to the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet , and use vortex duality to attack the problem coming from the easy - plane regime . \n duality has been a powerful tool for exploring unconventional phases such as valence bond solids and spin liquids in quantum spin systems,@xcite as well as complex charge - ordered states in bosonic systems . \n the main difficulty here is that vortices are at finite density , which is familiar from dual approaches to the fractional quantum hall problem . as an initial step towards applying duality to frustrated spin systems , in ref . \n we examined integer - spin triangular antiferromagnets with easy - plane symmetry from the vortex perspective . by _ fermionizing _ \n the vortices using chern - simons flux attachment , it was shown that an effective low - energy dual formulation can be derived , which was argued to reproduce the physics of a more direct landau - ginzburg - wilson analysis of the spin model . while this approach is reminiscent of the spin fermionization adopted by yang _ \n et al_.,@xcite we emphasize that alternatively fermionizing vortices is advantageous because the vortices interact logarithmically , which allows for a more controllable treatment of chern - simons gauge fluctuations . \n here we extend the fermionized vortex approach to the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet with easy - plane symmetry and anisotropic nearest - neighbor exchanges @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shown in fig . \n [ lattice ] . \n this formalism allows us to explore the phase diagram of the spin model in a setting where a more conventional landau analysis of the spin model is _ not _ accessible due to berry phases . \n remarkably , over a broad range of anisotropy @xmath7 this approach leads naturally , with the simplest flux - smeared mean - field starting point , to a novel `` critical '' spin liquid that we will refer to as the algebraic vortex liquid . \n this state was introduced earlier and applied to  in a short letter , ref .  , and is characterized in detail here . \n schematically , vortices form a critical state with four dirac nodes , and interact via a fluctuating gauge field representing the original boson current fluctuations . already on the mean - field level \n , the gapless character of the vortex state implies power - law @xmath8 and @xmath9 spin correlations at specific wave vectors shown in figs . \n [ bilinearqs ] and [ monopoleqs ] , respectively . \n such momenta for low - energy excitations in the spin system are determined by short - distance physics in the frustrated magnet , and we propose that this physics is well - captured in the vortex treatment .    going beyond a mean - field analysis , we argue that the algebraic vortex liquid is described by qed3 with an emergent global su(4 ) flavor symmetry , which has further implications for the dynamical spin correlations . in particular , as a consequence of the su(4 ) symmetry \n the in - plane spin structure factor exhibits enhanced universal power law correlations with the _ same exponent _ at several momenta in the brillouin zone : the spiral ordering wave vectors @xmath10 and momenta @xmath11 at the midpoints of the brillouin zone edges ( see fig . \n [ monopoleqs ] ) . \n the out - of - plane spin structure factor meanwhile has enhanced correlations only at the spiral ordering wave vectors @xmath12 . \n these nontrivial properties distinguish the algebraic vortex liquid from other known spin liquids . \n interestingly , the prominence of momenta @xmath13 in the theory appears to be consistent with recent series expansion studies of the heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet@xcite , which observe excitation energies at these wave vectors which are dramatically reduced relative to linear spin wave theory . \n moreover , the prediction of `` active '' momenta @xmath10 and @xmath14 in the anisotropic system seems to capture the neutron scattering data for .@xcite    the phase diagram in the vicinity of the algebraic vortex liquid is also explored , and found to be rather rich . \n nearby phases include the kalmeyer - laughlin chiral spin liquid , numerous magnetically ordered states including the coplanar spiral state , and variants of supersolids discussed recently.@xcite    in the range of anisotropy @xmath15 , our treatment captures the `` square - lattice '' neel ordered state , which is the expected ground state in this regime@xcite . here , we demonstrate in a particularly clear setting that anomalous `` roton '' minima in the excitation spectrum observed by series expansion studies can indeed be accounted for as low energy vortex - antivortex excitations.@xcite we further predict that these low - energy rotons may have still more dramatic effects in the easy - plane regime , which would be useful to explore using series expansions . \n the paper is organized as follows . the spin model and the dual vortex mapping \n are introduced in sec . \n ii . in sec .  iii the fermionized vortex theory is developed . \n we first discuss the `` roton '' excitations in the neel phase arising when @xmath15 . \n we then obtain a low - energy effective theory for @xmath7 which contains a description of the algebraic vortex liquid . \n iv focuses on the properties of the algebraic vortex liquid , including its stability , symmetries , and dynamic spin correlations . \n the proximate phases of the algebraic vortex liquid are explored in sec . \n v , and we conclude with a discussion in sec .  vi . \n we begin by considering an easy - plane , anisotropic spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet modeled by an xxz hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor exchange , @xmath16 +      \\sum_{\\langle{\\bf r r'}\\rangle}j^z_{\\bf r r ' } s^z_{\\bf r } s^z_{\\bf r ' } ,     \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the usual spin raising and lowering operators . as illustrated in fig . \n [ lattice ] , we take the in - plane exchange energy to be @xmath18 along bold horizontal links and @xmath19 along diagonal links of the triangular lattice . the out - of - plane exchange is defined to be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 to satisfy the easy - plane condition .    it is convenient to work with the easy - plane spin model recast in terms of quantum rotors by introducing an integer - valued boson number @xmath22 and its conjugate phase @xmath23 . upon identifying @xmath24 and @xmath25 , \n the hamiltonian reads @xmath26 the @xmath27 term above energetically enforces the constraint of having either 0 or 1 boson per site as required for modeling a spin-1/2 system . \n the xxz hamiltonian @xmath28 respects a number of internal and discrete lattice symmetries which we now enumerate . \n the model exhibits u(1 ) spin symmetry and is invariant under time reversal @xmath29 and a `` particle - hole '' transformation @xmath30 which sends @xmath31 . under these operations , \n the rotor fields transform as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant and @xmath29 is an antiunitary operation which sends @xmath34 . \n the model also preserves translations @xmath35 by triangular lattice vectors @xmath36 , as well as @xmath37-reflections @xmath38 and inversions ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 rotations ) @xmath40 about a triangular lattice site . rather than considering the @xmath37-reflections @xmath38 , it will be useful for subsequent developments to work with a modified antiunitary reflection @xmath41 . \n the latter operations transform the rotor fields as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an appropriately reflected coordinate . in the isotropic limit @xmath44 , \n the xxz hamiltonian additionally preserves @xmath45 rotations @xmath46 about a triangular lattice site ; @xmath47 is then no longer an independent symmetry since @xmath48 .    in this paper \n we are interested in exploring the phase diagram accessible with the above xxz spin model as a starting point . in particular , as the low spin and geometric frustration strongly suppress the tendency to magnetically order , it is natural to ask whether spin - liquid phases can be realized with not too drastic perturbations to the model . \n to this end , we would like to derive an effective theory that governs the low - energy behavior of the spin system . \n this is , for instance , readily achieved for the integer - spin analogue of eq . \n ( [ h ] ) , and the phase diagram can be explored within a standard landau analysis . however , for the spin-1/2 system studied here a similar direct analysis of the spin model is hindered by the presence of berry phases . \n consequently , obtaining a low - energy theory is largely intractable in this formulation .    to proceed we utilize an alternative dual approach , introduced in the context of integer - spin systems in ref .   , wherein one considers a reformulation of the problem in terms of _ \n fermionized vortices_. in this framework , the basic degrees of freedom one works with are vortices  topological defects in which the phases @xmath23 of the spins wind by @xmath49 around a triangular plaquette as in fig . \n [ lattice]rather than the spins themselves . \n although the vortices as defined are bosonic , it will prove extremely useful to fermionize them in a manner familiar from the fractional quantum hall effect via chern - simons flux attachment . \n doing so enables us to obtain a low - energy dual theory , which as we will demonstrate leads naturally to a novel `` critical '' spin - liquid phase , the algebraic vortex liquid . \n we proceed now to the dual vortex theory . \n we forgo the details of the duality mapping as these are provided in sec . \n iii of ref .   in a very similar setting , and instead emphasize the important physical aspects of the dual theory . implementing the duality transformation on the quantum rotor hamiltonian eq . \n ( [ hrotor]),@xcite one obtains a theory of bosonic vortices with `` electromagnetic '' interactions hopping among sites of the dual honeycomb lattice depicted by the dashed lines in fig . \n [ lattice ] . \n the vortices interact via a `` vector potential '' @xmath50 and a conjugate `` electric field '' @xmath51 which reside on honeycomb links and mediate a logarithmic vortex repulsion . here \n @xmath52 denote nearest - neighbor honeycomb sites . \n ( throughout , we distinguish sites of the honeycomb and triangular lattices by the labels `` @xmath53 '' and `` @xmath54 , '' respectively . ) \n these dual gauge fields satisfy the commutation relation @xmath55 = i$ ] and commute on different links . in - plane spin components are encoded in this formulation through the `` electric field '' and the vortices . \n the @xmath8 component of spin meanwhile appears as a dual `` magnetic flux , '' @xmath56 where @xmath57 signifies a lattice curl of @xmath58 around the hexagon encircling site @xmath54 of the triangular lattice . \n although @xmath58 roams over the real numbers , the desired half - integer values of @xmath8 in eq . \n ( [ sz ] ) are imposed energetically in the dual theory .    in terms of a vortex number operator @xmath59 and vortex creation operator @xmath60 \n , the dual vortex hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath61 together with a gauss s law constraint for the `` electric field '' , @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a static gauge field satisfying @xmath64 , and @xmath65 denotes a lattice divergence of @xmath51 at site @xmath53 . \n moreover , @xmath66 describes the gauge field dynamics , @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 on the bold zigzag honeycomb links in fig .   [ lattice ] while @xmath71 on vertical honeycomb links .    the cosine term in eq . \n ( [ hdual ] ) describes nearest - neighbor vortex hopping in an average background of @xmath39 flux per hexagon . \n this background `` magnetic flux '' is provided by the static gauge field @xmath63 and arises because @xmath8 is half - integer valued in the original spin model . \n ( the average background flux for an integer spin system , in contrast , is trivial.@xcite ) the hopping amplitudes @xmath72 are chosen to be anisotropic to reflect the spin exchange anisotropy . \n in particular , as illustrated in fig . \n [ lattice ] we take @xmath73 on the bold zigzag links of the honeycomb and @xmath74 on vertical links , with @xmath75 since vortices hop more easily across weak spin links than strong spin links \n .    an important feature of the dual theory is that with our conventions@xcite the bosonic vortices are at _ half - filling _ , which is a direct consequence of the underlying frustration in the spin model . \n for example , in the classical @xmath0 spin - ordered state we define the vortex number to be one on `` up '' triangles and zero on `` down '' triangles ( or vice versa , depending on the chirality ) . \n the half - filling of the vortices becomes manifest upon reexpressing the dual hamiltonian in terms of an _ unconstrained _ electric field as follows , @xmath76 where @xmath77 encodes the logarithmic vortex repulsion . \n equation ( [ hdual2 ] ) clearly exhibits a vortex particle - hole symmetry . \n the transformation properties of the dual fields under the discrete microscopic symmetries can be straightforwardly deduced as discussed in ref .   . \n these are summarized in table [ tab : dual ] . \n the continuous u(1 ) spin symmetry , which reflects conservation of @xmath8 , is not directly manifest in this formulation and is instead replaced by a conservation of dual gauge flux , @xmath78 . \n additionally , the dual hamiltonian has a u(1 ) gauge redundancy , being invariant under @xmath79 and @xmath80 for arbitrary @xmath81 . \n .[tab : dual ] transformation properties of fields in the dual bosonic - vortex formulation under the discrete microscopic symmetries \n . the lattice coordinates , which also transform appropriately under the lattice symmetries , have been suppressed on all fields for brevity .

based transit surveys @xcite , and corot@xcite and kepler@xcite have performed space - based transit surveys . moreover , the second epoch mission of kepler , namely k2@xcite , is now ongoing , and next generation space missions tess@xcite and plato@xcite have been approved to be launched around 2017 and 2024 , respectively . \n the biggest problem for transit surveys , especially for ground - based ones , is commingling of false positives with candidates of transiting planets . \n the cause of false positives of transiting planets are eclipsing binaries , as they mimic planetary transits by grazing or by being mixed in another bright star s brightness . \n thus it is important to conduct follow - up observations after transit surveys in order to validate candidates as true planets by eliminating false positives . \n high precision multi - color transit photometry is known to be useful for such follow - up observations to discriminate whether transit - like dimming is caused by a true planet or by an eclipsing binary @xcite . \n this is because a true planet is almost dark in all wavelength , while an intervening body of an eclipsing binary is bright itself and its brightness changes significantly with wavelength . \n thus false positives caused by eclipsing binaries can be spotted by observing significant wavelength dependence in transit depths . \n on the other hand , transit depths of a true planet also have wavelength dependence . \n most of the wavelength dependence comes from the stellar limb - darkening , but the apparent planetary radius also has weak wavelength dependence which reflects the nature of its planetary atmosphere . \n high precision multi - color transit photometry is known to be useful to measure the weak wavelength dependence in transit depths to study atmospheres of transiting planets . \n this kind of study is known as transmission spectroscopy , and numbers of multi - color transit observations for this purpose have been reported so far . \n multi - color simultaneous cameras are very fruitful for the studies described above for two reasons . \n first , multi - color simultaneous cameras provide not only higher efficiency but also more feasibility to accomplish aimed studies than single - color cameras , since observable transits from a specific ground site are very limited . \n second , simultaneity of multi - color transit photometry is important to avoid systematic differences of transit depths due to luminosity change in host stars possibly caused by existence of starspots , plages , stellar activity , and so on . \n for the reasons , multi - color simultaneous cameras such as grond , busca@xcite , ultracam@xcite , sirius@xcite , and mitsume@xcite have been actively used for transit observations . \n considering the fact that more interesting transiting planets will be discovered in the near future by advanced ground - based surveys , and also space - based surveys , like k2 , tess , and plato , developments of new multi - color simultaneous cameras are highly desired . \n we here report a development of such an astronomical instrument named muscat ( multi - color simultaneous camera for studying atmospheres of transiting planets ) , which is now installed on the 188 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) in japan . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows . \n we first describe designs of the optical system of muscat and its components ( sec . \n [ sect : design ] ) , and introduce the control system of muscat ( sec . \n [ sect : control ] ) . \n we then report characteristics and performances of muscat shown in engineering observations ( sec . \n [ sect : test ] ) . \n we discuss on some capabilities for future upgrade of muscat ( sec . \n [ sect : discussions ] ) , and finally summarize this paper ( sec . \n [ sect : summary ] ) . \n we have designed muscat considering the following conditions . as we plan to use muscat for validations of transiting planets discovered by transit surveys , at least 2 colors are necessary to discriminate eclipsing binaries from transiting planets . \n considering the cost and available research grants , we adopt a design for a 3-color simultaneous camera with the 3 colors in optical wavelength where ccds are sensitive . for transit observations , it is important to obtain good comparison stars in the field of view ( fov ) to achieve high precision transit photometry . for the reason , we have designed the muscat fov as wide as possible for the 188 cm telescope . \n we have also took care of the throughput ( tp ) of the instrument to achieve high photometric precision . to achieve higher sensitivity to the utmost extent , \n we have carefully selected and designed the muscat optical system including astronomical bandpass filters , dichroic mirrors , and ccds .", "StartTimeOffset": 1467425507886, "RequestID": "9b9237bc9a4f99e00ee2e97ed2e78a60118e0ff6", "TotalTokens": 1463}

public information about knowable people and its primary attribute is proliferation . \n gossiping is a communicative propensity characteristic of the human race manifesting itself in smaller communities '' . \n then , the person who is the subject of the gossip is known personally to the community . \n this fact makes the gossip interesting and this interest is the necessary condition of the gossip spreading . \n this `` semiprivate '' character makes our case different from the theory of rumor by galam @xcite . the experiment @xcite dealt with an interest in gossip about a known or knowable person in a web - based social network . as a result \n , three levels of social inclusion have been found , which practically limited the gossip spreading . as a sample of the questionnaire , \n answers were gathered to the following :    1 . \n would you tell about your girlfriend s new job to your friend ? 2 . \n would you tell about your girlfriend s new job to your friend s girlfriend ? \n would you tell about your girlfriend s new job to your friend s girlfriend s colleague ?    the percentage @xmath7 of positive answers varied from @xmath8 through @xmath9 till @xmath10 , respectively for questions 1 , 2 and 3 . \n after the third degree the results had shown a sharp decline @xcite . \n these considerations led us to our main question , under what conditions a given gossip will be known in the whole community ? \n the above numbers @xmath7 ( @xmath11 ) served us as probabilities , that the gossip will be told to people of 1-st , 2-nd and 3-rd level of inclusion , defined by the questionnaire . at this point \n we are faced with the as - yet - unsolved problem , what is the structure of the social network ? \n we have to admit that the answer varies from one kind of network to another , one or another kind of social ties . in the literature of the subject \n , one can find arguments about different parameters of social networks : size from a hundred to three hundreds and more @xcite , clustering coefficient @xcite , strength of ties @xcite and structure @xcite . \n the results can depend also on whether complete networks or personal networks are investigated @xcite . \n when we speak on friendly personal networks , the size of a typical group can decrease by at least one order of magnitude @xcite . \n not entering these discussions , here we attack the problem of gossip spreading in a model way , where the average number of friends is a model parameter . \n also , for simplicity we choose the random graph of erds and rnyi @xcite as a model of a social network . \n this selection should serve as a useful point of reference . \n the goal of this paper is to calculate the probability that the gossip is known , averaged over the community members . \n basically , the result is close to zero or one , except some range of the average number of friendship ties . \n this range can be seen as the range of a transition between two phases : `` they do not know '' and `` they know '' . \n however , even if the width of this range eventually shrinks to zero in the limit of large networks , this limit is not relevant for social sciences , where the quality of useful approximations does not necessarily increase with the system size .    in next section \n we describe the model calculations and the results . \n last section is devoted to their discussion . \n from noted above , the following model assumptions emerge :    1 .   the set of nodes are those who `` know about '' , and that is why they are willing to hear . \n the links join two nodes if they are friends . \n the linkage is random , as in the erds  rnyi model . \n 4 .   the question is to evaluate the size of the group who will know the information . \n the detail is if the victim of the gossip is also a member of the network in which gossip is spread . \n the argument for this assumption is in the questionnaire `` about your girlfriend s new job '' . in this case \n the talker role is to be limited to the set of boyfriends of the girl . \n however , we assume that the girl can have more boyfriends , and then the number of talkers can be greater than one .    in this case \n we have two parameters : @xmath1 ( the number of nodes ) and @xmath2 ( the probability of a link of friendship between randomly selected nodes ) . as we know from the theory of random networks \n @xcite , the mean degree is @xmath12 . \n the numbers @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be interpreted as weights in the average level of being informed about a given gossip . \n all friends of the girl who got a job will know it with probability one ( @xmath16 ) . \n this is a contribution @xmath17 . \n their friends ( each has @xmath18 still not informed ) will know the gossip with probability @xmath14 . \n this is a contribution @xmath19 . \n finally , consider friends of the friends ( supposed they are not informed yet ) . \n if each friend has @xmath18 uninformed friends , the information will pass to them from the teller with , say , probability @xmath20 . \n then , total level @xmath0 of being informed on the gossip would be @xmath21 this is a function of @xmath1 and @xmath22 . \n this expression has some deficiency : in the random networks the probability that two `` friends '' of a node are also `` friends '' is @xmath23 . in the above calculation \n , we disregarded this possibility . \n now we are going to include it . in the first zone , \n @xmath17 friends are informed with probability @xmath13 . \n each has @xmath24 neighbors , @xmath2 of them are already informed . \n then , newly informed are only @xmath25 next neighbors , and their contribution will be @xmath26 . \n how many still non - informed neighbors have these @xmath27 people ? \n the answer is that each has @xmath28 \n . they will be informed by a teller with probability @xmath15 . \n then , their contribution is @xmath29 . \n the total formula is : @xmath30 we note that still there are some assumptions left about the lack of correlations of further order , the arguments are somewhat heuristic , and valid only for small @xmath2 . \n however , @xmath0 obviously increases with @xmath2 . in the range where the formula is not valid ( large @xmath2 ) we rely on a computer simulation .    for given victim of the gossip @xmath31 ( one of @xmath1 nodes constituting network ) and all @xmath32 of its nearest neighbors ( talkers ) \n we evaluate the number @xmath33 [ @xmath34 of paths of length @xmath35 [ @xmath36 from all other nodes @xmath37 to talkers . the probability that @xmath37-th node _ is not _ informed is @xmath38 then , the level @xmath39 of being informed on the gossip for given victim @xmath31 is @xmath40 where summation goes over all @xmath41 and @xmath37 is not a talker . \n the total level @xmath0 of being informed of the gossip is averaged over all possible victims of the gossip in the given network @xmath42 we carry out our simulation for the set of probabilities @xmath16 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . \n it appears ( fig . \n [ fig -

opening ) to above set of eqns . can be easily found as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 . \n a general formulation of elastic surfaces was given by gurtin and murdoch @xcite . \n following @xcite , in the presence of surface elasticity / tension effects , the equation of equilibrium in the bulk remain unchanged ( i.e. same as eq . \n ( [ eq : bulk ] ) ) while the boundary conditions at a free surface are changed from @xmath14 to :    @xmath15    here @xmath16 denote surface stress tensor while @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are surface elastic moduli . \n if the normal to the surface lies along direction 2 , then latin subscripts @xmath20 range over 1,2,3 while greek subscripts \n @xmath21 range over only the directions lying along the surface viz . 1 and 3 . the derivatives such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 employed in the above eqns . \n are surface derivatives i.e. projection of usual derivatives along the surface . \n note that @xmath24 is linear in surface strain @xmath25 where @xmath26 . \n we switch to cartesian coordinates for a while for sake of mathematical convenience . along the crack \n faces ( @xmath27 ) , the negative @xmath28 axis coincides with @xmath29 for @xmath30 . \n substituting @xmath31 in above equations    @xmath32    taking surface divergence of @xmath24 one obtains @xmath33 where @xmath34 . \n the first term arises because the constant part of surface stress in eq . \n ( [ eq : surfstress ] ) drops abruptly to zero at the crack tip . its effect on stress fields \n was solved for many years ago by thomson et al @xcite who showed that such terms lead to @xmath35 singularity in stresses at the crack - tip . \n as we are concerned with the effect of surface elasticity and not surface tension in this work and since the overall field can be found as superposition of the fields due to both terms individually , we drop the first term in above eqn . keeping this in mind , the above eqn . in @xmath36 \n coordinates may be written as @xmath37    eqn . \n ( [ eq : bulk ] ) in conjunction with  ( [ eq : bc1wel ] ) and  ( [ eq : bc2wel ] ) completes the specification of boundary value problem for our problem . \n we were unable to find a straightforward method to solve this set of equations \n . we will solve for @xmath38 as a series expansion in terms of the parameter @xmath39 . \n we make the assumption @xmath40 . \n next write @xmath41 as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is given by  ( [ eq : w_on1 ] ) . throughout our analysis \n we assume that @xmath40 . \n since @xmath44 s are independent , each must satisfy the equation @xmath45 in the bulk and the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc1wel ] ) ,  ( [ eq : bc2wel ] ) individually . \n thus one gets the following set of equations    @xmath46    for all @xmath47 , and @xmath48    where upper sign stands for @xmath49 and lower for @xmath50 . substituting for @xmath43 from  ( [ eq : w_on1 ] ) in  ( [ eq : g_1n ] ) and solving for @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an arbitrary coefficient . \n since the loading due to surface elasticity is symmetric ( note the sign change in boundary condition at @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , all the terms containing @xmath3 should be symmetric in @xmath56 . \n therefore @xmath57 . \n thus the terms containing @xmath3 do not contribute to the crack opening displacement but the stress field is necessarily altered due to surface elasticity . substituting the expression for @xmath51 in  ( [ eq : g_2n ] ) @xmath58 again by the same argument @xmath59 \n is seen to be identically equal to zero . \n it immediately follows that @xmath60 . \n thus the perturbative solution is @xmath61 \n from equations  ( [ eq : w_tot1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : pert1 ] ) one observes that the displacement diverges if we include the term @xmath62 . as and \n ruina @xcite have shown through their analysis that one needs to be careful while discarding non-@xmath0 singular(and non - singular ) terms for crack problems . \n in fact , such terms are always present if one take a more realistic situation where there is a nonlinear zone @xmath63 surrounding the crack as shown in figure 2 . here \n we do an analysis similar to @xcite to determine the condition for small - scale yielding in the presence of surface effects .     the specimen ] \n assume that the nonelastic zone is centered at the origin @xmath64 and has dimensions smaller than the crack length @xmath65 . \n we now consider a completely elastic problem in the domain @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the outermost radius of @xmath63 . \n the traction at the inner radius @xmath68 is taken as @xmath69 together with the loading @xmath70 at @xmath71 . the antisymmetric solution to the elastic problem in the absence of surface effects \n can now be found as @xmath72 where @xmath13 and @xmath73 . \n following the notation of @xcite , the above field can be expressed as a sum of two terms : @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 stands for _ _ a__ntisymmetric , _ _ i__nner traction free and @xmath77 for _ _ a__ntisymmetric , _ _ \n o__uter traction free . for sake of completeness \n we write the expressions for these fields :    @xmath78    with @xmath73 , and @xmath79 with @xmath80 , and@xmath81 with @xmath82 , in the presence of surface effects the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc1woel ] ) ,  ( [ eq : bc2woel ] ) remain unchanged except that now our domain is @xmath83 . \n following exactly the same strategy as before , we obtain the following perturbative solution :    @xmath84    from this , the stress fields are readily obtained ,    @xmath85    and    @xmath86    from above equation the condition for @xmath0 ( @xmath87 term ) field dominance can be determined . \n comparing the total stress field due to @xmath0 field to that of next singular @xmath88 term one obtains the following expression for the region in which @xmath0 field dominates :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 it immediately follows from above eqn . that when @xmath91 , the k - dominance region diminishes in its radius by @xmath92 while for the case when @xmath93 the @xmath88 term always dominates the @xmath0 term as it does in the absence of surface elasticity . \n to put our analysis in perspective , many articles pertaining to effect of surface stress on crack field solutions have appeared in the past @xcite . \n the main difference with our work is that we have considered surface stress @xmath94 as having linear ( and thus surface energy quadratic ) dependence on surface strain @xmath95 instead of being independent of it . as mentioned earlier that a constant surface stress leads to @xmath96 singularity for a mode-3 crack @xcite . \n we have shown that the linear term causes a @xmath97 singularity at the crack - tip for @xmath98 . \n physically speaking , non-@xmath0 singular terms due to surface elasticity should be dominant only in the region of extent @xmath99 . \n indeed we see from eq . \n ( [ eq : region ] ) that surface elasticity decreases the extent of @xmath0-dominant region by @xmath100 .    though we are not aware of any direct experimental evidence which favors a quadratic dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath95 over a linear one , miller et al @xcite showed that a quadratic dependence was consistent with atomistic simulations for simple problems of elongation , bending and torsion . \n note that the variable @xmath94 , which is responsible for size - dependent elastic properties in @xcite , has same significance as @xmath3 in this article under gurtin - murdoch s formalism @xcite . \n finally , the green s function obtained by thomson et al @xcite for symmetric dipole acting along a mode-3 crack s surface may also be used for obtaining the results in this article but since in our problem the loading itself is dependent on the displacement field , we found it more expedient to directly solve the equations of elasticity instead of a solving a singular integro - differential equation .", "StartTimeOffset": 1484360851482, "RequestID": "4743f5c21b87975158c0e1f06d4cbdf5d056171e", "TotalTokens": 2484}

shifted optical jet component was discovered by @xcite . \n the optical visibility of @xmath4  oph  102 suggests that the source corresponds to a class ii object @xcite in the star formation phase , a class with an accreting circumstellar disk and the protostar at this stage is the so - called classical t tauri star . \n we have observed iso - oph  102 with the receiver band at 230  ghz of the sma @xcite . \n both 2 ghz - wide sidebands which are separated by 10 ghz were used . \n the sma correlator was configured with high spectral resolution bands of 512 channels per chunk of 104  mhz for @xmath5co , @xmath6co , and c@xmath7o @xmath8 lines , giving a channel spacing of 0.27  km  s@xmath9 \n . a lower resolution of 3.25  mhz per channel was set up for the remainder of each sideband . \n the quasars 1625@xmath10254 and 3c  279 have been observed for gain and passband calibration , respectively . \n mars were used for flux calibration . \n the data were calibrated using the mir software package and further analysis was carried out with the miriad package adapted for the sma . \n the compact configuration was used , resulting a synthesized beam of 3@xmath11.60  @xmath12  2@xmath11.43 with a position angle of 8.5@xmath13 . \n the rms ( root mean square ) sensitivity was about 3  mjy for the continuum , using both sidebands and @xmath140.2  jy  beam@xmath9 per channel for the line data . the primary fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) beam is about 55@xmath11  at the observed frequencies . \n the integrated flux density from the dust continuum emission was 7@xmath153  mjy measured at the brown dwarf position . \n an overlay of a near - infrared image and the integrated intensity in the carbon monoxide ( co @xmath16 ) line emission is shown in figure 1 . \n two spatially resolved blue- and red - shifted co components are symmetrically displaced on opposite sides of the brown dwarf position , with the size of each lobe of about 8@xmath11 corresponding to 1000  au in length . \n this is similar to the typical pattern of bipolar molecular outflows as seen in young stars @xcite . \n the two outflow components with a wide range of velocity ( figure 2 ) suggests a bow shock structure , an effect of the interaction between the jet propagation and the ambient material , which appears very similar to the bow shock phenomena as seen in young stars @xcite . \n such a co outflow morphology suggests that the jet - driven bow shock model ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be at work in @xmath4  oph  102 . \n following the standard manner @xcite , we calculate the outflow properties . \n we use a value of 35  k @xcite for the excitation temperature , and we derive a lower limit to the outflow mass of @xmath17 . if we correct for optical depth with a typical value of 5 @xcite , we obtain an upper limit to the outflow mass of @xmath0 . this value is smaller than the ones observed in young stars @xcite by three orders of magnitude . \n to estimate the outflow inclination , we combine our sma data with archival infrared data of the spitzer space telescope . for the infrared photometry \n , we use the archival basic calibrated data ( pids : 58 , 177 ) that were reduced with iraf to measure flux densities . \n disk modeling is performed as the previous works ( see @xcite and references therein ) . \n the circumstellar geometry consists of a rotationally flattened infalling envelope , bipolar cavities , and a flared accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium . \n the disk density is proportional to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radial coordinate in the disk midplane , and @xmath20 is the radial density exponent . \n the disk scale height increases with radius , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the scale height at @xmath23 ( the brown dwarf radius ) and @xmath24 is the flaring power . \n stellar parameters are obtained from @xcite , and an accretion rate of @xmath25  yr@xmath9 is used . \n the nextgen @xcite atmosphere file for an effective temperature @xmath26 of 2700  k , and log _ g _ = 3.5 , where @xmath27 is the surface gravity , is used to fit the atmosphere spectrum of the central sub - stellar source . \n the disk shows some flaring longward of @xmath1410 @xmath28 m , and the best model - fit was obtained using a disk mass of @xmath2 , an inclination angle between 63@xmath13 and 66@xmath13 , an outer disk radius of 80 au , and an inner disk radius equal to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the dust sublimation radius : 1  @xmath29@xmath30 . \n there is thus no inner hole in the disk as it would have to be larger than @xmath29 . \n the outer disk radius and the disk mass are well - constrained by the millimeter observations . a more face - on inclination \n can be ruled out as it results in larger - than - observed mid- and far - infrared fluxes . \n figure 3 presents the best fit from the disk modeling obtained using a disk mass of @xmath2 , an inclination angle between 63@xmath13 and 66@xmath13 , an outer disk radius of 80 au , resulting in a projected disk radius of 32 - 36 au . \n this immediately explains the non - detection of the red - shifted optical jet component , estimated to be about 15  au in length as reported in the previous observation @xcite . \n since the projected disk radius is larger than the jet length , the disk therefore hides the red - shifted jet component from our view . \n we use the observed maximum flow velocity of 2.2 km  s@xmath9 and apply a correction for the outflow inclination to compute upper limit values for the kinematic and dynamic parameters . \n we find that the momentum is @xmath31@xmath32  km  s@xmath9 , the energy is @xmath33@xmath32  km@xmath34  s@xmath35 , the force is @xmath36@xmath32  km  s@xmath9  yr@xmath9 , and the mechanical luminosity is @xmath37  l@xmath38 , where l@xmath38 is the solar luminosity . a correction for the optical depth factor of 5 and a missing flux factor of 3 for \n sma @xcite will increase these upper limit values by a factor of 15 . using the lower value of the outflow mass and a correction factor of 10 applied for the outflow duration time @xcite \n , we derive the outflow mass - loss rate of @xmath39@xmath32  yr@xmath9 , which is smaller than a typical value for t tauri stars @xcite by two orders of magnitude . \n one should note that these values are roughly estimated , depending on the correction factor values used in the calculation . \n one should also note that the outflow mass and the mass loss rate values from iso - oph 102 appear similar to that from l1014-irs @xcite , suggesting that they share the same origin . \n however as clearly stated in @xcite l1014-irs could be an embedded protostar or a proto - brown dwarf , corresponding to the earliest stages of star or brown dwarf formation processes , respectively . \n more observations are needed to confirm the l1014-irs nature and study the connection between iso - oph 102 and l1014-irs in the whole formation phase . \n we also examine the possibility that the emission might be due to bound motions and not outflow emission . \n this would require an interior mass @xcite of 2.7@xmath32 for an outflow size of 1000  au with a velocity of 2.2  km  s@xmath9 , which is significant larger than the core mass of @xmath40  @xmath32 within the same radius @xcite . \n we therefore conclude that the detected emission is from the outflow . \n the irs infrared ( 7.5 - 14.3 @xmath28 m ) @xcite spectra of iso - oph  102 whose the basic - calibrated data were downloaded from the spitzer archive ( pid : 3499 ) and reduced using the smart software package @xcite are also analyzed . \n it is worthy to note here that the mid - infrared spectrum of iso - oph  102 shows crystalline silicate features : enstatite ( mgsio@xmath41 ) at 9.3  @xmath28 m and very strong forsterite ( mg@xmath42sio@xmath43 ) at 11.3  @xmath28 m ( see figure 4 ) . \n the brown dwarf is indeed an analog of sst - lup3 - 1 , which is an m5.5 brown dwarf in the lupus iii dark cloud @xcite . \n the crystalline contribution to the silicate feature ( flux at 11.3 @xmath28 m over flux at 9.8 @xmath28 m ) in iso - oph  102 is 1.1 , even greater than the value of 0.9 in sst - lup3 - 1 @xcite . \n this provides a direct evidence of grain growth and dust settling , indicating the object is in the transition phase between the class ii and iii ( a class with an optically thin disk ) and the brown dwarf is reaching the final mass . \n here , we report the first confirmed detection of the bipolar molecular outflow in young brown dwarfs . we characterize the fundamental properties of the outflow with the first insight on its morphology . \n the results indicate that the bipolar molecular outflow in brown dwarfs is very similar to outflows as seen in young stars but scaled down by three and two orders of magnitude for the outflow mass and the mass - loss rate , respectively . \n we demonstrate for the first time that brown dwarfs , even young planetary mass objects @xcite can launch a bipolar molecular outflow , and hence we confirm that they are likely to have a common origin with the low - mass stars . \n this suggests that the terminal stellar / brown dwarf mass is not due to different formation mechanisms , but more likely due to the initial mass of the cloud core . \n we also show that there is evidence for dust crystallization in the disk around the brown dwarf . in brown dwarfs \n the molecular outflows may be longer lived than in low - mass stars and they coexist with grain growth and crystallization . \n outflows from brown dwarfs may play a crucial role in sweeping out gas from the disk and favouring the formation of rocky planets . \n np -

[ 1 ] report that the line emission observed in the keck ii spectra is consistent with constancy between their may 11 and june 5 observations . over this same period \n , the continuum emission has faded . \n this suggests that a host galaxy of relatively weak continuum emission may be present at the observed redshift of @xmath4 [ 2 ] . \n grb afterglows are believed to be described by the relativistic blast - wave model [ 5 - 13 ] . \n furthermore , the afterglow of grb 970228 , the only other grb for which sufficient afterglow information is available , has been shown to be compatible with this model [ 14,11,15 - 17,13 ] . \n a basic prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model is that after an initial period of increasing optical flux , lasting hours to days , the optical flux of the afterglow will decrease as a power - law of index @xmath9 . during this period of declining optical flux , \n the optical spectrum will be described by a power - law of index @xmath10 ( e.g. , [ 15 ] ) . however , in the case of grb 970508 , @xmath11 [ 18 ] , which is inconsistent with the relativistic blast - wave model .    in  2 , \n i show that the reported grb 970508 optical afterglow measurements , once corrected for galactic absorption , are inconsistent with this prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model unless a second , redshifted source of extinction is introduced . \n this second source of extinction may be the yet unobserved host galaxy . \n i determine its redshift and i estimate its hydrogen column density along the line of sight . \n an observing strategy for future optical afterglow observations is recommended in  3 . \n as of 1997 november 3 , @xmath12 70 optical and near - infrared measurements of the grb 970508 afterglow have been reported . \n these measurements span @xmath12 80 days , the earliest of which was taken @xmath7 4 hours after the grb event . \n although the photometry is generally quite good , with quoted errors that are often less than 0.1 mag , zero - point errors are evident between different observing groups in various bands . \n consequently , i consider only the largest self - consistent subset of these data : sokolov et al . \n [ 18 ] report 22 optical measurements ( b , v , r@xmath13 , and i@xmath13 bands ) taken with a 6-m telescope between @xmath7 2 days and @xmath7 31 days after the grb event . \n all of these measurements were taken after the optical flux had peaked (  1 ) , also @xmath7 2 days after the grb event . \n i have corrected these measurements for galactic absorption using the iras 100 @xmath14 m v - band absorption measure of rowan - robinson et al . [ \n 19 ] and the interstellar absorption curve [ 20,21 ] . \n the v - band correction is @xmath15 mag . \n i use the absorption measure of rowan - robinson et al . , which measures the dust directly , instead of measures of the hydrogen column density , i.e. [ 22 - 24 ] , since the iras 100 @xmath14 m flux about the location of grb 970508 varies significantly on angular scales that are smaller than the scales over which these measures of the hydrogen column density are averaged . \n the corrected measurements are plotted in figure 1 . \n psfig    the following model is now @xmath16-fitted to these corrected measurements : @xmath17 the first term is the extinction - free prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model (  1 ) . \n the second term is the correction that a second , redshifted source of extinction introduces . \n it is given by redshifting the interstellar absorption curve and by specifying the magnitude of the extinction , which i parameterize as the v - band absorption magnitude _ at the redshift of the source _ \n . a constant error of @xmath7 0.07 mag must be added in quadrature to the quoted errors of sokolov et al . [ 18 ] for the model to fit the data ( @xmath19 ) . \n this suggests that either the quoted errors are underestimated by a factor @xmath20 , or that the flux is varying by @xmath7 6% on timescales of days . \n reichart [ 16 ] noticed possibly related temporal behavior in the light - curve of grb 970228 .    the best fit is : @xmath21 cgs , @xmath22 , @xmath23 mag , and @xmath24 . \n the quoted uncertainties are 1 @xmath6 confidence intervals for one interesting parameter . \n the best - fit redshift is consistent with the observed redshift of @xmath4 . \n furthermore , redshifts greater than @xmath5 are ruled out at the 3 @xmath6 confidence level . \n the best - fit v - band absorption magnitude corresponds to a hydrogen column density of @xmath7 4.5 x 10@xmath25 @xmath26 . \n the possibility that there is no second source of absorption , i.e. , @xmath27 , is ruled out at the 3.8 @xmath6 confidence level . \n using equation ( 1 ) and the best - fit temporal decline power - law index , i have scaled each of the measurements that were fitted to in  2 to its corresponding value for may 11 , just shortly after the optical peak . \n these points define the post - peak , time - independent optical spectrum and are plotted in figure 2 . \n the best - fit spectrum , as well as the extinction - free , relativistic blast - wave component of this spectrum ( the first term of equation ( 1 ) ) , are also plotted in figure 2 . \n a broad absorption feature is apparent in the best - fit spectrum . \n this is the ultraviolet absorption feature of the interstellar absorption curve , redshifted into the b band . \n had the redshift of grb 970508 been less than @xmath4 , u - band measurements would also have been necessary for this , the only strong feature of the interstellar absorption curve , to have been detected . \n consequently , in this type of analysis , different bands most sensitively probe different redshift ranges , depending on whether or not this absorption feature has been redshifted into the band in question . since grbs are generally believed to have redshifts of @xmath28 , self - consistent sets of u- , b- , and v - band measurements should be a goal of future optical afterglow observations .    in this letter , \n i present a method by which redshifts can be determined for grbs that are associated with host galaxies , even if absorption or emission lines are not observable or if spectra of sufficient quality are unattainable . \n this method also yields hydrogen column densities along the line of site , which provides valuable information about the distribution of grbs within galaxies . for grb 970508 \n , i find that the redshift of its host galaxy , or possibly that of an intermediate galaxy , is @xmath3 , which is consistent with the observed redshift of metzger et al . \n : @xmath4 . \n redshifts greater than @xmath5 are ruled out at the 3 @xmath6 confidence level . \n metzger , m. r. , et al . \n , _ iau circ . \n _ , 6676 ( 1997 ) . \n m. r. , et al . \n , _ nature _ , * 387 * , 879 ( 1997 ) . \n costa , e. , et al . \n , _ iau circ . \n _ , 6649 ( 1997 ) . \n bond , h. e. , _ iau circ . \n _ , 6654 ( 1997 ) . \n paczyski , b. , & rhoads , j. , _ apj _ , * 418 * , l5 ( 1993 ) . \n katz , j. , _ apj _ , * 422 * , 248 ( 1994 ) \n . katz , j. , _ apj _ , * 432 * , l107 ( 1994 ) . \n mszros , p. & rees , m. j. , _ apj _ , * 476 * , 232 ( 1997 ) . \n sari , r. , & piran , t. , _ apj _ , * 485 * , 270 ( 1997 ) . \n vietri , m. , _ apj _ , * 478 * , l9 ( 1997 ) . \n waxman , e. , _ apj _ , * 485 * , l5 ( 1997 ) . \n sari , r. , _ apj _ , * 489 * , l37 ( 1997 ) . \n katz , j. , & piran , t. _ apj _ , in press ( 1997 ) . \n katz , j. , piran , t. , & sari , r. , preprint ( 1997 ) . \n wijers , r. a. m. j. , rees , m . \n j. , & mszros , p. , _ mnras _ , * 288 * , l51 ( 1997 ) . \n reichart , d. e. , _ apj _ , * 485 * , l57 ( 1997 ) . \n sahu , k. , et al . \n , _ nature _ , * 387 * , 476 ( 1997 ) . \n sokolov , v. v. , et al . \n , preprint ( 1997 ) . \n rowan - robinson , m. , et al . \n , _ mnras _ , * 249 * , 729 ( 1991 ) . \n johnson , h. l. , _ apj _ , * 141 * , 923 ( 1965 ) . \n bless , r. c. , & savage , b. d. , _ apj _ , * 171 * , 293 ( 1972 ) . \n hartmann , d. , & burton , w. b. , _ atlas of galactic neutral hydrogen _ \n , cambridge : cambridge university press , 1978 . \n stark , a. a. , et al . \n , _ apj supp . \n _ , * 79 * , 77 ( 1992 ) . \n burstein , d. , & heiles , c. , _ aj _ , * 87 * , 1165 ( 1982 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1500069874704, "RequestID": "c17a34fb24b8db3bc1aed592fc52c14b5a30865e", "TotalTokens": 2791}
{"ContextTokens": 3158, "GeneratedTokens": 291, "SynthesizedBody": "collisions in orbit pose a threat to spacecraft , to astronauts and to the global commons of near - earth space . \n several collisions have already occurred between spacecraft and debris , while the iridium 33/cosmos 2251 collision of january 2009 represented the first documented satellite - satellite collision . \n unfortunately , the cumulative number of collisions thus far is consistent with the prescient predictions of a runaway chain reaction @xcite .    reducing debris from current and future space missions ( debris mitigation ) \n is an important measure . \n however , even the unrealistic case of  no new launches \" is inadequate to curb runaway growth @xcite . \n there are two remaining ways to alleviate the problem : debris removal and collision avoidance . for the latter \n , one needs prediction precision to be sufficiently accurate so as not to imply an unwieldy number of collision avoidance maneuvers . \n in addition , one needs a means of doing debris - debris collision avoidance since applying collision avoidance only to the subset of conjunctions involving maneuverable spacecraft does not suffice to curb the growth . \n this paper describes a method to increase the orbit prediction accuracy based on publicly available tles . \n many satellite owner operations have inadequate ( if any ) processes for conjunction assessment and collision avoidance , since they would have to screen their asset(s ) against all other space objects . \n the only source of knowledge at their disposal for the majority of other objects is the publicly available two - line element ( tle ) sets . but \n predictions based on tles using the associated analytic propagator ( sgp4 ) are not sufficiently accurate to warrant maneuvering to avoid potential collisions : they imply an unacceptably large number of potential collisions per space object , each of which has very low probability . \n the problem is similar for debris - debris conjunctions except then both objects , not just one , are subject to these imprecisions .    to address this tle / sgp4 accuracy problem \n , we investigated several methods to improve the propagation errors for non - maneuvering orbital objects whilst using only tles as input data . \n the following research target was set : `` increase the predictive accuracy for orbital objects , using only historical tle data , such that it enables operational conjunction assessment for collision avoidance '' .    in the following sections , we describe one approach to this target , assess its accuracy , and discuss the requirements for extension to the entire space object catalog . \n finally , we propose a new method of debris - debris collision avoidance enabled by long - term high - accuracy conjunction assessment . \n esa uses tles from the publicly available catalog to initially screen their sun - synchronous orbit ( sso ) spacecraft ers2 and envisat for conjunctions @xcite . \n telemetry from their operational spacecraft provide precision orbital ephemeredes ( poes ) for those spacecraft . for screening against all other potentially conjuncting objects , \n only tles are used . \n @xcite describe a method to estimate error covariances of tles in order to quantify collision probability assessments . \n their method provided inspiration for the present work . here \n we extend and adapt their approach : based solely on the object s historical tles , we improve the accuracy of the object s predicted position , as opposed to quantifying the accuracy of the object s sgp4 propagation errors . \n our method is essentially to use tle data as `` pseudo - observations '' and to fit an orbit to these pseudo - observations using a high - precision special perturbations propagator and traditional batch least - squares differential correction . \n the fitted orbit is then propagated into the future using the same high - precision orbit propagator . \n the prediction accuracy is assessed by comparison with precision orbital ephemeris ( poe ) data from the international laser ranging service @xcite .    for each object \n we wish to analyze we choose a time window with two sections : a fitting period and a subsequent prediction period . \n the fitting period is initially set to ten days , typical of the period over which u.s . \n space surveillance network observations are fitted when generating tles for leo objects @xcite . \n section @xmath0 details a more principled approach to determining the fitting period . \n the prediction period is 30 days .    for a given object , \n all tles with epochs within its entire window are obtained . \n however , only tles with epochs within the fitting period are used for the fitting process ; those in the prediction period are only used for validation and test .    using all tles from the fitting period and interpolating using sgp4 \n , we generate a series of order @xmath1 state vectors ( `` pseudo - observations '' ) equally spaced in time within the fitting period . \n we initialize the differential correction with a state vector derived from the first tle in the fitting period , and then propagate that using a high precision propagator . \n we apply batch least - squares differential correction to minimize the rms error in the radial , in track and cross track ( ric ) components of relative positions between the fitted orbit and the pseudo - observations . \n the trajectory obtained from the converged differential corrector is our fit . \n the high precision propagator incorporates a @xmath2 egm2008 gravity field including solid earth tides , point masses for the solar and lunar gravity fields and a nrl - msise @xmath3 atmospheric drag model . \n we assume constant values for solar f@xmath4 and ap equal to their averages over the fitting period . \n solar radiation pressure is modelled using a simple the biconic approximation with earth and moon as eclipsing bodies . \n [ figure1 ]     days . \n the fitting period is @xmath5 days for stella and @xmath6 days for etalon-@xmath7 . \n all fitting uses only publicly available tles . \n truth data are only used for plotting . \n selection of the length of the fitting period is discussed in section 4 . \n also shown are the updated tles ( no prediction ) in blue . \n , width=529 ]    we applied our method to four non - manoeuvring spacecraft for which poe data were readily available @xcite : stella , starlette , ajisai and etalon-@xmath7 . \n the summary of basic orbital and physical properties for these spacecraft are shown in table @xmath8 . \n they were picked in part for their range of orbital altitudes . \n .key parameters of geodesic spacecraft used [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ] \n [ figure4 ]     runs corresponding to @xmath9 random starting dates in @xmath10 . \n , width=377 ]    the majority of tracked space objects ( i.e debris ) do not have precision orbital ephemerides  they are not tracked by the ilrs and they transmit nothing . many are , however , tracked by the united states space surveillance network ( ssn ) . \n unfortunately , the only publicly available source of data derived from these ssn observations are , at present , the tles accessible at space-track.org ( and archived e.g. at celestrak.com ) . \n while there is currently no publicly available source of high - accuracy trajectory for debris objects , we believe the method described above could be applied to refine the predictions of debris objects future positions based only upon comparatively inaccurate tles , facilitating conjunction assessment and collision avoidance . \n however , there are several issues which complicate the application of our procedure to debris :    the first set of issues arise when tles are the _ only _ source of data - we have no `` truth '' in order to perform validation and test . \n this is solved by the use of tles from beyond the fitting period as a proxy for truth data . \n our initial manual experiments suggested that different fitting periods were optimal for different orbit categories . \n these results are consistent with @xcite . \n we made a more principled investigation , utilizing cross - validation , to optimize the length of the fitting interval on a per - object basis using only tles for both fitting and validation . \n figure 4 shows how a fitting period of @xmath11 days was determined to be optimal for satellite ajisai . \n the important point shown in the figure is that a @xmath11 day fitting period is optimal both when validating predictions with truth data _ and _ when validating predictions with future tles . and \n the @xmath11 day fitting period is optimal whether predicting @xmath12 , @xmath11 or @xmath13 days into the future . \n thus it appears `` future '' tles can be used as a proxy for truth data when optimizing the length of the fitting period on a per object basis . \n the second set of issues is that for debris objects one must also solve for area to mass ratio ( drag ) and validate this as well using only future tles . \n we are currently performing these experiments . \n further accuracy improvements could come from a principled analysis of the number of fitting points and their weighting as a function of location within the fitting period , the removal of outlier data ( i.e. filtering ) and other techniques from statistical orbit determination , treating tles as observations . also , recent work @xcite suggests that there may be simple global transformations of tle data that can improve tle / sgp@xmath0 accuracy . \n these systematic corrections might also be further refined on the basis of orbital parameters , resulting in a look - up - table used to correct tles as a function of their orbital regimes . \n in addition , the scheme could be tested on actual known conjunctions in order to analyse its efficiency for conjunction assessment . \n these issues will be the subject of a future paper . \n as an initial assessment of the computational requirements needed to perform conjunction analysis for all space objects in the publicly available catalog , a simple conjunction analysis system was parallelized on the pleiades supercomputer at nasa ames research center . using approximately @xmath14 cpu cores , checking all objects against all objects for conjunctions @xmath15 days into the future takes about a minute . \n the conjunctions involving spacecraft precisely match the results from socrates @xcite . \n the same system takes about @xmath16 minutes to perform 7 days of all - on - all conjunction assessment of a `` simulated s - band fence '' catalog ( obtained from the nasa orbital debris office ) containing `` pseudo - tles '' for approximately @xmath17 million objects of size @xmath18 cm . \n this demonstrates the feasibility of doing all - on - all conjunction assessment on the present and expected near - future catalogs . \n scaling the fitting method discussed above to the future catalog will be the subject of a later paper . \n an along track @xmath19 of @xmath8 cm / s provides of order 1 km displacement per day . \n since error growth for our method is @xmath20 m per day , such small manoeuvres might suffice for collision avoidance . for manoeuvres this small one could use radiation pressure to impart the necessary momentum . to verify the conjecture \n , we increased the flux of radiation by a factor of 10x the solar radiation constant for 10 minutes on a typical debris object ( area to mass ratio @xmath21 m@xmath22/kg ) in sso . \n we then propagated that for a further 5 days . \n the displacement was @xmath23 km / day along track compared to a reference object that was not so irradiated . \n two cumulative such events , if one ensured appropriate geometry , would thus lead to the necessary along - track displacement . \n a factor of 10x the solar rational constant could conceivably be applied from the ground . \n for example , a 10kw class laser attached to a 1 m class telescope with appropriate tracking , could , ( considering diffraction limits only ) provide the necessary radiation pressure for a debris object of area @xmath241m@xmath22 in sso . \n one would need to perform a detailed engineering analysis of the feasibility of such a device , particularly the viability of maintaining small beam divergence and tracking . \n debris - debris collision avoidance could eliminate the need for an active debris removal program . \n the results of @xcite imply , to first order , that performing debris - debris collision avoidance for 5 additional carefully selected objects per annum would curb debris field growth . \n furthermore , any additional debris - debris collision avoidance would start reducing the net debris density , eventually to below a critical level , because debris creating collisions are being nulled whereas atmospheric drag continues to cause objects re - entry . \n thus this method could provide not just a stop gap measure , but a permanent solution . \n this fitting and propagation method , based solely on tles , could potentially provide initial conjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable collision avoidance system . \n if similar improvements are possible for debris objects , as we expect , then it could be used for all - on - all conjunction assessment . however , to ensure that the scheme works in an operational setting , it would be necessary to have additional data : the so - called `` uncorrelated objects '' ( a.k.a . \n analysts set ) which account for approximately 30 percent of potential conjunctions in leo @xcite . \n further , we show that all - on - all conjunction assessment is possible with moderate computer infrastructure , even with the large increase in size of the catalog of tracked objects that is expected in the next few years .    finally , given accurate predictions \n , we claim _ debris - debris collision avoidance may be possible _ by externally inducing small manoeuvres using radiation pressure from @xmath11 kw class power density ground - based lasers . if feasible , this could negate the need for a large scale debris removal program . \n k.  alfriend , s.  paik , v.  boikov , z.  khutorovsky , & a.  testov . \n comparison of the russian & us algorithms for catalog maintenance for geosynchronous satellites . \n adv . astronaut . \n , 112(2):11571176 , 2002 . \n j.  boers , s.  coffey , w.  barnds , d.  johns , m.  davis , & j.  seago . accuracy assessment of the naval space command special perturbations cataloging system . \n spaceflight mechanics 2000 , volume 105 of adv . astronaut . \n , pages 12911304 , 2000 . \n s.  coffey , h.  neal , c.  visel , & p.  conolty . \n demonstration of a special -

{"ContextTokens": 3670, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are one of the most fascinating and intriguing forms of solar activity . \n they occur when solar plasma threaded with topologically complex magnetic fields are ejected out into the corona and interplanetary medium . \n recent technological developments have yielded a steady increase in qualitative as well as quantitative studies of cmes and related phenomena . however , numerous cme - associated phenomena such as the relationship between different wave features ( eit waves : thompson et al . 1998 ; cme - driven shock waves : hundhausen et al . \n 1987 ) are not understood unambiguously . cmes with speed greater than the alfvn speed of the local plasma produce shock waves whose effects \n can be traced through radio type ii bursts ( klassen et al . 2000 ) and/or emission of very hot lines ( compared to the ambient coronal temperatures ; raouafi et al . 2004 ) . \n these waves could also be detected through deflections in remote streamer belts with respect to the ejected cme material ( see hundhausen et al . \n 1987 and sime & hundhausen 1987 ) . the high quality data of soho / lasco ( brueckner et al . \n 1995 ) yielded numerous cases for streamer deflections associated with super - alfvnic cme eruptions ( see sheeley et al . \n these observations led to the conclusion deduced by the previous authors that these deflections were indeed a consequence of cme - driven shock waves . \n spectroscopic signatures of coronal shock waves due to high speed cmes ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 ; see raymond et al . \n 2000 ) are line broadening ( e.g. , 1032   & 1037   lines ) and enhanced emissions in spectral lines that are rarely observed in the corona such as 520   and 625   ( e.g. , raouafi et al . 2004 ) due to their relatively high formation temperatures ( @xmath2  mk ) . up to now only a few cme - driven shock wave events have been reported through soho / uvcs ( kohl et al . 1995 ) observations : raymond et al . \n 2000 ; mancuso et al . 2002 ; raouafi et al . 2004 ; and ciaravella et al . \n 2005 ( hereafter rmrc00 - 05 ) .    since the discovery of the h@xmath3 moreton waves ( moreton 1964 ) \n , it was thought that these waves were due to the intersection of coronal shock waves ( due to flares ) with the chromosphere ( e.g. , uchida 1968 ) . \n later when eit waves ( thompson et al . \n 1998 ) were discovered based on the observations recorded by eit ( delaboudinire et al . \n 1995 ) , they were interpreted as the coronal manifestation of the chromospheric moreton wave ( thompson et al . \n however , the difference in propagation patterns and speeds of moreton and eit waves questions the similarity between these two phenomena . \n although these waves are being observed more frequently the question remains open as to how these different wave phenomena are related to each other . \n based on mhd simulations , ( chen et al . \n 2005a , b ) showed that moreton waves are the surface counter part of the cme driven shock wave . \n however , the eit waves are the slow moving wave fronts traveling behind the moreton wave due to the opening of the magnetic flux system . \n this was also suggested by zhukov & auchre ( 2004 ) and by delanee ( 2000 ) . \n however , this relationship and the nature of eit waves remains elusive . \n a cme event on 5 march 2000 has been observed simultaneously by different instruments on board soho ( eit , lasco and uvcs ) with different signatures of wave features . \n this event provides a unique opportunity to establish a relationship between different phenomena such as the cme driven shock wave , streamer deflection and the eit waves . \n observations and data analysis are described in  2 and results and conclusions are presented in  3 . \n the cme event of 5 march 2000 appeared as a three - part structure ( bright front followed by a dark cavity and a bright core ) in the lasco / c2 field of view ( fov ) at 16:54 ut . \n images with fov extending from 2.5 - 6.0  r@xmath4 were recorded every 20 minutes . \n [ lasco ] displays the running difference of lasco / c2 images of the white - light cme showing the proper motion of features ( sheeley et al . \n the bright material seen as a core of the cme is the erupting prominence which had expanded . the leading edge of the cme propagated with a super alfvenic speed of 860 km / s ( tripathi et al . \n 2006 ) . \n the arrows mark the location of the streamer deflection propagating north - east . as depicted in fig . \n [ lasco ] , there is no evidence of plasma material which could have caused such a kink in the streamer . \n the simultaneous propagation of the kink in the streamer outward in the corona along with the cme provides strong evidence for the existence of a wave phenomenon traveling in the flank of the cme . the speed of the propagating kink ( projected on the plane of the sky ) , measured by tracking the boundary between the bright and dark features from the running difference images , was about 260  km  s@xmath1 . \n sheeley et al . \n ( 2000 ) found that speed of the cme - flank material is likely to be smaller than that of the bright leading edge ( 860  km  s@xmath1 in the present case ) . \n since the cme propagates with super - alfvnic speed , it can drive a shock . \n therefore it is plausible to conclude that the propagating kink was likely to be the consequence of shock wave driven by the associated cme . \n the uvcs observational sequence started at 15:58  ut and ended at 20:12  ut . \n this time interval covers adequately the time evolution of the cme event that first appeared in the lasco at around 16:54  ut . the 40 arcmin long uvcs slit was centered at 2.55  r@xmath4 from sun center at @xmath5 counterclockwise ( ccw ) from the north pole . \n 80 exposures of 180 seconds each have been recorded in the wavelength ranges of 1027 - 1042   and 1241 - 1253   for the main and redundant channels , respectively . \n the latter includes the 625   line ( observed in second order ) , where the former contains the strong doublet 1032   & 1037   together with other weaker lines such as 520   which is observed in second order . \n however , we concentrate on the first 21 exposures where hot plasma emission is observed before the cme material has reached the slit . \n [ march052000_12072006_ovi ] displays two sets of averaged uvcs exposures ( top panel : average of exposures from 1 to 15 ; bottom panel : average of exposures from 16 to 21 ) showing the doublet together with the 520   line . \n the overplotted spectra are spatially binned between the two horizontal lines plotted on the figure . \n note that the amplitude of the spectral lines are not on scale and only the change in the profile shapes are emphasized . \n the line profiles in the top panel are composed mainly of a central narrow component and emission in the line is weak but remarkable . in the bottom panel , \n the lines are dimmed compared to the previous one and are significantly wider as shown by the overplotted spectra . \n the emission profiles in the line are enhanced and are also wider .    fig . \n [ march052000_event_mgx ] shows the average of the first 21 exposures in the redundant channel covering the 625   ( second order ) . \n the spatially binned spectra between the horizontal lines are overplotted . \n the solid curve is the spatially binned spectra of all the 21 exposures . \n the significance of the other curves is explained in the caption of the same figure . \n the dot - dashed spectrum ( average of exposures 1621 ) shows an intensity enhancement and profile broadening of the line simultaneously with the broadening of the and lines . \n the increase in the line widths together with enhanced emissions in hot lines are very likely due to plasma heating which is very likely due to a shock wave propagating in front of the cme ( e.g. , raouafi et al . \n 2004 and ciaravella et al . \n a simple time computation suggested that the shock wave has reached the uvcs slit after 16:45 and the heated gas emission lasted till about 17:20 ut , where emission in colder lines is observed . \n extra broadening in the lines is noticeable even after the cme cold material has reached uvcs fov . \n the intensity modulation along the slit , in particular the upper section of the slit , shows structures drifting towards the upper end of the slit , which corresponds to the north - east direction ( see tripathi & raouafi 2007 ) . \n in addition , intensity dimming in the upper section of the slit of the 1032   line from one exposure to the next , where that of the 1037   line changes quite differently . it gets enhanced in particular in exposure number 20 . \n this is evidence for the acceleration of the ions that leads the 1032   line to run out of resonance and the 1037   line to get optically pumped by the chromospheric lines of .we believe that is evidence that the physical process causing the intensity variation and lines broadening ( as shown previously ) is moving along the slit to the north - east quadrant of the solar corona . \n soho / eit images at 195   are recorded regularly with a cadence of 12 mins and were used for the present study . \n [ ewave_img ] displays the running difference images taken by eit at 195   . \n the filament slowly rose and erupted at 15:46  ut . \n the eit wave associated with this eruption first appeared at 16:10  ut and disappeared at 16:58  ut . \n the eit wave is seen propagating only towards the north - east . \n no counter - part moving to the south - west was detected probably because of the presence of an active region . \n the propagating wave - front also did not traverse through the coronal hole which was located north - east of the source region , similar to the observations presented by thompson et al . \n the estimated average speed of the propagation was about 55  km  s@xmath1 . \n note that no correction for the projection effect was performed while measuring the speed . \n except for the speed being much lower , other characteristics are similar to those of the eit waves . \n we studied the relationship between different coronal waves ( eit wave , streamer deflection and a cme - driven shock wave ) generated by the cme event on 5 march 2000 as observed by different instruments on board soho ( eit , lasco and uvcs ) . \n lasco - c2 images show a deflection propagating outward at @xmath6  km  s@xmath1 ( projected on the plane of the sky ) in a remote streamer located approximately at @xmath7 ccw from north pole . \n the streamer kink was first seen in lasco - c2 fov ( @xmath8  r@xmath4 ) at about 17:30  ut . no evidence for any cme material which could be the origin of such a deflection . \n the speed of the leading edge of the cme was @xmath9  km  s@xmath1 , which is sufficient to generate a shock wave . \n therefore , this propagating kink in the streamer provides strong evidence for a cme - driven shock wave in the corona as suggested by sheeley et al . \n ( 2000 ) . \n uvcs spectra show excessive broadening in lines and intensity enhancement in the hot lines of 520   and 625   . \n these are clear evidence for a cme - driven shock wave ( see rmrc00 - 05 ) . \n the analysis of the intensity modulation along the slit also reveals the propagation direction of the wave , north - east , that is the same as the kinking streamer . \n uvcs observations show that the shock wave would have reached the uvcs slit around 16:45  ut . \n eit difference images show evidence for an eit wave front propagating north - east with speed of @xmath10  km  s@xmath1 ( the solar disk shape not taken into account ) up to the north polar hole where the propagation has stopped , satisfying the properties of eit waves . \n the propagation of the wave in the south - east direction seems to be disabled by the presence of the complex active region . \n the eit wave first appeared at 16:10  ut and disappeared gradually after 16:58  ut .    on one hand , temporal and spatial correlations between the events observed by uvcs and lasco suggest that they are basically different manifestations of the same phenomenon . \n measurements of the speed in different part of cme envelopes reveal that noses of cmes travel faster than their flanks ( sheeley et al . \n therefore we anticipate that the propagating shock would have a similar property and would have speed higher in front of the cmes and lower in the flanks . \n different speed in the different parts would provide evidence for the anisotropic propagation of associated shock waves . on the other hand , \n the eit wave observed in the low corona was significantly slower the uvcs and lasco events . \n a possible explanation for this is the opening of the magnetic flux system due to the expulsion of the cme rather than the manifestations of the cme driven shock wave as suggested by chen et al . \n ( 2005a , b ) based on mhd modeling and by delanee ( 2000 ) and by zhukov & auchre ( 2004 ) . \n moreton waves , which are observed in the chromosphere are interpreted as counterpart of cme driven shock waves ( e.g. , chen et al . \n unfortunately , we did not have h@xmath3 high cadence observations for this event , which prevented a comparison with a chromospheric moreton wave . \n however , the semi - circular wavefront was moving in the same direction as the coronal shock wave . \n this supports the hypothesis that all three features are linked to each other . \n they are generated by the same source , propagate in the same direction and have good time and spatial correlations . \n the only apparent problem resides in the propagation speed . \n however , note that the three wave - like structures do not share similar physical conditions . \n one of these is the space and its characteristics . \n the speed of alfvn waves is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath13 is the density . \n depending on models , the density drops by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude or more between the very sparse corona and 2.0 - 3.0  r@xmath4 , where the magnetic field drops by an order of magnitude or more ( assuming the the coronal field is nearly potential and thus drops as @xmath14 ; see altschuler & newkirk 1969 ) . \n while the high corona is increasingly less dense with increasing altitude the corresponding alfvn speed tends to increase . \n this is not the case in the lower corona where the plasma density is higher and thus is characterized by a smaller alfvn speed . \n this may explain at least partially the difference in speed . \n another parameter is the propagation direction of the waves . \n the cme - driven shock wave is mainly propagating parallel to the magnetic field lines . \n however , the wave propagating on the solar disk does not share this property and propagates across . \n it encounters different magnetic structures that may allow for energy leakage which might consequently damp and slow down the wave ( see for instance de pontieu et al . \n 2004 on energy leakage of the acoustic oscillation @xmath15 modes through flux tubes with high inclinations to the chromosphere which contributes to the heating of this layer ) . a good illustration for that is given by active regions through which eit waves could not propagate and also across polar holes . \n we think that energy carried by the wave is progressively leaked to different magnetic structures which may heat and accelerate the plasma in these structures . \n this interpretation needs to be carried further and deeper through additional analysis of other observational examples and also by numerical simulations . \n the national solar observatory is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation . \n ner s work is supported by nso and nasa grant nnh05aa12i . \n dt acknowledges the support from stfc . \n soho is a project of international collaboration between esa and nasa .", "StartTimeOffset": 1513412499648, "RequestID": "ae3fc9b290fcad467fcd533b0240bec2ea79cf78", "TotalTokens": 3876}
{"ContextTokens": 1144, "GeneratedTokens": 198, "SynthesizedBody": "in order to develop a practical natural language processing ( nlp ) system , it is essential to deal with ill - formed sentences that can not be parsed correctly according to the grammar rules in the system . in this paper , \n an `` ill - formed sentence '' means one that can not be parsed as a unified structure . \n a syntactic parser with general grammar rules is often unable to analyze not only sentences with grammatical errors and ellipses , but also long sentences , owing to their complexity . \n thus , ill - formed sentences include not only ungrammatical sentences , but also some grammatical sentences that can not be parsed as unified structures owing to the presence of unknown words or to a lack of completeness in the syntactic parser . in texts from a restricted domain , such as computer manuals , \n most sentences are grammatically correct \n . however , even a well - established syntactic parser usually fails to generate a unified parsed structure for about 10 to 20 percent of all the sentences in such texts , and the failure to generate a unified parsed structure in syntactic analysis leads to a failure in the output of a nlp system . \n thus , it is indispensable to establish a correct analysis for such a sentence .    to handle such sentences , \n most previous approaches apply various heuristic rules @xcite , including    * relaxing constraints in the condition part of a grammatical rule , such as number and gender constraints * joining partial parses by using meta rules .    either way , the output reflects the general plausibility of an analysis that can be obtained from information in the sentence ; however , the interpretation of a sentence depends on its discourse , and inconsistency with recovered parses that contain different analyses of the same phrase in other sentences in the discourse often results in odd outputs of the natural language processing system . \n starting from the viewpoint that an interpretation of a sentence must be consistent in its discourse , we worked on completing incomplete parses by using information extracted from complete parses in the discourse . \n the results were encouraging . \n since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in other sentences in the discourse , the complete parses of well - formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in the same discourse . \n thus , rather than trying to enhance a syntactic parser s grammar rules in order to support ill - formed sentences , which seems to be an endless task after the parser has obtained enough coverage to parse general grammatical sentences , we treat the syntactic parser as a black box and complete incomplete parses , in the form of partially parsed chunks that a bottom - up parser outputs for ill - formed sentences , by using information extracted from the discourse .    in the next section , the effectiveness of using information extracted from the discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill - formed sentences . after that \n , we propose an algorithm for completing incomplete parses by using discourse information , and give the results of an experiment on completing incomplete parses in technical documents . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n we have proposed a method for completing partial parses of ill - formed sentences on the basis of information extracted from complete parses of well - formed sentences in the discourse . \n our approach to handling ill - formed sentences is fundamentally different from previous ones in that it reanalyzes the part of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships of each word in an ill - formed sentence by using information extracted from analyses of other sentences in the same text , thus , attempting to generate the analysis most appropriate to the discourse . \n the results of our experiments show the effectiveness of this method ; moreover , implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved the accuracy of its translation . since this method has a simple framework that does not require any extra knowledge resources or inference mechanisms , it is robust and suitable for a practical natural language processing system . furthermore , in terms of the turn - around time ( tat ) of the whole translation procedure , the improvement in the parses achieved by using this method along with other disambiguation methods involving discourse information , as shown in another paper @xcite , shortened the tat in the late stages of the translation procedure , and compensated for the extra tat required as a result of using the discourse information , provided the size of the discourse was kept to between 100 and 300 sentences .    in this paper , \n the term `` discourse '' is used as a set of words in a text together with the usage of each of those words in that text  namely , a part of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships with other words . the basic idea of our method is to improve the accuracy of sentence analysis simply by maintaining consistency in the usage of morphologically identical words within the same text . \n thus , the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the source text , since it presupposes that morphologically identical words are likely to be repeated in the same text . \n however , the results have been encouraging at least with technical documents such as computer manuals , where words with the same lemma are frequently repeated in a small area of text . \n moreover , our method improves the translation accuracy , especially for frequently repeated phrases , which are usually considered to be important , and leads to an improvement in the overall accuracy of the natural language processing system . \n i would like to thank michael mcdonald for invaluable help in proofreading this paper . \n i would also like to thank taijiro tsutsumi , masayuki morohashi , koichi takeda , hiroshi maruyama , hiroshi nomiyama , hideo watanabe , shiho ogino , naohiko uramoto , and the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions .", "StartTimeOffset": 1522051602390, "RequestID": "8434cdb847152374aa3d2989b0f9509e610315dc", "TotalTokens": 1342}
{"ContextTokens": 3444, "GeneratedTokens": 340, "SynthesizedBody": "there is a common recognition today that electrochemical activity of a wide class of non - magnetic colloids of technical and biomedical interest is primarily determined by the electrostatics of internal nano - structures of an extremely involved molecular composition . \n this complexity calls for the development of admittedly idealized models of such nano - complexes providing a comprehensive insight into in - medium electrostatics of both conducting and dielectric nanosolutions . \n a well - known example is the macroscopic treatment of spherical nano - structures in globular polyelectrolytic biosolutions borrowing the idea of quasi - particles from the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory of weak electrolytes . \n as is known , the standard dh - theory ( and set of its modifications , e.g. [ 1,2 ] ) deals with completely ionized ( highly conducting ) solutions in which the ions are regarded as non - polarized free spherical charges . \n the basic explanatory device of dh - theory is the in - medium quasiparticle composed of a massive macro - ion surrounded by an atmosphere of light counterions . \n the central to this theory is the approximation of particle density in ionic atmosphere by boltzmann function with the energy factor depending on the potential of mean electrostatic field . \n the most striking outcome the dh - approach to electrostatics of electrolytes , relying on the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation for the potential of exterior coulomb ( electrostatic ) field of above quasiparticles , is that the solution of this latter equation provides proper account for the in - medium effect of electric field shielding [ 2 ] .    on the other hand , \n the situation is not so clear for nanosolutions possessing properties of dielectric ( non - conducting ) liquids the sources of internal electric field in which are bound charges rather than free ones as is the case of electrolytes . \n the electrodynamics of continuous dielectric media teaches us that the local density of bound charges @xmath3 owe its origin to gradients of dielectric permittivity @xmath4 in the direction of local electric field @xmath5 , but the interrelation between this field and micro - composition of dielectric media remains less studied . in this paper \n we investigate this issue in the model of dielectric nanosolution whose micro - composition is dominated by spherically symmetric nano - complexes composed of massive counterions coagulated by cloud of polarized dipoles of solvent molecules . in what follows \n such nano - structures are dubbed by _ \n dipolarions_. in so doing we focus on computing exterior fields for two kinds of such nano- complexes , namely ( i ) permanent dipolarion composed of macro - ion coated by atmosphere of polarized dipoles of polar molecules with constant ( field - independent ) intrinsic dipole moments , and ( ii ) field - induced dipolarion the atmosphere of which consists of molecules whose dipole moments are induced by field of macro - ion . before embarking on mathematical details of in - medium electrostatics of such nanosolution , it seems worth emphasizing that dipolarion is the electrically charged nano - complex , as is illustrated in fig . \n 1 showing internal constitution of permanent dipolarions with a positive and a negative charges of central macro - ions . \n the effect of polarization of solvent molecules along the lines of central symmetric field of micro - ion consists in an effective shift of charge from center to the surface of the dipolarion with no change of the original sign of charge of micro - ion . \n thus , the physical nature of electric field shielding in dielectric nanosolutions with the above dipolarion micro - constitution is substantially different from that for dh - quasiparticles of electrolytes . \n this observation motivates the main purpose of this work which is to compute to exterior electric fields of dipolarions in dielectric nanosolution carrying information about the in - medium effect of electric field shielding . in the below presented calculations this effect \n is highlighted by difference between obtained analytic expressions for exterior fields of dipolarions and canonical formula for coulomb field of charged sphere immersed in a dielctric liquid composed of electrically passive , unpolarizable , molecules . \n the electrostatic state of an isotropic dielectric continuous medium is described by equations ( e.g. , [ 3 ] ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field of electric displacement , @xmath8 is the density of electric polarization - electric dipole moment per unit volume and @xmath9 stands for the electric permittivity of free space . \n the rightmost of ( [ e2.1 ] ) is the maxwell equation for the electrostatic field @xmath5 ( differential form of coulomb law ) and @xmath10 is the total density of electric charge which is a sum of the free charge density , @xmath11 , and bound charge density , @xmath3 . by definition \n these are @xmath12 as was mentioned , the main difference between dielectric liquids and electrolytes is that the former can be usually thought of as a non - conducting suspension composed of bound charges dissolved in a fluid matrix of electrically polarized molecules , whereas electrolyte is an electrically conducting solution ( of second type ) whose conductivity is attributed to the mobility of ions which are regarded as free ( non - bounded ) charges . taking this into account and putting @xmath13 , one has @xmath14 here @xmath5 stands for the internal electric mean field whose source is the bound - charge density charges which is formed from charges of both counterions and poles of molecular dipoles . in this work , \n as was stated , we focus on a dielectric nanosolution whose internal electrification is determined by dipolarions - nano - structures composed of monopole charge of counterions surrounded by a cloud of radially polarized molecular dipoles forming dipolar atmospheres , having some features in common with ionic atmosphere of dh - qiasiparticle . bearing this mind \n we represent the macroscopic bound - charge density of dielectric nanosolution in the form @xmath15 where index @xmath16 labels counterions carrying the charge @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the effective particle density of bound charges associated with the ion of @xmath16-th type which takes into account polarization of molecular dipoles by field of given ion . \n the contribution of bound - charges of dipole - polarized molecules to the macroscopic bound - charge density of nanosolution can be incorporated in the above parametrization of @xmath3 by using of boltzmann function for @xmath18 with the energy factor describing polarization effect of ionic fields on dipole moment of molecules of solvent . \n namely , @xmath19 where @xmath4 is electric permittivity of solvent , @xmath20 is the number of dipole - polarized molecules of @xmath21-type having a dipole moment @xmath22 , which form the dipolar atmosphere surrounding the ion . in the last equation , by @xmath23 \n is understood the effective particle density of ions in the the absence of dipolar polarization of solvent molecules , as it would be the case of dielectric liquid composed of ions dissolved in fluid matrix of electrically passive , unpolarizable , molecules ( i.e. , molecules which are non - polar and insensitive to fields of ions ) . equation ( [ e2.4 ] ) means , in fact , that dipolar atmospheres of counterions are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath24 which is high enough to approximate the average particle density of bound charges of dielectric solution in above fashion . with account of this \n we arrive at a highly non - linear equation of in - medium electrostatics @xmath25 describing electric field in dielectric nanosolution with account its dipolarion micro - composition . in this equation by @xmath26 \n is understood the bound - charged density which would be in case of ions suspended in the solvent of unpolarizable molecules . \n adhering to the spirit of debye - hckel theory , we make the following approximation @xmath27 as a result , the equation of in - medium electrostatics of dipolarionic nanosolution takes the form @xmath28 this equation constitutes mathematical basis for below presented analysis of the electric field shielding in the dielectric nanosolution with the dipolarion micro - constitution . \n in the reminder , we focus on application of the equation ( [ e2.6 ] ) to electrostatics of in - medium dipolarions having a shape of sphere of radius @xmath29 in accord with the standard approach to the problem of electrostatic field inside and outside sphere , the interior , @xmath30 , and exterior , @xmath31 , fields should be computed from two equations @xmath32 supplemented by boundary conditions on the surface of dipolarion of radius @xmath29 . in the above equations @xmath33 is the in - medium parameter which accounts for the dipole polarization of solvent molecules from dipolar atmosphere by field of monopole charge of central micro - ion . as was noted in introduction \n , we are considering the two kinds of dipolarions distinguishing by type of solvent molecules forming its dipolar atmosphere . \n the first model belongs to aqua and aqua - like solutions composed of polar molecules of solvent , that is , molecules endowed with permanent dipole moments of constant magnitude , @xmath34 . \n the nano - complex of this type is referred to as a permanent dipolarion . \n the second model belongs to a case of dipolar atmosphere consisting of @xmath20 non - polar molecules whose dipole electric moments @xmath22 are induced by local fields @xmath5 of macro - ions : @xmath35 , where constant parameter @xmath36 is the molecular polarizability of solvent molecule of @xmath21-sort . \n the in - medium dipolarion of this type is referred to as a field - induced dipolarion . since \n our prime goal is the in - medium effect of electric field shielding , in what follows we focus on exterior fields of above dipolarions whose central symmetric shape suggests that the local fields have only one radial component @xmath37 . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      taking into account the last remark presuming that @xmath38 , one finds that the radial component of exterior field of permanent dipolarion obey the liner equation @xmath39 with the help of substitution @xmath40 we arrive at equation for @xmath41 permitting the general solution @xmath42 as a result , for the radial component of external electrostatic field of permanent dipolarion we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total charge of dipolarion whose density accounts for the internal polarization of polar molecules by fields of central ion . \n the potential of this field is given by equations @xmath45 , \\quad { \\rm ei}(n , x)=\\int\\limits_1^{\\infty } \\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^n}\\,dt . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the exponential integral ( e.g. , [ 4 ] ) . \n special comment should be made regarding the obtained expression ( [ e3.6 ] ) for electric field of dipolarion whose exponential factor exhibits the in - medium effect of electric field shielding . \n this effect is controlled by parameter @xmath47 depending on characteristics of both counterions and molecules of solvent : the larger @xmath47 the smaller effect of shielding . \n also , it worth emphasizing that the magnitude of the shielding length @xmath47 is the in - medium parameter carrying information about all constituents of dielectric nanosolution , since depends upon bound - charged density of all counterions @xmath48 , electric permittivity @xmath4 and dipole moments of solvent molecules @xmath49 . \n the shielding of exterior field of permanent dipolarion is clearly demonstrated in fig.1 where we plot exterior field and potential as functions of distance from the dipolarion surface ( normalized to its radius ) computed at pointed out values of the shielding length @xmath47 . \n consider a model of field - induced dipolarion which might be appropriate to dielectric nanosolutions composed of non - polar molecules of solvent which are easily polarized , however , by fields of counterions : under the action of ionic field the molecules of dipolar atmospheres acquire a dipole electric moments which are proportional to the field of ion : @xmath50 , where @xmath21 labels the dipolar type of molecule . \n interestingly enough that the exterior electrostatic field of field - induced dipolarion is described by non - linear equation @xmath51 which can be solved analytically . \n however to avoid destructing attention to mathematical details of fairly tedious analytic computations ( which will be reported in separable paper ) , we present here the final result @xmath52 which can easily be verified by simple computation @xmath53 the exterior field and its potential can be represented in the form @xmath54 highlighting the effect of the field shielding which is regulated by parameter @xmath55 depending upon charges of macro - ions and electric polarizability of solvent molecules . here by @xmath44 is understood the total charge of field - induced dipolarion . \n it is seen that , unlike the exponential shielding of electric field of the permanent dipolarion , the dipolar atmosphere of field - induced dipolarion leads to the electric field shielding which is described by @xmath56 factor . \n the above characteristics can be conveniently represented via dimensionless parameter of the field shielding @xmath47 and distance ( normalized to the dipolarion radius ) @xmath57 which is measured from the surface of dipolarion @xmath58 in terms of these quantities , the radial component of external field @xmath59 and potential @xmath60 take the form @xmath61 the case of @xmath62 corresponds to the surface values of these quantities . in fig.2 \n , we plot the radial component of exterior electric field and potential of the field - induced dipolarion as functions of @xmath63 computed at different values of parameter of shielding length @xmath47 . \n one sees , the smaller @xmath47 the less in - medium effect of the field shielding . \n the limiting case of @xmath64 corresponds to coulomb law for the potential and field of uniformly charged sphere . \n an understanding of macroscopic electrodynamics of non - conducting nanomaterials possessing dielectric and/or ferroelectric properties is important for their practical applications in current industrial and biomedical nanotechnologies . \n for example , in ref . \n [ 5 ] , an optical response of ferroelectric nanoparticles by resonant vibrations has been studied in the context of their potential utilization as biolabels . \n continuing this line of research , the purpose of this work was to find out theoretical framework providing meaningful discussion of electrochemical properties of dielectric nanosolution originating from dipolarions  positively and negatively charged nano - complexes composed of counterions coagulated by clouds of electric dipoles of solvent molecules . employing the standard equation of electrostatics for dielectric continuous media and using boltzmann distribution for the particle density of bound charges , we found that in - medium electrostatics of such nanosolutions can be conveniently described by equation for the intensity of internal field , rather than rather poisson - boltzmann equation for electrostatic potential lying at the base of the debye - hckel theory of electrolytes . \n the introduced equations are interesting in their own right and , first of all , due to their capability of consistent mathematical description and physical treatment of the in - medium effect of electric field shielding which is caused by the polarization of molecular dipoles of solvent by fields of counterions \n . this capability has been demonstrated by numerical analysis of obtained analytic solutions for exterior fields of two kinds of dipolarions . from current investigations of technical and biolectrolytes we know that the electrostatic fields and potentials of in - medium quasiparticles serve as the basic ingredients in computations of coefficients of electrochemical activity of these conducting liquids . in the meantime , this issue has not , to the best of our knowledge , been properly discussed in the context of dielectric liquids and nanosolutions and will be the subject of our forthcoming paper relying on the results presented in this work . \n the authors are indebted to wei -

pressure time projection chamber with optical and charge readout . \n particles interacting in the sensitive volume of the detector ionize the gas either directly or by creating a charged particle recoil \n . the sensitive region of the detector is surrounded by a series of stainless steel rings with inner diameter of 27  cm , outer diameter of 32  cm , and thickness of 1  mm . \n the rings are connected with 1  m@xmath1 resistors and separated by nylon washers to keep periodicity at 1  cm . \n the last ring in the series is connected via a 2.2  m@xmath1 resistor to a ring holding a grounded mesh and is separated from the mesh by 1.7  cm . \n the total height of the drift region is 19.7  cm . \n the field uniformity in the drift cage is computed using the finite element method ( fem ) with the scaled transverse field component , @xmath2 , less than 1% . \n the cathode is made of a stainless - steel wire mesh with a pitch of 512  @xmath3 m and wire diameter of 31  @xmath3 m . \n the grounded electrode is made of a stainless - steel mesh with a pitch of 256  @xmath3 m and wire diameter of 28  @xmath3 m . \n the detector consists of two tpcs put back - to - back such that electrons drift toward two amplification planes located in the center of the vessel . \n only the top tcp is used in these measurements .    , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    the amplification plane is described in more detail in @xcite . \n an amplification gap is created by a copper anode ( + 730  v ) and a grounded mesh separated with 0.53  mm fishing lines that are placed at 2.5  cm intervals . \n primary electrons that drift toward the plane start avalanches of electrons and scintillation photons  @xcite . \n the detector s primary form of readout is the two - dimensional optical readout of scintillation photons created in the avalanche charge multiplication process . \n this scintillation light is collected with a nikon photographic lens with f - stop ratio of 1.2 and a focal length of 55 mm . \n the scintillation light is recorded by an apogee u6 camera with a kodak 1001e ccd chip . \n in addition to the optical readout , the charge deposited on the anode is also recorded . \n we use a proportional preamplifier ( ortec 109pc ) to integrate the charge signal and a shaping amplifier ( ortec 485 ) to make unipolar pulses . \n a fast digitizer ( alazar ats860 ) is used to convert pulses into waveforms , which are saved with our event record . \n the gas pressure is measured by an inficon pcg400 pressure gauge which utilizes a combination of a capacitance and a pirani gauge . \n the spatial resolution is estimated by extracting the track width of 5.486 mev alpha particles from an @xmath4am source . \n the observed width of the track along the axis in the readout plane is 300 - 500  @xmath3 m . \n the resolution is affected by the number of ccd pixels , @xmath5 merged into a readout bin ( 98@xmath6 ) , the spread of an electron avalanche in the amplification gap ( @xmath7 )  @xcite , and the mesh pitch ( @xmath8 ) . \n the measurement itself is affected by the imperfect collimation of the source ( 50  @xmath3 m ) and the straggling of alpha particles through cf@xmath0 gas ( 40  @xmath3 m )  @xcite in a 1.2  mm - long track segment . \n however , the dominant contribution to the spatial resolution uncertainty comes from the electron diffusion that is described and measured in the next section . \n we measure the energy resolution at 5.9  kev for the charge readout using a fe-55 source . \n a background - subtracted spectrum of pulse heights is fitted with a narrow gaussian for the full - absorption peak plus a wide gaussian for the escape peak . \n the resolution is extracted from the narrower gaussian and is found to be 10% ; a result which is consistent with fano factor of one  @xcite . \n we infer the energy resolution for the ccd readout from the amount of light that alpha particles deposit in track segments of different lengths . \n the energy deposited into ionization is estimated from the energy loss and calculated by srim  @xcite . \n we find that the resolution at 55  kev is approximately 15% , as shown in figure  [ fg::e reso ] . \n fe peak from charge readout , and the remaining points are from the optical readout of tracks from the @xmath4am sources . \n [ fg::e reso],width=453 ] \n electrons propagating through cf@xmath0 gas experience a spread in transverse direction @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion constant and @xmath3 is the mobility of electrons , i.e. a constant of proportionality between the drift velocity and the electric field . \n the @xmath9 parameter is a measure of the average electron energy , @xmath12 .    in previous measurements of @xmath9 , the spread of electron current \n was determined with annular anodes that integrate the swarm current  @xcite or with a small - area proportional counter that scans the swarm profile  @xcite . \n these approaches yield @xmath9 values that differ by more than an order of magnitude at electric field to number density ratio @xmath13 . \n the large data samples of these measurements suggests that the discrepancy is due to an unknown systematic offset , which motivates a new measurement with a different approach . \n in this work , we extract @xmath9 from the width of alpha tracks ( @xmath4am ) that are placed at different drift distances inside the drift cage . a 500  ms ccd exposure with alpha tracks emerging from the five sources \n is shown in figure  [ fg::imageoffivesources ] . \n the gaps in the tracks are the result of missing light due to the resistive separators which are used to maintain the amplification gap separation . \n images are taken without a shutter , so it is possible that some alpha tracks appear during the ccd readout . since the ccd is read out in a horizontal direction , these tracks appear shifted to the left or right . \n most of such tracks fall out of the fitting range of interest or appear at wrong @xmath14-positions and can be excluded by requiring that the mean of the light distribution of the track segment agrees with the position of the source . \n vertical lines depict a 1.2  mm wide region of interest approximately 3  cm from the sources for measurement of track widths . \n the kink in the second track from the top is likely due to a large -

absorption peak with a single gaussian and observing a change in the peak position of less than 1% . \n we also neglect the error due to imperfect collimation of x - ray source , as this does not change the mean of the drift length . \n we add all systematic errors in quadrature . \n we have measured the average energy ( @xmath9 ) and attenuation rate of electrons ( @xmath25 ) drifting in cf@xmath0 gas at operating conditions of low - pressure tpc s ( @xmath26  td ) . \n discrepancies in previous measurements of these parameters are an obstacle in designing a large volume tpc that is required for high - sensitivity experiments , such as dark matter searches . \n our measurement of the @xmath9 parameter is done by imaging alpha tracks that are placed at different heights in the drift cage . \n the results are consistent with measurements in ref . \n @xcite , but disagree with ref . \n the imaging technique can be applied to measurements of @xmath9 for other gases and mixtures that allow optical readout . \n the systematic errors can be reduced by improving detector uniformity and using smaller ccd pixel bins .    the reduced attenuation coefficient ( @xmath25 ) is measured by collecting charge created by a collimated x -

numerical simulations ( bate et al . \n 2003 ) propose that the dynamical interactions that eject brown dwarfs also truncate their disks , making them relatively small and of low mass . \n a testable prediction of such models is that brown dwarf disks dissipate faster . \n [ [ the - sigmaorionis - cluster ] ] the @xmath0orionis cluster + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath0orionis is a trapezium - like system with an o9.5v primary . \n the population of low - mass stars spatially clustered around this system was discovered as bright sources in rosat x - ray images , and follow - up optical spectroscopy confirmed most sources as pms stars ( walter et al . \n this association is young , nearby and affected by low reddening , making it an ideal target to analyse the pms population , even down to brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects . \n the main goal of the work we summarise here is to probe the properties of the pms population in the @xmath0ori cluster , establishing a representative sample of cluster members and analysing the frequency and properties of circumstellar disks . \n [ [ photometric - surveys ] ] photometric surveys + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    firstly , it is necessary to identify the low - mass pms content near @xmath0ori . \n fig.1 ( left ) shows an @xmath1 colour - magnitude diagram , obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , where the pms stars can be seen separated from the bulk of the contamination . \n it was based on this diagram that targets were identified for follow - up spectroscopy . \n the figure also shows ( right ) the @xmath5 colour - magnitude diagram for cluster members  j - magnitude comes from the 2mass database . \n it shows most of the ( over 100 ) cluster members identified so far , either by us ( see below ) or from the literature ( e.g.  bjar et al . 2001 ;

barrado y navascus 2003 ) that at most 10% of the cluster members exhibit a k - band excess that could indicate the presence of a circumstellar disk . \n however , a k - band excess is an unreliable disk indicator . \n it depends strongly on the inner disk temperature ; in particular for the lower mass stars , there is evidence that their disks are not hot enough to produce significant k - band excess ( natta & testi 2001 ; comern et al . \n 2000 ) .      at longer wavelengths , \n infrared excesses grow rapidly thus l - band observations are the most reliable and efficient way to detect circumstellar disks , down to the substellar regime . \n we have a program to observe all known @xmath0ori cluster members in the l - band ( and also in the k - band to avoid uncertainties related with variability , carpenter et al . \n 2002 ) ; we have obtained data in january 2003 with the newly installed uist at the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . \n due to adverse weather conditions we could only perform about 30% of the program , observing the targets in the mass range 0.2@xmath61.0m@xmath3 . \n we have since then been allocated more observing time at ukirt to complete this program . \n + fig.2 shows colour - colour diagrams for the sample observed at ukirt . on the top left \n is the 2mass @xmath10 diagram ; only one object has a significant k - band excess , indicative of a circumstellar disk . \n the situation changes dramatically in the @xmath11 diagram ( top right ) where many stars seem to exhibit @xmath12 excess , evidence of circumstellar disks . \n a very revealing diagram is @xmath13 ( bottom ) . both photometric variability in i- and j - band and reddening would move an object s position almost horizontally in this diagram , while a disk excess moves an object vertically . \n this means that the diagnostic value of this diagram for the detection of disks is for all effects insensitive to variability and reddening . \n at least 30% of the objects seem to have an excess that indicates the presence of a circumstellar disk , but this value might be as high as 50% . only the computation of the intrinsic colour for each object will reveal the true percentage of objects with an excess ( oliveira et al . \n 2003 in preparation ) . \n l - band observations are adequate for disk surveys , but in order to characterise circumstellar disk properties , observations at even longer wavelengths are necessary . based on estimates from the original iras data for the possible mid - ir emission of pms stars around @xmath0ori \n , we have targetted 12 such objects with timmi2 at the eso 3.6 m telescope to obtain n - band photometry , as well as q - band photometry and n - band spectroscopy for the brightest amongst them . \n + fig.3 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these sources \n . indicated in the upper right corner of each graph is the spectral index @xmath4  that is a measure of the mid - ir excess . \n the three objects on the top row , @xmath0ori itself , @xmath0ori e and a rosat source are the more massive , early spectral type objects . \n their seds are consistent with the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody ( @xmath14 ) , so there is no excess emission . \n the other objects all show an excess at these wavelengths , evidence of circumstellar disks . \n for instance , tx ori has @xmath15 consistent with a classii classification ( classical t tauri star , ctts ) ; the spectrum in the n - band reveals a feature consistent with silicate dust emission at 10@xmath16 m . \n based on the value of @xmath4 , most objects can be classified as classii objects . \n two objects exhibit seds that suggest more complex circumstellar structures : v510ori ( associated with a jet ) has @xmath4 consistent with a flat - spectrum source and iras05358 - 0238 has @xmath4 consistent with a classi source ( an intermediate state between an embedded class0 source and a ctts ) . \n this analysis is described in full in oliveira & van loon ( 2003 in preparation ) . \n we have combined photometric and spectroscopic surveys and identified a very significant number of cluster members , that together with other surveys constitutes a unique sample of pms objects , covering the mass range 0.02@xmath61.0m@xmath3 . \n + we have begun a program to search for cluster members with circumstellar disks in the l - band . \n preliminary results on a representative sample ( 0.2@xmath61.0m@xmath3 ) indicate that at least 30% of @xmath0ori cluster members have circumstellar disks . \n when compared with two other clusters of similar ages ( ngc2264 at @xmath83.2myr and ngc2362 at @xmath85myr ) , a disk frequency of 30% for the @xmath0ori cluster would fit nicely between these two clusters ( disk frequencies respectively 52% and 12% ) , broadly agreeing with the 6myr timescale for all stars to lose their disk as proposed by haisch et al . \n as our l - band survey does not yet reach low enough masses , we are not able to address the issue of mass dependence of disk frequency . \n we intend to continue our program to search for and characterise circumstellar disks around fainter members of the @xmath0ori cluster .    99 baraffe i. , chabrier g. , allard f. , hauschildt p. , 1998 \n , a&a 337 , 403 barrado y navascus d. , bjar v.j.s . , mundt r. et al . , 2003 , \n a&a in press bate m.r . , \n bonnell i.a . , bromm v. , 2003 , mnras 339 , 577 bjar v.j.s . \n , martn e.l . , zapatero osorio m.r . \n et al . , 2001 , \n apj 556 , 830 brown a.g.a . , 2001 , \n rmxac , 1 , 89 carpenter j.m . , \n hillenbrand l.a . \n , skrutskie m.f . \n et al . , 2002 , aj 124 , 1001 comern f. , neuhuser r. , kaas a. , 2000 , a&a 359 , 269 haisch k.e . , lada e.a . , lada c.j . , 2001 , \n apj 553 , 153 natta a. , testi l. , 2001 , a&a 376 , 22 oliveira j.m . \n , jeffries r.d . , kenyon m.j . \n et al . , 2002 , \n a&a 382 , 22 walter f.m . , \n wolk s.j . , freyberg m. , schmitt j.h.m.m.,1997 , mmsai 68 , 1081 walter f.m . , alcala j.m . , neuhauser r. et al . , 2001 , in protostars and planets iv , university of arizona press , eds . mannings v. , boss a.p . , russell s.s . \n , 273 zapatero osorio m.r . \n , bjar v.j.s . \n , martn e.l . \n et al . , 2000 , sci 290 , 103 zapatero osorio m.r . , bjar v.j.s . , pavlenko y. et al . , 2002 , a&a 384 , 937", "StartTimeOffset": 1547355838518, "RequestID": "9bf699a8d417704e87ea53156286baee6016999e", "TotalTokens": 3500}
{"ContextTokens": 2774, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "networks are elegant representations of interactions between individuals in large communities and organizations@xcite . \n these networks are constantly changing according to demands , fashions and flow of ideas@xcite . \n recently there has been a growing interest in the dynamics of complex networks with a focus on pairwise interactions@xcite . \n however , it has often been assumed that the mere existence of a connection in a network implies that transmission of information is complete . \n this assumption is associated with the fact that most studies consider static structures derived from all recorded interactions . \n often it is less interesting though to know whether two individuals are connected at some point in time and space than it is to quantify the volatility of the link connecting them . \n ( s.d . ) . \n panel b ) and c ) show the temporal variation in the tweet rates of three international brands . in the time signal in panel c ) there is a clear intermittent fluctuation in the overall signal while at the same time there is an underlying periodic variation over days and weeks . \n panel b ) shows the corresponding distributions of the tweet rate change @xmath0 measured in hourly intervals . ]    the rapidly growing flux of information through online media permits an unprecedented analysis of human behavior and interactions@xcite . \n these interactions can be monitored in real time with a high level of detail via social media such as twitter@xcite . \n twitter is a micro - blogging universe where registered users can submit small pieces of information , named `` tweets '' , to an online stream . \n the length of a tweet is limited to 140 characters and the content ranges from personal information to massively distributed advertisements or political messages . \n twitter has a potentially huge reach and is used by an increasing number of companies and political organizations to disseminate news .    ) . only links with a strength larger than 0.004 \n are shown . \n the network is strongly modular and individual modules have been identified using the spin - glass method@xcite . in panel \n b ) , a similar network over major cities in the usa is shown . \n links with a strength larger 0.004 are shown . in both panels \n pairwise tweet - rates were collected throughout november 2010 and an averaged similarity measures were computed . ] \n current tweet rates were measured by submitting repeated search queries to twitter . for each query , up to 1500 of the latest tweets were returned and based on the time interval over which they appeared a rate was calculated . \n samples were performed during a 4 month period , november 2010 to february 2011 . \n users of twitter have the opportunity to actively follow and re - post tweets , socalled retweets , of other users . \n the rate by which a given tweet or user is retweeted provides an instantaneous measure on the community s interest in a given subject . \n the distribution @xmath1 of retweet rates @xmath2 of specific tweets and users are shown in fig .  1 . \n both distributions have a scale free form on up to five orders of magnitude with an exponent @xmath3 ( s.d . ) , i.e. @xmath4 . \n the scale free distribution strongly indicates that the community s interest in a given user or subject is self - organizing@xcite and as a consequence leads to avalanches of retweet rates of all sizes . \n avalanches are often associated with an intermittent dynamics where large to extreme events are interrupted by longer periods of quiescent behavior . \n this is confirmed by the distribution of the tweet rate change @xmath0 measured in hourly intervals . \n the distribution has a clear stretched exponential tail fig . \n similar heavy - tail distributions are observed in a number of other systems which show intermittent temporal dynamics . \n examples are fully developed turbulence and time series of economical indices @xcite . \n the impact of a current subject is influenced by the collective behavior of individuals in social networks . \n for instance , the constant stream of information can be used to monitor the real - time popularity of different topics . \n moreover , correlations between topics can be measured by analyzing the content of individual tweets , i.e. related topics are likely to appear simultaneously in a tweet as well as in associated retweets . \n specifically , we have analyzed correlations within three widely different categories : 1 ) international brands , 2 ) nouns and 3 ) major cities in the usa . \n we compiled a list of 100 popular international brands representing top companies in different categories and used a list of the 50 largest cities in the usa . \n similarly random samples were taken from a list of 2000 common nouns of the english language . \n the similarity of two entities @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined in terms of the rate @xmath7 by which tweets contain both @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n for example , by considering queries to twitter containing the terms `` google '' and `` microsoft '' , we get @xmath8 per hour and @xmath9 per hour whereas @xmath10 per hour ( january 2011 ) . a normalized symmetric measure of similarity \n is naturally defined by @xmath11 in fig . \n 2 we present networks of international brands and usa major cities created by this measure . \n the network of brands is strongly modular with groups of brands representing similar products . \n however , some links reveal non - trivial relations between selected brands . for cities \n the similarity network provides an alternative map where individual cities only to some extent are grouped according to their geographical location . \n the network is dominated by a central module consisting of new york , chicago , atlanta , los angeles and boston . \n this is not surprising as these cities are hubs in the american society . in the lower right part \n , we observe californian cities in a module that connects naturally to cities like denver and seattle . \n we also detect a module of east - coast to mid - western cities connecting to a module of southern cities . \n ( s.d . ) . \n the dashed line is a guide to the eye and corresponds to the computed exponent . \n the inset shows distributions of tweet rates of single brands ( purple circles ) , major us cities ( blue triangles ) and english nouns ( green squares ) . \n although there is no clear scaling of these distributions we have inserted the same line as in the main panel for comparison . ]    in social media , international brands and to some extent us cities are of global common interest . \n fashions spontaneously emerge over a short time span in terms of a collective awareness in the network . \n we therefore expect that correlations between current fashions reflect how the awareness percolates on the social network . as a main result , \n we obtain scale free distributions of the pair - wise tweet rates @xmath7 over six orders of magnitude using brands , nouns as well as major cities , see fig . \n surprisingly , the distributions are all defined by the same scaling exponent @xmath12 ( s.d . ) . \n the distribution of the tweet rates of individual search terms @xmath5 , @xmath13 , does not follow a clear scale invariant distribution ( see inset of fig .  3 ) and \n correlations cause the tweet - rate of pairs @xmath7 not to be proportional to the product @xmath14 . \n in particular we notice that if the distribution of the rates @xmath15 could be approximated by a scale invariant distribution @xmath16 , we get that the product @xmath17 would follow a distribution @xmath18 the logarithmic correction to scaling does not fit the data of fig .  3 \n , e.g.  a best fit gives an exponent @xmath19 significantly larger than expected from the distributions of the tweet rates @xmath15 of individual search terms shown in the inset of fig . \n we attribute this observation to the interactions between individuals of the social network which generate a common perception of related entities . in other words \n , there is an amplification of the frequency by which e.g. certain brands appear together in a tweet . performing a similar analysis using search engines such as google and bing , we achieve different distributions ( see fig . \n in contradistinction to social media , the search engines integrate over a long time and include results from widely different media . moreover the search engines include results from web pages which are not restricted in size like the tweets . \n the results can be put into further perspective by considering correlations of nouns in a different context . in sentences of novels by e.g. mark twain ( huckleberry finn ) and herman \n melville ( moby - dick ) , we recover scale free distributions with significantly larger exponents ( see fig . \n the sentences have a typical length comparable to the 140 characters of a tweet . \n however , a novel is written by a single author and typically exhibits a more formal structure compared to the text messages created by online interactions between many individuals . \n the unique self - organizing behavior of users of social media appears to initiate a cascade dynamics which widens the distributions and lowers the scaling exponent relative to that of novels . \n a deeper understanding of this effect calls for an uncovering of mechanisms behind human communication on online media . \n social media have become vital channels for advertising as well as disseminating news and political opinions , therefore this understanding will have significant potential not only in several branches of science but also for commercial purposes . \n the fact that the complex communication patterns appear to be universal indicates that the information flow on social media is a reflection of basic human behaviour . \n ( huckleberry finn ) and @xmath20(s.d . ) \n ( moby -

{"ContextTokens": 3524, "GeneratedTokens": 215, "SynthesizedBody": "infrared stellar spectroscopy is becoming increasingly important with the advent of better infrared ( ir ) detectors on ground  based and satellite  borne spectrographs . \n however , at present the analysis of expensively acquired ir astrophysical spectra is restricted to the study of molecular bands and a small number of atomic transitions in the near ir . a significant restriction on \n the analysis is the lack of accurate laboratory determined atomic oscillator strengths in the ir . \n the need for accurate ir atomic oscillator strengths is particularly acute for the study of cool stars and brown dwarfs whose energy distribution peaks in the ir . \n accurate oscillator strengths for specific neutral atoms are thus needed to determine fundamental properties , such as effective temperature , metallicity and surface gravity @xcite . \n the current laboratory atomic database for ti i is particularly poor in the infrared . \n the longest wavelength spectral line with a measured oscillator strength is 1.06  @xmath7 m @xcite . in the wavelength region above 1.06  @xmath7 m , the only available oscillator strengths are derived from the semi - empirical calculations of @xcite . \n however , theoretical and semi  empirical predictions of oscillator strengths are difficult to calculate to the accuracy required for abundance determinations ( uncertainty of 10 to 20 per cent ) especially for weak transitions that may be the only useable lines for the analysis of astrophysical spectra . \n the most recent compilation of ti i oscillator strengths is the work by @xcite , which includes the visible to near ir study by @xcite and @xcite . \n the blackwell oscillator strengths were re - examined by @xcite who recommended that they be increased by 0.056  dex , or 14 per cent . since then , @xcite have published experimentally measured oscillator strengths with uncertainties of about 10 per cent for some even parity levels . \n experimental lifetime measurements on ti i have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite using time resolved laser induced fluorescence ( lif ) . despite the extensive work by @xcite , no experimental lifetimes have been published for the low lying levels , z  @xmath3d@xmath4 . \n however , transitions from the z@xmath8d@xmath4 levels are some of the strongest features in the ir ti i spectrum , and our new measurements have been carried out to obtain accurate laboratory oscillator strengths for these transitions . \n the transitions measured in the current work are a selection of strong ti i lines observed in the near ir that are of importance to the analysis of ultracool dwarf stars , as outlined in @xcite . \n we have measured branching fractions for 88 lines from 465.777 to @xmath9 nm using high resolution fourier transform spectroscopy . to place the relative line intensities on an absolute scale , we have measured 13 level lifetimes using time resolved lif and combined these with the branching fractions to yield 88 oscillator strengths , 67 of these being measured for the first time . \n the oscillator strengths have been determined by combining accurate branching fractions with level lifetime measurements . \n the branching fraction , bf@xmath10 , for a transition between upper energy level @xmath11 and lower energy level @xmath12 is defined as the ratio of its transition probability , a@xmath10 , to the sum of the transition probabilities of all the possible lines from the same upper level : @xmath13    where i@xmath10 is the photon intensity of the spectral line . \n the lifetime , @xmath14 , of the upper level is the inverse sum of the transition probabilities for all lines from the upper level : @xmath15    the transition probability for a line is then defined in terms of bf@xmath10 and @xmath14 as : @xmath16    we have used the branching fractions and level lifetime technique as outlined above to determine oscillator strengths ; the experimental details are described in the following sections . \n the ti i spectrum was measured using two spectrometers : the visible to ir ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath19 ) region was recorded at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) using the nist 2 m fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) @xcite ; and in the visible to uv ( @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xmath19 ) at imperial college ( ic ) using the ic uv fts @xcite . \n the light source used for both the nist and ic measurements was a water cooled hollow cathode lamp ( hcl ) @xcite . a pure ti ( 99.99 per cent ) cathode was used in the hcl , with either ar or ne as a buffer gas , to produce a stable source for the ti i emission spectrum . \n the optimum running conditions for the ti hcl were found to be 100  pa of ar at a current of 500  ma , and 370  pa of ne at a current of 500  ma . to check for self absorption in the main high current measurements , \n additional low current measurements were recorded with a ne buffer gas at 200  ma and at a pressure of 345  pa . branching fractions were determined using both the spectra recorded with low and high hcl current as discussed by @xcite . \n the branching fractions agreed to within the experimental uncertainties , indicating that no self - absorption was present . \n a summary of the spectra recorded is given in table [ summary ] . \n [ cols=\">,>,<,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     it can be seen that our results are consistent with previous experimental measurements for both the weaker and stronger transitions . of the previous 21 laboratory determined oscillator strengths in table [ osc ] , \n 16 agree to within the experimental uncertainties of both measurements . \n although most of our measurements agree well with the oscillator strengths of @xcite that have been revised by @xcite , the four ir transitions from the z  @xmath22d@xmath4 levels measured by @xcite are 56 per cent ( 0.25 dex ) weaker than our measurements . this may be the result of non  thermal equilibrium effects in the king furnace technique used by @xcite or an inaccuracy in the measured furnace temperature for the near ir oscillator strengths . \n it was noted by @xcite that these 4 lines gave a solar titanium abundance that was 0.15 dex ( 40 per cent ) higher than the lines at shorter wavelengths , and they attributed this to blends in the solar spectrum . \n although their values agreed well with @xcite , the more recent calculations of @xcite show much better agreement with our data than those of @xcite . \n our oscillator strengths for the transitions from the z  @xmath22d@xmath4 levels agree with the calculations of @xcite and to within uncertainties of the experimental measurements of @xcite and @xcite . \n therefore we believe that the near ir oscillator strengths of @xcite should be reduced by 0.25 dex . \n the new ti i oscillator strengths presented in table [ osc ] include transitions listed by @xcite as important for the analysis of ultra cool dwarf stars . in total , five of the new oscillator strengths are listed by @xcite as first priority transitions , thirteen are listed as second priority and three as third priority . in fig . \n [ starspec ] , we show an observed spectrum of the m2 dwarf gj806 . the spectrum was acquired by @xcite using the _ nirspec _ instrument on the keck telescope and has a resolution of @xmath23 . \n the theoretical spectrum was generated by the wita6 programme @xcite , and used the nextgen model structures supplied by @xcite . \n the theoretical spectrum was computed with a wavelength step of 0.001 nm and convolved with a gaussian to match the instrumental broadening . \n the ti i lines identified in fig . \n [ starspec ] have also been measured in the laboratory to determine accurate oscillator strengths , see table [ osc ] . \n the experimental values are the first laboratory determined oscillator strengths for these transitions , which are all identified as priority 1 lines by @xcite . \n this prioritization is an indication that they are amongst the relatively few identifiable atomic lines that are predicted to be observable and suitable for the high precision analysis of cool stars and brown dwarfs . whilst the ti i lines are clearly the strongest features in the observed spectrum and are reasonably well fitted in fig . \n [ starspec ] , it can also be seen that the continuum is rather poorly described \n . a better fit of the continuum would benefit from a line - by - line identification of the species responsible . \n in particular , scrutiny should be made of the large numbers of molecular water vapour lines expected to be present in this region as indicated by @xcite . a detailed analysis of this observational spectrum , and others that we are acquiring in wavelength regions containing ti i lines with experimentally determined oscillator strengths , will be the subject of a further paper ( lyubchik et al . \n , in preparation ) . \n experimental oscillator strengths have been determined for 88 lines of ti i in the visible and ir regions of the spectrum . \n sixty six of these transitions have no previous experimental oscillator strengths . \n the uncertainty in the oscillator strengths is 10 to 15 per cent for the stronger transitions , and for all oscillator strengths in table [ osc ] the uncertainty has been reduced to @xmath24 25 per cent .    in the ir region \n @xmath5 @xmath6 1.0 @xmath7 m , 50 new oscillator strengths have been measured , including those identified as high priority by @xcite . \n we show that some of these features are readily identifiable in cool star spectra and are likely to be of substantial interest for measurement of effective temperatures , gravities and metallicities . \n it can be seen that oscillator strengths for transitions in the infrared region @xmath5 @xmath6 1.0 @xmath7 m show a marked deviation from the semi  empirical calculations of @xcite , which were the only available data for these lines prior to our work . whilst theoretical calculations provide important data in regions of the spectrum where experimental data are not available \n , it is important to note that significant differences between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements do occur . in particular , for weaker transitions , caution should be exercised when relying solely on theoretical calculations for oscillator strengths . \n this is of particular importance for the analysis of cool stars and brown dwarfs where visible transitions are too weak to be of diagnostic value and oscillator strengths in the ir are required . \n rbw and jcp gratefully acknowledge the financial support of pparc of the uk and the leverhulme trust . \n gn acknowledges the financial support of the national aeronautical and space administration under inter -

{"ContextTokens": 3805, "GeneratedTokens": 107, "SynthesizedBody": "pentacene as well as other members of the acene family are famous organic semiconductors . \n single crystals of these materials can be grown in a very high quality , and thus very high charge carrier mobilities could be achieved in e.g. pentacene and tetracene @xcite . these have been exploited in organic field effect transistors in view of fundamental as well as applied aspects @xcite . \n in fact , such materials are very promising for a wide range of applications , for instance , in ( opto)electronic devices such as field - effect transistors @xcite , light - emitting diodes @xcite , and photovoltaic cells @xcite . \n the schematic representation of the molecular structure of the aromatic hydrocarbons investigated in this paper is shown in fig.[f1 ] . \n tetracene and pentacene belong to the so - called acenes and are characterized by a linear arrangement of the benzene rings . in contrast , chrysene and picene are close relatives but the benzene rings are arranged in a zigzag manner as depicted in fig.[f1 ] lower panel . the latter have received increasing attention recently due to the observation of superconductivity in alkali doped hydrocarbon crystals , among them picene , with relatively high transition temperatures to the superconducting state @xcite . in all cases the molecules in the solid arrange in a herringbone manner which is typical for many aromatic hydrocarbon molecular solids and can be seen as a consequence of the densest possible packing of the molecules within the crystal with the least possible repulsion .    in this contribution we present an investigation of the electronic excitation spectra of tetracene , pentacene , chrysene and picene single crystals , which have been measured using electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in transmission . \n this technique can probe the excitations as a function of energy and momentum , which allows additional information on the nature of electronic excitations as compared to optical studies @xcite . \n we demonstrate that the excitation spectra of chrysene and picene on the one hand , and tetracene and pentacene on the other hand differ substantially . \n moreover , we discuss the importance of charge - transfer excitations at low energies . \n pentacene single crystals with a high quality and typical crystal dimensions of 5 - 15 mm length , 2 - 5 mm width , and 0.05 - 0.25 mm thickness were obtained via a directional sublimation of two or three times purified pentacene ( fluka ) . \n the crystal growth was carried out at temperatures between 280@xmath0 and 220@xmath0 in closed , evacuated pyrex ampoules and a horizontal two - zone furnace was used . \n the growth procedure lasted about four to six weeks . in case of tetracene ( sigma - aldrich chemie gmbh ) \n , single crystals were synthesized via physical transport in an inert gas stream ( argon and hydrogen mixture ) , whereas the sublimation occurred at about 300@xmath0 in the hot zone of the furnace and the tetracene single crystals were grown at a temperature of about 150 - 200@xmath0 . to obatin \n well defined and large crystals ( dimension of 10 mm x 7 mm x 0.1 mm ) the crystal growth lasted between one and six hours . \n the chrysene and picene single crystals ( both sigma - aldrich chemie gmbh ) were prepared via physical vapor growth in a vertical geometry . \n chrysene as well as picene were sublimed from a glass surface and the crystal growth occurred on a al foil on top . \n the growth lasted 12 hours and resulted in very thin , singly - crystalline platelets with typical dimensions of about 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm x 100 nm .    our eels investigations require thin samples ( thickness @xmath1 100 nm ) which in the case of tetracene and pentacene were cut from the flat surface of a single crystal platelet with an ultramicrotome using a diamond knife . \n the as - grown picene and chrysene crystals were thin enough and could be used without further preparation . \n all samples were attached to standard electron microscopy grids @xcite , mounted into a sample holder , and transferred into the eels spectrometer . \n all eels measurements were carried out using a 172kev spectrometer described elsewhere @xcite . at this high primary beam energy \n only singlet excitations are possible @xcite . \n the energy and momentum resolution were 85mev and 0.03@xmath2 , respectively . \n the eels signal , which is proportional to the loss function @xmath3 ) ) , was determined for momentum transfers , @xmath4 , parallel to the directions of the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors [ @xmath5 is the dielectric function ] . \n moreover , a he flow cryostat allows to cool the sample down to 20k . \n prior to the investigation of the electronic excitations , our films were thoroughly characterized _ in - situ _ using electron diffraction . \n these investigations clearly document that the films are single crystalline and of very good quality . furthermore , as molecular crystals often are damaged by fast electrons , we repeatedly checked our samples for any sign of degradation . \n in particular , degradation was followed by watching an increasing amorphous - like background in the electron diffraction spectra and an increase of spectral weight in the loss function in the energy region below the first excitation feature . \n it turned out that under our measurement conditions the spectra remained unchanged for about 12h . \n samples that showed any signature of degradation were not considered further but replaced by newly prepared thin films . \n the results from the different films have been shown to be reproducible . \n we start the presentation of our results with a comparison of the loss functions for momentum vectors @xmath4 parallel to the reciprocal lattice directions @xmath6 and @xmath7 and a small momentum transfer of 0.1@xmath2 as shown in fig.[f2 ] . at such a small momentum transfer we probe essentially vertical transitions , the so - called optical limit , \n i.e. , a comparison to optical data is possible . \n we note however that our data are measured along the reciprocal lattice directions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which due to the low crystal symmetry of the acene and phenacene crystals are not parallel to the crystal axes @xmath8 and @xmath9 . fig.[f2 ] clearly demonstrates the differences in the electronic excitation spectra of the two types of hydrocarbons . for chrysene and picene \n we observe a broad peak around 4.5ev as well as a pronounced fine structure right after the excitation onset . \n in addition , the optical gap is about 3.3ev for chrysene and 3.2ev for picene , respectively . \n the main features in our spectra are in very good agreement with previous optical absorption data as well as eels studies of crystals or polycrystalline films @xcite . \n often , the low energy electronic excitations in molecular solids are excitons , i.e. bound electron - hole pairs with a sizeable binding energy @xcite . \n this is also true for the two phenacenes studied here since their excitation onset is significantly below the transport energy gap which has been estimated to be about 4.2ev for chrysene and 4ev for picene @xcite . \n the eqiuvalent is true for tetracene and pentacene with transport gaps of about 3.3ev and 2.2ev , respectively @xcite . for many molecular crystals \n it is not unusual that the lowest singlet excitations are split into into davydov components , which arise from the interaction of the excitation dipoles of the symmetrically inequivalent molecules in the crystal unit cell @xcite . \n these davydov components frequently have a particular polarization dependence . \n the spectra for chrysene and picene however as shown in fig.[f2 ] are isotropic in terms of the energy positions , and only some small intensity variations are seen going from the @xmath6 to the @xmath7 directions . thus , our data do not reveal different davydov components . \n this might be related to the rather small spectral weight of the lowest lying excitations in these materials , which could also imply a rather small davydov splitting @xcite . \n going to the linear acene crystals ( lower panels in fig.[f2 ] ) , these observations change substantially . \n the low energy excitations occur at much lower energies , their spectral weight is much larger , and their fine structure is significantly different . from systematic studies in the past of the optical absorption spectra of acenes and phenacenes as a function of the molecule lengths \n it is known that the energy position of these excitations in acenes quite strongly shifts to lower energies upon increasing the molecules , while it remains quite constant in the case of the phenacenes @xcite . \n this is related to the molecular structure and symmetry , which allows a delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of acenes over the entire molecules , while for their counterparts these orbitals remain localized at particular sites of the molecule @xcite . \n this difference in the molecular orbital structures most likely is also responsible for the different excitation probabilities ( intensities ) , since this is directly related to the overlap of these orbitals . in view of the different excitation intensities \n it is also tempting to attribute the clearly observed davydov splitting for tetracene ( with davydov components at about 2.38ev and 2.45ev ) and pentacene ( with davydov components at about 1.84ev and 1.98ev ) to the larger excitation dipoles for acenes . \n however , it has been shown recently that neither the davydov splitting nor the exciton dispersion in acene crystals can be explained on the basis of molecular excitations only , but they can only be understood when an admixture of charge transfer ( ct ) excitations to the molecular ( frenkel ) excitons is taken into account @xcite . \n parallel to the @xmath6-axis . \n the energy position of the main excitation and vibrational satellites in the optical absorption spectra of tetracene and pentacene in solution @xcite are indicated by vertical bares . ]    in the following we would like to concentrate on the contribution of ct excitons to the acene spectra as shown above . in fig.[f3 ] \n we depict a comparison of the excitation spectra for tetracene and pentacene with the momentum vector parallel to the corresponding @xmath6 axis . \n these spectra have been shifted in energy such that the first excitation features coincide and they are normalized to the same peak height of the first feature . \n the excitation spectrum of tetracene consists of the main peak followed by equidistant vibrational satellites as has been also observed on previous optical studies of crystals and films @xcite . \n moreover , this vibrational progression is also seen in optical absorption data of tetracene in solution @xcite , i.e. for individual molecules , and the energy distance of the satellites of about 170mev corresponds well to carbon - carbon stretching vibrations observed using raman scattering @xcite . \n thus , at least on a qualitative level the tetracene excitation spectrum can be rationalized by molecular ( frenkel ) excitons that couple to molecular vibrations . the equivalent picture \n would now be expected for pentacene , since the corresponding vibrations as well as their impact on electronic levels should be very similar for the two molecules . \n fig.[f3 ] however does not support this expectation . instead \n , the pentacene spectrum is characterized by a satellite feature about 270mev above the main excitation . \n this energy distance a far too large to represent a vibrational satellite , and consequently the excitation 270mev above the main feature must be of different origin .    in the light of the discussion above and recent reports in the literature \n we attribute the second excitation feature in the pentacene spectrum as seen in fig.[f3 ] to ct excitations in the pentacene crystal . in general , this assignment is in agreement to electro - absorption data where a ct excitation was reported at about 2.12ev @xcite . \n also , calculations of the electronic polarization in pentacene crystals and the energy of ct states have indicated that such ct states have a binding energy of about 0.7ev , which places them to almost the same energy as the molecular frenkel excitons @xcite . \n given this close excitation energy of frenkel and ct states , they have to interact , i.e. excitation spectroscopy will probe mixed frenkel - ct states . \n indeed , recent advanced calculations of the singlet excitation spectra of acene crystals @xcite and other @xmath10-conjugated molecular crystals @xcite as well as experimental studies @xcite demonstrated that the exact spectral shape can only be understood with the inclusion of ct excitons and their coupling to the molecular frenkel states . upon the basis of these calculations \n it has further been discussed that also the davydov splitting and the exciton dispersion significantly depend on this coupling , and a description of the experimental values only is possible with the inclusion of a substantial ct contribution @xcite . \n interestingly , these calculations also predict that the contribution of the ct excitations to the lowest exciton feature quite significantly varies as a function of the length of the acene molecule . for tetracene \n a 27 % contribution was reported , while for pentacene this contribution is with 48 % much larger . \n such a difference must then also affect the higher lying part of the excitation spectrum , since a mixture / hybridization of frenkel and ct states will result in two mixed states ( of bonding and anti - bonding character ) . \n the resulting mixed character of these states naturally governs the spectral weight of the corresponding excitation taking into account that ( most likely ) the transition dipole of molecular frenkel excitations is much large than that of the ct transitions . \n thus , in a mixed system the higher lying ( former pure ct ) excitation gains in intensity with increasing degree of mixture due to the frenkel contribution in its wave function . \n this now harbors the explanation of the difference of the excitation spectra of tetracene and pentacene as revealed in fig.[f3 ] . \n the interaction in tetracene is not large enough to modify the higher lying part of the spectrum visibly as compared to pure molecular excitations ( as seen in solution ) , while in pentacene a `` new '' excitation feature shows up at about 270mev above the lowest singlet exciton , and we attribute this to the anti - bonding part of the mixed frenkel - ct system . since both parts of the exciton wave function couple to the vibrations of the molecules , the total spectral shape of the electronic excitation spectrum becomes a complex mixture of satellites of electronic as well as vibronic origin , and a detailed analysis requires sophisticated , state - of - the art modelling , which is beyond the scope of this contribution . \n it is interesting to note that calculations based upon density functional theory ( dft ) have predicted that the energetically lowest singlet excitons in pentacene have a predominant charge transfer character , in good correspondence to what we have discussed above @xcite . \n moreover , these dft calculations also predict a dependence of the exciton wave function and its charge - transfer character on the length of the acene molecules @xcite . however , the exact spectral shape as measured has not been reproduced by such calculations . \n finally , coming back to the phenacenes there is an intriguing aspect with respect to the importance of ct states in the excitation spectra . \n while for chrysene all low energy features as observed in fig.[f2 ] or optical data of crystals have a corresponding counterpart in the absorption spectra of individual molecules in solution @xcite , this is not the case for picene . in the latter case \n the 3rd excitation feature at about 3.6ev is not observed in solution @xcite and in addition shows a momentum dependent intensity variation that is substantially different from all other low energy excitations @xcite . \n therefore , the excitation at about 3.6ev in picene has been attributed to a different origin , a predominant ct excitation @xcite . \n this conclusion suggests that there is a kind of universal length dependence of the importance of ct states in the excitation spectra for both the acenes as well as the phenacenes , since only for the longer representatives , picene and pentacene , the ct excitations modify the spectra visibly . \n the low energy excitation spectra of chrysene and picene as well as tetracene and pentacene crystals have been investigated using electron energy - loss spectroscopy measurements at 20k . \n our data reveal a significant difference between the former and the latter two materials . \n while for the phenacenes the excitation onset is characterized by up to five weak excitation features with only small anisotropy and without visible davydov splitting within the @xmath6 , @xmath7 planes , the acene spectra are dominated by a large excitation close to the onset and a sizable davydov splitting . \n we further show that the spectral shape of the pentacene excitation spectrum provides clear evidence for a large admixture of molecular frenkel - type excitons with charge - transfer excitations resulting in excited states with a significantly mixed character . \n this conclusion is in good agreement with recent advanced calculations which predicted a charge - transfer admixture to the lowest singlet excitation which is significantly dependent upon the length of the acene molecules . \n moreover , also for picene and chrysene we observe differences which point towards an increased charge - transfer contribution to the singlet excitation spectrum in the former .", "StartTimeOffset": 1594325556426, "RequestID": "82a087b7ffbb5e90baecc27e412f4f81c0b07e99", "TotalTokens": 3912}

topped response function @xmath24 , with a very sharp fall off at the edges . \n while the photocathode itself is quite uniform , the gain falls off a bit ( 50% ) near the edges of the array , and even more at the four corners . \n however the signal remains clean , and so the gain can be compensated in software . \n four identical drift chambers , placed in pairs upstream and dowstream of the prototype counter , provided tracking for determining the particle trajectory . \n thus , the expected position of the center of each rich ring on the phototube is determined to a resolution of approximately 500 @xmath25 m in both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions . \n in previous tests @xcite , time limitations did not permit a complete filling of the radiator volume with pure . \n our filling system was based on the difference ( factor of six ) in the molecular weights of the fluorocarbon and argon , with the heavy gas displacing the lighter one as it is brought into the bottom of the detector . in reality \n we found that even though the flow of into the detector was slow , some mixing occurs and 100% concentrations can not be reached in a single cycle . \n the measurements reported in our previous publication were done with @xmath28 and @xmath29 argon . \n this time we simply evacuated the radiator volume completely and then filled with pure . \n measurements were made for several particle momenta , over the range @xmath30 , using the ( negative ) secondary beam from the bnl ags accelerator . \n ( the momentum calibration for the beam - line was established in a separate measurement , employing time - of - flight techniques , to an accuracy of better than 0.5% ) . for each setting , \n the tracking information from four drift chambers was used to project the expected ring centers onto the pmt matrix . given this information , a ring - fitting algorithm was employed to find and fit the ring radius on an event by event basis . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : momentum_scan ] , which plots observed ring - radius versus beam momentum for particles thus identified as electrons , muons , and pions . \n the solid curves are calculated for the indicated particles , with the focal length and index of refraction as free parameters . \n both results can be seen to agree well with the known value,@xmath31 , and the calculated index of refraction ( at @xmath8 c , 1 atm @xmath32 nm ) n = 1.001379 ( this index is calculated using measurements in the liquid phase reported in @xcite ) . \n we have investigated the possibility that for larger rings ( r@xmath334.5  cm ) edge - effects may be of importance , resulting in extracted radii somewhat too small . \n for this purpose , the spherical mirror was further rotated by an additional 1@xmath34 to @xmath17=9@xmath34 . \n the projected ring center was therefore moved by 3.4  cm , such that one arc of the ring image was well inside the pmt s photocathode area . \n the results for this comparison are shown in fig . \n [ fig : momentum_scan ] for the electron data at 3  gev / c . \n as can be seen , the effect produces , at most , a minimal displacement in the direction that might have been expected . \n as remarked previously @xcite , the direct determination of the number of photons detected for a given event is precluded by the exponential shape of the pmt single - photon response function . \n instead , we have measured ( over a large number of events ) the statistical variation in the total charge collected per event . the resultant distribution ( @xmath35gaussian ) \n is then fitted to determine the measured mean ( @xmath25 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath36 ) . \n the number of detected photons ( n ) may then be estimated as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is deduced by unfolding the exponential detector response function . \n we thus estimated ( for 12 gev / c pions ) that @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 . \n the predicted behavior of the rich detector proposed for brahms has been investigated and confirmed by these additional measurements with the prototype detector , which were carried out under carefully controlled conditions . \n the imaging capabilities ( see fig .  3 ) and figure of merit @xmath41 are found to be in good agreement with expectations based on the design and performance of the individual components . \n this work was supported by u.s . \n department of energy contract number de - ac02 - 76ch00016 , in part through the r.&d . \n funds of the rhic project , and we thank t.  ludlam for his encouragement in this enterprise .", "StartTimeOffset": 1601929158822, "RequestID": "198fe8b5c20993ee695520ff31f70027e9db5f8f", "TotalTokens": 2138}

momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra of dileptons in urhics at \n the cern sps and bnl rhic will be reviewed . \n the emission rate of dileptons with an invariant mass @xmath2 and three - momentum , @xmath3 , from a medium at temperature @xmath4 is given by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the fine - structure constant , @xmath7 the lepton - phase space factor , @xmath8 the retarded in - medium em current correlator , and @xmath9 the bose - einstein distribution . \n in the vacuum the hadronic em correlator can be inferred from @xmath10 . at low @xmath0 \n it is well - described by the vector dominance model ( vdm ) , including the light vector mesons , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and at higher @xmath14 by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) continuum . \n the theoretical investigation of the dilepton signal in urhics thus must aim at a concise model for the spectral properties of the light vector mesons , most importantly the @xmath11 meson in the iso - vector - vector channel , which give the most important contribution to the em current correlator , and of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec . \n [ sec_medium ] theoretical models for the em current correlator in partonic as well as hot and/or dense hadronic matter are summarized , followed by a comparison to recent dilepton data from the sps in sec . \n [ sec_dileps - hics ] and conclusions and outlook in sec . \n [ sec_concl ] . \n approximate chiral symmetry ( cs ) in the light - quark sector of qcd is one of the most important ingredients for the building of effective hadronic models . in the vacuum and at low temperatures and/or densities \n cs is broken dynamically through the formation of a quark condensate , @xmath15 , leading to the mass splitting of the mass spectra of chiral hadron multiplets . \n one of the most evident manifestations of cs breaking is seen in the measurement of the isovector - vector and -axialvector current correlators through @xmath16-decay data ( @xmath17 : number of pions )  @xcite . \n finite - temperature lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) calculations  @xcite find a melting of the quark condensate with increasing temperature and the restoration of cs above a critical temperature , @xmath18-@xmath19 . \n another finding is that the cs restoration ( csr ) and deconfinement transition temperatures , coincide  @xcite . from these findings \n one expects significant changes of the hadron spectra in a hot and dense medium close to csr .    in the literature , \n two scenarios concerning the manifestation of csr in the hadron spectrum have emerged : in one scenario it has been suggested that due to the melting of the quark condensate hadron masses should drop to @xmath20 at the critical point  @xcite . \n the other mechanism is found in phenomenological hadronic many - body models , where hadron spectral functions show a significant broadening with small mass shifts  @xcite . \n it turns out , however , that both scenarios , i.e. , either dropping masses or the broadening of in - medium hadron widths ( `` melting resonances '' ) are compatible with qcd - sum rule calculations  @xcite . \n thus the dilepton signal in urhics gives an important experimental insight into the nature of the csr through the vector part of the em current correlator . \n since on the other hand a direct measurement of the axialvector correlation function in heavy - ion collisions is difficult , a direct assessment of csr in hic s seems not to be possible . \n thus , a promising theoretical evidence for csr may be achievable by the application of finite - temperature weinberg - sum rules  @xcite which relate moments of the difference of vector and axial - vector spectral functions to order parameters of cs like quark and four - quark condensates , which are in principle accessible in lqcd simulations .    a model - independent approach to the em current correlator is the use of the chiral - reduction formalism based on a low - density ( virial ) expansion  @xcite to evaluate medium modifications with empirical vacuum - vector and axialvector - correlation functions as input . in this approach a mechanism for csr is the mixing of the vector and axialvector correlators through pions in the medium , similar to the `` chiral mixing '' found on the basis of current algebra and pcac  @xcite . \n however , the applicability of such methods is limited to the low - density / temperature region of the medium . \n thus the building of effective hadronic models and the application of quantum - field theory methods becomes necessary to assess the dilepton signal in urhics realistically . \n the most important guideline for building effective hadronic models is cs , e.g. , using ( generalized ) hidden local symmetry  @xcite to describe vector ( and axial - vector ) mesons as gauge bosons . \n recently , it has been shown that within these models cs can be realized in the vector manifestation ( vm ) , leading to a field - theoretical model for the dropping - mass scenario of csr  @xcite . \n however , the same model also admits the usual wigner - weyl realization , where one finds degeneracy of the @xmath11 and @xmath21 spectral functions with little mass shifts  @xcite . in general , this finding suggests that a decision in which way cs is realized in nature and how it is restored can not be achieved from the fundamental principle of cs alone . \n another approach is the use of phenomenological lagrangians which describe the vacuum properties of the vector mesons and evaluate medium modifications of their spectral functions within finite - temperature / density quantum field theory . to account for the strong couplings , \n hadronic many - body theory ( hmbt ) implements non - perturbative techniques like the dressing of , e.g. , the pion propagator in the @xmath11-meson s pion cloud , as well as a resummation of direct interactions of the @xmath11 with mesons and baryons of the medium ( for a review see  @xcite ) . \n one finds small mass shifts of the vector mesons due to many repulsive and attractive interactions with cancellations in the real part of the vector - meson self - energy , but a substantial broadening of their spectral functions . \n an interesting result of the model in ref . \n @xcite is the apparent degeneracy of the pertinent hadronic dilepton - emission rates and that of hard - thermal - loop improved pqcd rates  @xcite at temperatures close to the critical region , @xmath22-@xmath23 , in a kind of `` quark - hadron duality '' , implying csr through `` resonance melting '' . \n this finding is consistent with the smoothness of the isovector quark - number susceptibility in lqcd simulations  @xcite . \n another possibility to assess in - medium properties of vector mesons is to employ empirical scattering amplitudes and dispersion - integral techniques within the @xmath24 approximation for the in - medium selfenergies  @xcite . \n to confront the in - medium em spectral functions from the above models to dilepton @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra in urhics a description of the entire evolution of the produced medium in its hadronic and partonic stages is necessary . \n the success of ( ideal ) hydrodynamics in the evaluation of the bulk of this matter implies local thermal equilibrium , i.e. , the medium can be modeled by an energy - density and collective - flow field . in  @xcite \n a thermal fireball parameterization has been used . after a formation time the hot and dense matter is described as an ideal gas of quarks and gluons , evolving through a mixed phase to a hadron - resonance gas at a transition temperature of @xmath22-@xmath19 . as thermal - model evaluations of particle abundances in urhics indicate , the chemical freeze - out temperature is about @xmath25-@xmath26  @xcite , below which the particle ratios are fixed through the introduction of chemical potentials . the thermal freeze - out temperature , around which also elastic rescatterings cease , occurs at temperatures of @xmath27-@xmath28 . \n the evolution of the medium is parameterized as a cylindrical homogeneous fireball which is longitudinally and radially expanding . \n the temperature is given via the assumption of isentropic expansion and the equation of state of an ideal gas of massless gluons and @xmath29 effective quark flavors with the total entropy fixed by the number of charged particles . \n after a mixed phase , which is described by a standard volume partition , the hadronic phase is modeled as a hadron - resonance gas .    early on , measurements of dilepton @xmath0 spectra in urhics at the sps have shown an indication of medium modifications via an increased yield in the low - mass region ( lmr ) , @xmath30 , compared to expectations from @xmath31 collisions  @xcite . however \n , only the recent precision achieved in the dimuon measurement of the na60 collaboration in @xmath32 in - in collisions  @xcite has made it possible to subtract the `` hadron - decay cocktail '' contribution to obtain the excess spectrum and thus to significantly discriminate between models of the dropping - mass or the resonance - melting scenarios for csr . \n the data clearly favor small mass shifts and a substantial broadening of the vector - meson spectral functions . \n spectrum in @xmath33 in - in collisions  @xcite compared to model calculations in  @xcite . \n right panel : @xmath1 spectra  @xcite in various @xmath0 bins compared to the model in  @xcite ( using eos -

reduction formalism has been applied . for the medium evolution in ( i ) and ( ii ) fireball models are used , while in ( iii ) a hydrodynamical calculation is employed . \n the predicted broadening of the em correlator , particularly in model ( i ) at low masses , is dominated by baryonic excitations of the vector mesons in the medium .    in the same figure , @xmath36 spectra ( @xmath37 ) in different mass bins \n have been compared to the model in  @xcite . \n the latter also contains studies of the sensitivity to uncertainties in ( a ) @xmath38 as determined in present lqcd simulations , and ( b ) @xmath39 as extracted from thermal models for hadron production . \n three equations of state with @xmath40 ( eos - a ) , @xmath41 ( eos - b ) , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( eos - c ) have been used . in eos - c a chemically equilibrated hadronic phase in the temperature region @xmath44 has been assumed . the comparison to the @xmath0 and \n @xmath36 spectra is qualitatively comparable to that of eos - a ( up to small variations of the total dilepton yields which could be readjusted by small changes of the fireball lifetime ) \n . an interesting consequence of this insensitivity to @xmath38 and @xmath39 is that the dimuon spectrum in the intermediate - mass region ( imr ) @xmath45 can be equally well described with models where the dilepton yield is either dominated by radiation from a partonic ( eos - b ) or a hadronic ( eos - c ) source . since the emission in this @xmath0 region is dominated from fireball stages with temperatures around the critical region , @xmath46-@xmath47 , this insensitivity is due to the above described `` parton - hadron duality '' of the dilepton rates within this model . \n thus , a definite conclusion whether the dileptons in the imr are dominated by radiation from a partonic or hadronic medium can only be drawn if a more precise value of @xmath38 is known .    as shown in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig.2 ] the comparison of the effective slopes of the @xmath36 spectra with the corresponding analysis of the na60 data indicates that a larger radial flow of the medium is favored by the data . \n spectra for different equations of state and radial acceleration of the fireball  @xcite , compared to na60 data  @xcite . \n right panel : comparison of the same model  @xcite to recent ceres / na45 dielectron spectra  @xcite in central @xmath48 pb -

pion threshold . \n the comparison of effective hadronic models for in - medium properties of the em current - correlation function with high precision dilepton data in urhics is a promising method to gain insights in the nature of csr . \n models based on hadronic many - body theory , predicting a strong broadening of the vector - meson spectral functions with little mass shifts , are favored by recent measurements compared to those implementing the dropping - mass conjecture . however , a more complete analysis of the generalized hidden - local symmetry model with the vector manifestation of cs , leading to dropping vector and axialvector masses , including baryonic interactions is not available yet . \n the large enhancement of the dilepton yield in the lmr , recently observed by phenix in @xmath49 au - au collisions at rhic  @xcite , to date can not be explained by any of the models which are successful at the sps . \n the extension of the present models to axialvector mesons , constrained by lqcd calculations of chiral order parameters in connection with weinberg sum rules , might help to deduce more direct evidence for csr from the dilepton signal in urhics . \n * acknowledgments . * \n one of us ( hvh ) likes to thank the organizers for the invitation and generous support to attend an exciting conference . \n this work was supported in part by the u.s . \n national science foundation under grant no . phy-0449489 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1617174138432, "RequestID": "cdba3ce07f08fa7ea5370452ff6d502b4a1f22f2", "TotalTokens": 3728}

type approach we study the stability boundary of the homogeneous distribution . to understand the system s behaviour in more detail \n , we perform specific numerical simulations in part two . \n we reveal that selfordered solutions with a constant centre of mass velocity can be realised . \n in addition we show that the system allows for slowing down a fast atomic or molecular beam . in the last part \n we derive expressions which enable to state whether the system settles in a selfordered phase or a carl instability depending on the pump parameters . \n let us consider a large ensemble of @xmath0 polarizable particles within a ring cavity supporting pairs of orthogonally polarized counterpropagating modes . for simplicity , we assume them to be linearly polarizable with a real scalar polarizability . as optically pumped atoms often have tensor polarizabilities , where the two orthogonal polarizations couple to different atomic transitions , the equations below have to be adapted for this case . \n however , for sufficiently large detuning from the optical resonances , we can largely neglect mode mixing due to spontaneous raman transitions to other zeeman levels and thus we simply end up with an effective polarizability for each field mode . \n note that in this case we do not include optical pumping and polarization gradient cooling as in optical molasses . \n when enhanced by cavity feedback this would tend to localize the particles in space as investigated in some earlier work  @xcite . while this is certainly a very interesting generalization and extension of our model , such ordering is a single - particle effect an thus fundamentally different from the collective selfordering dynamics into a lattice structure as studied below .    in a semiclassical point particle description the time evolution of the mode \n amplitudes @xmath1 of the intra cavity field @xmath2 is governed by the equations  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cavity linewidth and @xmath5 denotes the detuning between the pump field ( @xmath6 ) and the cavity modes ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 determines the interaction strength . \n physically , @xmath8 represents the optical potential depth per photon in the cavity as well as the cavity mode frequency shift per particle . in general \n , @xmath8 can be complex but we will restrict our treatment to real @xmath8 , meaning that we only consider dispersive atom - light interactions . \n we approximate the mode functions @xmath9 in the interaction zone as plane waves , so that their polarization is constant . in the following we will only consider four different modes , hence we will change notation from @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and the polarization vectors fulfil the orthogonality relation @xmath13 . \n two counterpropagating , orthogonally polarized modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pumped with amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while the other two modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are only populated by scattered photons . \n this configuration represents only a slight change as compared to standard ring cavity cooling scheme  @xcite , but constitutes a very different situation physically . \n as the two counterpropagating pump fields do not interfere , no prescribed optical lattice is formed and the system is inherently translation invariant . note that imperfect mirrors in principle could lead to scattering between the two polarizations . \n fortunately in a three mirror ring cavity the two orthogonal polarization modes are sufficiently frequency shifted due to the polarization dependent mirror reflection , so that no resonant scattering between the modes will occur . \n the force on a particle within the cavity field is given by the gradient of the optical dipole potential @xmath20 associated with the local field intensity , hence @xmath21 with particle mass @xmath22 . \n we restrict our treatment to the one dimensional motion along the cavity axis , so that @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath24 . under these assumptions eqs .   and   lead to :    @xmath25    [ eqn : modes ]    where @xmath26 defines the orderparameter and @xmath27 is the effective cavity detuning . \n these eqs . \n describe two independent carl geometries with different propagation directions  ( cf . \n [ fig : scheme ] ) which interact via the atomic density inhomogeneities . \n the light induced optical potential explicitly reads : @xmath28    for very large particle numbers the numerical simulation of equations of motion can be achieved only at large computational cost . however , in the limit @xmath29 the dynamics of the gas can , for sufficiently short times be reliably approximated by a vlasov equation ( in 1d )  @xcite @xmath30 for the corresponding one - body phase space distribution function @xmath31 \n . such a treatment misses , however , correlations in the density and field fluctuations which lead to cooling and heating on longer time scales  @xcite . assuming periodic boundary conditions allows to restrict our treatment to the truncated phase space with @xmath32 . \n let us now investigate the coupled dynamics of the field modes and the gas described by eqs .    . \n for a spatially homogeneous particle distribution the system is fully translation invariant and thus @xmath33 . \n for this reason the state defined by , @xmath34 as well as    @xmath35    [ eqn : stationary ]    constitutes a stationary solution of the system  - , regardless of the velocity distribution @xmath36 . \n notice , in the following we only consider thermal ( i.e.  maxwell - boltzmann ) velocity distributions @xmath37 here we introduced the thermal velocity @xmath38 which is connected to the temperature via @xmath39 .    in this stationary state only forward scattering occurs without photon redistribution between the modes and thus there are no forces on the particles . \n only deviations from perfect spatial homogeneity can lead to backscattering and the build - up of an optical lattice . to find out under \n which conditions such deviations are amplified and a subsequent phase transition to an ordered phase can occur , we perform a linear stability analysis following landau  @xcite . as a result \n we find that the steady state   is unstable if and only if the dispersion relation @xmath40 has at least one zero with a positive real part , where @xmath41i(s ) . \n \\label{eqn : dispersion}\\ ] ] in   we defined the total pump parameter @xmath42 and the pump asymmetry @xmath43 according to @xmath44 furthermore , @xmath45 with the recoil velocity  @xmath46 . \n one finds that for every given pump asymmetry there exists a critical total pump parameter @xmath47 such that the homogeneous state is unstable for @xmath48 and stable otherwise .    for equal pump intensities , i.e.  @xmath49 , we recognize that   is almost exactly the same dispersion relation as one obtains for a transversally pumped ring - cavity . \n the only difference is that the wavenumber is multiplied by a factor 2 and the transversal pump - intensity is replaced by the sum of the two pump intensities @xmath42  @xcite . \n obviously there exists a close analogy between the present setup with equal pump strengths and a transversally pumped ring - cavity . as in the latter case there \n appear stable selforganized solutions beyond an instability threshold  @xcite , which is given by @xmath50 the other extreme case , @xmath51 , corresponds to a pure carl instability  @xcite in which case no selforganization can take place . \n the dependence of the critical pump parameter on the pump asymmetry can not be found in closed form . \n nonetheless , solving @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 yields the stability boundary using @xmath55 as parameter ,  cf . \n [ fig : phasediagr ] . \n the central question in the following is whether and under which conditions there occurs selforganization for nonzero pump asymmetries . \n to gain deeper insight into the systems behaviour we have numerically solved the maxwell - vlasov equations  - for an initial condition close to homogeneous in space and a negative effective detuning @xmath56 . \n these simulations confirm our predictions for the @xmath49 case . \n furthermore they reveal that for sufficiently small @xmath43 and above threshold the system does evolve into a selfordered state , albeit one in which the gas possesses a non vanishing centre of mass velocity @xmath57 constant in time . in the process of forming such a travelling wave \n the continuous translation symmetry is broken . as a matter of fact , the gas moves in the direction of the stronger pump beam . \n a )   b )   c )    however , we find that , for a given @xmath42 , as soon as @xmath43 exceeds a certain value , there still occurs a carl instability resulting in a runaway centre of mass velocity . for an illustration of these processes ,  cf . \n [ fig : phsptevo1]-  [ fig : vcm ] . \n a )   b )   c )    while we have started from a particle ensemble at rest up to now and found a moving gas in a steady state , one can turn the idea around and use this setup to efficiently slowing down a cold atomic or molecular beam by collective scattering , improving a similar approach which has already been presented in  @xcite ( see the red curve in  [ fig : vcm ] ) .    . \n sufficiently small @xmath58 ( dashed blue ) leads to a selforganized solution with a constant centre of mass velocity whereas for large @xmath59 ( dash dotted black ) the carl phase is realised which results in an indefinitely increasing centre of mass velocity . \n the solid red curve shows the evolution of the mean velocity for a initial distribution with initially @xmath60 and @xmath49.,width=80 ] \n as we have seen above , in the case of instability and depending on the pump asymmetry , the gas either enters the carl regime , in which the centre of mass is accelerated indefinitely , or it settles in a selfordered , travelling - wave state with a constant phase velocity ( i.e.  centre of mass velocity ) . \n let us therefore investigate this latter type of solution more closely . from equation one deduces that any nonlinear wave with phase velocity @xmath61 must be of the bgk ( bernstein - greene - kruskal ) form  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an arbitrary function . \n furthermore , @xmath64 may depend on @xmath65 only through @xmath66 , which implies that @xmath67 as well as @xmath68 all be independent of time . to actually find the phase velocity from the equations of motion we require @xmath63 , which is obtained as the solution of an initial value problem and thus in general out of reach . \n nevertheless it is possible to deduce a relationship between the phase velocity , the order parameter and the relative pump asymmetry in the form ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 fulfilled by any nonlinear wave solution . from \n we find that for @xmath71 the wave travels in the direction of the stronger pump beam , as long as @xmath72 . \n as soon as the inequality is violated , waves with sufficiently large order parameters propagate in the opposite direction . as such waves \n have never been observed numerically we have reason to expect them to be dynamically unstable . \n hence we stipulate that the order parameter satisfies the bound @xmath73 .    . \n the dark grey region , bounded by  , marks the parameter regime where a warm gas transitions to a bgk state  . \n the dashed black line corresponds to the bound  .,width=245 ]    furthermore , eqn .   allows to conclude that \n if @xmath74 there exists _ no _ bgk - wave solution at all . \n this implies that if the homogeneous solution is unstable and the asymmetry exceeds the bound  , the gas will _ necessarily _ enter the carl regime . \n eqn .   can also be viewed as determining the necessary relative pump asymmetry @xmath75 , which is needed to generate a wave with a prescribed phase velocity @xmath57 and order @xmath76 . \n notice , however , that the necessary total pump strength @xmath42 can not be inferred . \n in particular , in order to stop a beam ( i.e.  to achieve @xmath77 ) the pump asymmetry has to be equal to zero . \n the foregoing statements exhaust the characterization of the bgk solutions in absence of knowing @xmath63 . without going into details we state that for gas with temperature @xmath78 \n , one finds that a bgk - wave will develop as soon as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 . \n \\label{eqn : bgkbound}\\ ] ] the results of the stability analysis and the discussion above are summarized in  [ fig : phasediagr ] . \n we demonstrated that utilizing orthogonally polarized counter propagating modes the physics of light induced selfordering is observable , similarly to the case of a transversely pumped ring resonator . in the case of no pump asymmetry the two setups are fully equivalent  @xcite . \n however , the system considered in this work is more versatile , because , in principle , by the choice of the pump asymmetry , ordered particle distributions with any prescribed centre of mass velocity can be generated . \n therefore the control of the pump intensity allows for controlling the motion of gas particles inside the ring cavity . as a consequence , \n a particle beam can be effectively slowed down and trapped . \n note that a different loss rate for the two polarization modes , as it often appears in practice , can be easily compensated by a correspondingly enlarged pump . \n analogous physics should be present at zero temperature allowing to control and study degenerate quantum gases . \n interesting effects can also be expected in the case of particles in optical lattices . \n here collective scattering from orthogonally polarized modes can be used to gain insight into the particle quantum statistics at minimal perturbation or to induce tailored long - range interactions . \n 22ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 1625034255918, "RequestID": "b5277230ba9e17b973d26af8330d74e5e197da7e", "TotalTokens": 3761}

stellar sources . \n they obtain an upper limit which is @xmath10 . it is interesting however to mention that @xmath9 is comparable to that produced in @xmath11-rays by cosmological grbs ( which are not expected to be absorbed by the intervening backgrounds since the typical photon energy is below 1 mev ) . assuming the efficiency with which electrons ( which ultimately produce the observed photons by synchrotron radiation ) and protons is the same inside the grb fireball \n , the value of @xmath9 quoted above might well be closer to the actual value . \n for this , and other reasons , it is anyway unlikely that our calculations are accurate to better than a factor 3 or so . \n moreover our neutrino event rate calculation might be conservative in this respect . \n the neutrino flux is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a normalization constant that is determined from energy considerations as explained above and in reference @xcite . \n the observed neutrino rates are calculated by folding this generic flux over the distributions of individual bursts in distance , @xmath14 , energy , @xmath15 and boost factor , @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy emitted by a particular grb , @xmath19 its redshift and @xmath0 the boost factor . \n @xmath20 represents the efficiency of detecting a neutrino of energy @xmath21 . \n the first two distributions can be modelled after observations : a cosmological distribution in distance , and an energy distribution which assumes that ten percent of grb produce more energy than average by a factor of ten , and one percent by a factor of 100@xcite . \n most important however are the fluctuations in the @xmath0 factor around its average phenomenological value of @xmath22@xmath23 . \n the fluctuations in @xmath0 affect the efficiency for producing pions in the @xmath24 collisions in the fireball as @xmath25 @xcite , as well as the break energy , @xmath26 , which varies as @xmath27 . \n unfortunately the distribution in @xmath0 can not even be guessed at . nevertheless , it is critical in making quantitative predictions@xcite . \n the physics is clear . in grbs , \n high luminosities are emitted over short times , therefore the large photon density would render grb opaque unless @xmath0 is very large . \n only transparent sources with large boost factors emit photons . \n they are however relatively weak neutrino sources because the actual photon target density in the fireball is diluted by the large lorentz factor . \n an even moderately reduced value of @xmath0 will produce a prolific neutrino source . \n we remind the reader that the results obtained from eq . \n [ eq : folding ] are at variance with the neutrino rate obtained by multiplying the average rate per burst by the number of bursts . even neglecting the all important fluctuations in @xmath0 , there is no such concept as an average grb . \n e.g.for @xmath28 , the correct computation of eq . \n [ eq : folding ] yields a rate of @xmath29 events per km@xmath30 and year , roughly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction obtained by neglecting the observed burst - to - burst fluctuations in distance and energy . \n another consequence of fluctuations is that the signal is dominated by a few very bright bursts , which greatly simplifies their detection . \n as pointed out above , the average neutrino energy varies with the square of boost factor and therefore the calculated event rates , especially their dependence on @xmath0 , is strongly affected by the fact that higher energy neutrinos are preferentially absorbed in the earth before reaching the detector@xcite . \n also this effect has been neglected in all previous calculations . \n for instance , the 75 events just mentioned are reduced by a factor 3 by absorption . \n one should on the other hand remember that by oscillations , a large fraction of @xmath31 can oscillate into @xmath32 which penetrate the earth @xcite . \n it is in this context important to realize that a kilometer - scale detector such as icecube can measure the energy of the neutrinos . \n therefore , signal events can be separated from the low energy atmospheric background by energy measurement , which allows the identifications of neutrinos from all directions and not just in the hemisphere where they pass through the earth . \n we calculate the flux of neutrinos from grb in the fireball model following reference  @xcite . \n the number of protons in the fireball is fixed by the assumption that they are the source of the ultra high energy cosmic rays above @xmath6 ev . \n the results are shown in figure [ grbfluxes ] which shows the @xmath33 flux from grbs for different values of @xmath0 . \n the fluxes have been multiplied by @xmath34 so that they represent the energy emitted in the form of neutrinos . \n notice the variation of the break in the spectrum @xmath26 as @xmath35 . \n also , for values of @xmath0 below @xmath36 100 the fireball becomes opaque to protons and at this point the total amount of energy available for neutrino production is converted . \n the neutrino flux , which roughly scales as @xmath25 , saturates and no longer grows with decreasing boost factor ; see figure [ grbfluxes ] .    as usual @xcite \n , we calculate the event rate per grb by folding the neutrino flux with the probability of detecting a muon produced in a @xmath37 or @xmath38 interaction . \n fluctuations in distance @xmath19 and total grb energy , or fluency , @xmath18 are accounted for by a monte carlo simulation we have developed for this purpose . \n we simulate a large number of grbs at different zenith angles assuming an isotropic distribution and subsequently obtain the event rate per year by assuming 1000 grbs / year . \n absorption of the neutrinos in the earth prior to reaching the detector is taken into account using the density profile of reference @xcite . \n it is also important to implement the fact that above the detector there is a limited column density of atmosphere and ice available for neutrino detection .    in table \n [ numuevents ] we separately show , for different @xmath0 s , the event rate of upgoing , i.e. neutrinos that cross the earth before interacting near the detector , and downgoing neutrinos . \n the first two columns show for comparison the number of events when neither absorption nor the limited amount of target above the detector are taken into account . \n it is clear that both effects play an important role in obtaining the correct event rate . \n this is not surprising : the earth becomes opaque to neutrinos of energy around 100 tev , and the muon range exceeds the @xmath36 2 km vertical depth of the icecube detector at energies around @xmath39 tev . \n .@xmath33 events @xmath40 \n . only fluctuations in distance and energy are taken into account . \n [ numuevents ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n this research was supported in part by the us department of energy under grant de -

mentioned discrete scale invariance in the three - body system . \n its appearance at leading order implies furthermore that two types of one - parameter correlations can be generated within this framework . \n either the three - body counterterm is kept constant while the two - body scattering length is varied or @xmath0 is kept constant while the three - body counterterm is varied . \n one example for each of these types of one - parameter correlations is shown in fig . \n [ fig : opc ] . \n the correlation between the charge radius of the triton and its binding energy is shown in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig : opc ] . \n the two different solid lines correspond to two different choices of fixing the two - body counterterms , the circles and triangles denote faddeev calculations with different potentials , the square denotes the experimental value . the difference between the experimental result and the short -

to - leading order bethe - peierls condition into the hyperangular equation . \n the shift in the binding energy of the @xmath3th bound state can then be found by calculating the integral @xmath13~,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the leading - order wave function of the @xmath3th three - body bound state . \n the second term on the right hand side arises from a three - body force @xmath15 which has been included to regularize the divergent first term . \n the expression is renormalized by demanding that the shift in the binding energy of the state with index @xmath4 is 0 . \n it turns out that this condition leads to the surprising result that the complete three - body spectrum remains unperturbed , i.e. @xmath16 for all @xmath3 . \n this result which was also found numerically by thgersen _ \n @xcite shows that the discrete scaling symmetry in the three - body system constrains the form of higher order corrections strongly . \n effective field theories can be applied to any system in which a separation of scales is present . \n they are not only perfectly suited to calculate observables in a systematic low - energy expansion , but also provide a reliable error estimate and a well - defined domain of applicability . \n an eft appropriate for short - range interactions has been applied to a large variety of physical systems . \n i discussed how this short - range eft can be used to study universal relations in the three - body sector and how range corrections affect the three - body bound state spectrum . \n it is a surprising result that the efimov spectrum in the unitary limit remains unchanged at next - to - leading order \n . it will be interesting to see how a finite range effects the universal relations between different three - body observables such as the relation between the minima in the three - body recombination rate and the binding energy of efimov trimers in the unitary limit \n . it might furthermore be possible to obtain analytic results at next - to - next - to - leading order in the unitary limit . \n the consistent inclusion of finite range corrections is required for future calculations of electroweak reactions in few -

dissipative systems . \n ott , grebogi and york ( ogy )  @xcitedeveloped a method by which chaos can be suppressed by making small time - dependent perturbations in order to shadow one of the infinitely many periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor . \n this method has been extended by many following studies  @xcite and successfully applied to experimental systems  @xcite .    as a result of the absence of attractors in conservative systems and the complex nature of the phase space combining regular and irregular regions , constructing \n an effective method has remained a challenging question . \n lai ding and grebogi ( ldg ) extended the ogy method to hamiltonian systems by incorporating the notion of stable and unstable directions at each periodic point .    in relation to the above question , chandre _ et al . _ \n @xcite have developed a method for constructing barriers in phase space to subdue chaotic behavior for large times . \n this method is based on the introduction of a specifically designed small control term which changes the dynamics from chaotic to regular behavior . \n et al . _ \n @xcite have introduced a method for controlling chaos in two - dimensional hamiltonian system which they called adaptive integrable mode coupling based on the separation of the system into two coupled subsystems one of which is stable and the other unstable ; when the unstable system comes into the vicinity of the integrable system the conditions are reset resulting in an effective adaptive control . \n et al . _ \n @xcite have constructed a method which permits stabilization of kam islands through forward iteration of the orbits , and transforming them into global attractors of the embedded system . \n et al . _ \n @xcite have used a method of adding a small perturbation to modify systems , such as nonlinear plasmas , to follow more regular motion . \n additional efficient methods have been proposed in  @xcite ; some of these methods require tracking the trajectories while others involve the addition of interacting terms for which the criteria are somewhat sensitive . \n geometric approaches for the analysis of the stability of a given hamiltonian have been widely discussed  @xcite , for which curvature of a manifold is associated with stability .    the pioneering work of oloumi and teychenn  @xcite proposes a stabilization method by considering the gaussian curvature of the potential energy as a source of chaos . even if the condition of negative curvature of the potential and instability of the dynamics are not completely equivalent they were able to successfully control the instability by avoidance of negative curvature regions of the potential energy ( ancrp ) .    in this work \n we make use of a recently developed geometrical criterion  @xcite which is highly sensitive to instability in hamiltonian systems , and has been shown to be in complete agreement with the results of the numerical technique of surface of section ( poincar plot ) and more effective than other geometric methods  @xcite . \n this criterion is based on an equivalence between motions generated by hamiltonian in the standard form with quadratic kinematic terms and additive potentials ( which we shall call the _ hamilton _ \n description ) and a hamiltonian in which the dynamics is described by a metric - type function of coordinates multiplying the momenta in bilinear form ( which we shall call the _ gutzwiller _ description )  @xcite . \n the mapping between these equivalent descriptions was first introduced by appel  @xcite . \n the criterion for stability developed in  @xcite establishes an inverse mapping of the motion described completely geometrically in the gutzwiller space back to the hamilton description , carrying with it the covariance under diffeomorphisms that is a property of the gutwiller dynamics . \n the resulting orbits in the hamilton description , with the special choice of coordinates serving as the basis for the appel type relation , reduce to the standard description of the hamilton orbits under the hamilton equations . in general geometric form , as geodesic equations , however , they are subject to analysis in terms of geodesic deviation , and the resulting formula can be reduced to a computation in the special coordinates of a new ( symmetric ) matrix valued criterion for stability  @xcite which has been shown to be very effective in a wide range of examples  @xcite .    in the analysis of these systems \n , it was shown that the presence of negative eigenvalues for the stability matrix in the admissible physical region ( for which @xmath0 ) results in a chaotic type poincar plot . \n since the condition is local in coordinate space , the result necessarily implies some degree of ergodicity . \n there has , however , been no proof that the existence of negative eigenvalues is not strongly associated with the structure of the dynamics more globally , as is often the case , for example , for analytic function theory , where the presence of a complex pole implies a distortion of a relatively large region of the complex plane . the results of our application to the control of dynamical systems , however , indicates that the regions of negative eigenvalue correspond to a very localized phenomena . \n the observed instability they induce appears to be due to the passage of orbits through these regions , and they are not strongly correlated with the more global structure of the dynamics . \n what we have done here is to identify the regions of negative eigenvalue in the coordinate space , and modify the hamiltonian in these regions locally , removing the source of instability either by removing the instability inducing terms or varying the coupling to these terms to bring the hamiltonian closer to an integrable form in these regions . \n the remaining part of the space is left to develop according to the full , nonlinear , symmetry breaking , evolution . the effect on the poincar plots , as we show here , is dramatic . \n this result provides strong evidence that chaotic hamiltonian systems derive their properties from sources that may be thought of as highly localized in the regions of negative eigenvalues for the stability matrix . \n in addition to giving an interesting insight into the nature of hamiltonian chaos , it also provides an effective control method in which the hamiltonian dynamics is left to exercise its full function in a large domain of configurations , but is only constrained in prescribed local regions of the configuration space .    in the next section , \n we review the basic ideas underlying the geometrical criterion , and in the following section we give numerical results for the application of our control procedure for the cases of an oscillator with broken symmetry and a potential which may be derived from the toda form . \n @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 + @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6

generated by @xmath33 , @xmath34 with this becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36    eq . has the form of a geodesic equation , with a truncated connection form  @xcite . \n note that performing parallel transport on the local flat tangent space of the gutzwiller manifold ( for which @xmath21 and @xmath19 are compatible ) , the resulting connection , after raising the tensor index to reach the hamilton manifold , is exactly the `` truncated '' connection .    substituting and into and \n , the kronecker deltas identify the indices of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; the resulting square of the velocity cancels a factor of @xmath39 , leaving the hamilton - newton law derived from the hamilton equations directly from . \n is therefore a geometrically covariant form of the hamilton - newton law , exhibiting what can be considered an underlying geometry of standard hamiltonian motion . \n since the coefficients @xmath40 constitute a connection form , they can be used to construct a covariant derivative . \n it is this covariant derivative which must be used to compute the rate of transport of the geodesic deviation @xmath41 along the ( approximately common ) motion of neighboring orbits in the hamilton manifold , since it follows the geometrical structure of the geodesic curves on @xmath42 . \n the relation @xmath43 obtained from , can be factorized in terms of the covariant derivative @xmath44 one obtains @xmath45 where the index @xmath46 refers to the connection , and @xmath47 corresponds to the curvature associated with the connection form @xmath40 this expression does not coincide with the curvature of the gutzwiller manifold ( given by this formula with @xmath48 in place of @xmath49 ) , but is a _ dynamical curvature _ which is appropriate for geodesic motion in @xmath42    with the conformal metric in noncovariant form , ( in the coordinate system in which is defined ) , the dynamical curvature can be written in terms of derivatives of the potential @xmath17 , and the geodesic deviation equation becomes @xmath50 where the matrix @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 , defining a projection into a direction orthogonal to @xmath55 .    instability should occur if at least one of the eigenvalues of @xmath56 is negative , in terms of the second covariant derivatives of the transverse component of the geodesic deviation . \n this condition is easily seen to be equivalent to the same condition imposed on the spectrum of @xmath51 , and is thus independent of the direction of the motion on the orbit . \n the condition implied by the geodesic deviation equation , in terms of covariant derivatives , in which the orbits are viewed geometrically as geodesic motion , is a new condition for instability  @xcite , based on the underlying geometry , for a hamiltonian system of the form , providing new insight into the structure of the unstable and chaotic behavior of hamiltonian dynamical systems . \n the method has been successfully applied to many potential models  @xcite . \n we now apply the method , which is simple and straightforward , since the instability criterion is defined locally in coordinate space , to extract from a chaotic hamiltonian the part of the dynamics in the regions for which @xmath51 has negative eigenvalues which lead to unstable motion . \n we show by direct simulation that this procedure is remarkably effective . \n the results confirm the notion of the locality of our criterion , since the ( local ) removal of parts of the hamiltonian inducing instability by this criterion strongly affects the global stability of the motion . \n in the following we give some examples of hamiltonian motion which are unstable and exhibit chaotic behavior . in two dimensions , the terms in the potential that break rotational symmetry \n have a form , in these examples , that induces chaotic behavior . \n the matrix @xmath51 computed over the physically accessible region exhibits certain regions with negative eigenvalues . \n we have arranged our simulation to replace the hamiltonian _ in the regions of negative eigenvalues _ by a hamiltonian in which the symmetry breaking terms are either removed or for which the coupling coefficient is decreased , but in regions of positive eigenvalues , the hamiltonian remains in its original form . \n the changes are carried in relatively small regions of the configuration space in the neighborhood of the regions of negative eigenvalues . \n we take for illustration here a simple and important case of coupled harmonic oscillators with perturbation @xmath57 and a generalization of the toda potential @xmath58    the first of these is known to generate chaotic behavior ; as we have shown previously , the transition to chaotic behavior as a function of energy and of the coupling to the perturbation is well described by our geometric criterion @xcite . in the present work \n , we set the coupling to the chaos inducing perturbation to zero in the regions for which the geometric criterion results in negative eigenvalues .    in our previous study of the second example eq . \n we studied the sensitivity of the dynamical behavior to the choice of energy @xcite . in the present work , at the energies for which the system exhibits chaotic behavior we have removed the chaos inducing perturbation in the regions for which the geometric criterion results in negative eigenvalues . \n 1 shows the effects on the dynamical behavior of the change of the coupling to a stable value in the regions of negative eigenvalues for the perturbed oscillator potential . \n the results for different values of energy are shown ; these values correspond to different sizes of the physically accessible region . \n note that the radius of the region of positive eigenvalues does not change in this example . \n the first row shows the physical region and the location of negative eigenvalues . \n the interior of the circle corresponds to a region in which no negative eigenvalue occur , chosen in this way to simplify the computation . \n the second row shows the surface of section poincar plot(surface of section ) of the original uncontrolled hamiltonian indicating chaotic dynamics . \n the third row shows the poincar plot generated by the controlled potential : @xmath59    where @xmath60 stands for the radius of the region of positive eigenvalues . \n 2 shows the effect of control on second system , using the controlled potential : @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for the limit ( a horizontal dashed line ) of the region of positive eigenvalues . \n in both cases , for sufficiently high energies the uncontrolled systems become less stable and a chaotic signature appears . \n we examine the method for different values of the energy , all corresponding to chaotic motion of the uncontrolled system . \n one can easily see that the poincar plots in controlled systems present almost completely regular motion . \n we see from these computations that in regions of positive eigenvalues the hamiltonian with chaos inducing terms do not generate instability . \n if the chaos inducing terms are removed or decreased in coupling in the regions of negative eigenvalues , the chaotic motion of the system is reduced or disappears . \n we conclude that the chaotic behavior of the system is associated with local properties of the hamiltonian , and that our local criterion is effective in identifying these regions . \n furthermore , our procedure provides an effective method for control of chaotic systems of this type .", "StartTimeOffset": 1685211361854, "RequestID": "755a552a7684952420134951de4a253d54e56cb4", "TotalTokens": 3479}

off analysis of the passive shielding on board the simbol  x mirror spacecraft ( msc ) is addressed considering both its geometry and composition , with the aim of evaluating the impact of the required mass budget and design on the shielding efficiency and photonic background level . \n since the formation flight architecture avoids the possibility of using the canonical telescope `` tube '' connecting the mirror to the focal plane unit , simbol  x passive shielding system consists of two main parts @xcite : the collimator tube placed on top of the focal plane and an hexagonal passive shield ( sky screen ) around the mirror module ( mm ) .     t lateral dithering . \n ( _ right _ ) : sky screen diameter in function of the collimator height for a perfect shielding.,title=\"fig : \" ]   t lateral dithering . \n ( _ right _ ) : sky screen diameter in function of the collimator height for a perfect shielding.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the passive shielding design must account for the formation flight relative motion , since a lateral dithering between the spacecrafts results in both a collimator walls vignetting effect and a detector opening angle to the unfocused cxb photons . if we assume a collimator height of 2.14 m and a @xmath05 mm dithering , the sky screen diameter required for a perfect shielding is 2.32 m ( see fig . \n [ fig : per_shield ] ) . \n + the msc design is characterized by an hexagonal platform ( fig . \n [ fig : thales ] , left panel ) , with the mm placed inside the thrust cylinder ( fig . \n [ fig : thales ] , right panel ) . \n the adapter , the cone trunk structure , is the interface between the mm and the thrust cylinder . \n the presence of the thrust cylinder around the optics hampers a complete shielding around the mm . \n this region is shielded by coating , using the same passive material of the sky screen , the adapter except for the holes , the contribution of which to the background level must be evaluated . \n the msc passive shielding geometry will thus foresee the sky screen ( an hexagonal plate covering the region around the thrust cylinder ) and the adapter cover ( on the dsc side ) . since the sky screen flat -

{"ContextTokens": 1414, "GeneratedTokens": 261, "SynthesizedBody": "because of their fairly simple geometrical and dynamical structure disk galaxies are the ideal benchmarks to test our theories of galaxy formation , gravity , and cosmology . \n one notable characteristic of disk galaxies is the flatness of their rotation curves , which implies either that ( i ) disks are embedded in a massive dark matter halo , or ( ii ) our theory of gravity is incorrect . \n one theory build around the latter option is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , originally proposed by milgrom ( 1983a ) . in mond a characteristic acceleration @xmath0 is assumed , such that for accelerations @xmath1 the true acceleration @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the standard newtonian acceleration . \n this implies flat rotation curves , with an asymptotic value @xmath4 , without the need for dark matter .    here \n we examine how mond fairs in comparison to cdm when it comes to explaining global properties of disk galaxies in the context of a model for disk galaxy formation . \n a more detailed treatment of the models and results presented here can be found in van den bosch ( 1998 ; 2000 ) and van den bosch & dalcanton ( 2000 ) . here \n we merely summarize some of our results . \n the zero - point , scatter , and slope of the tfr of disk galaxies ( @xmath5 ) all strongly depend on the photometric band in which the tfr is defined . in the near - infrared , where one is least sensitive to dust - extinction and to uncertainties regarding the ages and metallicities of stellar populations \n , one finds @xmath6 ( i.e. , verheijen 1997 ) .    in the cdm scenario , \n one predicts a tfr of the form : @xmath7 ( see van den bosch 2000 and references therein ) with @xmath8 the circular velocity at the virial radius , @xmath9 the mass - to - light ratio of the disk , and @xmath10 a parameter that describes what fraction of the baryons inside the virial radius resides in the disk ( as either stars or cold gas ) . \n thus , @xmath11 is related to the efficiencies of feedback and cooling .    in the case of mond , direct application of the modified acceleration results in a tfr of the form @xmath12 ( see milgrom 1983b ) . \n thus , cdm and mond make distinct predictions regarding the slope @xmath13 of the tfr . \n furthermore , the prediction for mond is in better agreement with the near - infrared tfr . for cdm to yield a tfr as steep \n as observed the process of galaxy formation has to be such that @xmath14 . \n advocates of mond have used this to argue against cdm , as they have claimed that this requires extremely difficult fine - tuning ( i.e , , mcgaugh & de blok 1998a , b ) .    in the upper panels of figure  1 \n we plot the @xmath15-band tfr for the data as well as for three of our models : the @xmath16cdm model , and two mond models ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . as can be seen \n , the @xmath16cdm tfr is as steep as the data ( @xmath19 ) , which we accomplished by adjusting the feedback efficiency . \n thus , indeed some amount of tuning is required in a cdm universe . \n the mond @xmath17 model , which has zero feedback , also reveals a tfr in excellent agreement with the data . \n the mond @xmath18 model , however , in which feedback is included , yields a tfr that is too steep and with too much scatter at the low - mass end . \n the reason for the inclusion of the feedback in this latter model becomes apparent below . \n the panels in the second row of figure  1 plot the gas mass fractions ( @xmath20 ) as function of the absolute magnitude . \n the data reveals a systematic decrease of @xmath21 with increasing magnitude , which is remarkably well reproduced by the models and owes in large part to the stability related threshold densities for star formation used in our models . \n panels in the third row plot the central surface brightness of the disk as function of @xmath22 ( the amplitude of the flat part of the rotation curve ) . \n the data indicates an absence of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies at the low mass end ( indicated by the thin solid line ) . \n this is nicely reproduced by the @xmath16cdm model , and owes to the particular feedback model used . in the mond @xmath17 model , however , no such deficit of low - mass hsb disks is present , in clear contradiction with the data . in model @xmath18 we included feedback , for which we tuned the parameters to reproduce the data . \n note , however , that this model yields a tfr that is too steep . \n finally , in the lower panels of figure  1 we plot the enclosed mass - to - light ratio @xmath23 as function of the local acceleration @xmath24 . here \n @xmath25 is the ` visible ' mass of the disk ( stars and cold gas ) , and @xmath26 is the galactocentric radius . \n each data point represents one resolved measurement in the rotation curve ( rc ) of a disk galaxy . as first pointed out by mcgaugh ( 1998 ) , the observed rcs of galaxies reveal a characteristic acceleration . \n this is evident from the fact that the data in the lower - left panel reveals very little scatter . \n the presence of such a characteristic acceleration is exactly the ` ansatz ' of mond , and , not surprisingly , the mond models @xmath17 and @xmath18 nicely reproduce the data . \n however , the @xmath16cdm model is also in good agreement with the data . \n therefore , the appearance of a characteristic acceleration is not a unique prediction of mond . \n the @xmath16cdm model requires tuning of the feedback parameters to yield a tfr as steep as observed . \n however , once this is achieved the model reproduces the gas mass fractions , the absence of low mass hsb galaxies , and reveals a characteristic acceleration as observed . \n all the particular problems for cdm pointed out by mcgaugh & de blok ( 1998a ) are in fact solved by this one simple tuning . \n the mond models , however , are unable to simultaneously reproduce the tfr and the absence of low - mass hsb disks . \n although we do not consider this a strong proof against mond ( as our particular assumptions underlying the model for galaxy formation might not be valid under mond ) , we do want to emphasize that our results largely remove the claimed advantages of mond over cdm .", "StartTimeOffset": 1701352354788, "RequestID": "b799b9b9708e006e459ecd2e7f2377bcc5708f72", "TotalTokens": 1675}

velocity update equation of the pso algorithm is modified by including the function @xmath0 . \n the addition of evaluation function restricts the particle from moving away from the actual course towards the global best position . \n this addition provides an advantage in computation . \n however , it also constrains the particle to move in a particular direction . to counter this effect \n , we add a craziness term in the velocity update equation . \n the modified velocity update equation is :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants , and @xmath44 is a random value that is varied during each iteration . the value of @xmath42 is chosen such that the term @xmath45 does not take the particle outside the ellipsoid . \n @xmath46 is a random point on the surface of a

@xmath0 . \n the function @xmath50 needs to be evaluated . \n we use @xmath51 instead of using @xmath52 as the objective function . \n the value of @xmath39 is unknown and needs to be arrived at by minimizing the function @xmath0 . \n the value of the function for the @xmath20 particle at the @xmath21 iteration is evaluated as @xmath53    let the present position of the @xmath20 particle be split into the previous position and the velocity vector of the particle . \n @xmath54    here , @xmath36 is fixed and the particle position @xmath55 in the objective function is dependent on the velocity vector @xmath56 . \n so , one possible option for minimizing the function @xmath0 is by changing the direction of the velocity vector of the particle as follows :    @xmath57    thus , the function @xmath0 is minimized if the direction of the velocity vector is as given by eq ( 10 ) . \n the velocity vector update equation ( 2 ) does not have any term relating to minimization , but the modified eq ( 7 ) includes the direction for minimization . \n it improves the convergence rate and thus reduces the computation time . \n the arrow ( for representation purpose ) shown in figure [ theoryexample ] is in the direction of minimizing the function @xmath0 given by eq ( 6 ) .    on the assumption that one end point is known in the shortest path , \n particle swarms are placed in the search space of the other region and the other end point of the shortest path is determined . in order to evaluate the objective function in eq ( 5 ) , we need to determine one end point from region @xmath29 and the other from region @xmath30 . \n two sets of particle swarms , one for each region , are placed within the search spaces of the respective regions . \n the objective function is evaluated based on the particles present in both the regions . in every iteration , \n the best position of a particle in one region is used as the known end point in the shortest path in the velocity update equation of the particles of the other region . \n the objective function reaches its optimal value after several generations .    in the process of optimization \n , some particles may often go out of the search space . to limit the particles within the search space , we inspect after every tentative position update as to whether the particle is lying within the search space by carrying out a check on the qcqp constraints . \n if the intended new position of a particle is going to violate the constraint , then its position is not updated . in other words , the particles likely to go out of the search space are redeployed back to their previous positions . \n the proposed solution may be used in control system problems such as optimization of sensor networks or collaborative data mining , which are based on multiple agents or gradient projection @xcite . \n general consensus problem may be solved using the proposed method , where multiple agents need to reach a common goal @xcite . \n consensus or distributed optimization is discussed in @xcite as ` consensus and sharing ' using alternating direction method of multipliers ( admom ) . \n admom uses one agent for each

the algorithm is ` 10 ' . the proposed algorithm is implemented in matlab . \n .proposed algorithm for qcqp using pso [ cols= \" < \" , ]     the performance of our method is close to that of the variants of svm and is superior to that of the neural network . \n we notice that in iris and wine datasets , the cross - validation error obtained by our technique is better than those achieved by svm with linear and rbf kernels and also the neural network . in pima and thyroid datasets , \n the cross - validation error is high , due to the high degree of correlation . \n we have developed a

   \\2 . \n the vortices remain in the continuum limit but do not influence the physical results ;    \\3 . \n the vortices survive the continuum and play a real role in the dynamics .    in the present work we found that the third possibility is realized . \n it means that the physical functional space should contain singular fields of such a kind . \n let us recall the definition of the simple center projection . \n we consider @xmath0 gluodynamics with the wilson action @xmath6 the sum runs over all the plaquettes of the lattice . \n the plaquette action @xmath7 is defined in the standard way . \n we consider the plaquette variable @xmath8    we can represent @xmath9 as the sum of a closed form @xmath10 for @xmath11 and the form @xmath12 . here \n @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . \n @xmath16    the physical variables depending upon @xmath9 could be expressed through @xmath17 @xmath18 is the center projected link variable .    for each @xmath19 and @xmath18 , @xmath20 is defined as a @xmath21 function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 for each @xmath23 we minimize @xmath25 with respect to @xmath22 , which is fixed locally . \n all links are treated in this way and the procedure is iterated until a global minimum is found . \n geometrically this procedure means the following . \n first we consider the `` negative '' plaquettes ( the plaquettes with negative tr @xmath26 ) . \n the collection of such plaquettes represents a surface with a boundary . \n we add to this surface an additional surface in such a way that the union of the two surfaces is closed . in our procedure \n we choose the additional surface so that it has minimal area . \n in other words , we close the surface constructed from the `` negative '' plaquettes in a minimal way . \n the resulting surface is the worldsheet of the simple center vortex . \n it is obvious that the `` negative '' plaquettes in the continuum limit become the singular configurations of the gauge field . \n thus the simple center vortex is also a singular configuration .    following @xcite we construct the center monopoles ( these objects are known in the condensed matter physics as nexuses ) @xmath27\\ ; { \\rm mod}\\ , 2 . \n \\label{eq.07}\\ ] ] \n the continuum limit of a lattice theory is obtained when we approach the point of the second order phase transition . \n for the theory under consideration this point is @xmath28 , which means that the correlation length @xmath29 tends to infinity for @xmath30 . \n the physical correlation length remains of course the same , but it becomes infinite in lattice units . \n in this situation any physical object of finite length is represented on the lattice by an infinite number of links . \n for example , let us write the physical correlation length in lattice units @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the physical size of a lattice link . \n in order to keep the physical correlation length finite , the lattice spacing scales as @xmath33 and consequently @xmath34 must tend to @xmath35 when we approach the phase transition and our lattice theory approaches the continuum limit . \n this means that the lattice size scales as @xmath36 , when we keep the physical size of the given lattice to be independent of @xmath1 . \n the dependence of the lattice spacing @xmath34 on @xmath1 is called scaling . \n suppose that some physical quantity which is represented by some lattice variable @xmath37 has the dimension @xmath38 in the units of mass , then @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is this variable in the continuum limit . \n thus we have for sufficiently large @xmath1 : @xmath41 a well - known example of such a behavior is the behavior of the string tension : @xmath42 . \n the renormalization group analysis of the continuum theory predicts ( up to two - loop approximation ) the following dependence of the lattice spacing on @xmath1 @xcite @xmath43 this behaviour is known as asymptotic scaling . \n thus we would like to see that for sufficiently large @xmath1 the scaling of the lattice spacing approaches the asymptotic scaling . in practice the asymptotic scaling in @xmath0 theory is not achieved ( at least for the values of @xmath1 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 which we used in the present work ) . \n the deviations of the scaling from the asymptotic scaling for these @xmath1 are well - known . \n one can extract the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath1 from the lattice string tension . in the tab . \n [ tab.01 ] we represent the data from ref . \n @xcite . \n .behaviour of the string tension as a function of @xmath1 : @xmath46 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can check that @xmath32 extracted from this data deviates from @xmath47 for the values of @xmath1 considered . \n it should be mentioned that @xmath48 is independent of the lattice size for sufficiently large lattices . the data in tab . \n [ tab.01 ] is presented for lattices of sizes @xmath49 . \n in this section we consider the definition of a fractal object ( see also refs . \n we shall see that it follows from our considerations in a straightforward way that objects of fractal dimension @xmath50 , as defined below , survive in the continuum limit . \n if a one - dimensional object survives the continuum limit it must have a length . \n we can introduce the following characteristic of this object : the mean length of an object embedded into the unit four - volume , which we denote by @xmath51 . the lattice density of these objects we denote by @xmath52 . then @xmath53 where @xmath22 is the total number of elementary four - cubes covering our object inside a four - dimensional cube of lattice size @xmath54 . \n the physical unit volume contains @xmath55 points of the lattice . \n the length of a linear object consisting of @xmath22 points is @xmath56 , so the length of an object embedded into a four - dimensional cube of lattice size l is @xmath57 . \n thus the length of a physical object scales as @xmath58 . \n it is important for us that @xmath51 is a real physical characteristic of a continuum object and thus it should be independent of @xmath1 in the limit @xmath59 . \n that means that the lattice density of linear object satisfies the equation @xmath60 in the same way we obtain for a 2 - dimensional object surviving the continuum limit : @xmath61 where @xmath52 is again the lattice density of these objects .    for any integer @xmath38 \n we get for the @xmath38 - dimensional object : @xmath62 so , lattice objects with a lattice density that satisfies eq . \n ( [ d ] ) at @xmath63 can be considered as surviving the continuum limit and having the dimension @xmath38 .    when our object satisfies eq . \n ( [ d ] ) with noninteger @xmath50 , we treat it as a fractal object of dimension @xmath38 . \n this point of view becomes transparent after the demonstration that the above definition of the fractal dimension is in accordance with the definition of the hausdorff dimension of a set embedded in four - dimensional space . \n the hausdorff dimension of an object in the four - dimensional continuum is defined in the following way @xcite : consider a four - dimensional cube of fixed physical size . subdivide this cube into @xmath64 different subcubes . \n the number of subcubes covering our object is denoted by @xmath22 . if @xmath65 and @xmath50 at @xmath66 we say that our object has hausdorff dimension @xmath38 . \n how can we represent the subdivision of a cube of some physical size into different numbers of subcubes using the lattice theory ? \n the answer is as follows . \n the subdivision into the infinite number of subcubes is represented via the continuum limit itself ( the lattice theory at @xmath28 ) . \n the lattice theory for finite @xmath1 is not equal to the continuum theory . \n but it becomes closer to the continuum limit when @xmath1 becomes larger . instead of the subdivision of the cube into @xmath64 subcubes in the continuum theory we can use the lattice theory defined on the lattice of size @xmath54 . \n we have already seen that the size of the lattice which represents the same physical volume scales as @xmath67 , where @xmath32 represents the scaled lattice spacing . \n thus the fractal dimension of some object ( up to the difference between the pure continuum theory and it s lattice version for large @xmath1 ) can be extracted from the formula @xmath68 where @xmath22 is the number of cubes , which cover our object inside the lattice of size @xmath54 . \n the difference between the two theories disappears at @xmath66 ( which implies that @xmath69 ) . thus if eq . \n ( [ ld ] ) is valid for @xmath63 , when @xmath54 and @xmath22 are treated as functions of @xmath1 while @xmath38 remains independent of @xmath1 , we can consider @xmath38 to be the fractal dimension of our object existing in the continuum theory .    now \n let us show that an object on the lattice , which density scales for @xmath70 as in eq . \n ( [ d ] ) with @xmath50 can be considered as an object in the continuum with hausdorff dimension @xmath38 . \n the number @xmath22 of subcubes covering the elements of our object is involved into the definition of the lattice density : @xmath71 . \n thus the number of elementary subcubes covering our object inside the four - dimensional cube of some fixed physical size can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath67 . \n we get from eq . \n ( [ d ] ) : @xmath73 thus @xmath74 here @xmath38 is independent of @xmath1 . according to above we \n can treat it as the hausdorff dimension . \n we summarize this section as follows : if an object under consideration has a lattice density which satisfies eq . \n ( [ d ] ) for @xmath63 , we say that this object survives the continuum limit and can be treated as a fractal object of dimension @xmath38 . \n the definition of such a dimension is in accordance with the definition of hausdorff dimension . \n in this section we represent our numerical results . \n we made our simulations using lattices of sizes @xmath75 and @xmath76 . \n we found no difference between the results obtained on those lattices , which is our reason to believe that the lattice size has no influence on the considered quantities at all , for lattices of size @xmath75 and greater . \n the numerical investigation of the lattice density of the simple center vortices and of the center monopoles are represented in fig . \n [ fig.10 ] . \n we represent @xmath52 as a function of @xmath32 . \n the values of @xmath77 for finite particular @xmath1 are represented in the tab . \n [ tab.01 ] . from fig . \n [ fig.10 ] we find that within the errors the dependence is indeed linear @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the density at @xmath80 obtained via the extrapolation of the data from fig . \n [ fig.10 ] . \n for the center monopoles we we find : @xmath81 and for the vortices @xmath82 . \n it is clear now that @xmath83 does not tend to @xmath35 for @xmath70 . \n thus we have , both for the vortices and the monopoles . \n @xmath84 with @xmath85 . \n so we find for our objects a specific behavior of the density . \n it does not vanish for @xmath70 . \n that means according to the previous section , that those objects survive the continuum limit with a fractal dimension equal to @xmath86 . \n it should be mentioned here that the action near the monopole current is greater than the average value of the action calculated over all the lattice . \n the excess varies between 5% and 8% in the interval @xmath87 . \n it means that this object carries energy . \n the monopoles form one big cluster and several small ones . \n this situation is similar to the maximal abelian case@xcite . following this reference we call the large loops infrared and the small ones ultraviolet monopoles . \n the latter are unphysical . \n we found that the fraction of unphysical monopoles amounts to about @xmath88 - @xmath89% of all the monopoles .      to illustrate that the string tension is due to the simple center vortex we consider the configurations for which there are no vortices inside the wilson loop considered . in fig . \n [ fig.20 ] the dependence of the creutz ratio for such configurations on the size of the wilson loop is represented for @xmath90 . \n this creutz ratio vanishes for large size @xmath91 . \n we have found that the same result takes place for all values of @xmath1 . on the other hand , \n the string tension does not vanish in the continuum limit . \n that means that the singular simple center vortices play a real role in the dynamics . \n in this work we are trying to answer the question : `` do singular configurations live in the continuum @xmath0 theory and do they play a real role in the dynamics ? '' \n our answer is `` yes .

{"ContextTokens": 2647, "GeneratedTokens": 161, "SynthesizedBody": "the torus was introduced by @xcite to explain the revelation from spectropolarimetry that type  2 ( narrow - line ) seyfert galaxies can look like type  1 ( broad - line ) seyferts along different lines of sight . since that discovery , the torus primary purpose has been to obscure the broad - line region , but it also serves to explain the near- and mid - infrared ( ir ) emission observed in the vast majority of quasars whose spectral energy distributions ( seds ) indicate dust heated to near sublimation temperatures , presumably by the accretion - disk continuum .    typically , the torus has been modeled as a static , axisymmetric structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) that may have condensations ( clumps or clouds ) within it ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n a notable exception to this paradigm is the dusty wind model of @xcite , who started with a magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind , and added in radiation driving on grains beyond the dust sublimation radius . \n they were motivated in part by the large scale - height of the obscurer required by the observed seyfert  1 to seyfert  2 ratio , the inevitability of radiation driving in the presence of such a strong source of uv photons , and the apparent luminosity - dependent covering fraction of the torus @xcite . since then others ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) have also incorporated some wind component into their models , and/or the effects of ir radiation - pressure in inflating the dusty medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the questions remains : how to test for the existence of this dusty wind ?    in the uv , \n wind signatures are clearly evident in the broad resonance lines of high ionization species such as c  iv . while most apparent in classic p - cygni - like broad absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the asymmetries in the same broad emission lines are also evidence for winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the most natural mechanism for accounting for the high velocities ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ) of the outflows is resonance - line driving by uv continuum photons .    unlike the clear wind signatures in the uv , \n quasar ir spectra are characterized by broad features , such as the silicate emission bumps from the vibrational stretching and bending modes of the grains at 10 and 18  @xmath0 m , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : gall_one ] ) . \n the widths and peaks of the silicate bumps are affected by the grain size distribution , and so extracting information on the velocity of the emitting grains is impossible given the uncertainties in the inherent shape of the bumps . \n narrow atomic features in the ir are from forbidden lines such as [ o  iv ] and [ ne  v ] generated in low density , photoionized gas in the inner parts of the narrow - line region . \n clear spectral signatures of a dusty wind are therefore elusive . \n luminous sdss quasars from the _ spitzer _ irs archive . \n prominent emission features are labeled ; the horizontal bars indicate the approximate location of the broad silicate emission bumps . from hill \n ( in preparation ) . ] \n in the uv , the maximum possible terminal velocity of outflows seen in absorption appears to be set by the uv luminosity @xcite . \n this makes sense for a radiation - driven uv outflow ; a high uv photon density has the ability to transfer more momentum to the ionized wind . \n while this particular mechanism is not relevant in the ir , spectral features in this regime whose strength depends on luminosity are potentially fruitful for looking for evidence of the wind from the dust . \n one such feature is the 35  @xmath0 m bump , which can be successfully modeled as a blackbody with a temperature of 12001500  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n these temperatures are interesting because they are near the grain sublimation temperature of graphites , but higher than the grain sublimation temperature of silicates . \n @xcite first noted that this feature becomes stronger at higher luminosities . \n @xcite confirmed this trend with a much larger sample of sdss quasars with _ \n irac + mips photometry by searching for convex spectra between 1 and 8  @xmath0 m ; the amount of spectral curvature was significantly correlated with luminosity . \n the increasing prominence of the 35  @xmath0 m bump can be qualitatively understood in a wind paradigm , because more luminous quasars will have more radial ir outflows . \n assuming an accretion disk is the source of the optical through x - ray continuum , the dust - driving continuum will always be interior to ( and significantly more compact than ) the dusty wind , and thus act in the radial direction . in this scenario , \n the hottest dust is visible from a larger range of inclination angles in luminous objects . in the uv , an ionized wind launched from the accretion disk at small radii ( @xmath3  cm ) could have a significant vertical component to its acceleration . \n this geometric effect can naturally account for the larger observed fraction of bal quasars ( seen when looking through the uv wind ) compared to type 2 quasars ( seen when the broad - line region is blocked by thick , dusty material ) . \n to investigate the interplay of radiation driving and the ir sed , we have developed a dynamical model of the torus as a dusty wind launched by mhd forces and by radiation pressure from the accretion disk continuum . the dusty wind generated in this manner can cover a large fraction of the sky as seen from the central black hole . \n this model has the benefit of being more self - consistent than static torus models and including the important physics of motion around the black hole and radiative acceleration . \n ultimately , we wish to use this model to understand how the physical properties of dusty winds in quasars correlate with their observable spectral signatures in the ir .    the model and its corresponding code has been expanded from its original form ( described in * ? ? ? \n * ) by @xcite , where a comprehensive account of the model s components and key equations are described . \n we advance on @xcite by adding the continuum opacity of ism dust grains , as specified by the ism dust model @xcite in ` cloudy ` @xcite . \n the radiation pressure on the dust from the central source is very strong  even for cases where l / l@xmath4 , it is approximately 10 times the force required to unbind dust from the gravitational potential @xcite . \n dust grains absorb radially streaming photons originating from the accretion disk , and then cool by radiating isotropically . \n the force , felt by the dust particles due to conservation of momentum , feeds back on the wind structure by bending the magnetic wind from a vertical to more radial structure . \n the radiative force works in conjunction with the magneto - centrifugal forces to accelerate the wind flow and therefore modifies the structure of the outflow . \n after iterating the mhd+radiation pressure calculations to set up the structure of the wind , we use the monte carlo radiative - transfer code mc3d @xcite to send rays through the wind and predict the observed ir seds . \n the input parameters for the wind such as eddington ratio ( @xmath5 ) , black hole mass ( @xmath6 ) , and illuminating continuum ( the empirical optical - to - x - ray composite of @xcite , hereafter r06 ) are varied to investigate their effects on the output sed . \n m bump emission . \n _ right : _ the output ir seds generated by the wind models ;

reaction of magnetic fluctuations on the velocity field . \n the equation for the time evolution of the magnetic field @xmath35 reads @xmath36 where the velocity field obeys the navier - stokes equations  ( [ eq : ns ] ) . in the lagrangian frame \n this equation takes the form @xmath37 again , using the same _ recent fluid deformation _ \n approximation for the resistive term and adding a stochastic forcing , which is as above gaussian and white - in - time , we obtain @xmath38    note that this equation differs from by the transpose in @xmath39 and - more important - the sign of the first term on the right hand side . thus directions , where the magnetic field is stretched , are directions , where the gradient of the passive scalar is compressed and vice versa . \n this very different influence of the stretching term results in a qualitatively different pdf for the magnetic field fluctuations compared to the @xmath34 fluctuations . in order to test \n whether the _ recent fluid deformation _ approach is able to reproduce the different role of the stretching term , we performed direct numerical simulations of kinematic mhd turbulence . here \n , we again performed simulations using the framework latu and the relevant parameters are given in table [ table : paramscalar ] . \n the simulation was started with random initial condition for the magnetic field @xmath35 and an already fully turbulent velocity field . \n external forcing was only applied to the velocity field by keeping the large scale fourier - modes @xmath40 constant . \n the top of figure [ fig : b ] shows the pdf of magnetic field fluctuations calculated using equations ( [ eq : final ] ) and ( [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) . \n this pdf has to be compared to the pdf obtained from direct numerical simulation shown in the bottom of figure [ fig : b ] . \n it is again remarkable that the simple stochastic ode model ( [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) is able to capture correctly the shape of the pdf of magnetic field fluctuations . \n since we considered the kinematic mhd equations in the dynamo regime , the pdf of the stochastic model could not be obtained from a time series as in the case of the passive scalar since the magnetic field is growing exponentially .    to obtain meaningful statistics ensemble averaging \n was used instead of time sampling . \n numerically , a random initial state was generated and integrated a sufficiently large number of time steps , to retain no statistical influence of the initial state . \n the final state enters the statistics and a new realization is generated via another random initial condition . \n the pdf was obtained by sampling over @xmath41 initial conditions .    for illustration of the kinematic dynamo effect and a consistency check with direct numerical simulations of the kinematic mhd equations we tracked the local magnetic energy @xmath42 in figure [ fig : dynamo ] for @xmath43 , a value well in the dynamo regime of the modell . \n for this simulation only the velocity gradient itself was driven by stochastic forcing , as outlined above , while the magnetic field was undriven . \n the forcing amplitude was scaled with @xmath32 , analog to the scaling for a standard random walk . \n + the parameter @xmath14 of the model was chosen to be @xmath44 . \n + the magnetic diffusion time @xmath45 scale is varied to explore the reaction of the dynamo effect . below the critical parameter of approximately @xmath46 we observed no growing magnetic energy . \n the corresponding growth rate , estimated from an exponential growth @xmath47 , is about @xmath48 . \n the growth rate compares well with the growth rate of our dns simulation , where we obtain @xmath49 . \n although the identification of the correct kolmogorov timescale @xmath14 is not without uncertainties , it is remarkable that this value of the growth rate is in the range of data obtained by kinematic dynamo simulations ( see also table i in @xcite and references therein ) . \n in this paper we have shown that the natural extension of the _ recent fluid deformation _ model for navier - stokes turbulence @xcite to the case of fluctuations of the gradient of a passive scalar and to magnetic field fluctuations is able to produce probability distribution functions that agree well with pdfs obtained from direct numerical simulations . \n the pdfs from the stochastic odes ( [ eq : final ] , [ eq : sde_ps ] , [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) are obtained with a fraction of the computing resources necessary for direct numerical simulations . \n the next step is to include the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the fluid flow . \n if this can be managed , then generating magnetic field fluctuations using the _ recent fluid deformation _ model is a tempting alternative for e.g. the problem of cosmic ray propagation where magnetic field fluctuations are generated by other means which are not able to capture intermittency effects ( see @xcite ) . \n + r.g . acknowledges stimulating discussions with l. chevillard during the workshop `` euler equations : 250 years on '' . \n access to the jugene bluegene / p computer at the fz jlich was made available through project hbo22 . \n this work benefited from support through dfg -

{"ContextTokens": 2618, "GeneratedTokens": 249, "SynthesizedBody": "there is a significant body of literature in statistics , econometrics and ecology dealing with the modeling of discrete responses under biased or preferential sampling designs . \n they are particularly popular in the natural sciences when species distributions are studied . \n such sample schemes may reduce the survey cost especially when one of the responses is rare . \n a large part of statistical literature concerns the case - control design , retrospective , choice - based or response - based sampling @xcite . in the simplest case a sample of cases and a sample of controls are available and for each observation a set of `` attributes / covariates '' is observed in both samples . \n then inference is carried out following standard statistical procedures @xcite . \n + a case that has received increasing attention in the literature is the situation where the sample of controls is a random sample from the whole population with information only on the attributes and not on the response @xcite . \n this situation is fairly common in ecological studies where only species presence is recorded when field surveys are carried out . in the ecological literature , since the 1990 s such data are called _ presence only data _ ( see * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n @xcite define presence - only data as `` consisting only of observations of the organism but with no reliable data where the species was not found '' . \n atlases , museum and herbarium records , species lists , incidental observation databases and radio - tracking studies are examples of such data . \n + in recent years we find a considerably growing literature describing approaches to the modeling of this type of data , among the many ecological papers we recall @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , most notably , in the statistical literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . while in @xcite and @xcite to model the presence - only data poisson point processes are considered in the likelihood and bayesian framework respectively , in @xcite and @xcite a modified case - control logistic model is adopted in the likelihood and bayesian perspective respectively , in both papers there is no account for possible dependence structure in the observations . in @xcite \n the asymptotic relations between the two approaches are discussed . \n + a different approach , maxent , is based on the maximum entropy principle @xcite . in maxent \n @xcite the relative entropy between the distribution of covariates at locations where the species is present and the unconditional background distribution of covariates is maximized subject to some constrains concerning empirical statistics ( see philips et al . , 2006 , for details ) . as pointed by @xcite \n `` the maxent method requires knowledge of species prevalence for its estimator of occurrence to be consistent '' . \n + in what follows we are going to use the name _ presence - only data _ when referring to the above sketched general problem of having information on the presence and covariates jointly on a sample from a population , while information on only the covariates is available on any sample from the same population . \n this work is developed in the same discrete setting as in @xcite and @xcite , i.e. , we have a population of independent units , no dependence structure , such as spatial correlation , is anticipated . \n we defer the treatment of this extension to a subsequent work . \n + the main contribution of the paper is a new rigorous formalization of the logistic regression model with presence - only data that allows further insight into the inferential issues . \n this leads us to an algorithmic procedure that , among other results , returns a mcmc approximation of the response prevalence under general knowledge of the process generating the data . \n we also present a large simulation study involving 24,000 simulated datasets and comparing our approach to other two models representing optimal benchmarks . \n + the paper is organized as follows . \n section [ sec : reglog ] introduces a general framework for the presence - only data problems , section [ sec : bayes ] presents our bayesian approach , section [ sec : mcmc ] describes the mcmc algorithm while results related to the simulation study are reported in section [ sec : sim ] . \n finally in section [ sec : conc ] some conclusions are drawn and future developments briefly described . \n the analysis of a binary response related to a set of explicative covariates is usually carried out through the use of the logistic regression where the logit of the conditional probability of occurrence is modeled as a function of covariates . in this section , \n we first introduce a general framework for the modeling of presence - only data and then consider the case of the linear logistic regression . \n the approach proposed is built on two levels and we partially follow the formulation introduced by @xcite but adopting a bayesian scheme as in @xcite . \n let @xmath0 be a binary variable informing on the presence ( @xmath1 ) or absence ( @xmath2 ) of a population s attribute and let @xmath3 denote a set of highly informative , on the same attribute , covariates which are available on the same population . \n then , the presence - only problem can be formalized by considering a censorship mechanism that acts when observing the response @xmath0 , so that part of the population units are not reachable . in particular , we refer to the situation in which we are able to detect only a partial set of units on which the attribute of interest is present while the information on the covariates @xmath4 is available on the entire population . in this situation \n , we have to consider two types of uncertainty : the uncertainty due to the mechanism of censorship and the uncertainty due to the sampling procedure . \n moreover , since we are not able to collect a random sample of observable data , we need to adjust for the sampling mechanism through the use of a case - control scheme @xcite . \n + in order to build a bayesian model , in this framework we adopt the following conceptual scheme in two levels . \n +          let @xmath9 be the subset of @xmath5 where we observe @xmath1 . \n a modified case - control design is applied so that a sample of presences , considered as cases , is selected from @xmath9 and a sample of `` contaminated '' controls @xcite is selected from the whole population @xmath5 , with all the covariates but no information on @xmath0 .      here \n , we can not approach the model construction using only a finite population approach @xcite because of the censoring mechanism that `` masks '' distributional information on @xmath0 already at the population level . by the introduction of level 1 we can describe the censored observations as random quantities generated by the model @xmath8 . \n hence , the problem of presence - only data can be formalized as a problem of missing data @xcite .      at the first level , we assume that the law @xmath8 is defined in terms of the conditional probability of occurrence @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath11 , when the covariates are @xmath12 . \n moreover , we consider that the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is formalized through a regression function @xmath13 on the logit scale @xmath14 that is @xmath15 when the data @xmath7 are independently generated from @xmath8 , we denote by @xmath16 the empirical prevalence of the binary response @xmath0 in @xmath5 , expressed as the ratio of the number of presences @xmath17 to the size of the population , that is @xmath18      at the second level , we adopt a case - control design modified for presence - only data @xcite in order to account for the specific sampling procedure considered . \n the use of the case - control scheme is necessary at all times when it is appropriate to select observations in fixed proportions with respect to the values of the response variable . \n this can occur when the attribute of interest represents a phenomenon that is rare among the units of the population as for example a rare disease or a rare exposure in epidemiological studies @xcite . \n + now , let @xmath19 be a binary indicator of inclusion into the sample ( @xmath20 denotes that a unit is in the sample ) , let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the inclusion probability of the absences and the presences , respectively . under the assumption that , given @xmath0 , the sampling mechanism is independent from the covariates @xmath4 , the conditional probability of occurrence is modified through the bayes rule as @xmath23 hence , the corresponding case - control regression function @xmath24 defined as the logit of is given by @xmath25 in particular , if the selection of cases ( @xmath26 ) and controls ( @xmath27 ) is made independently without replacement , the inclusion probabilities are given in terms of the empirical prevalence @xmath16 by @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that the equation becomes @xmath30 in our framework , since the response variable @xmath0 is already censored at the population level , the standard case - control design can not be adopted but it should be modified in such a way that a sample of presences is matched with an independent sample drawn from the entire population , named the _ background sample _ @xcite . remark that in this sample the response variable is unobserved and only the covariates are available . \n + in this way , the complete sample @xmath31 is composed by a set @xmath32 of @xmath33 independent background data , where the response @xmath0 is not observed , drawn from the entire @xmath5 and by a set @xmath34 of @xmath35 independent observations selected from the sub - population of presences @xmath9 . \n this procedure implies that the reference population @xmath5 is augmented with its subset @xmath9 so that the total number of observations considered in the sampling scheme becomes @xmath36 . to illustrate the sampling framework we are going to adopt here , \n let us consider the following situation : we can label population units of type @xmath37 only when they are isolated from units of type @xmath38 . \n this can be formalized by introducing a binary stratum variable @xmath39 such that @xmath40 indicates when an observation is drawn from the entire population @xmath5 while @xmath41 denotes the sampling from the sub - population @xmath9 . \n remark that @xmath41 implies @xmath1 whilst @xmath40 implies that @xmath0 is an unknown value @xmath42 . \n moreover , by construction @xmath39 is independent from the covariates @xmath4 , given the response @xmath0 . \n the introduction of the variable @xmath39 allows us to define the structure of the data at the population level and at the sample level in terms of presences / absences ( @xmath0 ) and known / unknown data ( @xmath39 ) , as reported in table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] . \n di  lorenzo , b. , farcomeni , a. , and golini , n.

the polytropic eos . in the paper we present results of our studies on late stage of inspiral of binary systems containing equal mass compact stars described by different realistic eos of dense matter . \n the calculations are performed in the framework of _ isenberg -

measured neutron star masses in relativistic binary radio pulsars @xcite . \n we assume that the velocity flow in the stellar interiors is irrotational ( the fluid has zero vorticity in the inertial frame ) since the viscosity of neutron star matter ( or strange star matter ) is far too low to ensure synchronization during the late stage of the inspiral @xcite . \n in fig . 1 we show gravitational mass versus stellar radius for sequences of static compact stars . \n we limit ourselves to neutron stars consisting of nucleons and hyperons and strange quark stars described by the mit bag model . depending on the eos \n we obtain the radius of a 1.35 @xmath5 star in the range 10 -

body calculations ( see @xcite for details ) . \n we note that the equations of state of nuclear matter can be considered static , as the timescales for bulk processes such as viscosity is much longer than the last stages of inspiral considered here .     versus stellar radius @xmath6 for sequences of static neutron stars described by three different nuclear equations of state ( solid lines ) and strange quark stars described by different mit bag models ( dashed lines ) . \n , width=491 ]    strange stars are currently considered as a possible alternative to neutron stars as compact objects ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . \n typically , they are modeled with an eos based on the mit - bag model in which quark confinement is described by an energy term proportional to the volume ( e.g. @xcite ) in which quark confinement is described by an energy term proportional to the volume @xcite . \n there are three physical quantities entering the mit - bag model : the mass of the strange quarks , @xmath7 , the bag constant , @xmath8 , and the strength of the qcd coupling constant @xmath9 . in the framework of this model the quark matter is composed of massless u , d quarks , massive s quarks and electrons . \n strange stars are self - bound objects , having high density ( in the range @xmath10 $ ] @xcite ) at the surface . dashed lines in fig . 1 correspond to sequences of static strange quark stars described by three different sets of parameters of the mit - bag model : * sqs56 * - the standard mit bag model : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; * sqsb60 * - the simplified mit bag model with @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; * sqsb40 * - the  extreme  mit bag model ( relatively low strange quark mass and @xmath8 but high @xmath9 ) : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . \n in the inspiral phase , since the timescale of orbital shrinking due to the emission of gravitational waves is longer than the orbital period , one may consider a binary system to be in a quasi - equilibrium state ( helical killing vector approximation ) . \n for each eos , we construct so called an _ evolutionary sequence _ by calculating a sequence of quasi - equilibrium configurations with fixed baryon mass and decreasing orbital separation . \n we assume that the timescale in which the neutron star adjusts to the current gravitational potential is much shorter that the timescale of the orbital shrinking . \n the present computations of close binary neutron star or strange star systems rely on the assumption of irrotational flow of the fluid and a conformally flat spatial 3-metric ( isenberg - wilson - mathews approximation ) . in order to calculate the last orbits of inspiral phase of binary compact stars we use a numerical code which solves the \n five coupled , nonlinear , elliptic equations for the gravitational field , supplemented by an elliptic equation for the velocity potential of irrotational flows ( see@xcite for a discussion on different boundary conditions in the case of strange stars and neutron stars ) . the code has been already used successfully for calculating the final phase of the inspiral of compact stars @xcite . \n this code is built upon the c++ library lorene ( http://www.lorene.obspm.fr ) . \n the complete description of the resulting general relativistic equations , the whole algorithm , as well numerous tests of the code can be found in @xcite . \n additional tests have been presented in sect . \n iii of @xcite . \n in fig . 2 we show the evolution of equal mass binary neutron stars ( solid lines ) and strange stars ( dashed lines ) having total gravitational mass @xmath20 at infinity . \n the binding energy @xmath21 is defined as the difference between @xmath22 ( arnowitt - deser - misner mass - the total mass - energy of a binary system @xcite ) and the total mass of the system at infinite separation . \n this energy is equal to total energy emitted by a binary system in gravitational waves . \n the frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency . \n comparison of our numerical results with 3rd order pn point masses calculations @xcite reveals a good agreement for small frequencies ( large separations ) . \n the deviation from pn curves at higher frequencies ( smaller separation ) is due to hydrodynamical effects , which are not taken into account in the pn approach . \n a turning point of @xmath21 along an irrotational evolutionary sequence indicates the orbital ( dynamical ) instability @xcite . \n this instability originates both from relativistic effects and hydrodynamical effects . in the case where no turning point of @xmath21 occurs along the sequence , \n the mass - shedding limit ( roche lobe overflow ) marks the end of the inspiral phase of the binary system , since recent dynamical calculations for @xmath23 polytrope have shown that the time to coalescence was shorter than one orbital period for configurations at the mass - shedding limit ( i.e. see @xcite ) . \n thus the physical inspiral of binary compact stars terminates by either the orbital instability ( turning point of @xmath21 ) or the mass - shedding limit . in both cases \n , this defines the _ innermost stable circular orbit ( isco)_. the end of inspiral phase strongly depends on eos - for irrotational neutron star binaries a quasi - equilibrium sequence terminates by mass - shedding limit ( circles at the end of each line in fig 2 ) and for strange stars by orbital instability ( shown as diamonds in fig . \n the differences in the evolution of binary strange stars and neutron stars stem from the fact that strange stars are principally bound by additional force than gravitation : the strong interaction between quarks . \n they are self - bound objects having very high adiabatic index at the stellar surface ( see @xcite ) . \n although the crust of a @xmath24 neutron star contains only a few percent of the stellar mass , this region is easily deformed under the action of the tidal forces resulting from the gravitational field produced by the companion star . \n the end of inspiral phase of binary stars strongly depends on the stiffness of matter in this region . \n the frequency of gravitational waves at the isco is one of potentially observable parameters by the gravitational wave detectors . \n in addition so called `` break frequency '' , a characteristic frequency where the power emitted in gravitational waves decreases measurably @xcite , could be an observable quantity . _ the frequencies of gravitational waves at the depature point from the 3pn aproximation and at the isco strongly depend on the eos . \n _ for irrotational equal mass ( of 1.35 @xmath25 at infinite separation ) binaries the isco frequency is @xmath26 for strange stars described by the mit bag model and between @xmath27 and @xmath28 for neutron stars described by nuclear eos ( see also @xcite ) . \n the 3rd pn approximations for point masses derived by different authors are giving isco at very high frequencies of gravitational waves @xmath29 ( @xcite ) . \n it should be mentioned that the frequency at isco found in quasi - equilibrium approximation could differ from that obtained by the numerical integration of the full set of time dependent einstein equations . \n the only comparison ( according to the authors knowledge ) between these two approches for binary neutron stars can be found in marronetti et al . \n ( 2004 ) who showed that for a polytropic eos with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the frequency at the isco at quasi - equilibrium approximation is @xmath32 higher than the dynamical isco . \n thus full relativistic hydrodynamical calculations are required in order to obtain detailed predictions for particular forms of the nuclear matter equations of state . \n this work was partially supported by the `` ayudas para movilidad de profesores de universidad e invesigadores espanoles y extranjeros '' program of the spanish mec , by the grants 1 p03d 005 30 , pbz -

{"ContextTokens": 3976, "GeneratedTokens": 171, "SynthesizedBody": "for some time now , the detection of an excess in @xmath0 ev cosmic rays from the general direction of the galactic center ( gc ) by the air shower array agasa @xcite has been a special riddle in galactic cosmic ray research . \n the angular region of the excess observed by agasa and sugar is illustrated in fig .  1 . \n gamma ray bursts ( grb ) have long been argued to produce high energy cosmic rays . in this paper \n we will show what the observational signature should be and try to demonstrate that the agasa excess can be attributed to the last one , or last few grb in our inner galaxy . \n there is a significant excess around @xmath0 ev , seen by two different experiments , agasa and sugar , of cosmic rays coming from the general direction of the gc region , that can not be attributed to the expected gradient of cosmic ray sources and distribution . \n this excess has been supported at the time by the air fluorescence detector fly s eye @xcite . however \n the sky coverage of agasa does not include the gc , while that of sugar does @xcite . \n the sugar data suggest a point source to within their spatial resolution , while agasa shows an extended source . \n the excess starts to be significant around @xmath1 ev , peaks near @xmath0 ev , and cuts off sharply at about @xmath2 ev , see @xcite .    the flux of the excess particles can be turned into a luminosity of particles beyond @xmath0 ev of about @xmath3 erg / s . since agasa can not observe the entire region , this inferred luminosity must be a lower limit , with the true luminosity possibly being a factor of 3 - 10 larger .    as suggested by the agasa collab . \n these events may arise from neutrons @xcite ; the possibility that they are due to photons was discussed and discarded by @xcite on the basis of sugar data . \n firstly , neutrons are not deflected due to the galactic magnetic fields . \n secondly , a peak at exactly @xmath0 ev corresponds to the distance to the gc region ( in distance from here between 5 and 11 kpc , using the region of highest star formation rate of about 3 kpc around the gc @xcite ) , folding the neutron decay with an injected power law spectrum . only with neutrons \n would there be a lower limit in energy , above which there can be significant flux . with photons there is no such threshold . \n in this case the original proton must have had an energy about three times that observed , and so we require proton energies of at least up to @xmath4 ev . \n there are three main mechanisms and respective sites to accelerate particles in the galaxy : supernova explosions either in the interstellar medium , in young and hot star bubbles , or in massive star winds . in any of the three cases \n such an energy per nucleon can not be reached for any reasonable parameter of shock velocity and/or magnetic field @xcite .    the only way to accelerate particles to such an energy per nucleon in a normal galaxy as ours is relativistic shocks . \n such relativistic shocks are produced in grbs @xcite . \n grbs are believed to occur in every galaxy in some small fraction of all supernovae , of order @xmath5 , arising from the final evolutionary stages of very massive stars , either in a binary system or as a single star . \n therefore we propose to ask : what are grbs expected to produce in terms of energetic particles ?    as shown in @xcite , because of adiabatic losses , the highest energy particles that emerge from a grb are mostly neutrons ; protons are captive in the magnetic field and so suffer extensive adiabatic losses on the way out . \n these neutrons will decay after some distance , turning into protons , which are then caught by the magnetic field in the galaxy , and rumble around with a rather short residence time scale . \n there is a small , but finite probability that they will produce a neutron again in interactions with the interstellar medium . \n these secondary neutrons then could travel undeflected to us to be observed . \n we will try to follow the neutrons originally ejected from a grb . \n 2 shows our concept in three key time steps . \n in order to estimate the remaining traces of any activity of cosmic rays ejected and/or produced by grbs , we discuss below various probabilities , the residence time for the protons resulting from the decay of the neutrons ejected , and present spectral and spatial arguments . \n we will somewhat arbitrarily adopt here a grb rate of 1 per @xmath6 years for the inner galaxy ( considering @xcite , this may seem pessimistic , but considering @xcite , even optimistic ) . \n the residence time scale for energetic protons in the solar neighborhood is around , @xcite , @xmath7 and so is about @xmath8 yrs at @xmath0 ev . \n obviously , near the gc this time scale could be different . \n since the magnetic field strength is higher , and the path to the outer parts of the galactic halo is also larger it is likely that the time is longer , and so we adopt @xmath9 years . \n after an injection event the number of cosmic rays at some energy will decay in a 3d - slab diffusion approximation with @xmath10 for times up to the diffusive reservoir time , and with @xmath11 thereafter . \n for the nominal injection time scale of every @xmath6 yrs , the expected diminution factor is about 1/300 at again the typical time to the next grb . \n the decay length of a neutron at @xmath0 ev exceeds the thickness of the gc thin disk - like region of high density and high star formation rate . using a 3 kpc radius of the region of high interstellar medium density and high star formation rate in the galactic disk about the gc and a decay length of 10 kpc this leads to a suppression factor of about 1/3 . \n another important aspect of the model is the probability of a proton to produce again an energetic secondary neutron in a collision with a nucleus of the interstellar medium in the inner galaxy . \n using conservatively the typical grammage inferred from the boron to carbon ratio in cosmic rays , with the solar neighborhood again as a reference , this probability is of the order of a few percent , estimated to 1/20 ( simulated with cross sections from @xcite ) . \n next we compare in the following the flux of particles above @xmath0 ev with the flux at all cosmic ray energies combined . assuming the injection spectrum to be around @xmath12 at first produces a diminution of the flux beyond @xmath0 ev by a factor of about 1/100 @xcite . \n photons are produced in decays of neutral pions , but the typical energy of secondary pions is lower than that of energetic secondary protons and neutrons . thus the final photon energy is lower and so may become submerged in the higher cosmic ray flux at lower energies . in fig . \n 3 we show a simulation for a power law injection spectrum with an arbitrary exponential cutoff in energy at @xmath13 ev : the differential flux is @xmath14 and @xmath15    \\ ; { \\rm for } \\ ; e \\ge e_{\\rm cut } $ ] . \n down to an energy of about a factor ten below the cutoff energy the effect of the cutoff is clearly visible in the ratio of the various fluxes , and below that energy , the ratio approaches a constant . \n what is the probability that a grb jet points more or less along the galactic plane ? as seen from the gc region the galactic plane is quite thick , and so maybe half the sky has an appreciable column density  see , e.g. , @xcite  leading to a factor of 1/2 . and , finally , what is the total cr production by a `` typical '' grb \n ? we adopt here the generous number of @xmath16 erg in pure cosmic rays from @xcite . \n therefore the expected flux today , from the last grb occurring @xmath6 yrs ago is now @xmath17 erg / s . \n this is just above what is observed , and so allowing for uncertainties mainly due to the limited sky coverage of agasa , a very plausible estimate to explain the data . \n the observed spectrum would be completely dominated by the two step propagation of the secondary neutrons in such a picture . \n therefore the spectrum is the folding of the production spectrum , with the decay probability inside the available space , so a hump from the minimum distance to get any neutrons , see fig.3 , to the maximum energy possible from grb productions . \n last we wish to ask whether it could be that we observe the effect of a few grbs . \n the most important parameters are 1 ) the time since the grb event , and 2 ) the orientation with respect to the galactic plane . so adopting a picket - fence model for the timing of subsequent grbs \n , we note that the flux from a grb that was twice as old is decreased by a factor of about 5 with respect to the younger one , and a grb at three times the age shows a flux that is a factor of 16 down . \n we conclude that the observed distribution is rather likely to be the result of several grb events in the gc region . \n large numbers of photons , electrons and neutrinos are produced in the collisions that give rise to the second generation neutrons in such a picture . \n however , their mean energy is small relative to that of the neutrons . \n the fluxes of photons , electrons and neutrinos are expected to follow an energy spectrum similar to that of the interaction protons . \n furthermore , photons and neutrinos map out the spatial and angular distribution of the proton interactions . \n it is convenient to express the secondary particle spectra in terms of the primary proton spectrum by multiplying it with appropriate reduction factors . \n simulations using the monte carlo event generator sibyll 2.1 @xcite predict the following reduction factors : for secondary protons and antiprotons 0.27 , for neutrons and antineutrons 0.09 , for photons 0.11 , for electron - positron pairs 0.05 , and for neutrinos ( all flavors ) 0.13 . \n all these numbers are normalized to a primary proton spectrum , using a power law of @xmath12 , and the energy range @xmath18 - @xmath0 ev . \n these numbers are the ratio of the fluxes far below the upper energy cutoff . \n observable is the ratio of the uncharged components , e.g. , the ratio of neutrons to gamma - rays , which is here close to 1 ; however , as fig . \n 3 shows , near to the upper cutoff the photons drop off earlier than the neutrons . \n the curves can be shifted in energy for any other assumption of maximum energy , since they will look the same relative to maximum energy ( here @xmath0 ev with a following exponential cutoff ) .    to see an appreciable flux of neutrons peaking near @xmath0 \n ev with a visible extension to @xmath19 ev requires that the primary proton / neutron flux extends to at least about @xmath20 ev . a measurement of the ratio of neutrons to photons , with a simultaneous determination of the injected powerlaw slope , \n would then allow to estimate the real cutoff energy of the injected proton / neutrons .    in fig . \n 4 we show the 95% confidence level for the expected flux at an agasa - like experiment at earth , using 1000 random realizations of grbs in the inner galaxy . \n the horizontal line shows roughly the average value actually observed for the excess signal by agasa . \n the density distributions are from @xcite , and the magnetic field distributions from @xcite . in these specific simulations \n the cross - sections were taken from @xcite . \n the spatial distribution of the neutrons should mimic roughly a folding of the decay distance at some energy of the presumed original neutron with the matter distribution . \n thus it should be similar to the gamma ray emission and the fir emission along the galactic plane . \n we note that the estimated residence time at @xmath0 ev energies corresponds to a real travel distance via diffusion of only about 2 to 3 kpc , while the propagation and interaction distance ( i.e. the length along the meandering path ) is 30 kpc . \n it is interesting to consider the time evolution of such a neutron flux : during a first phase protons resulting from neutron decay interact to produce new neutrons , and so steadily increase the observable neutron flux . \n second , we begin to use up the reservoir of protons , so the flux of neutrons decreases slowly , with @xmath10 . and \n third , the flux begins to decay with @xmath11 , as protons leak out from the probable interaction volume . \n the spatial distribution strongly depends on the specific orientation and the exact location of the original double jet of the grb - if that is the best model . \n of course , it is very unlikely , that the grb jet would point exactly at earth - that might be damaging to us , since this is the same power in a few seconds as the sun gives in minutes , and in a less benign form . \n therefore , if we see several grb events and their consequences superimposed on each other , then the discrepancy between agasa and sugar in spatial distribution might be partially explainable . \n we have shown that it is plausible that the observed agasa excess of events near @xmath0 ev energies coming to us from the gc region is due to the last few grb events in the galaxy . \n we predict a corresponding flux in photons and neutrinos . \n in fact , if the predicted details can be confirmed , we will have established i ) that grb cosmic ray signature can be detected , ii ) the cosmic ray production of grbs to be of order @xmath16 erg , iii ) that their particle energy extends to at least @xmath21 ev , iv ) that the maximum particle energy can be estimated with a measurement of both neutrons and photons , as well as the slope of the injection spectrum , and v ) that their contribution to the overall energetics of galactic cosmic rays is minor . to check this \n will be a major contribution of the pierre auger observatory whose southern part is ideally located to observe the gc region @xcite . \n the combination of fluorescence and surface detectors of this experiment allow measurements in the energy region from several @xmath18 ev to the highest energies . \n the authors appreciate comments from a. watson and t. kellmann . \n plb is mainly supported through the auger theory and membership grant 05 cu1era/3 through desy / bmbf ( germany ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 1150, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "as it was pointed out in one of the papers of @xcite , massive professional photometric surveys are today sources of many , often unexpected , discoveries ( e.g. the asas project of @xcite or the kepler mission of @xcite ) . on the other hand , databases collecting amateur photometric measurements are growing rapidly , as telescopes and ccd detectors are easily accessible nowadays @xcite . \n this gives us access to a number of valuable open astronomical archives , both professional and amateur , with a richness of data gathered during the past decades . \n we have now a great opportunity to trace photometric behaviour of a lot of variable objects , for instance dwarf novae stars . \n dwarf novae are cataclysmic binaries with a white dwarf as a primary and a low mass main sequence star , filling its roche lobe , as a secondary . \n due to the transfer of mass from the secondary onto the non - magnetic primary , an accretion disk is formed . \n such a mass transfer leads to outbursts in dwarf novae , as they are caused by sudden gravitational energy release due to accretion of this material onto the white dwarf . \n dwarf novae with shortest orbital periods ( @xmath0 ) are called su  uma stars . \n they are characterised by the presence of superoutbursts , next to normal outbursts , which are about @xmath1 brighter and about ten times less frequent than normal outbursts @xcite . \n the length of the supercycle , i.e. the time between two successive superoutbursts , is one of the most fundamental properties of su  uma stars and is specific for each of them . \n the nature of this feature is still uncertain . \n nowadays there is an open debate about the cause of superoutbursts . \n the thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model @xcite suggests that the sypercycle length ( @xmath2 ) is set by the mass transfer rate ( @xmath3 ) . \n according to this scenario , the observed @xmath2 is inversely proportional to @xmath3 . \n the tti model shows that normal outbursts remove less material from the disk than it has been accreted since the last normal outbursts . \n this makes the disk grow during a number of normal outbursts . \n when the disk reaches the critical radius ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the binary separation ) , it becomes eccentric and tidal effects occur , which causes superoutburst , during which the disk is shrinking again . \n although the tti model is commonly accepted , it still seems to need some improvements . for instance the tti simulations which reproduced the light curve of one of the most active dwarf novae , er  uma star , required an artificial increase of the mass transfer rate by the factor of ten in comparison to values expected from the theory based on gravitational radiation @xcite . \n another example is the fact shown by ( * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) that embedded precursors of superoutbursts are present also in systems with long orbital periods . \n this argues for a more general model , which is not restricted to the mass ratio of @xmath6 , as the tti model . \n recently @xcite presented evidence in favor of this model . \n although their analysis was based on variations of the negative superhump period of a single dwarf nova , v1504 cyg , they claimed that the cause of superoutbursts is finally revealed . \n however , @xcite showed that this object can not be considered as a representative for all systems which show negative superhumps . \n he also presented a number of arguments which suggest that superoubursts are caused by strongly enhanced mass transfer ( emt ) rate @xcite . \n recent observations @xcite surprisingly showed that the supercycle length of one of the most active dwarf novae , ix  draconis , has been increasing with a constant rate since the last twenty years . \n this is interesting in the context of evolution of such systems . \n encouraged by this fact , we decided to investigate the same issue for other well - observed active objects of the su  uma type . \n the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec - data ] \n we give information on the data used in this research . \n the analysis is presented in section  [ sec - analysis ] . \n results together with discussion are given in section  [ sec - res ] . \n we summarize the main conclusions in section  [ sec - conc ] . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - nextsteps ] \n we analysed a set of photometric data covering last decades of observations for the most active su  uma stars in order to study changes of their supercycle lengths . \n despite the common feature of the selected objects , which is the highest activity in this class of stars , they are diverse in terms of their orbital periods below the period gap . for all of the analysed objects we found positive values of period derivatives of their supercycle lengths . \n there are some subtle fluctuations for short time scales in the behaviour of @xmath2 , but the general trend is the same in each case . \n increasing supercycle lengths mean that the mean mass transfer rates have been decreasing for these objects over the last decades . \n this is in agreement with the scenario of the evolution of bk  lyn presented by @xcite , which seems to be a general case . \n this phenomenon is important in the context of evolution of such systems .", "StartTimeOffset": 1791935404218, "RequestID": "f7f7eff4cd6ae70167849929c5963997447a7b2f", "TotalTokens": 1304}
{"ContextTokens": 1810, "GeneratedTokens": 76, "SynthesizedBody": "the importance of the instanton content of @xmath0 gauge theory comes through both the intrinsic importance of understanding the ground state of qcd and the role instantons are conjectured to play in light hadron structure . \n cooling is a technique for removing the high - frequency non - topological excitations of the gauge - field . \n however , during cooling instantons are also removed ; either if they are very small ( lattice artifacts ) or through @xmath1 annihilation . \n we use under - relaxed cooling to reduce the latter problem . \n also , on the cooled configurations there is still the problem of extracting the instanton properties ; for this we have developed pattern - recognition algorithms . \n we present results for 20 configurations at @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 lattices . \n the gauge update for under - relaxed cooling @xcite is implemented in each cabibbo - marinari subgroup as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gauge link that minimises the action , @xmath8 the original link , @xmath9 is the under - relaxation parameter and @xmath10 a normalisation constant . under - relaxed \n cooling increases the number of _ calibrated _ sweeps needed to annihilate an @xmath1 pair ;

a peak is only included if the various widths are in sufficiently good agreement . \n full details will appear elsewhere  @xcite .    in figure 1 \n we show the instanton size distribution for @xmath4 at 23 sweeps . \n [ figure1 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    the distribution is peaked around @xmath20 . \n the best fit to the large-@xmath21 tail of the distribution is @xmath22 with @xmath23 . \n as one would expect , the total number of instantons is found to vary rapidly with the amount of cooling . \n however the average size and the form of the small / large @xmath21 tails varies much less . \n we note that our results are consistent with those of @xcite but not with those of @xcite . \n the fact that the impact of a cooling sweep does not scale complicates the scaling analysis . \n figure  2 shows that we can tune the number of cooling sweeps so as to get scaling when comparing @xmath4 and @xmath2 . \n [ figure2 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    examining the number of unlike charges a distance @xmath24 away from each peak ( normalised by the volume of the shell ) gives the distribution that is shown in fig 3 ( for @xmath4 after 23 sweeps ) . \n [ figure3 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    it is uniform at long distances and amplified at short distances . \n the corresponding distribution for like charges is uniform at long distances and suppressed at short distances . \n this implies some screening of instantons by anti - instantons in the vacuum  as expected .    calculating @xmath25 where @xmath26 is \n the number of objects of size @xmath21 and @xmath27 is the charge carried by objects of size @xmath21 shows that the charge carried by small ( large ) instantons is correlated ( anti - correlated ) with the sign of @xmath28 ( figure  4 ) . \n indeed our results suggest over - screening of large instantons by small anti - instantons . \n [ figure4 ]    = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm \n the wilson - dirac operator , or equivalently @xmath29 , may have vanishing or almost - zero eigenvalues for certain values of @xmath30 . moreover , it has been shown that the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath31 are strongly localised in space - time @xcite . \n `` exceptional '' configurations are assumed to be related to the appearance of ( almost-)zero eigenvalues at some @xmath32 . \n they seem to be more frequent at smaller @xmath33 and with sw improvement . on the other hand , \n it is unclear if and how these zero modes are related to the topology of the underlying gauge field , in particular because the chirality @xmath34 of the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath35 of @xmath36 is typically much smaller than one . to clarify this relation we investigate the low - lying eigenmodes of @xmath37 using a modified conjugate gradient method  @xcite . \n we verified that the index theorem is realized on single instanton configurations ( generated as in ref . \n @xcite ) , for both improved and unimproved wilson fermions , with one right - handed ( 4 right - handed plus 3 left - handed ) zero modes in the range @xmath38 for anti - periodic ( periodic ) boundary conditions . \n this is in complete analogy to the results for 2-dimensional wilson and for staggered fermions @xcite . \n .position @xmath39 and chirality @xmath40 of the zero - mode for single instantons without ( with ) improvement . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for anti - periodic boundary conditions , the eigenmodes are localised and centered on the instanton . moreover , we find considerable effects from discretization errors and sw improvement which are summarized in table  1 . \n we also investigated the localisation of the lowest eigenmodes on four exceptional configurations encountered by ukqcd at @xmath2 on @xmath41 and @xmath42 lattices . in all cases \n the ( almost-)zero mode is localized close to a small ( @xmath43 ) instanton ( less than @xmath44 away ) . \n the chirality has the same sign as the topological charge of the topological object but is not correlated with the overall topological charge of the configuration . \n this provides some evidence that exceptional configurations are related to small instantons in the underlying gauge field . \n more detailed results will be presented elsewhere @xcite . \n we acknowledge financial support by pparc grant gr / k41663 . \n d.s . was funded by the carnegie trust for the universities of scotland . \n 8 d. smith and m. teper , in preparation . \n h. simma and d. smith , in preparation . c. michael et al . , phys.rev.*d*52 ( 1995 ) 4691 . \n p. de forcrand et al . , \n these proceedings . \n t. degrand et al . , these proceedings . \n k. jansen et al . , nucl.phys.*b * ( proc.suppl . ) 53 ( 1997 ) 262 . \n t. kalkreuter and h. simma , comp . \n 93 ( 1996 ) 33 . \n lauritsen et al . , nucl.phys.*b*343 ( 1990 ) 522 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1802972114172, "RequestID": "16bde8df924c1a9f499bca20f34265cb39c132dc", "TotalTokens": 1886}
{"ContextTokens": 2823, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "apart from stars , the baryonic matter within the galaxy is in the form of an extremely dilute , turbulent plasma known as the interstellar medium ( ism ) . \n the multitude of physical processes within the ism entails a rich heterogeneous structure @xcite . \n approximating radiative processes by a simplified cooling prescription , and restricting the computational domain to a local patch , the turbulent ism is now routinely modelled by means of three - dimensional fluid simulations \n . one main focus of these simulations has been to obtain filling factors of the different ism phases and compare them to the classical predictions as well as observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . \n further topics of interest include turbulent mixing @xcite , thermodynamic distribution functions @xcite , and line - of - sight integrated column densities @xcite . \n while various simulations discuss the influence of magnetic fields on the ism morphology , little is said about the actual mechanism of field amplification . \n @xcite have addressed this question by means of unstratified simulations of sne turbulence . \n the authors relate the growth of small - scale magnetic fields to vorticity production in supernova shocks @xcite , and chaotic field line - stretching @xcite . \n the fact that vorticity production by colliding shells is almost inevitable in a clumpy and highly structured ism has first been pointed out by . the issue has then been investigated for the simplified case of driven expansion waves by @xcite and , more recently , by del sordo & brandenburg ( this volume ) . \n considering turbulence driven by non - helical transverse waves , @xcite have shown that the small - scale dynamo becomes harder to excite in the super - sonic regime , albeit the critical reynolds number for the onset of dynamo action only seems to depend weakly on the mach number . \n because the eddy turnover time is short at small scales , a dynamo based on chaotic field line stretching will be fast . \n this is in - line with observations , which exhibit dominant turbulent fields . \n open issues remain with respect to the mechanism governing the saturation of the small - scale dynamo . \n therefore , it is currently unclear whether equipartition field strengths can be obtained by a non - helical dynamo alone . \n alternatively , the turbulent field might be explained as a `` shredded '' coherent field , i.e. , as the by - product of a helical mean - field dynamo . \n notwithstanding the above , the presence of the observed coherent fields on scales larger than the outer scale of the interstellar turbulence ( @xmath0 , see * ? ? ? \n * ) clearly requires the presence of a coherent dynamo . \n the favoured candidates for such a dynamo are , in no particular order : ( i ) the kinetic driving by sne , ( ii ) the buoyant cosmic ray - supported parker instability @xcite , ( iii ) the magneto - rotational instability , and ( iv ) gravitational interactions @xcite . \n the last of these effects is certainly dominant at the early stages of galaxy formation and will provide a seed field for subsequent processes . \n it remains to be shown , however , how important external interactions are in the presence of a realistic feedback from scales currently unresolved in cosmological simulations . \n moreover , as have shown , the cosmic ray ( cr ) dynamo critically relies on the anisotropy of the cr diffusion coefficient . \n combined simulations , including both sne and crs , will prove whether this anisotropy remains effective for strongly tangled turbulent fields \n .    the mri will be important ( at least ) in the outer regions of galaxies , where the star formation activity is low @xcite  even under moderate turbulence , it may operate efficiently . \n the stability criterion for a global isothermal disk of thickness @xmath1 leads to the relation @xmath2 for instability . depending on the local rotation frequency , @xmath3 , turbulent diffusivity @xmath4 , and turbulent magnetic prandtl number @xmath5 \n which is generally expected to be of order unity  this value may be lower than the critical dynamo number for the supernova - driven dynamo \n . it should be worthwhile to address this question within state - of - the - art simulations of the ism , with an alvfn velocity of the external vertical field of the order @xmath6 .     of the top half of the now larger simulation box ( _ upper panels _ ) , and the disc midplane ( _ lower panels _ ) . \n the variables shown are : ( a ) number density @xmath7 $ ] , ( b ) column density @xmath8 $ ] , ( c ) temperature @xmath9 $ ] , ( d ) velocity dispersion @xmath10 $ ] , and ( e ) magnetic field strength @xmath11 $ ] . \n the logarithmic grey scales cover ranges @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 $ ] , and @xmath16 $ ] , respectively . ] \n the energy input through sne into the ism is tremendous . \n the corresponding amplitude of the expected dynamo effect has first been estimated by @xcite . \n assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and applying quasi - linear theory , these estimates have subsequently been refined by . \n a shortcoming of the approach was the neglect of a possible galactic wind . \n in general , there was a controversy as to whether the turbulence created by the sne was too vigorous to warrant dynamo action  either because of a too strong wind ( carrying the field away ) , or contrary to this , because of a too strong downward pumping ( enhancing turbulent dissipation near the midplane ) .    in a series of papers , \n analytically derived the electromotive force stemming from isolated remnants ; the line of work was also later supported by simulations of single remnants . to obtain the net @xmath17  effect , \n a convolution with an assumed vertical sn distribution was applied . however , the approach suffered from a too weak dynamo and highly dominant ( upward ) pumping . only when considering the stratified nature of the galactic disc , the issue was somewhat alleviated , although still predicting a strong upward pumping \n .    pioneering semi - global simulations based on `` first principles '' where performed by @xcite , and it was only for the fact of a too low dynamo number that no field amplification was observed in their simulations . \n the first direct simulations exhibiting dynamo action were reported almost a decade later . \n the general morphology of such simulations is illustrated in figure  [ fig : slices ] ; note the apparent correlation between the density  ( a ) and magnetic field amplitude  ( e ) near the midplane , indicating field amplification via compression . \n in contrast , away from the midplane ( i.e. , in the diffuse medium ) the field shows more folded structures .    . \n the variables are plotted in dark ( @xmath18 ) or light ( @xmath19 ) colours , respectively . \n shaded areas indicate @xmath20-fluctuations . in the region for @xmath21 , the results agree well with a previous run applying a much smaller box . ] \n the fast growth of the dynamo can be understood rigorously in terms of mean - field theory , i.e. via a reynolds - averaged induction equation @xmath22\\ , ,    \\label{eq : mf_ind}\\ ] ] and assuming a standard parametrisation @xmath23 with tensorial coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the determination of these closure parameters @xcite hugely benefited from the development of the so - called test field method @xcite . for kinematically forced turbulence , this method allows to determine unambiguously all eight tensor components  and , in fact , none of them can be ignored @xcite . \n notably , we find a significant positive rdler effect in the off - diagonal elements of the diffusivity tensor ( see panel d in figure  [ fig : ae ] ) . \n the measured @xmath17  effect and turbulent diffusion are of the expected sign and magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : ae ] , panels a and c ) . \n the key finding is that of a moderate downward pumping ( panel b ) as predicted by . \n this inward pumping has profound implications in compensating the effect of the equally strong upward mean flow ( not shown ) , thus yielding ideal conditions for the dynamo . \n moreover , a wind may aid the shedding of small - scale magnetic helicity as discussed in @xcite . \n one major concern with the local box approximation was the issue of its limited dimension in the horizontal direction . in the low - pressure ambient medium of the galactic halo , \n supernova remnants can easily expand to several hundred parsec in diameter . \n because of the periodic boundaries and the finite domain size , this leads to ( spuriously ) correlated self - interactions . \n the simulations of @xcite used @xmath26 , which was justified for the limited vertical extent of their model . for our standard \n runs we applied @xmath27 together with a vertical box size of @xmath28 . \n even with near @xmath29 horizontal box size , the issue of self - interaction was still seen in the far halo region . to eliminate the possibility of an artificial dependence of the results on the horizontal box size \n , we carried out a fiducial simulation run at @xmath30 ( cf . \n figures  [ fig : slices ]  &  [ fig : ae ] ) . in the region of overlap \n , the extended profiles agree well with their counterparts derived from the smaller boxes ( cf . fig . \n 4.5 , model f4 in * ? ? ? \n beyond @xmath31 , the velocity dispersion increases significantly , enhancing the turbulent diffusion and resulting in noisy profiles for the other coefficients . \n note , however , the pronounced systematic @xmath17  effect in the region of strong vertical gradients near the midplane ( panels a and b in figure  [ fig : ae ] ) . \n this clearly supports the paradigm of helicity production being the direct result of inhomogeneous turbulence .      beyond the purpose of mere diagnostics , the profiles shown in figure  [ fig : \n ae ] serve as a foundation for global large eddy - simulations solving ( [ eq : mf_ind ] ) . \n we believe that the semi - global approach of vertically stratified local boxes captures the essential physics behind the turbulent @xmath17  effect in the galactic disc . at the same time \n , we are aware that the local geometry implies certain restrictions on the permitted dynamo modes . \n identifying global symmetries is however necessary for a direct comparison with observations .    to warrant global mean - field modelling of the @xmath32  dynamo \n , the scaling of the measured closure coefficients with the relevant input parameters has to be obtained . \n this is important because the angular velocity @xmath3 , the local shear rate @xmath33 , the supernova rate @xmath34 , and the midplane density @xmath35 are functions of the galactocentric distance @xcite . \n @xcite already made a first step in this direction by inferring the dependence on the supernova rate . \n corresponding mean - field models have been reported in @xcite . further scaling relations with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath35 \n will be reported elsewhere . \n first estimates ( subject to small number statistics ) for a range of 0.11 times the galactic star formation rate lead to the relations @xmath36 this has the consequence that the dynamo number @xmath37 scales inversely with the star formation rate . \n therefore we would not expect a stronger amplification of the large - scale field for stronger star formation activity . \n lastly , the pitch angle @xmath38 , in the kinematic regime , only seems to depend weakly on the studied parameters . \n the strongest dependence here is , however , expected from the local shear rate @xmath39 , suggesting a dedicated parameter survey . \n because current numerical simulations are limited to very moderate reynolds numbers , it is important to understand how efficient the observed mechanisms remain under realistic conditions . \n to achieve this , it has proven fruitful to study simplified scenarios and run multiple parameter sets ( see * ? ? ? * for a comprehensive review ) . \n fortunately , the emerging physical effects are dominated by the outer scale of the turbulence , i.e. , as soon as a rudimentary scale separation is achieved , the turbulent quantities should become independent of the actual micro scale . \n the growing complexity of models challenges the distribution of computing time : increasing physical realism leaves little margin for the variation of key parameters , let alone convergence checks or running multiple representations of a single parameter set . \n dedicated studies remain mandatory to segregate artificial trends from genuinely physical ones . \n the dilemma becomes even more apparent when looking at the recent trend to performing `` resolved '' global simulations . \n for these , convergence checks are a rare exception . \n while an `` enhanced '' diffusivity may be sufficiently approximated by the numerical truncation error on the grid scale , the diamagnetic pumping term certainly is not . \n yet vertical transport has profound implications on the emerging dynamo modes and growth rates .    in conclusion , we advocate a strategy that has been applied with great success in the design of aircraft , namely the concept of large eddy ( or mean - field ) simulations . \n global fluid simulations currently can not guarantee scale separation for all relevant physical scales . to obtain quantitatively correct results \n , we therefore believe that a sub - grid scale model is inevitable . \n present local box simulations are a valuable means to provide a rigorous framework for the calibration of such a model .", "StartTimeOffset": 1808930570214, "RequestID": "52f61c330ede12ef24555bc71dd676b2c12a4c65", "TotalTokens": 2973}

lifshitz equations in which the ( effective ) anisotropy parameters have to be fitted at each given temperature @xcite . \n temperature is taken into account explicitly by the so - called stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite . \n however we will introduce in the following an alternative approach based on a quantum mechanical description of the film system and an explicite consideration of magnon excitations using a heisenberg model containing atomistic anisotropy terms . \n the hamiltonian of our microscopic model reads @xmath1 the first term describes heisenberg coupling @xmath2 between magnetic spin moments @xmath3 at the sites of a monolayer . \n it represents the largest energy scale in the problem and is responsible for the magnetism in the system . a film thickness beyond monolayer \n is effectively absorbed into the nearest neighbor exchange parameter @xmath4 to which we restrict ourselves . \n @xmath4 is chosen such that the monolayer magnetic moment equals that of the multilayer film at room temperature ( @xmath5 k , @xmath6 k ) . \n the second term contains an external magnetic field @xmath7 in arbitrary direction with the land@xmath8 factor @xmath9 and the bohr magneton @xmath10 . \n the third and fourth term constitute lattice anisotropy and dipolar interaction , respectively , the latter leading to shape anisotropy . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are microscopic anisotropy parameters , @xmath13 is the @xmath14-component of @xmath3 perpendicular to the film plane , and @xmath15 is the vector between lattice sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n the shape anisotropy favors in -

magnonic ) effects which would manifest themselves in a temperature dependence of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 . \n in the following we take @xmath58 for ni and @xmath59 for co due to different magnetic moments of the two metals @xcite . the land@xmath8 factor is taken as @xmath60 for both ni and co. the fmr microwave frequency was set to @xmath61ghz . \n [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the comparison between the @xmath62-curves from theory and experimental data for a ( subscript denotes the number of monolayers ) cu@xmath63/co@xmath50/cu(001 ) and a ni@xmath29/cu(001 ) film system , respectively , at two different temperatures . in both cases \n the effective anisotropy favors the magnetization to lie within the film plane . \n there is quite good agreement at both temperatures over the whole range of angles @xmath57 for both films . at a given angle \n the resonance field increases with temperature . \n it is important to note that the choice of the microscopic parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 at a given temperature can not be unambiguous as one easily sees from ( [ keff ] ) . \n however we took additionally into account the temperature dependence of the resonance field for a fixed angle @xmath64 as it is shown in fig . \n [ fig4 ] . due to the temperature dependent term which goes with @xmath11 in ( [ keff ] ) , namely @xmath49 , \n the ambiguity is removed . \n indeed it is still possible to accurately fit the experimental results with one set of ( @xmath0-independent ) parameters ( @xmath65 ) for ni and co , respectively , over the whole temperature range . \n furthermore in both cases the values of @xmath66 lie slightly above the result of an explicit evaluation of this quantity assuming point - like dipoles on the lattice sites for the given geometry @xcite ( @xmath67 kg ) . \n the conclusion we can draw is that the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy energy is solely due to spin wave excitations which manifest themselves in the @xmath0-dependence of ( [ keff ] ) rather than due to thermal expansion or phononic interactions . in other words \n , there is no additional @xmath0-dependence of the parameters @xmath65 to be considered in order to describe the non -

[ effprop ] this propagator agrees with the bare one if the bare mass , @xmath25 , is replaced by the effective mass @xmath26 . \n the dispersion relation of the scalar field in the medium follows from the poles of the effective propagator : @xmath27 . \n an alternative method to the itf is the rtf , where the thermal propagator in momentum space is given by i ( k ) = + 2 n_b(|k_0| ) ( k^2-m^2 ) . [ rtf ] in order to avoid unphysical singularities from products of @xmath28-functions , which can appear in diagrams with two propagators , the propagator has been extended to a @xmath29-matrix @xcite . \n an important advantage of the rtf compared with the itf is the possible generalization to non - equilibrium by replacing the equilibrium distribution in ( [ rtf ] ) by a non - equilibrium . \n now we will turn to gauge theories ( qed , qcd , electroweak theory ) at finite temperature and density , which are relevant for astrophysical situations . as an important example we consider the one - loop qed polarization tensor in an electron - positron plasma shown in figure  [ fig : polarization ] . \n in contrast to the tadpole diagram the polarization tensor is energy and momentum dependent . \n it can be calculated exactly only in the high - temperature limit which is equivalent to the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) limit , in which the loop momentum is assumed to be much larger than the external momentum . \n the high - temperature limit corresponds to an ultrarelativistic electron - positron plasma as it exists in supernovae . due to the breaking of lorentz invariance by choosing the frame of the heat bath , \n the polarization tensor has two independent components , for which we take the longitudinal and the transverse . in the htl limit they read _ \n l(p_0,p)&=&-3 m_^2(1- ) , + _ t(p_0,p)&= & m_^2 , [ htlpolar ] where @xmath30 can be regarded as a thermal photon `` mass '' . however , it should be noted that this mass does not break gauge invariance .    by resumming the polarization tensor using the dyson - schwinger equation \n we construct an effective photon propagator which describes the propagation of collective photon modes ( plasmons ) in a qed plasma . \n the corresponding dispersion relations for the longitudinal and the transverse plasma waves are shown in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] . \n finally , let me mention that in the case of two - loop self energies , from which e.g. damping rates follow , infrared singularities and gauge dependent results ( `` plasmon puzzle '' ) are encountered . \n braaten and pisarski @xcite developed a method , the htl resummation technique , for avoiding these problems , which allows a consistent treatment of gauge theories at finite temperature . \n neutrinos are copiously emitted from the core of a supernova . \n they interact with the surrounding plasma , providing an effective mechanism for energy deposition , which pushes the shock wave outwards and finally triggers the explosion @xcite . \n important neutrino interaction processes in the plasma are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    the differential rate for instance for @xmath34-annihilation is given by = m^ \\{_(q_1+q_2 ) } , [ diffrate ] where m^=8(q_2^q_1^+ q_1^q_2 ^ - ( q_1 q_2 ) g^ + i q_1 \n q_2 ^ ) [ leptonic ] is the leptonic tensor of the neutrino current and @xmath35 the polarization tensor . \n to lowest order in the fermi theory the latter is given by figure  [ fig : fermi ] . \n the total rate follows from the differential rate by convolution with the neutrino distributions : r_|= & & [ f_(q_1)f_|(q_2 ) + & & - ( 1-f_(q_1))(1-f_|(q_2 ) ) ] e^-e / t_e ] . \n [ totrate ] similar expressions for the differential and total rate can be derived for @xmath36-scattering . \n alternatively the rates can be calculated from the scattering amplitude , & & = [ 1-n_e^+(e_1 ) ] + & & [ 1-n_e^-(e_2 ) ] ( 2)^4 ^ 4(q_1+q_2-p_1-p_2 ) _ \n i |m|^2 , [ amplitude ] where @xmath37 $ ] is the fermi distribution of the electrons and positrons in the plasma . \n in addition to medium effects at finite temperature and density we consider a strong magnetic field , which plays an important role in supernovae and neutron stars . \n recently magnetic field strengths above @xmath38 g have been observed in so - called magnetars @xcite . in a magnetic field \n the electrons and positrons are in landau levels , which leads to a modified electron propagator in the polarization tensor . \n the magnetic field can absorb momentum , allowing for new processes such as the gyromagnetic absorption @xmath39 . \n the advantage of starting from the polarization tensor instead of the scattering amplitude is the automatic inclusion of all possible processes ( annihilation , scattering , gyromagnetic absorption ) . \n using the approach described above , we found a strong modification of the rates of the various processes in fields at @xmath40 g. in particular there are pronounced peaks in the rates coming from the landau levels , new processes like the gyromagnetic absorption become important , and the processes show a strong anisotropy , which could play a role in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in the figures  [ fig : bdepend ] to [ fig : aniso ] these features are illustrated . \n quark matter consisting of up , down and strange quarks may exist in the interior of neutron stars or even in form of strangelets , if quark matter is stable , i.e. , if it has a higher binding energy than iron @xcite . \n strangelets have also been discussed as a possible dark matter candidate @xcite . \n so far calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) of strange matter are based on an ideal fermi gas , where sometimes also one - gluon exchange effects are included @xcite .    here \n we want to consider medium effects at finite density and vanishing temperature , which lead to effective quark masses . using the one - loop quark self energy in the high - density limit \n , an effectice in - medium quark propagator is constructed . \n the dispersion relation at zero momentum following from this propagator defines the effective , density dependent quark mass @xcite ( p=0)=m_q^*=+ ( + ) ^1/2 , [ qmass ] where @xmath41 is the quark chemical potential of the order of 300 mev . \n the coupling constant @xmath42 , typically of the order 2 - 4 , can be regarded as a parameter describing the medium effect of the effective quark mass , which arises naturally due to the interactions as known from mean - field theories in many - particle physics . \n consequently we replace the ideal fermi gas by a quasiparticle gas , where e.g. the particle density is now given by ( ) = [ ^2-m_q^*^2()]^3/2 , [ density ] where @xmath43 is the degree of freedom , e.g. @xmath44 for strange quarks . \n similar expressions for the energy density and the pressure determining the eos can be found . \n the introduction of an effective quark mass , typically of the order of 100 mev , reduces the binding energy of strange quark matter and renders the existence of stable strangelets as a dark matter candidate unlikely @xcite . \n furthermore we studied the influence of the quark medium effects on strange stars and hybrid stars , i.e. neutron stars containing a quark matter core , by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation using the eos for quark matter derived above . \n as shown in figure  [ fig : mass_radius ] the effective quark mass has a negligible effect on the mass - radius relation of strange stars . on the other hand , \n the presence of a quark matter core , reduces the radius of a neutron star by typically 20 - 30 % , which might have observable consequences @xcite . \n this reduction is caused by a softening of the eos due to the presence of a mixed phase . \n it also reduces the maximum mass of the star to about 1.5 @xmath45 . \n recently it has been speculated that quark matter at high density should be in a color superconducting phase @xcite . \n while this could have some consequences for the cooling behavior of neutron stars @xcite , it probably does not affect bulk properties , such as the mass - radius relation , since the pairing takes place only close to the fermi surface . \n although the cross section for photon - photon interaction is very small , light propagating through the universe interacts continuously with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : thermal ] photons may acquire an effective mass in a thermal medium . on the other hand , \n there are very small upper limits for the photon mass deduced from laboratory experiments ( @xmath46 ev ) and from the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath47 ev ) @xcite . \n therefore it is of interest to consider medium effects of light in the cmb . \n the photon - photon interaction of low energy photons ( @xmath48 ) can be described by an effective lagrangian @xcite _ i=- ( f _ f^)^2 + f _ f^ f _ f^ , [ euler ] where @xmath49 is the electron mass , @xmath50 the fine structure constant , and @xmath51 the field strength tensor . \n the lowest order photon self energy following from this lagrangian is shown in figure  [ fig : photon ] . \n a gauge invariant definition of the debye mass of the photon relates it to the photon self energy in the following way @xcite : @xmath53 . using ( [ photself ] ) \n one finds that the debye mass vanishes , @xmath54 . \n also the effective photon `` mass '' or plasma frequency , defined as the zero momentum limit of the dispersion relation , @xmath55 , vanishes , @xmath56 . \n hence there is no conflict with the measured upper limits of the photon mass . \n the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are also related to the photon self energy : & = & 1-=1 + , + & = & 1+=1- . \n [ perm ] from these quantities the phase velocity @xmath57 and the index of refraction @xmath58 follow as v_p===1- . [ phase_velocity ] since the temperature of the universe drops with time , the phase velocity increases continuously to its vacuum value . \n whereas it was given by @xmath59 , when radiation and matter decoupled at about @xmath60 k , it increased today at @xmath61 k to @xmath62 . \n although this is probably not a measurable effect , it is amusing to note that the speed of light is not a constant in our universe .", "StartTimeOffset": 1842805506978, "RequestID": "24590d792feec45e448e426e5952ad1ecc6c9e16", "TotalTokens": 3546}

desy study , is described in details in @xcite . \n + in this contribution , we describe the current design of the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the different ongoing studies concerning the readout technologies . \n a large tpc is proposed as the main inner tracker at tesla . \n the actual design , taking into account the different performance goals , is described in details in the tesla tdr  @xcite . \n the tpc , as shown schematically in figure  [ tpc-side-view.eps ] , is of cylindrical design with an inner radius of about 32  cm , an outer radius of about 170  cm and an overall length in the beam direction of about 2  @xmath2  273  cm . \n the internal radius is determined by the size of the mask system , whereas the external radius is constrained by the fact that the calorimeter is inside the coil . \n these large dimensions allow the tracks to be measured with about 200 @xmath3 space points , so that the global tracking efficiency remains close to 100  % in the overall volume and a momentum resolution @xmath4  /  gev in the central region can be achieved . \n in addition the tpc should measure the specific energy loss of particles thus aiding in the identification of charged particles . with ar - based gas mixtures , operating at atmospheric pressure \n , it is expected that a resolution of @xmath5 can be reached , enough , to provide a separation between pions and kaons of better than two sigma for momenta between 2 and 20 gev . \n operating a tpc in the environment at tesla presents a number of challenges . \n presently no dedicated hardware trigger is forseen within a bunch train , so that all detectors should be active throughout one full train about 1  ms . \n one readout cycle of the tpc will integrate over approximatively 150 bunch crossings at tesla , and many readout cycles will follow continuously until a train has passed . \n this makes it important that the readout is granular enough to resolve the expected number of hits . \n in addition means have to be found to avoid the need for gating the tpc to remove the buildup of positive ions : during one bunch trains ions will travel significantly into the tpc drift volume , potentially distorting the drift field . \n a possible solution to handle both the high granularity and to suppress the ions drift into the drift volume is the use of micro - pattern gas detectors as readout devices . \n possible candidates are at the moment micromegas chambers  @xcite or gas electron multipliers ( gem ) foils  @xcite . \n micro - pattern gas chambers , due to their intrinsically smaller distances between amplification elements compared to the traditional wire chambers , offer the promise to significantly reduce systematic distortions in the electron drift close to the amplification region due to the so - called @xmath6 effect . \n a challenging research and development program is underway to meet the current design goals for a tpc at a linear collider like tesla . \n institutes from a number of different countries are participating ( aachen , carleton , desy , ipn orsay , karlsruhe , krakow , lal , lbnl , mit , mpi munich , nikhef , novosibirsk , rostock , saclay and victoria ) . \n the main focus of the work is at the moment on the development of a valid amplification and ion - suppression scheme ( see reference  @xcite ) . over the next years , efforts to develop a compact readout scheme and to understand \n the design of the mechanical structure of such a large tpc are planned . in the following sections we present the different first results for these different key issues . \n several studies focus on the tpc readout using micro - pattern gas detectors instead of the wire used conventionally to produce the gas amplification that is necessary to read the tpc signal . \n gas electron multiplier ( gem ) and micromegas , sketched in figure [ gemmicromegas.eps ] , are two attractive candidates for the readout planes .        a gem foil is a sandwich consisting of thin conductive layers of copper separated by a thin polymer film of capton . \n the foil is perforated with small holes arranged in a hexagonal lattice . \n when operating in the detector , a potential applied to the two conductive layers generates a strong electric field , typically 80 kv / cm , in the small holes . \n the electric field lines guide charged particles through the gem holes , with minimal losses due to collisions with the foil . \n electrons are accelerated in the strong field lines within the gem foil , producing secondary ionizations and charge multiplication which are then transfered by the electric field to the readout pads where they are collected . \n a unique property of the gems is their capability to operate in cascade , i.e. in a multi - gem structure , offering several advantages like a higher gain and an effective ion feedback suppression . \n most of the groups working with gem readout use gem towers with two or more gems . \n an attractive alternative technology to gem is that of micromegas . \n an uniform high - field , typically 30  kv / cm , is produced between a thin metallic mesh , few microns thick , stretched at a distance of 50 - 100  @xmath7 m above the readout pad plane and held by insulating pillars . on top of the mesh , the electrons are transferred to the amplification gap , where they are multiplied in an avalanche process , resulting in a large number of electron - ion pairs . \n a micromegas has similar advantages to a gem as far as simplicity of construction , low cost and efficiency of ion - feedback suppression are concerned . \n it has an excellent potential for de / dx resolution due to the fact that the gain is nearly independent of the gap thickness . \n moreover it is robust and can be built at least in parts using commercially available components . \n r&d studies focus among other things on the gain stability and homogeneity to reach a de / dx measurement with 5% precision . \n this is illustrated in figure [ gainvsruntime.eps ] which shows the gain uniformity with time using a two - gem tower structure . \n a crucial issue at tesla is to prevent the ions produced during the amplification to return to the tpc drift volume and cause field distortions . \n the use of gems or micromegas promises to reduce the ion feedback . \n the degree of reduction depends strongly on the exact choice of operational parameters and the micro - pattern gas detector used . \n several ongoing studies , using gems and micromegas , demonstrated a suppression to the level of 10@xmath8 ( figure  [ saclay.eps ] ) . \n however , a level of suppression to a level of 10@xmath9 is needed to ensure that the positive - ion effects are at an acceptable level . in case \n this goal can not be reached and to guarantee a stable and robust chamber operation , the insertion of a gating plane , gated in between bunch trains , might be needed in order to minimize the effects of ion feedback .          to optimally exploit gems and micromegas and \n in addition to the experimental program , extensive simulation studies are being performed . \n these concern mainly the study of the charge transfer mechanism in gem or micromegas structures . \n these numerical simulations are of crucial importance , since they determine the optimal parameter choice needed to reach the different tesla tpc milestones . \n figure  [ aachen.eps ] shows , as the validation of the simulation of a gem hole , the comparison between measurement and simulation of the evolution of the primary and secondary extraction efficiencies respectively defined as the fraction of ions extracted from the gem holes into the drift volume per number of ions produced in the holes and the fraction of ions extracted from the gem hole into the drift volume per number of ions which have been collected in the gem hole . \n the charge produced during the avalanche in the gems is collected by readout pads located typically a few mm behind the last gem . \n since the number of pads is limited , the distance between pad centers is large compared to the size of the electron avalanche cloud ( typically a few to several 100  @xmath7 m ) . \n the charge from a track after amplification in the gems is therefore sometimes collected on a single pad . \n this effect is even more important with magnetic field at tesla since the transverse diffusion is then smaller . \n the major consequence will be that the centre of gravity method can not be applied anymore for position calculation . \n ongoing simulation studies investigate more sophisticated pad geometries , like chevron - shaped pads which may lead to a better point resolution if the charge sharing between neighboring pads is more important . \n figure  [ res_chevron_rect.2.eps ] shows the measured point resolution @xmath10 for rectangular and chevron shaped pad with a size of 14 @xmath2 14 mm@xmath11 and for different drift lengths using gems and without magnetic field . for small drift distances \n the point resolution with chevrons is better than with rectangles . \n this effect of the pad geometry gets smaller with increasing drift distances since the influence of the diffusion of the electron cloud gets larger . \n the improvement is clearly visible but simulation studies concerning mainly the pad response function description , the optimal induction gap between the last gem and the pad plane , are still required for a better description of the pad charge sharing mechanism . \n another approach to make the electron charge cloud broader , and get then a better point resolution , uses a resistive anode foil placed a few ten of @xmath7 m between the readout plane and the last gem . \n this work is illustrated by the plot on figure  [ carleton.eps ] showing the signal detected with a size of about 2  mm for an initial charge cluster size of 1  mm . \n the possibility to detect induced pulses in a gem setup is also being studied . during the buildup of charges in the gem hole a small induced pulse \n is expected in the pad opposite to this hole . \n this signal is also visible in the neighbor pads and can then be used to reconstruct the position of the avalanche and have a resolution significantly better . \n the price to pay for this improvement is that the readout electronics has to be able to detect the small pulses and that a very fast electronics is needed . \n several institutes have started a joint r&d effort with the goal of developing the technologies needed for a large tpc at the next generation of linear colliders . \n the main challenge is to design a continuous - tracking , high performance tpc which should be substantially more performant than any existing tpc . \n important progress has been made to better understand the different aspects of the tpc . \n particular emphasis is placed on the amplification , the ion - suppression scheme and the large scale - integration electronics . \n while first results concerning these different points look very promising , some open questions like the readout behavior in a strong magnetic field , or the results with large tpc prototypes , still remain unanswered and need more investigations in the near future . \n i wish to thank all the members of the ecfa - desy tpc study for providing material for this contribution . \n i m grateful to ties behnke for reading this manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 1856724438174, "RequestID": "b8c7b45207e3059a1ef0e35ad36b66aeaaa005e3", "TotalTokens": 2546}

{"ContextTokens": 4027, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "the detection of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies ( bennet et al . 1996 ) confirmed the notion that the present structure in the universe originated from small density fluctuations at early times . \n the gravitational collapse of overdense regions could explain the present - day abundance of bound objects , such as galaxies or x - ray clusters , under the appropriate extrapolation of the detected large - scale anisotropies to smaller scales ( e.g. , baugh et al . \n recent deep observations with the hubble space telescope ( steidel et al . \n 1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; chen et al . 1998 ; clements et al . \n 1999 ) and ground - based telescopes , such as keck ( lowenthal et al . \n 1996 ; dey et al . 1999 ; hu et al . \n 1998 , 1999 ; spinrad et al . 1999 ; steidel et al . 1999 ) , have constrained considerably the evolution of galaxies and their stellar content at @xmath3 . however , in the bottom - up hierarchy of the popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies , galaxies were assembled out of building blocks of smaller mass . \n the elementary building blocks , i.e. the first gaseous objects to have formed , acquired a total mass of order the jeans mass ( @xmath4 ) , below which gas pressure opposed gravity and prevented collapse ( haiman & loeb 1997 ; ostriker & gnedin 1997 ) . in variants of the standard cdm \n cosmology , these _ basic _ building blocks formed at @xmath5@xmath6 ( see fig . \n the _ first light _ from stars and quasars ended the `` dark ages '' of the universe and initiated a `` renaissance of enlightenment '' in the otherwise fading glow of the big bang . \n it is easy to see why the mere conversion of trace amounts of gas into stars or black holes at this early epoch could have had a dramatic effect on the ionization state and temperature of the rest of the gas in the universe . \n nuclear fusion releases @xmath7 ev per hydrogen atom , and thin - disk accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole releases ten times more energy ; however , the ionization of hydrogen requires only 13.6 ev . \n it is therefore sufficient to convert a small fraction of @xmath8 of the total baryonic mass into stars or black holes in order to ionize the rest of the universe . \n ( the actual required fraction is higher because only some of the emitted photons are above the ionization threshold of 13.6 ev and because each hydrogen atom could recombine more than once at @xmath9 ) . \n calculations of structure formation in popular cdm cosmologies imply that the universe was ionized at @xmath10@xmath11 ( haiman & loeb 1998 , 1999b , c ; gnedin & ostriker 1998 ) . \n the free electrons produced during reionization scatter the microwave background and smooth its anisotropies on angular scales below the size of the horizon at the reionization epoch ( @xmath12 for reionization at @xmath5 ) . \n the fractional decrement in the anisotropy amplitude is of order the optical depth of the intergalactic medium to thomson scattering , i.e. a few percent . \n the forthcoming map and planck satellites will thus be able to constrain the reionization redshift ( zaldarriaga , seljak , & spergel 1997 ) . \n secondary anisotropies are also produced during this epoch on smaller angular scales ( hu 1999 ) .    a variety of cdm models that are all consistent with both the cobe anisotropies ( @xmath13 ) and the abundance of objects today ( @xmath14 ) differ appreciably in their initial amplitude of density fluctuations on small scales . \n the reionization history of the universe is determined by the collapse redshift of the smallest objects ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) and is therefore ideally suited to discriminate between these models . \n current observations reveal the existence of galaxies out to redshifts as high as @xmath17 ( chen et al .  1999 ; \n weymann et al .  1998 ; dey et al.1998 ; spinrad et al . \n 1998 ; hu et al .  1998 , 1999 ) or possibly even higher ( clements et al . 1999 ) , and bright quasars out to @xmath18 ( fan et al.1999 ) . based on sources for which high resolution spectra are available \n , the intergalactic medium appears to be predominantly ionized at this epoch , implying the existence of ionizing sources at even higher redshifts ( madau 1999 ; madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; haiman & loeb 1998 , 1999c ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . \n the _ next generation space telescope _ ( ngst ) , the successor to the _ hubble space telescope _ , is scheduled for launch in 2008 , and is expected to reach an imaging sensitivity better than 1 njy in the infrared . \n its main scientific goal is to probe directly the first galaxies ( see , http://ngst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ for more details ) . \n _ how many sources will ngst see ? _ figure 2 shows the predicted number of quasars and star clusters expected per field of view of ngst , based on semi - analytic modeling of a hierarchical cdm cosmology ( haiman & loeb 1999c ) . in this calculation , a fraction of the gas in each dark matter halo forms stars , and a much smaller fraction assembles into a massive central black hole . \n the star formation efficiency was calibrated based on the inferred metallicity range of the ly@xmath19 forest ( songaila & cowie 1996 ; tytler et al . \n 1995 ) while the characteristic quasar lightcurve was calibrated in eddington units so as to fit simultaneously the observed luminosity function of bright quasars at @xmath204 , and the black hole mass function in the local universe ( magorrian et al . \n both populations of sources were extrapolated to high redshifts and low luminosities using the press - schechter formalism ( for more details , see haiman & loeb 1997 , 1998 , 1999c ) . \n typically , there should be of order tens of sources at redshifts @xmath21 per field of view of ngst . \n the lack of point source detection in the hubble deep field is consistent with a low - mass cutoff for luminous matter in halos with circular velocities @xmath2275@xmath23 , due to photoionization heating ( haiman , madau , & loeb 1999 ) . \n the redshift of early sources can be easily identified photometrically based on their ly@xmath19 trough . \n figure 2 demonstrates that ngst will play a dominant role in exploring the reionization epoch and in bridging between the initial and current states of the universe . \n existing telescopes are just starting to probe this epoch now . \n the expected size distribution of high - redshift galaxies was calculated semi - analytically by barkana & loeb ( 1999 ) . \n figure 3 shows that most of the galaxies are more extended than the resolution limit of ngst , @xmath24 . despite the cosmological @xmath25 dimming in surface brightness , galaxies at @xmath5 \n are predicted to have an observed surface brightness which is comparable to their @xmath26 counterparts . \n this follows from the decline in the proper size of galactic disks with increasing redshift ( which is caused by the higher density of the universe and the lower masses of the galaxies at high redshifts ) . due to the compactness of high - redshift galaxies , only @xmath27 of the sky \n is expected to be covered by galactic disks at @xmath28 and only @xmath29 by galaxies at @xmath30 . \n hence , deep high - resolution observations of galaxies at high - redshifts ( e.g. , with ngst ) are not expected to be confusion limited or miss considerable levels of star formation due to surface brightness limitations . \n the radiation produced by the first sources might however get reprocessed through galactic and intergalactic dust and contribute to the diffuse infrared background ( haiman & loeb 1998 ; loeb & haiman 1997 ) . \n barkana & loeb ( 1999 ) also predicted that about @xmath31 of these galaxies will be gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies . \n lensing would bring into view sources which are otherwise below the detection threshold . \n lensed sources would be multiply imaged and hence appear to be compsed of multiple components ; their redshift identification requires sub - arcsecond resolution , since it might be otherwise compromised by blending of background light from the lensing galaxy .    _ which sources triggered reionization ? _ it is currently unknown whether the universe was reionized by quasars or stars at @xmath28 . \n haiman & loeb ( 1999b ) pointed out that quasars can be best distinguished from stellar sources by their x - ray emission . \n based on simple semi - analytic extension of the observed quasar luminosity function , we have shown that deep x - ray imaging with cxo will likely reveal @xmath32 quasars per @xmath33 field of view from redshift @xmath28 at the flux threshold of @xmath34 ( see fig . \n the redshifts of these faint point - sources could be identified by follow - up infrared observations from the ground or with ngst . by summing - up the uv emission from these @xmath28 quasars \n , one could determine whether they triggered reionization . \n the x - ray selection of these quasars is not influenced by dust obscuration . \n the stages in the reionization history of the universe are illustrated schematically in figure 5 . \n this sequence follows the collapse redshift history of baryonic objects shown in figure 1 , which was calculated with a spherically - symmetric code for the gas and the dark matter dynamics ( haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ) . for objects with baryonic masses @xmath35 , gravity dominates and results in the characteristic bottom - up hierarchy of cdm cosmologies ; at lower masses , gas pressure delays the collapse . \n the first objects to collapse are located at the `` knee '' that separates the above regimes . \n such objects reach virial temperatures of several hundred degrees and could fragment into stars only through cooling by molecular hydrogen [ see haiman et al . \n ( 1996 ) or tegmark et al . \n ( 1997 ) , for details regarding the chemistry network leading to the formation of @xmath36 in a primordial gas ] . \n however , molecular hydrogen ( @xmath36 ) is fragile and could easily be photo - dissociated by photons with energies of @xmath37@xmath38ev , to which the universe is transparent even before it gets ionized . \n haiman , rees , & loeb ( 1997 ) showed that a uv flux of @xmath39 is capable of dissociating @xmath36 throughout the collapsed environments in the universe ( see also haiman , abel , & rees 1999 ) . \n this flux is lower by more than two orders of magnitude than the minimum flux necessary to ionize the universe , which amounts to one uv photon per baryon . \n the inevitable conclusion is that soon after the first stars form , the formation of additional stars due to @xmath36 cooling is suppressed . \n further fragmentation is possible only through atomic line cooling , which is effective in objects with high virial temperatures , @xmath40k . \n such objects correspond to a total mass @xmath41^{-3/2}$ ] . \n figure 5 illustrates this sequence of events by describing two classes of objects : those with @xmath42k ( small dots ) and those with @xmath43k ( large dots ) . in the first stage ( top panel ) \n , some low - mass objects collapse , form stars , and create ionized hydrogen ( hii ) bubbles around them . \n once the uv background between 11.213.6ev reaches some critical level , @xmath44 is photo - dissociated throughout the universe and the formation of new stars is delayed until objects with @xmath40k collapse . \n each massive source creates an hii region which expands into the intergalactic medium . \n initially the volume of the universe is dominated by neutral hydrogen ( hi ) . \n but as new sources appear exponentially fast ( due to the gaussian tail of the rare high - amplitude perturbations ) , numerous hii bubbles add up , overlap , and transform all the remaining hi into hii over a short period of time . \n since the characteristic separation between sources is eventually much smaller than the hubble distance , the transition completes over a period of time which is much shorter than the hubble time , and can be regarded as sudden . \n reionization is defined as the time when the volume filling factor of ionized hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) approached a value close to unity . \n _ is it possible to identify the reionization redshift , @xmath45 , from the spectrum of high - redshift sources ? _ \n the most distinct feature in the spectrum of a source at @xmath46 would be the gunn - peterson absorption trough due to the neutral intergalactic medium that fills the universe prior to reionization . \n figure 6 provides a sketch of the spectrum of a source with @xmath47<1.18 $ ] , which contains some transmitted flux between the gunn - peterson troughs due to ly@xmath19 and ly@xmath48 absorption . \n this transmitted flux is suppressed by the residual ly@xmath19 forest in the post - reionization era ( haiman & loeb 1999a ) . the possibility of identifying @xmath45 from the damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough ( miralda - escud 1997 ) suffers from potential confusion with damped ly@xmath19 absorption along the line of sight and from ambiguities due to peculiar velocities and the proximity effect . \n an alternative method makes use of the superposition of the spectra of many sources . in the absence of the ly@xmath19 forest \n this superposition should result in the sawtooth template spectrum ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ) . \n the reionization redshift can also be inferred from a direct detection of intergalactic hi . \n loeb & rybicki ( 1999 ) have shown that the existence of a neutral igm before reionization can be inferred from narrow - band imaging of embedded sources . \n the spectra of the first galaxies and quasars in the universe should be strongly absorbed shortward of their rest - frame ly@xmath19 wavelength by neutral hydrogen in the intervening intergalactic medium . \n however , the ly@xmath19 line photons emitted by these sources are not eliminated but rather scatter until they redshift out of resonance and escape due to the hubble expansion of the surrounding intergalactic hi ( see fig . \n typically , the photons emitted by a source at @xmath49 scatter over a characteristic angular radius of @xmath50 around the source and compose a line which is broadened and redshifted by @xmath51 relative to the source . \n the scattered photons are highly polarized ( rybicki & loeb 1999 ) . \n detection of the diffuse halos around high redshift sources would provide a unique tool for probing the neutral intergalactic medium before the epoch of reionization . _ \n the sources serve as lampposts which illuminate the surrounding hi fog . _ on sufficiently large scales where the hubble flow is smooth and the gas is neutral , the ly@xmath19 brightness distribution can be used to determine the cosmological mass densities of baryons and matter . \n ngst might be able to detect the halos around sources as bright as the galaxy discovered by hu et al . \n ( 1999 ) at @xmath52 , even if such a galaxy is moved out to @xmath5 . \n loeb & rybicki ( 1999 ) explored the above effect for a uniform , fully - neutral igm in a pure hubble flow . \n it would be useful to extend their analysis to more realistic cases of sources embedded in an inhomogeneous igm , which is partially ionized by the same sources . \n one could extract particular realizations of the perturbed igm around massive galaxies from hydrodynamic simulation , and apply a suitable radiative transfer code to propagate the photons from the embedded galaxies . \n observations of halos could in principle be used to map the pecluiar velocity and density fields of the neutral igm during the reionization epoch . \n in addition to altering the ionization state of hydrogen in the universe , the first galaxies enriched the igm with metals . because the potential wells of the first dwarf galaxies are relatively shallow ( @xmath53@xmath54 ) , supernova  driven winds are likely to have expelled the metal  rich gas out of these systems and mixed it with the intergalactic medium . \n incomplete mixing could have led to the observed order - of - magnitude scatter in the c / h ratio along lines - of - sight to different quasars ( rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz 1997 ; hellsten  et  al . \n it is an interesting coincidence that the supernova energy output associated with a metal enrichment of @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 ev per hydrogen atom , which is just above the binding energy of these early star clusters . \n supernova feedback in these objects could have therefore dictated the average metallicity observed in the forest . \n direct observations of these supernovae might be feasible in the future ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) . \n the rise of the uv background during reionization is also expected to boil the gas out of shallow potential wells . \n barkana & loeb ( 1998 ) have shown that a dominant fraction of the virialized gas in the universe at @xmath57 will likely reside in potential wells with circular velocity of @xmath58 and evaporate shortly after reionization . \n this process could also enrich the intergalactic medium with metals . \n i thank my collaborators , rannan barkana , zoltan haiman , martin rees , and george rybicki for many illuminating discussions on the topics described in this review . \n this work was supported in part by the nasa grants nag 5 -

packed double planes . \n each scintillating hodoscope plane has 206 vertical slats , and there are more than 1000 straw tubes in each straw plane . \n the tracking system measures momentum , charge and velocity ( @xmath8 ) of charged particles with a mass resolution of about 3% in the region of interest . \n charge misidentification is less than 1 in 10 billion due to three redundant charge measuremnts . \n there is an additional mass measurement from hadronic calorimeter@xcite which has good energy ( @xmath9 ) and time ( @xmath10 ) resolutions . \n it is made of 754 towers of scintillating fibre embedded lead . \n a vacuum tank is along the beam line to reduce the background from beam particles interacting with air . \n the total length of the apparatus is about 28 meters . \n the incident beam is 11.5gev / c au beam on pt target with 60% interaction length . \n the spectrometer fields of m1 and m2 are set to their highest field + 1.5 t to reduce background ( sweep out high @xmath11 particles ) and achieve best tracking resolution for positively charged strangelets . \n the trigger consists of good beam definition , a multiplicity requirement@xcite and a level ii high mass trigger@xcite . \n only events of the 10% most central collisions are collected since strangelets are most likely to be produced in central collisions . \n high sensitivity and open geometry are keys of e864 . \n we achieve the high sensitivity by a high - mass level ii trigger  late - energy trigger ( let ) . \n there is a two - dimensional ( energy and tof ) programmable lookup table for every calorimeter channel to setup for different topics . \n the let rejects those events without any high mass candidate and achieve a rejection factor of about 70 while maintaining good efficiency ( @xmath12 ) for high masses . \n there are about 200 million let events or 13 billion 10% most central events sampled in the whole data set for positively charged or neutral strangelet searches . \n offline cuts are used to further refine the candidate selection . for any particle , tracking mass and calorimeter mass have to be consistent with each other . \n these confirmations are performed by energy and tof consistency cuts . \n a upper limit cut on particle velocity ( @xmath8 ) is used to maintain good mass resolution and clean up the background since @xmath13 scales with @xmath14 . \n tracking @xmath15 and shower quality cuts are studied extensively . \n we have conducted the full analysis of 1996/97 s +1.5t data set for strangelets with charge=+1 , + 2 , + 3 . \n there are two classes of background which we have to deal with . \n the background in the tracking system is the result from multiple scattering and neutron - proton charge exchange interactions . \n fluctuations of energy measurements and overlapping showers are background in the calorimeter measurements . \n these two background sources are relatively independent . \n simulations showed that we are able to achieve a rejection level of @xmath16 per central interaction@xcite . \n with all the cuts we used in analysis of data from the previous run@xcite , we observe 3 candidates with mass between 5 and 10 @xmath17 . \n but when we check for additional evidence of double interactions using the calorimeter , we conclude that the 3 candidates are probably normal particles scattered and their showers in calorimeter are contaminated by a second interaction@xcite . \n the efficiency of this additional cut is about 85% . in fig \n [ fig : q2a6 ] , the mass measured from the tracking system of charge=+2 is plotted . \n it is clear that consistency cuts between tracking and calorimeter measurements and tighter @xmath8 cut do clean up the spectrum . \n we clearly see a @xmath2 peak but we do not see any @xmath18 or exotic particles . we conclude that there is no candidate with @xmath19 and @xmath20 . \n we extend our analysis to include @xmath21 particles and indeed we are able to see a clear @xmath3 peak . with a loose @xmath22 cut , no particle with @xmath23 is found . \n however , when the limits are calculated , a tighter cut ( @xmath24 ) is used . an analysis with the looser cut \n is being carried out and should give slightly better limits . \n because of the finite acceptance , we choose the following production model to calculate the sensitivities and limits : @xmath25 } \\exp{[-{{(y - y_{cm})^{2}}\\over{2\\sigma_{y}^{2}}}]}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the mean transverse momentum , @xmath27 is the center - of - mass rapidity and @xmath28 is the standard width of the rapidity distribution of the produced strangelet . \n it is worth pointing out that because of the large rapidity and transverse momentum coverage , the results depend weakly on the model chosen . \n e864 is capable of detecting weak - decay strangelets with lifetime of about 50ns or greater . \n we compute the limits at 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) for strangelets of z=+1 , + 2 and + 3 with mass between about 10 to 50@xmath17 . \n these results represent the best limits at ags energies@xcite . \n fig  [ fig : limits ] shows the preliminary limits together with our previous results@xcite and predictions from coalescence , qgp distillation and thermal model . \n interpretations and implications of the results will be discussed in next section . \n in addition to searching for positively charged strangelet , we measure the production of light nuclei near midrapidity up to @xmath29 in this data set . \n fig  [ fig : q2a6 ] shows preliminary measurements of the yields of @xmath2 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath31 ) . \n together with the analyses of other e864 data sets@xcite , we observe an exponential decrease of the yields of particle production as a function of nuclear number a near midrapidity ( center of mass of the system ) . that is @xmath32 this means that the penalty factor of adding a nucleon to a nuclear cluster is about 50 for all nuclei up to @xmath29 near midrapidity at @xmath33 . \n from this observation , one can make a naive model of the particle production , namely : @xmath34 where 157 is the total number of initial protons , @xmath35 is the strangeness penalty factor @xcite and @xmath36 is the total strangeness in the ` cluster ' . \n this naive model assumes complete stopping and does not take into account the change of the spectrum with mass and the spin factor . \n but it describes the trend of the production level .      e864 has previously measured @xmath7 production in 10% most central collisions@xcite . \n additional mininum bias data were taken in the 1996/97 run with let trigger . when the measured @xmath7 production shown in fig  [ fig : pbar ] is compared with that from e878@xcite in different centralities \n , we see a strong centrality dependence of the level of disagreement between the two experiment measurements . \n this can be explained by the enhancement of antihyperon production in central collisions , because e864 accepts all the @xmath7 s from antihyperon ( @xmath37 ) decays while e878 accepts only a small fraction of them . \n detail comparisons can be found in @xcite . from the difference of the acceptance and difference of the detected @xmath7 s , we compute the antihyperon - to - antiproton ratios @xmath6 in each centrality bin , where acceptance and decay branching ratios are properly taken into account . in fig \n [ fig : pbar ] , we plot the low edge of the ratios at 98% c.l . together with the most probable values of the ratios as a function of centrality . \n it reaches the most probable value of 3.5 and is higher than 2.3 at 98% c.l . in central collisions \n the interpretation is quite consistent since the ratio in peripheral collisions is consistent with that of p+p collisions at similar energy . \n we are looking forward to the forthcoming direct @xmath38 measurements @xcite at the ags . \n coalescence@xcite and thermal@xcite models predict the production of hyperfragments . it is noticed that @xcite @xcite overpredict the production of light nuclei @xcite and therefore we expect overpredictions of hyperfragment / strangelet production from these models .    from and our most probable sensitivity at low mass range ( @xmath39 ) \n , we can translate our limits per central collision to limits in baryon number and strangeness content@xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41@xcite . for any combination of a and s satisfying \n , we have the sensitivity for strangelets produced by coalescence if they exist . \n another important message from is that it is very unlikely to produce a large strangelet in a normal medium . \n for example , production of an @xmath42 and @xmath43 object will be at the level of @xmath44 per central collision . \n on the other hand , this implies that positively charged strangelets can be a possible clean signature of qgp formation@xcite which will not be confused by normal nuclei or strangelets produced via coalescence.      our limits largely rule out the predictions from @xcite and are at the same order of or below predictions from @xcite for @xmath45 . \n however , predictions listed from @xcite are from their early predictions in which a qgp is assumed to happen in every central collision at the ags energy and an optimistic mass formula is used . \n further improvement in the mass formula@xcite indicates that strangelets with low a ( @xmath46 ) are unstable . \n our limits are not sensitive enough to challenge the region where one might expect stability according to this model \n .    our limits do constrain the sequence of qgp production followed by qgp distillation into strangelet in a model independent way@xcite . for large strangelets which are predicted to be more stable , \n our data restrict these processes at the 90% confidence level as follows : @xmath47 \n in summary , we have found no evidence of positively charged strangelets produced in 11.5gev / c per nucleon au+pt collision and set a 90% confidence level upper limit of about @xmath48 per 10% most central collision for @xmath49 strangelets over a wide mass range and with proper lifetimes of @xmath50 . \n this represents the best sensitivity at the ags energies . \n we have measured production of @xmath29 nuclei near midrapidity and found that the penalty factor of adding a nucleon to a cluster stays at about 50 . \n comparisons of @xmath7 measurements between e864 and e878 as a function of centrality suggest an enhanced antihyperon - to - antiproton ratio in central collisions .    in the near future , we will combine two data sets ( +1.5t and -.75t ) together to improve our sensitivities .    the strangeness penalty factor for adding hyperon to a nuclear cluster has never been measured in high energy heavy ion collisions . \n we have collected about 250 million let events ( 12 billion central events sampled ) . the unique high sensitivity and open geometry \n give us opportunity to measuring the production of @xmath51 and @xmath52 through their two - body mesonic decay channel@xcite . \n there are also data available for studying nuclear resonant states , such as @xmath53 , @xmath54 . with these new studies , \n we hope to better understand the dynamics of the high energy heavy ion collisions and provide more information for future experiments in searching for strangelets via coalescence . \n we gratefully acknowledge the excellent support of the ags staff . \n this work was supported by grants from the u.s . \n department of energy s hight energy and nuclear physics divisions , the u.s . \n national science foundation and the istituto di fisica nucleara of italy . \n 10 schaffner -

{"ContextTokens": 3578, "GeneratedTokens": 204, "SynthesizedBody": "observational evidence continues to establish the association of long gamma - ray bursts with active star forming regions of galaxies e.g. , @xcite . in addition , there are indications from the optical light curves of several ( long ) grb afterglows that supernova components may be directly observed as emission from the decelerating relativistic ejecta fades @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n these observational continue to support the collapsar models for grbs in which the core of a massive rotating star collapses to a black hole and rapidly accretes @xcite@xcite . \n it is therefor of interest to try to understand under what conditions a star which makes a grb will also make an observable supernova .    collapsars @xcite@xcite form dense accretion disks ( @xmath1 gm @xmath2 ) which are extremely optically thick to photons ( @xmath3 ) . as the stellar gas spirals through the disk , \n photons are trapped and accrete with the gas . \n this is in distinction from `` thin''accretion disks in which photons are assumed to escape to infinity carrying away the locally dissipated energy . \n since photons are trapped , viscous dissipation of orbital energy increases the disk entropy , pressure gradients are important for the force balance and the disk is `` thick . '' \n such non - radiating accretion flows are capable of ejecting gas away from the black hole @xcite . \n accretion in these disks is inefficient with significant fractions of the gas supplied at large radii being ejected from the system . \n an important feature of collapsar disks , is the realization at sufficiently high accretion rates ( @xmath4 ) of temperatures ( @xmath5 k ) and densities ( @xmath6 gm @xmath2 ) at which the loss of thermal energy to neutrino emission and photodisintegration of heavy nuclei allows for accretion with a range of efficiency . \n macfadyen & woosley @xcite showed that collapsar disks eject comparable amounts of material in a wind as is accreted by the central black hole . \n the fraction of accreted gas depends on the efficiency of neutrino cooling at removing entropy from the accreting gas . \n the remainder is ejected from the black hole as an outflowing wind . \n recent semi - analytic work @xcite has mapped the parameter space of inefficient neutrino - cooled accretion in agreement with detailed calculations of @xcite for limited parameters .    of particular interest in the case of collapsars is the chemical composition of the wind . \n collapsar disks are hot enough to completely photodisintegrate heavy nuclei to free nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) . \n recent simulations @xcite and @xcite show expulsion of free nucleon gas in the wind . \n this is important for two reasons : 1 ) energetics : free nucleons combining to iron group nuclei ( e.g. nickel-56 ) release 8 mev / nucleon or @xmath7 erg per solar mass of recombined material . \n 2 ) observability : this ejected material provides a long term energy supply to the explosion ( through radioactive decay of @xmath0ni ) enabling the gas to shine on time scales of months . \n models of the light curve of the energetic and peculiar type ibc supernova sn1998bw require large quantities of @xmath0ni ( m(@xmath0ni ) @xmath8 ) @xcite@xcite . \n conventional models require large explosion energies to produce sufficient nickel and fit the light curve . \n in addition abnormally high expansion velocities were inferred from the unusual spectrum indicating a large explosion energy ( @xmath9 erg ) . \n several groups have also interpreted deviations from power law decay of grb optical transients as supernovae light curve components and have matched them with appropriately shifted 1998bw light curves @xcite . \n since supernovae are invoked to interpret these observations it is important to note that a stellar explosion ( e.g. , jets piercing a star ) is not necessarily a supernova . \n supernovae , as an observable phenomenon , require a persistent source of energy input to power a light curve for long times ( weeks to months ) . \n it is necessary to make @xmath0ni in the explosion so that radioactive decay ( to cobalt to iron ) injects energy into the gas so that it can shine . lacking a persistent source of energy input , \n a stellar explosion would be unobservable via electromagnetic radiation . \n explosion energy released in the optically thick star would simply be converted to expansion kinetic energy with little or no light emitted .    in conventional core collapse supernovae \n some nickel is thought to be produced via explosive nuclear burning behind the explosion shock . \n however , current models for these `` delayed '' supernova explosions have trouble producing the @xmath10 erg for a normal supernova ( in fact , some current models fail to get any explosion at all ! ) and are unlikely to be capable of producing the higher energies required for 1998bw . \n as we have seen , neutrino cooling and photodisintegration of heavy nuclei are crucial for allowing gas to accrete efficiently . \n the neutrino cooling depends sensitively on temperature ( e.g. , @xmath11 for neutrino losses due to pair capture on free nucleons ) and therefore on the radius where the disk forms . \n this radius is , in turn , dependent on the angular momentum of the accreting gas with the disk first forming at the kepler radius @xmath12 cm , where @xmath13 is the specific angular momentum of the accreting gas in units of @xmath14 @xmath15 s@xmath16 and @xmath17 is the mass of the central black hole in units of three solar masses . the virial temperature for gas falling to its kepler radius @xmath18 k , where @xmath19 is the proton mass and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant . in terms of gravitational radii , @xmath21 \n , this temperature is @xmath22 k ( assuming a newtonian potential ) , where @xmath23 . \n we see that gas with @xmath24 is heated to above @xmath25 k so that it is fully photodisintegrated to free neutrons and protons from it s original composition of silicon , oxygen and helium . \n this means that capture of electron - positron pairs onto the free neutrons and protons serves as an efficient neutrino emission process which cools the gas and helps it to accrete efficiently . \n gas with @xmath26 , however , heats to less then @xmath27 k. at these lower temperatures the heavy nuclei fail to photodisintegrate and pair capture neutrino cooling is suppressed . \n this gas is therefor poorly cooled and subject to being driven from the disk . \n it is worth noting that gas with @xmath28 is partially photodisintegrated . \n photodisintegration acts as a loss for thermal energy for the gas and thus is effectively a cooling process , robbing about @xmath29 erg of thermal energy from every gram of photodisintegrated nuclei . \n this process helps the gas to accrete and provides free nucleons which enhance the neutrino cooling . \n the above discussion assumed @xmath30 though the scaling with @xmath17 is apparent . \n s@xmath16 . a wind ( the striped region in the upper right ) \n is blown from the collapsar disk at speeds of up to @xmath31 km s@xmath16 . \n the wind is composed of free neutrons and protons which can recombine to iron group elements injecting @xmath32 erg per @xmath33 m@xmath34 of reassembled nucleons . @xmath0ni in the wind can power a long term `` supernova '' light curve via radioactive decay of nickel and cobalt . \n the black solid arrows indicate the velocity of the gas flow while the thick dashed lines represent neutrino emission . the wind is shown only in the upper right quadrant for clarity but is in reality present in all four quadrants . ] \n interestingly , energy lost to photodisintegration becomes available again if the gas is ejected from the disk and begins to reassemble . \n effectively , gravitational energy is temporarily stored in the freeing of nucleons from the heavy nuclei . \n these nucleons are volatile in the sense that the have a huge nuclear energy source if they manage to escape the energetic photons trapped in the ( optically thick ) accretion disk \n . accretion physics may provide the nucleons with opportunity to escape the disk s nuclei - disintegrating photon bath . \n once free they can quickly recover nuclear binding energy by reassembling into iron group elements . \n this process can be explosive since the nuclei may recombine in seconds compared to millions of years it took them to assemble ( burn ) the first time around during the slower pre - explosion nuclear burning stages . \n in fact the reassembly , plus the kinetic luminosity of the disk wind , may power extremely energetic explosions . \n sn1998bw may be an example . \n the collapsar model relies on rapid accretion into the central black hole to power relativistic jets which pierce the star and make a grb and afterglow via internal and external shocks . \n it is notable that for an interesting range of angular momentum the accretion of the star simultaneously feeds the black hole rapidly and powers a wind @xcite . \n there are several interesting regimes determined by the angular momentum present in the collapsing star :    the following values of angular momentum correspond to important transition radii in the accretion flow :    @xmath35 angular momentum of the innermost stable circular orbit . \n this is the minimum angular momentum needed to form a disk around a black hole . \n @xmath36 angular momentum of gas that falls deep enough in the gravitational potential to photodisintegrate the heavy nuclei to free nucleons activating pair capture neutrino emission as an efficient coolant . \n @xmath37 angular momentum of gas that falls deep enough to cool partially . \n some gas accretes and some is expelled in a wind . \n the relative amount depends on the exact value of @xmath38    \\1 . \n @xmath39 - efficient neutrino cooling allows rapid accretion into black hole with plenty of power potentially going into jets with little or no outflows expected . \n this kind of star would not be expected to produce a bright supernova since little or no @xmath0ni is expected to be present in the exploding star . \n a possible caveat is that there is some nickel production via explosion burning in the lateral jet shock but the temperature is low in this region and not much mass is involved . \n @xmath40 - some gas accretes and some is ejected in a wind rates can be comparable depending on j. this can make both a grb and a `` supernova ''    \\3 . @xmath41 \n gas does nt cool efficiently so does nt feed the hole rapidly . not good for making an accretion powered grb . \n outflows may results with some recombination nickel possible if some gas is heated above @xmath27 k by a combination of virialization and viscous dissipation . of interest here \n is explosive burning of centrifugally supported oxygen . \n a less interesting regime is @xmath42 for which the gas falls directly to the innermost stable circular orbit without forming an accretion disk . \n note that electromagnetic extraction of black hole spin energy is a possible source of jet energy even for `` slowly '' accreting black holes . \n convective motions may even be favorable for building up large magnetic fields needed to extract the hole spin energy . \n as stellar gas collapses onto the collapsar accretion disk , adiabatic compression and shocks can raise the temperature sufficiently to photodisintegrate the gas to alpha particles and free nucleons . \n the destruction of the heavy nuclei is an energy sink for the gas which is helpful in allowing accretion to occur . \n photodisintegration of heavy nuclei ( e.g. , silicon , oxygen in the collapsing core ) costs @xmath43 per unit mass where @xmath44 ( or 8 mev / nucleon ) for complete disintegration to free nucleons . \n gas falling in a gravitational potential can dissipate its accretion energy by swapping nuclear binding energy for gravitational binding energy . \n a measure of where this occurs is where the gravitational binding energy equals the nuclear binding energy @xmath45 . \n if gas near the equator falls to it s keplerian radius the other half goes into the kinetic energy of keplerian rotation so @xmath46 .    measuring radius in gravitational radii @xmath47 where @xmath48 we can define a photodisintegration radius @xmath49 . we thus expect photodisintegration to `` cool '' accreting gas when falls to a radius of @xmath50 . \n the above scenario assumes significant viscosity in the disk gas corresponding to a shakura - sunyaev alpha viscosity parameter @xmath51 . \n the temperature and density of the disk wind and hence the nucleosynthesis depend on the disk viscosity . \n observations of the supernova powered by a collapsar wind may therefor help to constrain the viscosity of the collapsar accretion disk . \n recent calculations of the neutron abundance in one - dimensional accretion disk models relevant to grbs @xcite indicate that the inner parts of collapsar accretion disks may be too neutron rich to produce significant quantities of nickel-56 @xcite@xcite . \n outflows from these inner regions may instead be of interest for rare nucleosynthesis like the r - process . however , much of the mass loss from grb accretion disks ( collapsars and otherwise ) may come from the outer regions of the disks where electron capture has not significantly neutronized the material composing the outflow . \n collapsar disks may have more than one active wind blowing region : 1 . the outer disk where low densities imply non - degenerate electrons and little neutron excess ( @xmath52 ) . radioactive nickel-56 may result from nucleosynthesis taking place in as this wind expands . \n 2 . the innermost disk where the disk becomes optically thick to neutrino emission and is again poorly cooled . \n this innermost disk wind is significantly neutronized and will not produce nickel-56 . however , it is an interesting site for the r - process because of the large neutron fraction and large entropies attained from viscous dissipation .    in between these two disk regions , \n the disk is ( partially ) neutrino - cooled and most ( but not necessarily all ) of the gas can accrete . \n this region of the disks transports the fraction of gas received from the outer , i.e. the gas not ejected in the wind , plus gas falling onto the neutrino - cooled region of the disk . \n fruchter , a.  2002 , american physical society , april meeting , jointly sponsored with the high energy astrophysics division ( head ) of the american astronomical society april 20 -

{"ContextTokens": 3408, "GeneratedTokens": 315, "SynthesizedBody": "in standard cosmology it is assumed that the space - time is homogeneous and isotropic . \n after the discovery of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and accelerating expansion of the universe , a standard cosmological model describing universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) is formulated , known as @xmath0cdm model or cosmic concordance model . \n fluctuations in the temperature of cmb radiation are statistically isotropic in this model @xcite . \n a central assumption in our standard model of cosmology ( and in most cosmological models ) is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic upto small perturbations , and thus described by a perturbed freidmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric . \n obersevations show that the temperature of the cmb is isotropic to a remarkable degree indicating that our universe is close to an friedmann - lemaitre ( fl ) model . \n according to ehlers , geren and sachs ( egs ) theorem @xcite , if the cmb temperature were exactly isotropic about every point in spacetime , then the universe would have to be exactly an fl model . \n this result is not directly applicable to cmb , because , cmb radiation is not exactly isotropic . \n the presence of temperature anisotropies in the cmb from the observations made by cobe / wmap satellites are inconsistent with an exact homogeneous and isotropic frw model @xcite . \n the current cmb data supports an inflationary big bang model of cosmic origin for our universe . \n however at large angular scales , there are some anomalies observed in cmb data , such as , a low value for quadrupole power , alignment of quadrupole and octopole modes roughly in the direction of virgo cluster , ecliptic north - south power asymmetry , parity asymmetry between even and odd multipoles , almost zero correlations on large angular scales of cmb and an anomalous cold spot ( @xmath1 diameter ) in the southern galactic hemisphere of cmb sky @xcite . several solutions to the low multipole cmb anomalies \n have been put forth such as foregrounds / systematics , anisotropic space - times and exotic topologies @xcite . \n some of these supposed deviations seen in cmb data were addressed by the wmap and planck science teams also @xcite . \n these deviations may be an evidence that we live in a globally anisotropic universe .    generally , in a global anisotropic universe , during inflation , shear decreases and eventually it goes over to an isotropic phase with negligible shear @xcite . in order to produce any substantial amount of shear in recent times \n one needs to induce anisotropy in the spacetime . \n one way to induce anisotropy is to have anisotropic matter present at the last scattering surface . \n it was shown earlier that the power suppression in cmb quadrupole , without affecting higher multipoles , can be explained by assuming anisotropic matter ( magnetic fields ) @xcite . \n earlier works on anisotropic cosmological models with anisotropic stresses can be found , for example , in ref . \n anisotropic dark energy as a possible solution to the cosmic acceleration as well as the large scale cmb anomalies is studied , for example , in ref . \n the anisotropic sources can be a uniform magnetic field , cosmic strings or domain walls \n . a nanogauss scale magnetic field could be present today which would have been produced during inflation due to a lorentz - violating term to the photon sector @xcite . \n we call this as `` lorentz violation generated magnetic field ( lvmf ) '' . other possibilities such as a maxwell type vector field coupled to a scalar field \n is studied , for example , in ref . \n @xcite .    in this paper \n our approach is not to deal with metric approach directly , but rather to adhere to an approach similar to orthonormal frame formalism @xcite . \n this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : bianchii ] , we write down the einstein s equations in cosmic time . \n geodesic equations in cosmic time are studied in section [ sec : geodesic ] . in section [ sec : \n fixedpoint ] , we do a fixed point analysis of all the evolution equations in terms of a dimensionless time variable ( @xmath2 ) , to study the asymptotic evolution of the state observables . \n then , in section [ sec : cmbpattern ] , we show the temperature patterns for cmb due to various anisotropic sources considered in our study . \n a more realistic model including the ordinary dark matter and dark energy components in addition to the anisotropic sources already considered , is studied in section [ sec : realscenario ] . in section [ sec : snconstr ] , we obtain the constrains on the fractional energy densites due to various components in the realistic model of the previous section , the level of shear , and also determine a preferred axis if present . \n finally , we conclude our work in section [ sec : conclusion ] . \n the way we study dynamical systems is that we first write evolution equations in terms of few dimensionless state observables . \n it is a very invaluable tool to obtain qualitative information about the solutions of the state space of bianchi universes ( see ref . \n @xcite and references therein ) . here \n we concentrate only on bianchi  i model . \n first we derive the einstein equations in metric approach . \n then we write in terms of the state observables analogous to the orthonormal frame formalism @xcite . in this approach \n one writes the field equations as first order differential equations . \n an advantage of this orthonormal frame approach is that the derivation of geodesic equation is easy compared to the metric approach . \n we start with a bianchi  i line element with a residual planar symmetry in the @xmath3 plane as @xmath4 we choose the diagonal energy momentum tensor of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n the four kinds of anisotropic matter we study here are given in table  [ tabl : matter ] . \n the magnetic field configuration considered here as anisotropic source is well known @xcite . \n we , then consider a particular configuration of infinite domain walls ( spanning the @xmath3 plane ) stacked along the @xmath8axis . in this case , average energy momentum tensor will take the form we just described . \n similarly , the average energy momentum tensor due to a distribution of long , thin , straight cosmic strings along @xmath8axis which takes an anisotropic form , also serves as anisotropic matter source @xcite . \n finally , a magnetic field generated due to a lorentz - violating term in the photon sector , which we call lvmf in short , is also studied as an anisotropic source @xcite . \n .matter content for different anisotropic sources considered in this paper . [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ] \n here we studied the evolution of bianchi - i universe in the presence of different types of anisotropic matter sources . \n first we analyzed the evolution of the state space variables @xmath9 in cosmic time . \n depending on the initial conditions we found that there can be a sign change in the shear . \n this may have some interesting implications in early universe cosmology . \n then we examined the evolution of dimensionless variables viz . \n , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in dimensionless time @xmath2 . in the @xmath13frame \n , we determined the fixed points of the full set of evolution equations including the geodesic equations . \n we also checked the stability of the fixed points numerically . in terms of @xmath2 variable , we get an analytic expression for the temperature anisotropies of the cmbr . \n then we generated the temperature patterns of the cmb for the four different types of anisotropic matter considered here . \n we found that the contribution to the cmb temperature signal is mainly through the quadrupole . \n we also pointed out the difference between the cmb tempearture maps due to all cases of anoisotropic matter considered in this work . \n we then investigated a more realistic scenario where we included ordinary isotropic dark matter and cosmological constant as dark energy . \n we found that the universe asymptotically evolves to a desitter universe . \n we also constrained the parameters of this model using supernovae union  2 data . \n we also found a preferred axis from the data for all the four cases of anisotropic matter . \n this anisotropy axis is found to be same independent of the anisotropic source we used . \n it turns out that this axis is very close to the mirror symmetry axis found in cmb data @xcite \n .    it will be interesting to generalise our results to other bianchi classes - a and b. in case of other bianchi models the state space would be larger and we need to find different subspace of the state space and their stable fixed points . \n it will also be interesting to study the cmb polarisation anisotropy in these models . \n +   + * acknowledgements * : s.t . would like to acknowledge department of science and technology , india for financial support . \n hinshaw g. et al . , 2003 , \n apjs , 148 , 135 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3659, "GeneratedTokens": 292, "SynthesizedBody": "broad - line radio galaxies are the radio - loud kin of seyfert 1 galaxies , and as such they offer the possibility of investigating why some agn show strong radio jets . understanding the origin of the radio - loudness is important , since the mechanical energy deposited through agn jet activity is thought to be a primary way that the agn can impact its host galaxy evolution @xcite . \n recent studies show that the cool gas necessary to re - trigger the agn activity needed to power the radio - loudness in radio galaxies , which are pre - dominatently hosted by ellipticals , is provided by galaxy interactions such as mergers @xcite . \n however , this still does not address the issue that , while some agn do launch powerful jets , many do not . \n it is possible that the magnetic field build - up and black hole spin are decisive factors for this @xcite . \n x - ray observations can provide both the determination of the black hole spin , as well as the detection of any changes in the inner accretion disk as one might expect them from significant changes to the magnetic flux strength . \n previous works in the x - ray band have indicated that a typical radio galaxy x - ray spectrum possesses a relatively flat photon index , weak cold reflection signatures , and in some cases a weak relativistic reflection component ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the distinctly flatter photon index raises questions as to whether the entire comptonization spectrum is different in this source class , implying differences in the balance of cooling and heating of the corona . \n the recent launch of the _ nustar _ \n observatory @xcite provides the opportunity to study the broadband spectra of agn with unprecedented sensitivity , allowing us to start directly addressing this issue in sources . to yield the best results the target s x \n - ray spectrum should possess a continuum dominated by comptonization , requiring only weak or no jet contribution . \n a recent study of a suitable source , the radio galaxy 3c382 , with _ nustar _ confirms the previous results of weak reflection and a flat photon index . \n additionally they show for the first time that the high - energy cut - off of the comptonization spectrum is time - variable in radio galaxies and possibly flux - dependent @xcite . \n this paper builds on this discovery and the need for a better understanding of comptonization spectrum in broad - line radio galaxies , focusing on the coronal parameters of the radio galaxy , 3c390.3 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , using a joint soft x - ray ( _ suzaku _ ) and hard x - ray ( _ nustar _ ) observation \n .    previous work in the x - ray band on 3c390.3 has found its timing properties not to differ from those of radio - quiet seyferts @xcite and there to be no noticeable contribution from jet to the x - ray emission @xcite . \n @xcite performed a detailed broad - band spectral analysis including _ xmm _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ swift_-bat data , determining that two different spectral models can describe the x - ray spectra well . \n the first model includes a continuum modeled by a cut - off power law ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , cold reflection ( @xmath9 ) and a narrow gaussian line to model the fexxv line detected in the data . \n the second model is similar to the first model but models the fexxv line with a highly ionized , blurred reflector ( @xmath10 ) . \n it has been shown by @xcite that the modeling of fexxv and ionized reflection can be ambiguous in broad - line radio galaxies . \n the paper is organized in the following way : we begin by providing an overview of how the data were reduced in  [ datared ] . \n this is followed by a description of the x - ray spectral modeling (  [ spec_modeling ] ) , and a brief study dedicated to the iron k band (  [ fe_modeling ] ) . \n the x - ray analysis is then supplemented by a study of spectral energy distribution of this agn (  [ sed_modeling ] ) and conclude with a discussion of our results (  [ disc ] ) . \n an overview of the observations considered in this work is given in table  [ nu_obs ] . \n .overview of observations and their characteristics . \n the exposures are the net exposures used during the x - ray broad - band spectral modeling given per xis in the case of _ suzaku _ and per fpm for _ nustar_. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also tested an alternative scenario similar to the one suggested by @xcite , where the accretion disk is covered by a warm layer producing a low temperature , optically - thick comptonization component that extends from the optical / uv into the soft x - ray band . \n this component is assumed to replace the standard accretion disk component . \n however , we find that such a component is unable to produce enough optical / uv flux without producing significantly more soft x - ray flux than observed . \n with a 2 - 10kev flux of @xmath11 the source was observed to be brighter in this observation than in any other previous high quality ccd data and slightly above the average flux of all previous _ rxte _ observations @xcite . from the 2 - 10kev flux \n , we estimate an eddington fraction of 1% using a bolometric correction of 6.33 as determined by @xcite . \n the results from the x - ray spectral analysis in this work are in good agreement with those of the previous broad - band analysis by @xcite . \n contrary to the softer - when - brighter trend seen in many seyferts , the photon index of the power law in this observation is similar to that of the previous high quality ccd observations at lower flux ( @xmath12 versus 1.72 ) , suggesting a rather stable shape for the primary continuum . \n the neutral reflection fraction on the other hand is found to be much smaller in this observation ( @xmath13 versus 0.81 ) and much more in the realm that is typically expected for broad - line radio galaxies . \n this could however be due to the inclusion of the bat data , which is non - simultaneaous in the @xcite analysis . \n attributing the discrepancy to such a technical problem seems reasonable given that the average pca+hxte spectra indicate reflection fraction of @xmath14 @xcite . in our observation \n we do not find evidence for any broadening in the iron k@xmath15 line (  [ fe_modeling ] ) , however we do find a weak soft excess that can be well described by a blurred ionized reflector . attempting to model the soft x - ray excess with an additional power law , which could physically represent either a low energy comptonization component @xcite or a jet component , leads to a worse fit than the reflection scenario . \n ( this is also confirmed by the sed fitting in  [ sed_modeling ] . ) \n therefore we conclude similar to @xcite and @xcite that an ionized reflector is present in the x - ray spectrum of this agn . \n the fact that it is not very apparent in this observation can be explained by a variable ionized reflector . \n a variable ionized reflector is predicted along with the formation of the new jet knots @xcite and would therefore not be surprising . \n the exact strength and shape of the ionized reflection component in 3c390.3 depends on the comptonization model , as we will see below . \n the overall exceptionally low reflection fraction observed in broad - line radio galaxies can be explained by an outflowing corona @xcite . \n if the corona is outflowing at mildly relativistic speeds , the emission is beamed away from the accretion disk lowering the amount of reflection . \n overall , we find that the x - ray spectrum of 3c390.3 can be well described by a model consisting of a primary continuum , cold and ionized reflection , and photoionized emission . for the primary continuum we consider three possibilities : a cut - off power law as a purely phenomenological model and the two thermal comptonization models ` comptt ` and ` eqpair ` . \n all continua yield fits of comparable quality and the total spectral models consequently appear almost identical in the observable 0.7 - 80kev band ( fig . \n [ models_comparison ] ) . \n however , the contribution of the different model components differs for the two comptonization models . in figure  [ models_comparison ] \n the dashed lines show the primary continuum for both cases , indicating that for the ` comptt ` case the primary continuum accounts for most of the flux at lower energies , while for ` eqpair ` this is not the case . \n the remaining , required soft x - ray flux in the ` eqpair ` case is made by neutral and ionized reflection , as the increase in the reflection fraction shows with @xmath16=0.09 to @xmath17=0.30 and @xmath18=0.07 to @xmath19=0.23 . at first glance \n one might therefore be tempted to reject the ` eqpair ` solution . \n the view changes , however , as one extends the models to energies above 80kev , where the models diverge . \n no x - ray data exists for those energies that are simultaneous with the _ suzaku_/_nustar _ \n observation , but we can use the average 70month _ swift_-bat spectrum as guidance on how the x - ray spectrum might look like at higher energies . \n the spectrum , which is overlayed on the best fit model in figure  [ models_comparison ] , agrees well with all best fit models below 40kev , above this energy it is systematically brighter . \n it is important to note here that it is inherent to comptonization models that they roll over more rapidly than the phenomenological exponential cut - off included in ` pexmon ` @xcite . comparing the two comptonization models \n , it seems that the ` eqpair ` solution produces fluxes better in agreement with bat spectrum . \n the high energy cut - off of our thermal comptonization spectrum of 117@xmath20kev is in very good agreement with a joint ibis / bat spectral analysis suggesting a cut - off temperature of @xmath21kev @xcite and the result from the joint epic - pn / xis / pin / bat fit by @xcite returning @xmath22kev . \n this would suggest that the coronal temperature was constant , however the large errorbars can not exclude a change . possibly , fig . \n [ models_comparison ] could be seen as weak evidence that at brighter fluxes the cut - off is lower . \n such a trend could be caused by increased coronal cooling from stronger uv emission ( more seed photons ) . \n indeed , when comparing the uvot fluxes to the om fluxes we find that the source was brighter in the new uvot observation ( the agn flux doubled in the u - band ) . \n it is likely that given the large errorbars a small change in the coronal temperature / high energy cut - off would be undetectable . \n the coronal temperature found for 3c390.3 is rather cool ( @xmath3kev ) , similar to what has been found in ic 4329a @xcite , swift j2127.4 + 5654 @xcite and mcg-05 - 23 - 016 @xcite . \n in contrast to these coronae with temperatures of @xmath23 , _ nustar _ has also found several sources with coronal temperatures above 150kev such as 3c382 @xcite and ark120 @xcite . \n the number of measurements is still too small to suggest a reason for the wide spread of the measured temperatures . \n one possibility could be that the coronal temperature is linked to the radiative compactness of the corona . while we have already noted that the hard over soft compactness measures the ratio of heating and cooling , the compactness by itself tells us about the importance of photon - photon interactions @xcite . \n if @xmath24 is much greater than 1 ( as is the case here ) these become important . \n if sufficient high - energy photons are produced via compton upscattering these will start to create electron / positron pairs until at some point there will be so many pairs formed that the temperature of the corona is decreased significantly . therefore there is a maximum temperature a corona can reach at any given compactness . \n below this temperature the corona would still be able to heat up further , but above it pair production will cool it down again . \n accurate predictions of this equilibrium temperature are difficult as it depends on the unknown geometrical layout of the disk corona system . \n however , @xcite show that the coronal temperature measurements with _ nustar _ do indeed show a dependency with the coronal compactness that is similar to that expected for a slab corona . \n the measurement of 3c390.3 , which is also included in @xcite , agrees well with the other measurements and supports the idea of an equilibrium temperature .    aside from the coronal temperature \n the other key parameter returned by the comptonization models is the optical depth of the corona . from our measurements we find it to be large ( @xmath25 ) , meaning that all soft photons entering the corona will be scattered multiple times . \n depending on the geometry of the corona this could lead to an apparent truncation of the accretion disk as the photons can not escape unscattered . \n this apparent truncation could be detected in the reflection spectrum and the accretion disk spectrum . \n unfortunately the _ \n swift_-uvot photometry does not allow a measurement of the accretion disk temperature for the unscattered component , which could indentify a blocked central region . \n however , our measurements of high spin and very high emissivity from the reflection spectrum , if taken at face value , suggest that we are seeing very close to the black hole . \n in fact the vast majority of the reflection would stem from a small ring around the black hole . \n the easiest way to bring this into agreement with the high optical depth of the corona would be a very compact corona ( see also below ) . \n we caution however that the extreme reflection parameters could also indicate that we have reached the limits of the current spectral models . \n curious is also the disagreement between uv predicted by the x - ray spectral and measured uv emission by about a factor of @xmath26 . \n a similar phenomenon has been found for 3c382 with also a factor of about 10 @xcite . \n this mismatch of predicted and measured uv / optical emission can be explained by the spatial compactness of the corona , which causes only a small fraction of the total disk emission to enter the corona and be comptonized . \n there is much observational evidence for the corona being of small spatial extent , for example microlensing ( e.g. , * ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , broad iron lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , and time lags ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the sed presented in figure  [ sed ] also reveals that a naive modeling of the sed as is performed in this work predicts detectable accretion disk flux in the very soft x - ray band . \n this small flux contribution from the accretion disk is inconsistent with the weak soft excess observed in the x - ray spectrum of 3c390.3 . with the continuum being describable by only thermal comptonization , no contribution from the jet to the x - ray spectrum \n can be found in 3c390.3 . \n this is another matter concerning radio galaxy x - ray spectra , which is generally still open to debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n our finding is in good agreement with the fermi non - detection of 3c390.3 suggesting that the jet emission is only very weak in the hard x - ray band @xcite . \n we thank the anonymous referee for their helpful comments . \n al thanks julien malzac for helpful discussions and acknowledges support from the erc advanced grant feedback . \n ft would like to thank m. coleman miller and brian morsony for the useful comments . \n m.b . acknowledges support from nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space science fellowship program , grant nnx14aq07h . \n this work made use of data from the _ nustar _ mission , a project led by the california institute of technology , managed by the jet propulsion laboratory , and funded by the national aeronautics and space administration . \n this research has made use of the _ nustar _ data analysis software ( nustardas ) jointly developed by the asi science data center ( asdc , italy ) and the california institute of technology ( usa ) . \n this research has made use of data obtained from the _ suzaku _ satellite , a collaborative mission between the space agencies of japan ( jaxa ) and the usa ( nasa ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1922763241434, "RequestID": "b43de675a09918b7778811baa09a0eb04430be2c", "TotalTokens": 3951}

ray emission . on long time \n scales the x - ray emission of the two ins candidates is almost constant . \n however , most remarkably , pulsations with a period of 8.4 seconds were detected for rxj0720.43125 , which , under the assumption of accretion , indicate a low magnetic field ( @xmath010@xmath23 g ) and a small space velocity ( @xmath010 km s@xmath24 ) for the neutron star ( haberl et al . \n a third , fainter candidate ins , rxj0806.44123 , also detected in the rass has been reported by haberl et al . \n its optical counterpart has @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .    assuming that only two ins with count rates @xmath02 pspc cts s@xmath24 exist in the rass \n , we expect a number of order 20 over the whole sky with count rates @xmath00.2cts  s@xmath24 ( c.f . \n neuhuser & trmper 1998 ) . \n in order to improve the determination of the x - ray luminosity function of x - ray emitting source classes , mainly agns , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , we have almost completed a program of optical identifications of bright , high - galactic - latitude x - ray sources , termed the rosat bright survey rbs . the goal is to completely identify all bright x - ray sources , @xmath27 pspc cts s@xmath24 , detected in the rosat all - sky survey ( 1rxs catalogue , voges et al . \n 1996 ) at galactic latitudes @xmath28 , excluding lmc , smc and the virgo cluster ( hasinger et al .  1997 \n ; fischer et al .  1998 ; \n schwope et al . \n the rbs is already to 98% spectroscopically complete . \n we find a total of 757 stars , 659 agn , 297 clusters of galaxies , 171 bl lac candidates , 43 galaxies , 49 cataclysmic variables or x - ray binaries . \n only 36 of the more than 2000 sources in the sample are not yet identified . among the known types of x - ray emitters , the bl lac objects are those with the most extreme x - ray to optical flux ratio . \n yet the optically faintest bl lac objects at @xmath29 have @xmath30 ( fig . \n [ f : colcol ] shows the ratio @xmath31 for bl lac objects , ins candidates and unidentified rbs sources ) .    for all unidentified x - ray sources we have produced finding charts from the roe / nrl and apm digitised sky survey catalogues . \n the position errors of bright rass - sources are of sufficient quality that we can immediately localize x - ray sources with empty rass error circles on the sky survey plates . \n for quite a number of such objects we have been awarded short follow - up observations with the rosat hri in the last years or looked in the archive , in order to investigate whether the source is a fluke or has an exceptionally large x - ray position error ( a number of such objects existed in the first processing of the all - sky - survey , rass - i ) . \n another possibility is that the x - ray source is extended ( cluster or group ) and therefore has a formally empty error circle . finally , in one case so far the hri confirmed the position and flux of the x - ray source and has put very strong constraints on the magnitude of an optical counterpart . \n the field of rbs1223 has been observed with the rosat hri on june 13 , 1997 at 19:58 ut for a net exposure time of 2218s . \n we have corrected the individual x - ray photons for the hri plate - scale factor of 0.9972 ( hasinger et al . \n 1998 ) and then analysed the data using the standard interactive analysis system exsas ( zimmermann et al . \n the hri observation showed a point - like x - ray source consistent with the position of 1rxsj130848.6 + 212708 . \n positions of rosat pointed sources have a routine accuracy of @xmath010  due to inherent attitude errors . \n the hri position of rbs1223 however , could be related to an absolute celestial reference system through the fortuitous detection of a second , fainter hri source about 4.5 arcmin west of rbs1223 , which could be identified with the bright ( @xmath32 ) star ag+21 1341 ( using simbad ) . \n the x - ray position of the second hri source is within @xmath33 of the optical position of ag+21 1341 , as determined from the apm catalogue . \n we did not consider it necessary to correct for this shift . \n the final position of rbs1223 is therefore ra(2000)@xmath34 , dec(2000)@xmath35 . \n taking into account the statistical accuracy of the centroiding for both sources , the 90% position error for rbs1223 is 1.6 arcsec . fig . \n [ f : xcont_over ] shows a superposition of the x - ray contours of the rbs1223 field on a digitised copy of the poss - ii plate , clearly indicating an empty error box down to the plate limit . \n the hri count rate of rbs1223 , @xmath36  cts  s@xmath24 , is comparable to the pspc count rate of @xmath37  cts  s@xmath24 . \n rbs1223 has pspc hardness ratios which can be fit with a blackbody temperature of @xmath38ev , and an interstellar absorption column density of @xmath39  @xmath40 , consistent with the total galactic value in this direction , @xmath41  @xmath40 . \n the unabsorbed blackbody flux at earth is about @xmath42  erg  @xmath40  s@xmath24 . \n we have analysed the @xmath43 hri photons from rbs1223 for periodicities in the x - ray flux , but did not detect any significant signal in the fourier transform of the data . \n -0.5truecm    ( 8,8 )    -0.5truecm    -0.5truecm \n images of the rbs1223 field have been obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al . \n 1995 ) at the cassegrain focus of the keck ii telescope on the photometric night of march 19th , 1998 . \n the @xmath44 pixel loral ccd was read out in single amplifier mode . a 15 min exposure through the r filter \n was taken at 13:33 ut and a 15 min exposure through the b filter at 13:52 ut . \n the reduction was done using midas . \n the two frames were bias subtracted , cleaned of cosmic rays and flat - fielded using twilight flats . \n no photometric standards were taken . using the brightness limits derived by kvk98 for the same instrumental setup and same observing conditions we estimate the limiting magnitude of our images at about @xmath45 by scaling with the sqaureroot of the integration time . for our estimate of the x - ray to optical flux ratio \n we used the conservative limit of @xmath46 . \n [ f : xcont_detail ] shows the hri x - ray contours of rbs1223 superposed on the @xmath47 keck image . \n no optical counterpart is detected in the x - ray error circle in either the @xmath47 or the @xmath48 image . using the observed x - ray flux from above we derive a lower limit of @xmath49 , using the relation @xmath50 ( maccacaro et al . \n 1988 ) under the assumption of @xmath51 . \n -0.5truecm    ( 8,8 )    -0.5truecm    -0.5truecm \n rbs1223 has all properties that single out the new class of isolated neutron stars identified by rosat : a very high x - ray to optical flux ratio , a rather soft x - ray spectrum and a constant x - ray flux over long time scales . with its very small x - ray error box \n it will provide a further challenge for optical identification . scaling from the counterpart of rxj1856.53754 ( walter & matthews 1998 ) we expect its optical magnitude in the range @xmath52 , within reach of the hst and ground - based 810 m telescopes . \n the direct prediction of the optical brightness assuming pure blackbody radiation with the spectral parameters of tab . \n 1 gives only @xmath53 , beyond the limit of current telescopes . \n [ f : colcol ] shows the extreme position of rbs1223 and the other ins candidates of tab \n .  1 plotted in a kind of x - ray / optical colour - colour diagram together with the otherwise most extreme point - like rbs sources , the bl lac objects . only sources with a very peaked x - ray - optical spectrum can be in the upper left corner of this diagram . \n rbs1223 is the faintest of all known ins candidates and has also the highest x - ray temperature . among the 36 unidentified rbs sources , \n there is only a handful of objects with x - ray hardness ratios consistent with ins . \n ( we have , however , to be careful about possible misidentified objects in x - ray surveys ) . the next best ins candidate from the rosat bright survey is rbs1556 , which lies in the same part of the diagram . at somewhat lower values of @xmath54 \n there are a number of unidentified objects , which could be either bl lac candidates or ins . assuming between 2 and 10 candidate objects in the rbs , a rough estimate of the surface density of ins brighter than 0.2 pspc cts / s is @xmath55  sources  sr@xmath24 . \n the lower and upper limit can provide strong constraints on the ins @xmath56 function and therefore on the nature of the population as a whole . \n the accreting old neutron star scenario was recently criticized because of a number of highly uncertain assumptions or unlikely requirements ( see the discussion in kvk98 ; wang et al . \n a very low magnetic field is required to overcome the propeller effect and allow accretion . \n ism accretion would most likely be highly variable on time - scales of months to years . \n finally , accreting neutron stars would quickly build up a hydrogen - rich envelope , which should appear much brighter in the optical band than is detected for ins ( wang et al . \n 1998 ) . \n several authors have therefore proposed alternatives or variants for the nature of isolated neutron star candidates . \n haberl et al . \n ( 1997 ) suggest a connection of rxj0720.43125 to the class of anomalous pulsars ( mereghetti & stella 1995 ) which might be born with low space velocities and magnetic fields . \n kvk98 discuss the interesting possibility that the ins candidates are cooling magnetars , very high magnetic field isolated neutron stars with long spin period , which are associated with soft gamma ray repeaters . at any rate , \n the detection of more objects of this class and their detailed study with existing and upcoming x - ray and optical instruments is of vital importance for the understanding of their nature . \n we thank the referee frederick m.  walter for helpful comments . \n the rosat project is supported by the bundesministerium fr bildung , forschung und wissenschaft ( bmbf ) , by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and the science and engineering research council ( serc ) . \n the w.m . \n keck observatory is operated as a scientific partnership between the california institute of technology , the university of california , and the national aeronautics and space administration . \n it was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.m . \n keck foundation . \n this research has made use of the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france and was greatly facilitated by use of the apm catalogue based on scans of the poss plates performed at the institute of astronomy , cambridge , uk and the cosmos scans of the eso / serc j plates performed at the royal observatory edinburgh . \n this work has been supported in part by dlr grant 50 or 9403 5 ( ads , gh ) and by nasa grant nag5 -

bang control @xcite . \n given a single spin-@xmath0 dirac electron with the rest mass @xmath1 , we could realize the qubit by the spin up and down along the @xmath2 direction . \n if the dirac electron is coupled with an noisy magnetic environment , the coherence of the spin - qubit will be lost . in conventional quantum information theory ( cqit ) \n , people always assume that the central quantum system is at rest . in this paper \n , we present the time evolution of the spin state of a _ moving _ dirac electron . \n it can be seen that the decoherence properties is significantly modified by special relativity . \n we demonstrate that the dressed environment induced by special relativity will suppress the spin decoherence . \n one should note that , the problem we consider here is different from the gravitational decoherence @xcite , which results from quantum metric fluctuations and unruh effect . \n the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec . \n ii we demonstrate the spin dephasing of a rest electron . in sec . \n iii the influences of special relativity on the spin decoherence properties is investigated by presenting its dynamical behavior in the operator -

diagonal elements , which will decay exponentially as @xmath19 until @xmath20 in the long time limit @xmath21 , i.e. the spin state becomes classically mixed . \n to deal with the relativistic dirac electron moving at a constant velocity @xmath22 relative to the rest frame @xmath23 , we should adopt the dirac equation for the electron in external homogeneous static fields . after choosing a suitable reference frame @xmath24 , \n the dirac hamiltonian in foldy -

diagonals will not vanish . from the evolution of diagonal and off - diagonal elements in eqs.([de],[nde ] ) , we can establish a physical picture of the above analyses by expressing the spin density matrix at time @xmath10 in the operator - sum representation@xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . \n the operators @xmath81 are @xmath82^{1/2}(\\cos \\varphi \\sigma _ { x}+\\sin \\varphi \\sigma _ { y})$ ] and @xmath83 . \n if the velocity of the electron @xmath67 , the modulation factor @xmath84 , and the above results reduce to the pure dephasing of a rest spin . when we consider a moving electron , the first two terms in eq.([osr ] ) \n is similar to pure dephasing . \n however , the decay rate of the off - diagonal elements is amplified by the factor @xmath85 . \n the suppression of dephasing stems from the third term @xmath86 . \n the other two operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 in eq.([osr ] ) represent different decoherence mechanisms which makes the spin suffer from other decoherence than pure dephasing . \n we could also formulate the evolution of the spin state of the moving electron as in the dressed environment    @xmath89^{\\kappa } ( v\\rho v^{\\dagger } ) [ \\exp ( i\\frac{\\delta _ { 0}}{2}\\sigma _ { z})]^{\\kappa } \\eta ( b)db\\right\\ } v\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 $ ] is the dressing transformation , @xmath91 is the angle between the axes @xmath92 and @xmath2 . from the viewpoint of qubit , after the control operation @xmath93 , the initial state @xmath94 will undergo pure dephasing in the dressed hilbert space , the final reverse operation @xmath95 will recover some coherence information in the original hilbert space . \n the modulation factors @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the key ingredients that characterize the influence of special relativity . \n fig 2 shows the modulation factor @xmath96 as a function of the rapidity @xmath41 and @xmath98 . for a given rapidity @xmath41 , the modulation factor \n @xmath99 $ ] . \n we are interested in the maximum value of the modulation factor @xmath96 . \n thus we consider the first order partial differential equation @xmath100 , which leads to @xmath101 , and the corresponding maximum value of @xmath96 is@xmath102we plot the maximum value @xmath103 for various rapidity @xmath41 in the following fig 3(a ) . \n it can be seen that @xmath103 always increases monotonically as the rapidity @xmath41 grows . in the limit @xmath104 , \n i.e. the velocity is close to the light velocity @xmath105 , the maximum modulation factor @xmath103 reaches the constant value @xmath14 .    for the angle @xmath98 of the velocity @xmath106 that maximize the value of @xmath107 , the corresponding value of the other modulation factor @xmath108 is @xmath109 . \n when we consider the relativistic dirac electron , i.e. the velocity @xmath106 is comparable to the light velocity @xmath110 , @xmath111 , which can be neglected in some sense . \n _ example _ to explicitly demonstrate the influence of special relativity on the spin decoherence of a moving dirac electron , we consider a spin qubit in a fully coherent initial state @xmath112 . we could have chosen a more general initial spin state with different relative amplitudes . \n however , the above state gives rise to all interesting physical features in the situation considered here . \n we set the velocity angle @xmath113 to maximize the modulus of the saturation value of off - diagonal elements , thus @xmath114 \\\\ \n \\rho _ { \\uparrow \\downarrow } ( t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}[(1-\\eta ) e^{-\\gamma ^{\\prime } t^{2}}+\\eta ] \\end{aligned}\\]]we plot the decay of the off -

diagonal elements decay much faster , which is due to the amplification of @xmath117by the factor @xmath118 . \n however , as the time is longer , the decay of the off - diagonal elements will be much suppressed . in particular , \n if the time is sufficiently long , for @xmath116 , the spin degree of freedom becomes completely classical ; while for @xmath115 , the off -

1999 ) of data in the 94 galactic bulge fields . \n the data that are currently available for the analysis consist of 5 seasons ( 1993 - 1997 ) in 77 fields , and contain the photometry of about 30 million stars , including 2.1 million clump giants . \n the events with clump giants as sources have been selected from the sample of all events which contains about @xmath5 candidates . \n the determination of which of these sources are clump giants , is investigated through the analysis of the global properties of the color - magnitude diagram in the galactic bulge . \n using the accurately measured extinction towards baade s window allows one to locate _ \n clump giants on the reddening - free color - magnitude diagram . \n this defines the parallelogram - shaped box in the upper left corner of the left panel of figure 1 . with the assumption that the clump populations in the whole bulge have the same properties as the ones in the baade s window \n , the parallelogram described above can be shifted by the reddening vector to mark the expected locations of clump giants in different fields . \n the solid lines are the boundaries of the region where one could find the clump giants in fields with different extinctions . using this approach \n , we identified 52 clump events . \n there is a high concentration of long - duration events in macho field 104 at @xmath0 as 5 out of 10 clump events longer than 50 days are in 104 . \n the analysis of event durations _ uncorrected _ for efficiencies provides a lower limit on the difference between field 104 and all the other fields . \n we use the wilcoxon s test on two samples : events in field 104 and all the remaining ones , and find that the events in 104 differ ( are longer ) at the level of @xmath6 . \n in addition , field 104 also has the highest optical depth ( see figure 1 ) . \n both of these features can be explained by the concentration of mass along this particular line of sight . \n first , we report the average optical depth of : @xmath7 which is 1.5 - 2 times lower than the previously obtained values . \n we caution that this result is only preliminary , because possible systematic errors may be a fair fraction of the statistical error . \n we also note that about 40% of the optical depth is in the events longer than 50 days . \n this is at odds with standard models of the galactic structure and kinematics . \n second , we plot in the right panel of figure 1 the spatial distribution of the optical depth . \n the variation of the optical depth is dominated by the poisson noise . \n the gradient of the optical depth is stronger in @xmath8 than in @xmath9 direction . \n again , we note the anomalous character of field 104 . it is marked with a black square and has an optical depth of @xmath10 . \n we presented first results from the analysis of five years of microlensing data toward the galactic bulge collected by the macho collaboration . \n it is possible to select an unbiased sample of clump events based only on an event s position on the color - magnitude diagram . \n ten out of 52 clump events have durations @xmath11 days , which implies that @xmath12% of the optical depth is in the long events . \n this is surprising , because long events are the most likely a result of the disk - disk lensing ( kiraga & paczyski 1994 ) , while clump giants trace the bar rather than the inner disk ( stanek et al . \n field 104 centered on @xmath13 is anomalous : it has longer events and substantially higher optical depth . both effects can be explained simultaneously by a concentration of mass along this line of sight . \n the optical depth averaged over the clump giants in 77 fields is @xmath14 at @xmath15 . \n when anomalous field 104 is removed , the optical depth drops to @xmath2 , which is fully consistent with infrared -

{"ContextTokens": 2140, "GeneratedTokens": 205, "SynthesizedBody": "a possible influence of solar variability on climate has been discussed for some time . \n although the direct solar influence on climate is apparent , variations of the solar irradiance are estimated to be an order of magnitude too small to explain the observed changes in climate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) . therefore , an indirect mechanism linking solar variability to climate should be involved . according to some modeling studies , \n a response in atmospheric circulation can amplify the terrestrial effect of solar irradiance changes @xcite . on the other hand \n , cosmic rays can noticeably affect the earth s climate @xcite . while the energy deposited by cosmic rays into the earth s atmosphere is negligible compared to that from solar irradiance , \n they are the main source of ionization in the troposphere ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? \n a possible qualitative link has been proposed that relates cosmic ray induced ionization ( crii ) in the troposphere and cloud properties @xcite . \n ions created by cosmic rays rapidly interact with molecules in the atmosphere and are converted to complex cluster ions ( aerosols ) @xcite . \n these cluster ions may grow by ion - ion recombination or ion - aerosol attachment and thus affect the number of aerosols acting as cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn ) at typical atmospheric supersaturations of a few percent @xcite . \n others have suggested that a crii - cloud link could also arise through changes in the global electric circuit affecting aerosol - cloud interactions at the edges of clouds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * or a review of possible mecahnisms in _ harrison and carslaw _ , 2003 ) . \n both mechanisms require that an amplified effect of cosmic rays on climate is realized through the important role that clouds play in the radiation budget of the atmosphere by both trapping outgoing long wave radiation and reflecting incoming solar radiation . \n although a detailed physical model quantifying this connection is still missing , correlation studies support its validity . \n @xcite found a highly significant correlation between low clouds below @xmath1 3.2 km ( rather than clouds at other altitudes ) and the cosmic ray flux during the period 19831994 . \n this basic result has subsequently been confirmed by other independent studies @xcite . \n there is also evidence for the reduction of cloud coverage during strong forbush decreases at time scales of a few days @xcite . \n this implies that the proposed cloud - cosmic ray relation may also be significant at short - time scales . \n more recently @xcite found that the low cloud - cosmic ray correlation can be extended until 2001 but only after the globally averaged cloud data are re - calibrated . \n however , the variability in low cloud amount ( lca ) can not be uniquely ascribed to a single mechanism when using globally averaged data since the observed long - term changes in the global lca correlate with different solar - related indices including solar irradiance and cosmic rays .    in this paper \n we study the spatial distribution of lca and crii over the period 19842000 . in all previous studies \n the count rate of a single neutron monitor was used as a measure of cosmic rays , and assumed to represent the global crii@xmath2 . \n although useful for qualitative correlation studies , this approach does not give quantitative estimates since the cosmic ray intensity varies strongly over the globe due to the shielding by the geomagnetic field . \n here we study the global distribution of crii and compare that with the measured lca distribution . \n following previous studies @xcite , we use the low cloud amount obtained from the isccp - d2 database limited to ir radiances . \n isccp provides monthly observations of the global cloud cover based on an intercalibration of up to 5 satellites for the period from july 1983 to september 2001 . \n satellites detect a cloud when radiance observations differ significantly from clear sky values . \n however , uncertainties can arise if atmospheric transparency is influenced by processes other than clouds , e.g. , aerosol loading from mt . \n pinatubo @xcite . \n we note that lca as defined from satellite observations is restricted to clouds with their tops below 640 hpa ( 3.2 km ) , which is different from ground - based observations . in the present analysis \n annual lca averages are used ( in order to avoid seasonal variations ) on a 5@xmath3x5@xmath3 latitude - longitude grid for the period 19842000 inclusive . \n recently , the global distribution of crii has been calculated for the troposphere ( 010 km ) since 1951 @xcite . \n first , the electromagnetic - nucleonic cascade initiated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere was simulated for different conditions using the corsika monte - carlo package @xcite . \n then the annually averaged ion production rate in the troposphere at a given latitude was calculated using the respective cosmic ray spectra parameterized by the average heliospheric modulation strength @xcite . \n finally , the equilibrium ion concentration was calculated at a given location , taking into account processes of recombination and aerosol attachment . \n here we use crii values calculated at 3 km altitude which corresponds roughly to the limiting altitude , as defined by isccp - d2 , below which low cloud forms . \n .correlation coefficients ( and their significance levels in parentheses ) between lca and crii for the period of 19842000 for different regions : global ( @xmath4 ) , tropics ( @xmath5 ) , and mid - latitudes ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the latitudinal zones with highly significant c.c.s ( see fig . \n [ fig:2_zonal ] ) we try to quantify the relation between detrended lca and crii ( fig . \n [ fig:5_detrended ] ) . for want of a physical model relating lca to crii , a quantitative phenomenological relation is assumed in the form of a direct proportionality between normalized variations of lca , @xmath8 , and crii , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the zonal mean crii value during 19842000 . \n the scatter plot of @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 is shown in fig . \n [ fig:6_scatter]a . despite the wide scatter of points , \n there is a highly significant correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( c.c.=0.6 , s.l.@xmath1398% ) , with the corresponding linear relation as follows : @xmath14 the fact that the proportionality coefficient is close to unity implies that inter - annual variations of lca around the long - term trend can be directly ascribed to the variations of crii . \n moreover , the amplitude of cyclic relative variations in @xmath11 and @xmath12 shows a similar latitudinal dependence ( fig . \n [ fig:6_scatter]b ) . \n these results strongly favor the idea that the variations of lca are related to crii rather than other mechanisms , e.g. , solar irradiance , which can not naturally explain such a latitudinal dependence . \n while in earlier studies data from a single neutron monitor was used as a proxy of cosmic ray intensity , we have explored the quantitative relationship between temporal and spatial variations of lca and crii over the globe for the period 19842000 . \n we suggest that the lca time series can be decomposed into a long - term slow trend and inter - annual variations , the latter depicting a clear 11-year cycle in phase with crii . \n the trend whose nature is beyond the scope of the present study , is strong in tropical regions and possibly masks the lca - crii relation . \n we then find a highly significant correlation between the detrended inter - annual lca variations and crii over the globe ( polar regions being excluded ) . \n a quantitative regression model was obtained ( eq .  [ eq : lin2 ] ) , which implies a one - to - one relation between the relative variations of lca and crii over the latitude range 2055@xmath0s and 1070@xmath0n . the amplitude of relative variations in lca was found to increase polewards , in accordance with the amplitude of crii variations but in contrast to the insolation which decreases polewards . \n these results thus support the idea that lca is modulated by crii , rather than by solar irradiance , at inter - annual timescales between 1984 - 2000 . \n we thank henrik svensmark for useful discussions . \n the financial support by the academy of finland is acknowledged . \n ogg and gak were partly supported by the program `` non - stationary processes in astronomy '' . \n the cloud data are obtained from isccp d2 web - site ( http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/products/browsed2.html ) . \n gringel w. , j.a . \n rosen , and d.j . \n hofmann , electrical structure from 0 to 30 kilometers , in studies in geophysics : the earth s electrical environment , p166 - 182 , natl . \n acad . press , \n washington d.c . , \n 1986 . \n hoppel , w.a . \n andersen , and j.c . \n willet , atmospheric electricity in the planetary boundary layer , in studies in geophysics : the earth s electrical environment , p159 - 165 , natl . \n acad . press , washington d.c . , 1986 . \n marsh n. , and h. svensmark , galactic cosmic ray and el nio - southern oscillation trends in international satellite cloud climatology project d2 low - cloud properties , _ j. geophys . \n _ , * 108*(d6 ) , aac 6 - 1 , doi:10.1029/2001jd001264 , 2003b .            tinsley , b.a . , influence of solar wind on the global electric circuit , and inferred effects on cloud microphysics , temperature , and dynamics in the troposphere , _ space sci . \n _ , * 94*(1 - 2 ) , 231 - 258 , 2000 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1981928225076, "RequestID": "6743aa2cfdcc3e3d33dc0f58ff9779d81fc20ef5", "TotalTokens": 2345}

acceleration voltages from @xmath25 to @xmath26kv were used . some pulse - height spectra with different acceleration voltages \n are shown in fig.[spectra ] . \n protons hit the detector with slightly different incident angles and energies due to the distribution of initial angles and energies , thus an angle or energy dependence in the detection probability leads to a systematic effect . \n although first simulations show that this effect is rather small , it will be investigated experimentally at a proton source dedicated for detector tests @xcite . \n @xmath0spect was set up at the cold neutron beam line pf1b @xcite at the institut laue - langevin . \n the neutron beam was shaped by apertures made from sintered boron carbide in the beam tube before the spectrometer ( pressure @xmath27 mbar ) and apertures from isotopically enriched @xmath28lif inside the spectrometer ( @xmath29 mbar ) . \n the vacua were separated by 250@xmath30 m thick mgal3zn1 windows . \n a fast neutron shutter in front of the beam tube permitted to open and close the neutron beam during data taking . behind the spectrometer , a beam stop from boron carbide with an integrated neutron flux monitor was installed . \n the thermal neutron flux at the exit window of the spectrometer was @xmath31 . outside the spectrometer \n the beam was shielded by several layers of @xmath32b loaded rubber and 10 cm of lead . \n all information in this section is preliminary . \n the proton spectrum was determined by setting the analysing plane electrode to 7 different voltages @xmath16 . \n 50v is used for the normalisation of the count rates , 400v approximately provides the best statistical sensitivity towards @xmath0 @xcite . \n the background was quantified by measurements with 780v . \n most of the background is caused by beam - related electrons from neutron decay which are also guided towards the detector . at 780v \n no proton can overcome the barrier , whereas the background is only marginally influenced . \n the pure proton count rate is obtained by subtracting the background from the measurements with lower voltages . to learn about systematic effects and to gain a more precise knowledge of the shape of the spectrum 0v , 50v , 250v , 400v , 500v , 600v , and 780v were measured . \n typically , about 470 events per second with pulse - heights in the integration window from 160 to 900 adc channels ( fig.[spectra ] ) at 50v analysing plane voltage were counted on one detector pad . at @xmath33v \n the count rate in the same window was about 7 counts per second . \n this means , approximately 460 protons per second were detected . with closed neutron shutter \n the count rate dropped to 0.2 counts per second in the integration window .    in our previous beam time , the background count rate without neutron beam at @xmath33v was higher than at @xmath34v by several hz @xcite . \n for this beam time , changes were made to the detector high voltage and the rest of the electrodes system to suppress the dependence of the background count rate on the analysing plane voltage . \n so far , such a dependence was not clearly identified in the present beam time . \n for example , for a run of 16 hours , the background count rate measured during the periods with closed neutron shutter was @xmath35hz for @xmath34v and @xmath36hz for @xmath33v . \n the absolute height of the potential barrier has to be known precisely to determine the transmission function , eq.([eq : transmissionfunction ] ) . \n the voltage applied to the electrode is monitored by a precise multimeter . \n the accuracy of the voltage settings was better than 5mv , limited by the multimeter s calibration . \n stability and reproducibility of the voltage were much better . \n however , the electrostatic potential inside the electrode is affected by the work function of the electrode surface . in a cylindrical sample electrode at room temperature , \n a variation of up to 100mv was found . to investigate this effect , further measurements with a kelvin probe are ongoing .    protons and positive ions with too low energy to overcome the potential barrier \n are trapped between the electrostatic mirror and the analysing plane . \n they are removed by an @xmath37 electrode between the decay volume and the analysing plane ( see fig.[sketch ] ) . \n this electrode consists of two half cylinders set to different voltages @xmath38 and @xmath39 . \n trapped particles oscillate between the mirror and the analysing plane . every time they pass the electrical field produced by the @xmath37 electrode they drift into the same direction , perpendicular to both @xmath40 and @xmath41 . \n in addition , electrons and negative ions may be trapped in the region of the analysing plane electrode . \n these trapping effects were investigated with two methods :    1 .   for each analysing plane voltage @xmath16 , \n the measurement started with closed neutron shutter during a time @xmath42 , then the shutter was opened for @xmath43 , and closed again for @xmath44 . \n this mode allowed us to investigate the environmental , not beam - related background and possible differences in the background count rate before and after the shutter was opened \n . a higher count rate in the last part would point to either trapped particles inside the spectrometer or activation of some material . typically , the total measurement time with closed shutter was about half as long as the time with open shutter ( @xmath45 ) . \n the analysing plane was set to 780v so that no protons should be able to overcome the barrier and the @xmath37 drift potential was reduced from the standard setting of @xmath46 = @xmath47v@xmath48v on the two half cylinders of the electrode in several steps down to @xmath49v@xmath50v . \n a comparison of two measurements with @xmath49v@xmath50v and @xmath51v@xmath50v is shown in fig.[exb ] . \n for the lowest drift voltage of @xmath52v there are only some counts before the shutter is opened , this is the environmental background . \n as soon as the shutter is opened , protons are trapped and the count rate starts to fluctuate . even after the shutter is closed again , there are still particles that reach the detector . \n already a potential of @xmath25v@xmath50v reduces this behaviour strongly , and with @xmath51v@xmath50v the count rate is stable as long as the shutter is open and drops back to the environmental background count rate immediately after the shutter is closed again . \n the knowledge of the magnetic field in both decay volume and analysing plane is important for the calculation of the transmission function , eq.([eq : transmissionfunction ] ) . to determine the magnetic field ratio @xmath53 \n , the magnetic field has been measured in the spectrometer installed at the beam position , before and after the beam time . \n there was no significant change in the ratio or the absolute values of the fields . \n to check the response of the spectrometer , the ratio was changed by about @xmath54 by additional , external coils . \n these coils do not change the homogeneity or the shape of the magnetic field in both analysing plane and decay volume . as expected , the count rates for the different measured voltages @xmath16 changed due to the altered transmission function , but the value for @xmath0 is , within statistical errors , still the same if we use the adapted ratio of the magnetic fields @xmath53 in eq.([eq : transmissionfunction ] ) .    to monitor the ratio @xmath53 , \n it is planned to install a nuclear magnetic resonance system with polarised @xmath55he . \n the nmr frequency will be measured in two cells close to decay volume and analysing plane , respectively . \n the ratio of those frequencies is proportional to @xmath53 . \n the superconducting magnet coils show some hysteresis which might alter the field values if the magnet is set to a different strength . \n measurements showed that despite the hysteresis magnetic field settings can be reproduced if for each change in the coil setting the same procedure is used , which starts with warming up the coils above their critical temperature . \n then they are cooled down again and finally ramped directly to the desired current . \n another systematic effect we investigated is the so - called edge effect . \n the neutron beam profile in the decay volume is projected onto the detector by the magnetic field . \n close to the edge of the detector , two cases may occur : on the one hand , protons produced outside the directly projected volume can hit the detector , since they gyrate about a magnetic field line . \n this increases the detected count rate . on the other hand , protons produced within the projected area might miss the detector , resulting in a loss of detected count rate . as the gyration radius of a proton depends on its momentum , the proton count rate gain and loss is momentum dependent . \n as long as the beam profile is perfectly flat and the detection efficiency of the proton detector is uniform the two effects cancel . \n but if the profile is non - flat the probabilities for the two cases become different . \n this leads to an energy - dependent systematic effect . \n the effect can be calculated using monte carlo simulations . \n still , the neutron apertures were simulated and designed to obtain a beam profile as flat as possible to minimise the effect . to verify our calculations of the edge effect \n , data was taken for different beam profiles . \n these profiles were generated with an additional aperture in front of the spectrometer . \n each profile was measured by copper foil activations in front of and behind the spectrometer . \n in the recent beam time we showed that our spectrometer is capable of measuring the proton recoil spectrum with high precision . compared to a previous beam time , the major improvements were the new proton detector , the redesign of several electrodes , and a better vacuum . from the investigated systematic effects and the collected statistics , we expect a total relative error well below 5% .    with the knowledge of the systematic effects gained in this beam time we should be able to improve @xmath0spect to permit a measurement of @xmath0 with its design accuracy , which is 0.3% in a further beam time . \n + we thank jim byrne and gerd petzoldt for their contributions in the earlier stages of the experiment , and d. dubbers and b. mrkisch for the @xmath28lif apertures . \n we also gratefully acknowledge pnsensor gmbh and the mpi halbleiterlabor for supporting this experiment with their excellent sdds .", "StartTimeOffset": 1988030642928, "RequestID": "c91c2447c04bc5c88494f03c06a8c34fd504ec00", "TotalTokens": 3503}

read ( mr ) state  @xcite ( or pfaffian state ) that should occur  @xcite at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . \n this state was first introduced to explain the fermionic fraction @xmath12 in 2des . \n higher @xmath13 values are associated to the so - called read - rezayi ( rr ) states  @xcite . because of the parafermionic behavior of these states , their excitations have surprising non - abelian statistics . \n so far , there are no well - established physical situation where these states play a role . \n the original suggestion by read and rezayi is that they may explain the incompressible states observed in the second landau level on the flanks of the elusive @xmath12 state . \n the rr states ( or clustered states ) in ultracold rotating atomic gases have been already the focus of several works . \n numerically exact diagonalizations of small systems have provided some hints of the presence of rr states . in the seminal work by cooper , wilkin and gunn \n @xcite , spectra in the torus geometry exhibit the special ground state degeneracy associated with the topology of the rr states and have excellent overlaps with the explicit rr trial wavefunctions . in the spherical geometry \n there is also a set of incompressible states with the special relationship between the flux and the number of particles of the rr states  @xcite . \n extrapolation of the gap points to a non - zero value for the mr @xmath10 case , whereas the @xmath14 and @xmath15 results do not show clear evidence for a smooth thermodynamic limit . on the sphere geometry , \n the overlap is excellent for the mr state and tend to a nonzero value as the system size increases  @xcite . \n a more recent work  @xcite has been done on the @xmath14 case . \n it shows that the overlap can be improved by adding a longer range dipole - dipole interaction    our purpose is to go beyond existing studies and look at size effects for fractions @xmath16 using exact diagonalizations on the sphere . \n we also check if the quasihole ground states are present at these filling factors by evaluating overlap between subspaces spanned by these states and the lowest energy excitations of the delta function interaction , @xmath1-wave scattering system . \n appearance of such quantum states with the correct degeneracy predicted by conformal field theory arguments is a strong hint of the validity of the rr state hypothesis .    in section [ parafermion ] , \n we give an overview of the clustered states and their excitations while section [ cft ] is devoted to the conformal field theory ( cft ) formulation . \n section [ numerical ] is a brief description of the numerical method we use . in section [ ground ] , we give the results for the overlap of the ground states . \n we discuss how the system size , longer range or higher order n - body interaction impact on the overlap . \n section [ excitations ] is devoted to the quasihole excitations . \n in addition to the overlap values , we also give numerical evaluation of quasihole degeneracy on sphere for fractions @xmath17 and compare them to a formula due to ardonne  @xcite to check the validity of the conformal field theory approach . \n for the sake of simplicity , we use the disk geometry in this section . in the symmetric gauge , \n the lll one - body wave functions are given by  :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and we take the magnetic length @xmath20 to be equal to unity . any @xmath4-body wave function of particles in the lll can be written as a polynomial @xmath21 in the particle @xmath22 coordinates  :    @xmath23    from now on , we drop the global gaussian factor . \n the @xmath13-type rr state is the exact zero energy ground state of the pure @xmath24-body @xmath25-function interaction hamiltonian  :    @xmath26    the corresponding wave function can be written@xcite  : @xmath27 where @xmath28 the sum is over all permutations @xmath29 of @xmath4 elements such that @xmath30 . the number of particles @xmath4 must be a multiple of @xmath13 . \n these states are also referred to as clustered states because the wavefunction ( [ parawavefunction ] ) vanishes when @xmath31 or more particles are at the same position . \n the @xmath13-type rr state is associated to the filling factor @xmath0 . \n each rr state is the zero - energy ground state of its corresponding hamiltonian with the smallest total angular momentum . \n the simplest case @xmath32 corresponds to the usual laughlin wave function  : @xmath33 and is the exact ground state for rotating bosons with @xmath1-wave scattering at @xmath6 whose effective hamiltonian is given by  : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath1-wave scattering length , @xmath36 is the characteristic length of the @xmath37 axis oscillator which is used for 2d confinement , and @xmath38 is the cyclotron rotation frequency . \n the case @xmath11 is the so called mr / pfaffian state . \n it can be rewritten as  : @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for the pfaffian defined as  : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a skew - symmetric @xmath43 matrix ( n even ) , the sum runs over all permutations of the index with n values and @xmath44 is the signature of the permutation .    if we deviate from the clustered state at filling factor @xmath45 by adding @xmath46 vortices ( or flux quanta in the 2des analog ) , quasihole excitations are generated . \n for each added vortex , @xmath13 quasiholes are nucleated . \n for the laughlin state , quasihole ground state wave functions can easily be obtained . \n any function of the form  : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a symmetric polynomial , corresponds to a zero - energy many quasihole state . for one quasihole at position @xmath49 , \n the polynomial @xmath48 is just @xmath50 . \n read and rezayi have also obtained an explicit formula in the case of the mr state@xcite for two quasiholes at positions @xmath49 and @xmath51  : @xmath52 with @xmath53 . in the general case , the quasihole ground states can be written down using the cft formulation . \n this formalism also reveals their non - abelian statistics . \n there is an elegant way to introduce rr states involving cft@xcite . \n the key idea@xcite is to express the wave function as a correlator using the algebra of the @xmath54 parafermions@xcite . \n this algebra is defined a set of field @xmath55 obeying the following operator product expansion ( ope )  : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath59 is the conformal weight of the field @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the theory central charge and @xmath62 are numerical coefficients . \n the algebra of @xmath54 parafermions corresponds to the choice @xmath63 leading to the central charge @xmath64 and to uniquely determined @xmath62 coefficients . \n read and rezayi have shown that the following wave function  : @xmath65 is equivalent to expression . one can easily show that this expression vanishes quadratically as @xmath31 particles go to the same point using the ope rules above . within this formalism , it has been argued that the zero energy quasihole states can be built by inserting a spin field for each quasihole into the correlator of . for @xmath11 , this spin field \n @xmath29 is equivalent to the magnetization operator of the ising model . in the ising case , \n the fusion rules are given by  : @xmath66 for @xmath67 quasiholes , the candidate state is then  : @xmath68 the fusion rule leads to a non - trivial degeneracy of the quasihole states  : there are @xmath69 ways to fuse the spin operators leading to a non zero correlator , thus giving as many different wavefunctions . \n this so - called intrinsic degeneracy is the key of non - abelian statistics  : exchanging two quasihole coordinates of a given quasihole state will result in a linear combination of states of the same family instead of an overall multiplicative phase factor . in the case of the spherical geometry that we will discuss later , an additional ( extrinsic ) degeneracy arise from the laughlin - like part of eq .. determining the multiplet decomposition of quasihole states in such a case is a challenging task  @xcite and constitutes a non - trivial check of the cft approach when compared to numerical calculations . \n more details will be given in section [ excitations ] . \n for @xmath70 , the spin field that we have introduced has to be replaced by one of the primary field operators of the @xmath54 parafermion algebra . \n the guess is to use the operator @xmath71 which minimizes the charge of the quasiholes . \n the wavefunction can then be generalized to  : @xmath72 the fusion rules involving @xmath71 are more complex  @xcite but the same remarks as for the @xmath11 case apply , meaning they lead to non - abelian statistics . \n notice that for @xmath73 , such states have been proposed to be a robust way to implement quantum computation@xcite . \n we use exact diagonalizations to study if the rr states are relevant to the physics of the fast rotating boson gases at filling factor @xmath0 . \n numerical calculations can be done on various geometry such as the disk , the torus or the sphere . \n the disk geometry is plagued by edge effects and thus closed geometries are preferred when dealing with bulk properties . in this paper , \n all calculations are done on the spherical geometry @xcite . due to the @xmath74 symmetry \n , states can be classified with respect to their total angular momentum @xmath75 and its projection along one axis @xmath76 . \n solutions of the one - body problem are given by the monopole harmonics  @xcite ( a generalization of the spherical harmonics ) , which take the following form in the lll  : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the projection of the angular momentum , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the spinor components in spherical coordinates  : @xmath82 the radius @xmath83 of the sphere is related to the number of vortices ( or flux quanta in the 2des language ) @xmath5 that pierce it  : @xmath84 the one particle angular momentum @xmath85 is such that @xmath86 . due to sphere topology , the relation between the number of particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a given fraction is linear with a non - zero shift . \n for each trial wavefunction for a given fraction , there is a unique shift , which is a characteristic of the quantum hall state . in the case of parafermionic states , \n the relation between the magnetic flux and the number of particles is given by  : @xmath87 this can be deduced from the expression of the ( [ parawavefunction ] ) on the sphere by applying a stereographic projection . \n formally , we just have to drop the gaussian factor and make the substitution  : @xmath88    the two - body interaction is completely characterized by a set of @xmath89 numbers @xmath90 called the pseudo - potentials  @xcite . \n the integer @xmath91 is the _ relative _ angular momentum between the two particles . for spinless bosons , \n only even-@xmath91 potentials are relevant . \n @xmath1-wave scattering interaction corresponds to the case where all pseudo - potentials are equal to zero except @xmath92 . \n longer range interactions involve additional pseudopotentials , the next one for spinless bosons being @xmath93 . \n thus , adding some @xmath93 component allows to test the effect of longer range interactions . \n comparison between the rr states or their quasihole excitations with the true ground states is achieved by computing overlaps . for two states \n @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the overlap is defined as @xmath96 . this definition can be extended to the case of subspaces of same dimension @xmath4 and spanned by vector sets @xmath97 and @xmath98  : latexmath:[\\ ] ] and is equal to zero if @xmath123 or @xmath124 . \n @xmath105 is the number of quasiholes . \n it is linked to the number of added quantum fluxes @xmath46 by the relation @xmath125 . \n @xmath126 is the identity dimensional matrix and @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the cartan matrix of the @xmath129 algebra  :      @xmath131 is a vector of @xmath132 non - negative integer such that @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a multiple of @xmath13 . \n when we look at a system of @xmath4 bosons , we are only interested in the values @xmath135 . \n @xmath134 has to be understood as the number of unclustered bosons . in the simplest case @xmath11 \n , @xmath136 corresponds to the number of parafermionic fields that appear when using ope . \n each @xmath112-polynomial in front of given @xmath137 monomial , is associated to the multiplet decomposition of the intrinsic degeneracy of a given @xmath134 value . \n it will be of the form  : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a global shift of the @xmath112 power and @xmath140 is the number of multiplet of momentum @xmath141 . \n thus the multiplet decomposition of the intrinsic degeneracy can be directly read - out from the polynomial expression . \n for example , let evaluate ( [ ardonneformula ] ) for @xmath142 , for the @xmath143 bosons case , we only need the partial development given in ( [ ardonneformulaexample ] ) up to @xmath144  : @xmath145 thus the multiplet decomposition for the intrinsic degeneracy is one singlet @xmath102 for @xmath146 , one multiplet @xmath147 for @xmath148 and one singlet @xmath102 for @xmath149 . \n the extrinsic part gives the following multiplet : one singlet @xmath102 for @xmath149 , one multiplet @xmath150 for @xmath148 , one multiplet for @xmath151 for @xmath146 . using the standard momentum addition rules \n , we get the result display in table [ tabledegeneracy32 ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 1996520404584, "RequestID": "933fabf8caf0805b8fcdae90937afe2b74cdf646", "TotalTokens": 3868}

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results are listed in table 5 and we argue that for the sample b the hypothesis is certainly right , and for the samples a and @xmath26 it can be acceptable . only the samples @xmath27 and c have a too high @xmath21 . \n the linear fit of sample c is shown in fig . \n 1 with a dashed line and involves @xmath28 . \n the fourth test for our relationship is the inclusion of lenticular and spiral galaxies in the statistical analysis . \n our sample d is now composed by all the 29 galaxies listed in table 2 . in fig . \n 3 we show with a dashed line the best fit ( 11 ) for the 18 ellipticals ( denoted with boxes ) , with the dot - dashed line the best fit for the remaining 11 galaxies ( denoted with circles ) : @xmath29 and with a solid line the best fit for the whole sample d @xmath30 we argue that the contribution of lenticular and spiral galaxies increases the slope that becomes closer to unity . \n from the first samples of data ( a and b ) we were induced in a previous paper @xcite to consider a relationship between the masses of smbhs and the kinetic energy of random motions in elliptical galaxies . this suggestion \n is now confirmed first by reanalyzing the old data using the fitexy routine and then comparing the results with the corresponding fit of a new set of kinematical data extracted from the paper of hring and rix @xcite . in the light of fig . \n 3 we show that the relationship works well also for lenticular and spiral galaxies . \n the remarkable result is that the relationship we proposed ( 7 ) , has now a smaller scatter with respect to the old equation ( 6 ) and the @xmath8 vs @xmath31 law . \n furthermore we have shown that , using the new data , all these relationships can be strictly connected because ( unlike afdm ) the mass of the galaxy strongly depends on the velocity dispersion : the linear correlation coefficient of this relationship ( 8) is very high and the @xmath21 very low . \n finally our result ( 14 ) with @xmath32 is surprisingly smaller than the ones expected of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .    for the sample \n a and b , given the assumptions of the model of busarello , longo and feoli @xcite , it is clear that triaxiality , anisotropy of the velocity field , inclination , deviations from the @xmath15 law , are all sources of possible errors that could affect the derived kinematical parameters . for the remaining samples we must consider that the masses are not computed with the same method and \n often refer to a bulge region that ends to @xmath35 . at the same time \n all the velocity dispersions are no longer averaged until the effective semimajor axis of each galaxy . \n so the nonhomogeneity of the measurements and the differences in the part of the galaxy that each single measure now considers , can affect also the results obtained with the new set of data . \n of course a rigorous analysis will be possible only when the observational uncertainties in all quantities are reduced and the sample is further extended . \n however , though with the caution due to all these possible error sources , the study of the relationship we propose between the rest energy of a smbh and the kinetic energy of random motions of the host galaxy appears to be very useful for a more complete understanding of the formation and evolution of smbh not only in elliptical galaxies . \n we are grateful to gaetano scarpetta , antonio donofrio and nicola de cesare for useful comments and franco caprio for helpful suggestions about computer programs . the research was partially supported by far fund of the university of sannio . \n l. ferrarese and d. merritt , _ astrophysical journal _ * 539 * , l9 ( 2000 ) . \n k. gebhardt et al . \n , _ astrophysical journal letter _ * 539 * , 13 ( 2000 ) . \n s. tremaine et al . \n , _ astrophysical journal _ * 574 * , 740 ( 2002 ) . \n j. kormendy and d. richstone _ annual review of astronomy and astrophysics_*33 * , 581 ( 1995 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 1797, "GeneratedTokens": 103, "SynthesizedBody": "the problem of human segregation is an important problem of society and politics even in the 21st century @xcite . \n social sciences have been investigating the reasons and and nature of segregation for a long time . \n sociologist have introduced several models , one of them is the schelling model @xcite . from physicist point of view that model is a 3-state voter - type non - equilibrium model ( groups a , b and empty ) , with spin - exchange dynamics at zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) on a 2-dimensional square lattice . \n although the model describes a segregation by a quench without external reasons , unwanted frozen states may also occur . \n recently it was shown by computer simulations @xcite that there exists a simpler model , namely the glauber - ising model @xcite , which captures the essence of human segregation . \n besides that , the usage of the simple @xmath1 spin - flip dynamics makes it computationally easier and one can avoid the frozen states of the schelling model . in this model \n the temperature plays the role of a global tolerance ; by varying it , the model may or may not evolve into the ordered ( segregated ) state . \n however a constant , global tolerance is rather artificial in a society , it can vary from individual to individual and can change in time as well . by introducing a local , time dependent temperature ( tolerance ) , with a feedback mechanism from the local neighborhood \n the model becomes more realistic . \n the results do not change too much @xcite , a self - organization of the average temperature occurs . \n the parameters of this model are the global rate of forgetting ( of tolerance ) and the response of local tolerances on the neighborhood . \n the sum of these local changes determine the local temperature . \n hereafter this self - organized segregation model will be called so - seg model .    stepping further towards more realistic models \n , one can pose the question what happens to this model if the decision of individuals are affected by an independent external noise as well . \n the external noise can be an artifact of a random environment , housing , moving situation , presence of shopping centers ... etc . \n the external noise introduced here as a second temperature , i.e. individuals are connected to a second heath bath . \n two - temperature two - state voter - type models have been investigated intensively recently and have become the prototypes of non - equilibrium models ( for a review see @xcite ) . \n an important finding of these studies was the discovery of relevant factors affecting the phase transitions of models exhibiting @xmath2 ( up - down ) symmetry @xcite . \n in particular models with general , isotropic spin - flip dynamics maintaining the @xmath2 symmetry can be classified as two temperature models , where one temperature controls the bulk , the other the interface fluctuations . \n the ising model is a special case of these models , where both temperatures are nonzero and the time - reversal symmetry drives the system into an equilibrium state . the transition of these @xmath2 symmetric , two - temperature models has been found to be continuous , ising type unless the bulk temperature is zero . in the latter case \n it is first order , voter model class type @xcite . in this work \n i investigate the effect of a second temperature applied as an external , independent heat - bath to the spins of the so - seg model . \n the model is defined on 2-dimensional square lattice , with periodic boundary conditions and ising spins ( @xmath3 ) distributed initially randomly ( zero initial magnetization = no segregation ) . \n the kinetics follows a glauber spin - flip ( sequential ) update with heath bath acceptance rate ( see ref .  ) , depending on the local temperatures . in the so - seg model \n each individual has four interacting nearest neighbors and a randomized initial local temperature , with an average value @xmath4 . \n this local temperature is lowered by @xmath5 at each update for modeling the loss of tolerance . \n this alone would just make a quench to @xmath6 with domain coarsening . \n to model people s awareness of the dangers of segregation they can increase their own temperature ( tolerance ) by @xmath7 , if all four neighbors of an individual belong to the same group as @xmath8 . \n if all four neighbors belong to the different group the local temperature is decreased by the same amount . \n our external noise is described by a heat bath of a second temperature @xmath9 applied to the decisions \n . the actual spin - flip will be the logical or of internal and external flip decisions . \n the magnetization @xmath10 , the average number of like neighbors minus unlike neighbors @xmath11 , and the average self - organizing internal temperature ( tolerance ) @xmath12 is followed up to @xmath13 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) of the lattice . \n the simulations were performed on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 sized square lattices , up to @xmath13 mcs , with cooling rates : @xmath17 and tolerance steps : @xmath18 . \n the phase transition of the so - seg model is at @xmath19 @xcite , so @xmath20 corresponds to super - critical , @xmath21 to sub - critical situations . \n as figure ( [ fig0 ] ) shows the inclusion of a small second temperature @xmath22 does not change the composition of neighbors and @xmath23 in the steady state ( as @xmath24 ) . \n the same can be seen by plotting @xmath25 ( see fig.([fign ] ) ) and the average internal temperature of individuals ( fig.([figt ] ) ) . for stronger external noise \n the domains are destroyed , but the average tolerance goes to zero too . \n this means that the unsegregated state can be maintained with the help of strong external noise , without worrying about people s local tolerance . \n the same analysis for @xmath21 resulted in similar trends in @xmath26 ( see fig.[figninf ] ) and in the average tolerance @xmath27 . \n note that one observe even a weak increase in the asymptotic values for @xmath28 . \n running the simulations on larger sizes there were no change in this , excluding the possibility of finite size errors .    by increasing the second temperature @xmath9 the transitions of @xmath29 ( see fig.([figninf ] ) ) and \n @xmath30 are very smeared . \n the magnetization density @xmath31 on the other hand shows a sharp fall , indicating a first order phase transition at @xmath32 . a fitting attempt using the form @xmath33 did not result in agreement with the 2d ising class continuous phase transition behavior , characterized by @xmath34 @xcite . \n furthermore a hysteresis cycle can also be found by starting the simulations with different initial conditions ( ordered vs. disordered ) , which is a clear hallmark of a first order phase transition . \n this is in contrast with the results for two - temperature @xmath2 symmetric models exhibiting ising transition in 2d ( the bulk noise in nonzero of course ) . \n one may understand the discontinuous transition here by realizing that this model is effectively a coupled system : ising + temperate field . \n the temperatures can increase if at least four neighbors are in the same state and decrease without condition . in the language of reaction diffusion systems \n it is a quadruple model , where at least for neighbors are needed for a creation but the removal is spontaneous . \n it is well known that in 2d such a quadruple model exhibits a first order transition @xcite . \n simulations with different initial temperatures ( @xmath35 ) , cooling rates ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath7 have not resulted in changes in the transition point @xmath37 . \n a two - temperature , self - organized ising - schelling model has been introduced and investigated by numerical simulations . a low second temperature , which represents the external noise to the decision of individuals for moving does not change the segregation behavior of the model . \n a temperature bigger than @xmath38 randomizes the segregated , ordered domains and results in low average tolerance of individuals . \n while the self - organized tolerance and the average composition of the steady state show continuous variation on @xmath9 the magnetization exhibits a first order phase transition . \n the threshold did not show considerable dependence on the model parameters . \n the author thanks d. stauffer for motivating and discussing his study and providing the code of ref . \n @xcite for simulations . \n support from the hungarian research fund otka ( grant no . \n t-046129 ) during this study is gratefully acknowledged .", "StartTimeOffset": 2014499894706, "RequestID": "3f3dde1c63bc26bdc1704ea0a13968b19373e847", "TotalTokens": 1900}

[ \n fig : eclipse ] ( a ) . \n a thin wire was inserted in the laser beam channel to form a thin shadow in the laser channel . \n the position of the shadow was changed with a micrometer of the wire stage . \n note that the width of the shadow becomes a little wider than the screening object because of the diffraction of the laser beam . \n taking into consideration the distance from the wire to the probe tip ( @xmath130.5 m ) and the wavelength of the laser ( 532 nm ) , the calculation based on the fresnel diffraction provides the effective shadow width @xmath14 of the wire diameter plus 0.6 mm @xcite . \n typical temporal evolution of the conventional lpd signal and that of the eclipse - lpd are shown in fig . \n [ fig : signals ] . \n we have checked that the recovery time is not disturbed by the screening object when the shadow width is sufficiently thinner than the laser diameter . \n thus the sheath effects can be observed in both eclipse - lpd signals and in conventional lpd signals as the shift of the recovery time .    on the other hand , \n the time for the lpd signal to reach its peak value depends on the displacement between the effective probe surface including the sheath and the edge of the photodetached electron _ swarm_. the configuration of the laser beam and probe tip in eclipse - lpd \n are shown in fig . \n [ fig : eclipse ] ( b ) . when the probe is located outside the laser - irradiated area as shown in fig . \n [ fig : eclipse ] ( b ) , the peak time of the signal @xmath15 is shifted from @xmath16 by @xmath17 . because the propagation velocity of the excess electron _ swarm _ toward the outside of the laser irradiated region corresponds to the negative ion drift velocity @xcite , \n the time shift due to the propagation can be expressed according to fig . \n [ fig : eclipse ] ( b ) as @xmath18 where @xmath14 is the shadow width and the term @xmath19 represents the probe radius corrected by the sheath thickness . \n the shift of the peak time at the space potential @xmath20 can be also deduced by substituting @xmath10 in eq . \n ( [ ptim_modif ] ) as @xmath21 finally , the electron sheath thickness is deduced from the difference between eqs . \n ( [ ptim_modif ] ) and ( [ ptim_modif0 ] ) as @xmath22 where @xmath2 can be obtained from eq . \n ( [ tr_modif ] ) . \n moreover , from eqs . \n ( [ eq1 -

lpd method , \n the signal intensity decreases when part of the collection region is shaded by the shadow . \n however , the signal intensity recovers when the shadow is well aligned with the electrostatic probe . \n this phenomena can be explained by the excess electrons leaked from the irradiated region to the shaded region @xcite . \n the width of the total signal dip is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the length of the collection region of pde . \n we can thus obtain @xmath25 . \n the experiments were performed in divertor simulator map -

shaped electrostatic probe , consists of a 0.3 mm in diameter tungsten wire , was placed on the axis perpendicular to the magnetic field in the target chamber . the total length exposed to \n the plasma was 5 mm ( 2 mm plus 3 mm ) . \n the laser was injected parallel to the probe tip head . in the present paper , \n the probe was located at the peripheral region of the plasma column , where the negative ion density ratio to the electron density is about several percent @xcite . \n the negative ion density ratio was so small that we neglected the modification of the sheath structure due to the photodetachment process . \n second harmonic nd : yag laser pulses ( the wavelength of @xmath35532 nm ) were used for the photon source of the photodetachment . \n a thin wire for the eclipse - lpd is located outside the vacuum chamber . \n the distance from the wire to the probe tip was about 0.5 m and the shadow position was adjusted with a micrometer of the wire stage . in the case of 15 mt , \n the larmor radius of the electrons is comparable to the size of the probe . in order to examine the effect of the magnetic field , the case without the magnetic field \n was compared with the case at 15 mt . in reality , a weak magnetic field of less than 1 mt exists even when the coil currents at the target chamber are turned off . however , \n the effect is negligible because the larmor radius of electrons is much larger than the probe size in this case . \n thus , we henceforth call this condition 0 mt . \n the recovery time and the peak time of eclipse - lpd signals as a function of the probe - bias voltage are shonw in fig .

dimensional geometry can be written as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the current density , @xmath43 the dielectric constant in vacuum , @xmath44 the mass of an electron . in the present paper , @xmath45 stands for the thickness of the `` plane - parallel child - langmuir ( c - l ) sheath '' . \n it has been confirmed in map - ii that the experimentally obtained thicknesses of the sheath around an plane probe are well agree with @xmath45 in magnetized plasmas @xcite . on the other hand , in cylindrical geometry \n , the sheath thickness is expressed as a function of @xmath46 , where @xmath7 is the probe radius , and then can be written as @xcite @xmath47 @xmath48 stands for the thickness of the `` cylindrical child - langmuir ( c - l ) sheath '' in this paper . \n this can be regarded as the limit of using a cylindrical probe in un - magnetized plasmas . \n the cylindrical c - l sheath is much thinner than the plane parallel c - l sheath as is shown next .    the electron sheath thicknesses obtained ( i ) from eq . \n ( [ sheath1 ] ) , ( ii ) from eqs . \n ( [ sheath2 ] ) and ( [ tr_modif ] ) , and ( iii ) from eq . \n ( [ sheath3 ] ) , respectively , are plotted in fig . \n [ fig : sheath_cyl ] . \n the sheath thicknesses obtained from different procedures ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are consistent value with each other . in fig . \n [ fig : sheath_cyl ] , the calculated sheath thicknesses @xmath45 and @xmath48 are also plotted . \n the experimental results are much thicker than the cylindrical c - l sheath thickness , and moreover , they are agree with the calculated plane - parallel c - l sheath thickness at the probe - bias voltage higher than about 50 v. this result indicates that the effect of the magnetic field on the sheath structure is significant even in a weakly magnetized regime for electrons , where the larmor radius of electron is comparable to the size of the probe tip . \n in addition , @xmath25 is measured at three different probe - bias voltages as changing the shadow position , and the results are also plotted in fig . \n [ fig : sheath_cyl ] . \n the length @xmath49 also increases with the probe voltage , and is about three to five times thicker than @xmath8 . \n ten times the debye length @xmath50 , which is defined as @xmath51 , is also plotted in fig . \n [ fig : sheath_cyl ] , since @xmath52 has been regarded as the typical sheath thickness conventionally . \n when the probe was positively 70 - 80 v biased against the space potential , the sheath thickness was comparable to ten times the debye length . \n we can check the applicability of the negative ion velocity measurement with @xmath8 , and that of the negative ion density measurement with @xmath25 . \n if a thick electron sheath is formed around an electrostatic probe , we should modify the recovery time by replacing @xmath7 with @xmath53 . \n if @xmath54 is longer than the laser radius @xmath5 , we should enlarge the laser size or reducing the probe - bias voltage until the condition @xmath55 is satisfied . because @xmath25 might be elongated along the magnetic field , it is strongly recommended to check the condition @xmath55 especially when the lpd technique is applied to strongly magnetized plasmas .    , @xmath56 ev . ) [ shot @xmath3613926 ] . ] \n electron sheath thicknesses around a cylindrical probe in weakly magnetized plasmas were measured at different probe - bias voltages by using a newly developed eclipse - lpd . \n the sheath thickness was consistent with the calculated sheath thickness from the plane - parallel child - langmuir law , especially when the probe voltage was rather high . \n in addition , the electron collection region of photodetached electrons was measured from the shadow position dependence of lpd signal intensity . under the experimental condition in the present paper , \n the length of the electron collection region was three to five times longer than the electron sheath thickness . \n the eclipse -

peimbert ( 1993 ) based on the computations by storey ( 1994 ) were the first to obtain larger o@xmath4/h@xmath5 values from oxygen recombination lines than from collisionally excited lines under the assumptions of @xmath0 = 0.000 and of chemical homogeneity . \n most pne show this difference which has been usually called the abundance discrepancy factor defined by : adf(o@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) = ( o@xmath4/h@xmath5)@xmath6 / ( o@xmath4/h@xmath5)@xmath7 , ( e. g. liu 2006 , and references therein ) . \n the adf(o@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) value is larger than predicted by simple photoionization models for about two thirds of the well observed pne . \n a similar abundance difference for c@xmath4/h@xmath5 has been obtained by peimbert , torres -

peimbert & peimbert ( 2003 ) presented seven mechanisms as possible sources of temperature variations , in what follows we will mention additional results in favor of some of these mechanisms .    _ \n deposition of mechanical energy : _ the central stars of pne inject mechanical energy into the expanding shells by means of stellar winds , bipolar flows , multipolar flows , and asymmetrical ejections , these processes produce shocks , turbulence , and an increase of the expansion velocity of the shell with time . \n these processes are more important for some objects than for others and might be responsible for the spread in the observed @xmath0 values . \n guerrero et al . \n ( 2005 ) and guerrero , chu , & gruendl ( 2006 ) found that the following pne are strong x - ray emitters : bd+30@xmath11  3639 , ngc  40 , ngc  2392 , ngc  3242 , ngc  6543 , ngc  7009 , and ngc  7027 , they also argue that this emission is due to shocks produced by fast winds or bipolar flows . \n rowlands , houck , & herter ( 1994 ) derived @xmath1([ne v ] ) @xmath12 50,000 k for ngc  6302 and ngc  6537 , they also computed photoionization models and were not able to produce temperatures higher than 20,000  k and reached the conclusion that these temperatures were indicative of shock heating . \n peimbert et al . \n ( 1995a ) found that the following pne with large velocity dispersions also show large temperature variations : ngc  2392 , ngc  2371 - 2 , ngc  2818 , ngc  6302 , and hu  1 - 2 , the last four are bipolar type  i pne . \n medina , pea , & stasiska ( 2006 ) found , from a sample of 47 pne , that the velocity of expansion of the shell increases with age indicators , for example @xmath13 is larger for low density nebulae and it is also larger for nebulae with higher temperature stars . \n furthermore by studing the line profiles medina et al . \n ( 2006 ) find that a substancial fraction of the material shows turbulent motions . \n _ chemical inhomogeneities : _ see section 4.2 and the review by liu ( 2006 ) . \n _ time dependent ionization : _ when a photoionization front passes through a nebula it heats the gas above the steady state value and some time is needed to reach thermal equilibrium . in the presence of localized density variations or a density gradient this process produces large temperature variations and might explain the presence of hot external halos in pne ( e.g. tylenda 2003 , sandin et al . \n when the stellar ionizing flux decreases , or the density distribution along the line of sight changes , the outer regions of a nebula might become isolated from the stellar radiation field and will cool down before fully recombining , creating cold partially ionized outer regions , this might explain the low @xmath1(balmer ) values derived by luo & liu ( 2003 ) in the outer regions of ngc  7009 . \n _ density variations : _ extreme density variations are present in most pne , as can be seen from optical images . for steady state photoionization models density variations \n are not very important , but for time dependent processes the regions of higher density will reach equilibrium sooner than those of lower density . \n _ deposition of magnetic energy : _ no specific models have been proposed yet for this mechanism .    _ dust heating : _ stasiska & szczerba ( 2001 ) have analyzed the effects of photoelectric heating by dust grains in photoionization models of pne . \n this effect might be important in nebulae with large density variations . \n this suggestion has not been tested yet for a specific model on any given pn . \n _ shadowed regions : _ due to the presence of molecular globules inside ngc 7293 and ngc 6720 , two nearby pne , their presence is expected in many pne . according to huggins & frank ( 2006 ) , the covering factor of the globules in ngc 7293 amounts to about 5% . \n the ionization of the gas shadowed by the globules will be produced by diffuse radiation , and consequently , the temperature of the shadowed gas will be a few thousand degrees lower than that of the material that is directly ionized by the central star ( mathis 1976 ) . \n this mechanism alone might produce @xmath0 values around 0.01 in pne of the type of ngc 7293 and ngc 6720 .    to discriminate among the different possibilities , \n it is important to understand the signature of each process on the temperature and density distributions . \n mechanical energy deposition , an increase in the local ionizing flux , and magnetic energy deposition will produce localized high - temperature regions relative to simple photoionization predictions ; while shadowed regions , the decrease of the local ionizing flux , and the presence of metal - rich inclusions will produce localized low - temperatures regions relative to simple photoionization predictions . \n abundances correspond to those derived from recombination lines , if forbidden lines are used a @xmath0 different from 0.000 has to be adopted . in what follows we present evidence in favor of chemical homogeneity for most pne .    from chemical evolution models of the galaxy \n it has been found that in the solar vicinity about half of the c enrichment of the ism is due to low and intermediate mass stars that end their lives as white dwarfs , and the rest is due to sn of type  ii ( e. g. carigi et al . \n moreover according to other models most of the c enrichment is due to low and intermediate mass stars ( e. g. matteucci 2006 ) . \n carigi ( 2003 ) has shown that the c / h values derived from c  ii recombination lines are in agreement with these models , while the c / h values derived from the 1906 and 1909 collisionally excited lines , under the assumption of @xmath1([o  iii ] ) and @xmath14 , imply lower c yields than those needed by the galactic chemical evolution models . \n .stellar and nebular abundances for ngc 6543 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath1([o  iii ] ) , @xmath1(he  i)@xmath15 peimbert et al.(1995b ) ; @xmath1(balmer ) zhang et al . \n ( 2004 ) ; @xmath1(he  i)@xmath16 zhang et al.(2005 ) ; a ) 3889,4471,7065 ; b ) 3889,4471,10830 ; c ) 6678,7281 ; d ) 4471,5876,6678 . \n we consider that our knowledge on the density and temperature distributions and on the chemical composition of pne will increase considerably from the study of the four following problems . \n the @xmath17(o  ii ) values derived from the o  ii lines of multiplet 1 , like those presented in table 3 , need to be determined again based on the atomic physics computations by bastin & storey ( 2006 ) . \n objects with small he@xmath18 and he@xmath4 fractions and with most of their o in the o@xmath4 ionization stage will be particularly useful , those objects of this group with @xmath17(o  ii ) @xmath19(balmer ) will be chemically homogeneous , while those with @xmath17(o  ii ) @xmath20 @xmath17(balmer ) will be chemically inhomogeneous . \n the idea that there are high density he@xmath5 regions embedded in low density h rich material might be tested by deriving @xmath1(he  i ) , @xmath17(he  i ) , and @xmath21(3889 ) based on accurate measurements of at least 10 different he  i lines in relatively low density pne without substantial he@xmath18 and he@xmath4 regions . those objects with @xmath17(he  i ) @xmath19(balmer ) will be chemically homogeneous , while those with @xmath17(he  i ) @xmath22(balmer ) will be chemically inhomogeneous . \n there are at least seven possible mechanisms as sources of temperature variations . from the theoretical side , it is important to model the signature of each process on the temperature and density distributions . while , from the observational side , the combination of 3d kinematical models with high spectral resolution data , like those presented by barlow et al . \n ( 2006 ) , might permit to derive temperature and density distributions and consequently to single out the main mechanism responsible for the temperature variations in a given object . \n finally accurate h , he , c , and o abundances of h - rich central stars , like those obtained by georgiev et al . \n ( 2006 ) for ngc  6543 , are needed to compare them with those nebular abundances derived from permitted and forbidden lines .", "StartTimeOffset": 2043332564688, "RequestID": "e1a652e0acffc0aa86a6794370b1599cca5aa0cd", "TotalTokens": 3051}

{"ContextTokens": 3829, "GeneratedTokens": 227, "SynthesizedBody": "inferring the true radial dependence of supernova ( sn ) properties in their parent galaxies from observations of projected radial distributions is a tricky business . for example , \n bartunov , makarova , and tsvetkov ( 1992 ) could find no significant difference between the radial distributions of sne of type ia ( sne  ia ) and type ii ( sne  ii ) in disk galaxies , while van den bergh ( 1997 ) and wang , hflich , & wheeler ( 1997 ) reach opposite conclusions as to whether sne  ia or sne  ii are more centrally concentrated . \n wang et  al also conclude that sne  ia farther than 7.5 kpc from the centers of their parent galaxies are more homogeneous in absolute magnitude and @xmath0 color than those that are closer to the centers . \n an obvious and generally recognized difficulty in this kind of work is that only the projected distance of an sn from the center of its galaxy , not the true distance , is observed . \n another difficulty , that to our knowledge has not previously been explored , is that extinction of sne by dust in their parent galaxies can affect the observed radial dependence of sn properties .    to make a first exploration of the effects of extinction on the radial dependence of sn properties , we have used a monte carlo technique together with assumed spatial distributions of dust and sn progenitors in a simple model of a characteristic sn  producing disk galaxy . \n the model is described in section 2 , and the extinction distributions and projected radial distributions that it predicts for the various sn types are presented . \n model predictions of how the brightness distributions of the various sn types depend on projected radius are presented and compared with observation in section 3 . \n section  4 presents a brief discussion . \n our monte carlo technique for studying the visibility of sne and novae ( hatano et  al . \n 1997a , b , c ) was inspired by a study of the visibility of galactic sne by dawson and johnson ( 1994 ) . in their model and in hatano \n ( 1997a , b ) , which were concerned with sne and novae in the galaxy , a double exponential distribution of dust was used , with a radial scale length of five kpc and a vertical scale height of 0.1 kpc . \n core  collapse events ( sne  ii and ibc ) were distributed like the dust except that they were not allowed to occur within three kpc of the center in view of the lack of evidence for much recent star formation in the central regions of our galaxy . \n sne  ia consisted of two spatially interpenetrating components : disk sne  ia had a double exponential distribution with a scale length of five kpc and a vertical scale height of 0.35 kpc and they were not truncated at three kpc . \n bulge sne  ia were spherically distributed ( in kpc ) as @xmath1 . \n disk sne  ia outnumbered bulge sne  ia by a factor of seven , consistent with the estimated galactic disk  to  bulge mass ratio ( van der kruit 1990 ) . \n the bulge was truncated at three kpc and the disk at 20 kpc . for more detailed descriptions of the model , \n see dawson and johnson ( 1994 ) and hatano et al . \n ( 1997a ) . \n hatano et al . ( \n 1997c ) was concerned with novae in m31 . \n because the dust density in m31 is known to peak not at the center , but well out in the disk where most of the current star formation is taking place , the model dust distribution was modified accordingly . \n recently sodroski et al . ( \n 1997 ) have found that in the galaxy , too , the dust density peaks off center , at a radius of about 5 kpc , where the total face  on extinction through the disk is @xmath2 . for the present study we have made a simple parameterization of the radial dependence of the total face  on extinction through the disk , after figure 9 of sodrowski et  al . \n this radial dependence of the dust , together with a retained vertical scale height of 0.1 kpc , leads to the following expression for the @xmath3band extinction per kpc , @xmath4 , in the plane of the disk :    @xmath5 @xmath6    thus the dust density rises from zero at the center of the model to a maximum value at 5 kpc and then falls to zero at 17.5 kpc . \n this particular parameterization gives a rather high value of 3.8 mag kpc@xmath7 in the plane of the disk at @xmath8 kpc , i.e. , at the radial distance of the sun in the galaxy , but considering that large galaxies produce more sne and tend to be more dusty than small ones ( van den bergh & pierce 1990 ) , it probably is not unreasonable for this initial exploration of the effects of extinction . \n figure  1 shows the model extinction distributions for bulge sne  ia , disk sne  ia , and core \n collapse sne , each for five different galaxy inclinations as well as for a random distribution of inclinations . \n note that for any inclination , even edge  on , the distributions for bulge and disk sne  ia are strongly peaked at small values of @xmath9 . \n ( for the adopted disk  to  bulge sn  ia ratio of seven , the total distribution for sne  ia is much like the distribution for disk sne  ia . ) \n core  collapse sne tend to be more extinguished than sne  ia owing to their smaller vertical scale height . \n table 1 quantifies the model extinction distributions . \n column ( 1 ) gives the cosine of the inclination of the model , where @xmath10 refers to the face  on case . \n columns ( 2)(4 ) refer to bulge sne  ia ( ia  b ) and list the mean extinction @xmath11 , the mean extinction of an `` extinction  limited subset '' of bulge sne  ia that have @xmath12 , and the fraction of the events in that subset . \n columns ( 5)(7 ) give the same information for disk sne  ia ( ia  d ) and columns ( 8)(10 ) are for core  collapse sne ( cc ) . in the edge  on case the mean extinction of all sn types becomes high , but of course there would be a strong observational selection acting against the discovery of severely extinguished events . \n it is interesting that the mean extinction of the extinction  limited subsets \n _ decreases _ as inclination increases , i.e. , when the model is highly inclined the extinction tends to be all or nothing . \n note that even in the edge  on case substantial fractions of bulge and disk sne  ia make it into the extinction  limited subsets , while only a small fraction of the core  collapse sne do . \n column ( 10 ) shows that , to the extent that an extinction of 0.6 mag is sufficient to significantly reduce the probability that a sn is discovered , this particular model is dusty enough to support an inclination  dependent observational discrimination against the discovery of core \n collapse sne ( cf . \n van den bergh 1993 ; tammann 1994 ; cappellaro & turatto 1997 ) . \n our technique allows us to plot model projected radial distributions of sne for comparison with observed distributions . \n the model distributions presented here have been calculated with a disk truncation radius of 30 rather than 20 kpc because some sne have been observed beyond 20 kpc . \n figure  2 shows normalized projected radial distributions for disk sne  ia and core \n collapse sne , for five inclinations and a random distribution of inclinations . as the inclination increases , the projected distributions shift toward the central regions . \n the behavior of the core \n collapse sne is especially interesting : in the face  on case , by construction , there are no core  collapse events within three kpc , but in the edge  on case plenty are projected into the innermost regions because of the small vertical scale height . \n this illustrates that the observational presence of core  collapse events projected near the center does not guarantee the actual existence of core  collapse events near the center . \n more generally , figure  2 illustrates the difficulty of inferring details about the relative radial distributions of sn types from observations of their projected radial distributions in samples that include highly inclined galaxies , especially if the sn types have different vertical scale heights . \n van den bergh ( 1997 ) studied projected sn radial distributions in a sample of disk galaxies restricted to those having @xmath13 , to minimize extinction and projection effects , and he tentatively concluded that sne  ia are more centrally concentrated than sne  ii . \n wang et  al ( 1997 ) presented calculated projected radial distributions , analagous to our figure  3 but with very different model parameters . \n they compared to observed distributions and tentatively concluded the opposite  that sne  ii are more centrally condensed than sne  ia . because wang et  al . did not use a smaller vertical scale height for sne  ii than for sne  ia , they probably overestimated the true central concentration of sne  ii relative to that of sne  ia ; thus it appears to us that van den bergh s conclusion is more likely to be correct . \n at this point we have to specify the sn luminosity functions . after hatano et  al ( 1997a ) we adopt gaussian distributions of the intrinsic absolute magnitudes of sne  ia , ibc , and ii , with mean absolute magnitudes of -19.5 , -18.0 , and -17.0 , and dispersions of 0.2 , 0.3 , and 1.2 , respectively . \n the top panel of figure  3 shows the model distribution of absolute magnitude as viewed by the external observer who has not corrected for parent  galaxy extinction ( i.e. , the quantity @xmath14 ) for sne  ia . \n those at large projected radial distances are practically unextinguished , while some of those at smaller projected distances are severely extinguished . \n the lower panel of figure  3 shows a corresponding observational plot , constructed from data in the june 6 , 1997 version of the asiago supernova catalogue with distances based on parent  galaxy radial velocity and @xmath15 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 . \n apparent magnitudes have been corrected for foreground extinction in the galaxy but not for extinction in the parent galaxies . \n considering the simplicity of our model , and that the lower panel is affected by strong observational bias against the discovery of severely extinguished events , the general resemblance of the two panels of figure  3 is satisfactory . \n figure  3 strongly suggests that the effects of parent  galaxy extinction are likely to be the cause of much of the observed difference in absolute  magnitude dispersion between sne  ia within and beyond 7.5 kpc , a difference first pointed out by wang et  al . \n . it should be noted , however , that for a small sample of sne  ia having high  quality data , wang et  al . also found an excess of _ overluminous _ sne  ia within 7.5 kpc , which of course can not be explained in terms of extinction . \n wang et  al also called attention to an apparent observational deficit of sne  ia in the innermost one kpc of their parent galaxies . \n the upper panel of figure  3 shows that our model predicts the presence of observationally bright sne  ia ( mostly bulge sne  ia ) projected into the central kpc , while none appear in the observational plot ( lower panel of figure  3 ) . \n this supports the suggestion by wang et  al . \n that bulge populations may be poor producers of sne  ia . \n ( the conclusion of wang et  al that sne  ia therefore do not come from novae does not follow for us , because we [ hatano et  al . \n 1997b , c ] have argued that galactic and even m31 novae do not come primarily from the bulge populations as is usually assumed . ) \n figure 4 is like figure  3 , but for sne  ii . \n although the effects of the broad adopted luminosity function for sne  ii are apparent , the upper panel of figure 4 shows the same general tendency as figure  3 for many severely extinguished model sne to appear at relatively small projected distances from the center . \n ( some are extinguished right off the top of figure  4 . ) \n the large triangle in the upper panel serves to call attention to predicted deficit of bright sne  ii in the central regions . in the model \n the deficit reflects the tendency of sne  ii that are projected into the central regions to be substantially extinguished . \n although more data are needed to reach a final conclusion , this deficit does appear to be present in the observations ( lower panel ) . \n in the same way the model predicts a deficit of bright sne  ibc in the central regions , and the inset to the lower panel shows that although the numbers are still smaller , observations of sne  ibc are at least consistent with the presence of the deficit . \n we have explored the consequences for the core \n collapse deficit of altering the dustiness of the model . halving the dustiness makes the model deficit less pronounced than the observational one , while doubling the dustiness extinguishes nearly all centrally projected core \n collapse sne beyond detectability . measuring \n the radial dependence of controlled samples of sne in galaxies appears to be a promising way to constrain the amount and the distribution of dust in galaxies , which is a controversial issue ( valentijn 1990 ; burstein , haynes , & faber 1991 ) . \n the results shown in figure 4 lead us to suggest an alternative to the classical explanation of the selection effect discussed by shaw ( 1979 )  the observational deficit of sne in the central regions of remote galaxies relative to nearer galaxies . \n ( see van den bergh ( 1997 ) and wang et  al ( 1997 ) for plots that illustrate the shaw effect with present data . ) \n shaw s interpretation , which has been generally accepted , was that the effect is caused by the increasing difficulty , with distance , of discovering sne against the bright central regions of galaxies . \n but if this is the primary cause of the shaw effect then in figure  4 we would expect to see a deficit of observationally _ dim _ sne in the central regions , because they would be more readily lost than bright ones . \n then the large triangle in the lower panel of figure  4 should be upside down . \n instead , the lower panel of figure 4 shows a deficit of observationally _ bright _ sne  ii in the central regions , as predicted by our model . \n therefore we suggest that the shaw effect for sne  ii ( and sne  ibc ) comes about at least in part because core \n collapse sne projected into the central regions of galaxies tend to be observationally dim , and the difficulty of discovering dim sne increases with distance . \n our model does not predict such a deficit for sne  ia , but it is not so clear that there really is an observational shaw effect for sne  ia ( see figure  3 of van den bergh [ 1997 ] and figure  1 of wang et  al [ 1997 ] ) . \n our simple model of the spatial distributions of dust and sn progenitors in a characteristic sn  producing disk galaxy predicts that owing to extinction , sne projected into the inner regions of their parent galaxies tend to be observationally dimmer and to have a much larger magnitude dispersion than sne in the outer regions . as wang et  al ( 1997 ) first showed , such is the case for sne  ia . in our model \n the effect is severe enough , for core \n collapse sne , to produce a deficit of observationally bright events projected into the central regions . for core \n collapse sne , such a deficit does appear to be present in the observational data . although the need for improving on the assumption of a single characteristic sn  producing disk galaxy in future work is obvious , this effect of extinction is likely to be real . \n it has obvious implications for such things as using high  redshift sne  ia to determine the cosmic deceleration ( avoid extinction by using events in the outer regions of their parent galaxies ) ; for determining the true relative radial distributions of sn types ( extinction can cause confusion , especially when comparing sn types that have different vertical scale heights ) , and for determining sn rates ( substantial corrections for incompleteness that depend on parent  galaxy dustiness are required ) . \n adam fisher wrote the original version of our monte carlo code . \n we are grateful to eddie baron , darrin casebeer , dean richardson , bill romanishin , and rollin thomas for many discussions in the course of this work , which was supported by nsf grant ast 9417102 . \n j.d . was supported in part by an nsf reu supplement to ast 9417242 .                                      1.00 & 0.12 & 0.12 & 1.00 & 0.30 & 0.16 & 0.76 & 0.32 & 0.24 & 0.84 + 0.75 & 0.18 & 0.14 & 0.92 & 0.40 & 0.15 & 0.65 & 0.41 & 0.24 & 0.71 + 0.50 & 0.36 & 0.13 & 0.72 & 0.58 & 0.14 & 0.55 & 0.62 & 0.24 & 0.54 + 0.25 & 1.06 & 0.08 & 0.46 & 1.17 & 0.13 & 0.43 & 1.21 & 0.22 & 0.34 + 0.00 & 4.26 & 0.07 & 0.52 & 8.80 & 0.12 & 0.32 & 19.8 & 0.14 & 0.07 +", "StartTimeOffset": 2053155534954, "RequestID": "212084723f2777830d5d3ada2f21423ed10b82c9", "TotalTokens": 4056}

5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28where the creation operator @xmath29 of the cavity field is defined by @xmath30with @xmath31 . \n ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) shows that the mirror variables are shifted by the amount @xmath32 due to its interaction with the cavity field . \n it is clear that the ground state of the effective hamiltonian in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) can be obtained via the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath33 in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 2 - 1 ] ) for a harmonic oscillator with displacement operator @xmath34the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the mirror , corresponding to the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) , are , respectively , @xmath35and @xmath36eqs . \n ( [ 2 - 9 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) show that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are functions of the slow variables of the cavity field . \n ( [ 2 - 9 ] ) also shows that the ground state of the fast variables ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) of the mirror is a coherent state @xmath39 , resulting from radiation pressure .    according to the lowest - order generalized bo approximation \n , the total eigenfunction @xmath40 of the coupled system of the cavity field and the mirror can be factorized as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 satisfies the schrdinger equation with the effective hamiltonian @xmath43the bo adiabatic separation provides an effective potential @xmath44 for the slow  motion of the cavity field . \n this potential contains a typical @xmath45where the parameter @xmath46plays the role of _ the phenomenological third - order susceptibility _ as in usual kerr media . \n versus normalized detuning @xmath47 for the value @xmath48 . \n analytical results for the full hamiltonian are shown with a red dashed curve , while the bo approximation results are shown with a blue solid curve . \n note that squeezing occurs when @xmath49 , and the baseline @xmath50 is shown with a horizontal black dot - dashed line.,width=307 ]    we now verify the validity of the generalized bo approximation applied to the optomechanical system through the squeezing effect , which is induced by the kerr interaction . \n this squeezing effect can be demonstrated by the output intensity spectrum @xmath51 . following the definition of the @xmath51 in ref . \n @xcite and the linearization technique of the langevin equations governed by the hamiltonian in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 11 ] ) , we obtain the intensity spectrum under the bo approximation @xmath52where    @xmath53    with renormalized detuning @xmath54 and the steady - state value @xmath55 of the amplitude of the cavity field . here , the cavity loss @xmath12 has been taken into account . \n the bo approximation requires that the photons in the cavity can survive a sufficiently long time , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath56    if there is no kerr interaction induced by the radiation pressure ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 can be simplified to @xmath59 . \n when the kerr interaction is induced ( @xmath60 ) , the intensity spectrum can be less than @xmath61 , which displays a squeezing effect  @xcite of the cavity field . \n here , @xmath62 plays an important role in the reduction of the output intensity fluctuation . \n hence , the squeezing effect could be observed experimentally by measuring the intensity spectrum of the output laser \n .    fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] shows the squeezing of the cavity field in the intensity spectrum with a blue solid curve , where the maximum squeezing occurs in the vicinity of @xmath63 . \n we consider that the oscillating mirror has mass @xmath64 ng , frequency @xmath65 , and a normalized damping rate @xmath66 . \n [ fig : fig2 ] is plotted for the driving field frequency @xmath67 thz , the optical cavity length @xmath68 m , finesse @xmath69 , and decay rate @xmath70 s@xmath71 ; a driving laser wavelength @xmath72 nm , normalized frequency @xmath73 and power @xmath74 @xmath75 . \n the temperature @xmath76 of the cavity field and the mechanical resonator is assumed to be zero , as in ref . \n @xcite . then at a particular frequency @xmath77 ( chosen at the position where @xmath58 is minimum ) , the intensity spectrum has the squeezing effect shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] . \n now , we also study the intensity spectrum without the bo approximation . \n starting from the total hamiltonian in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) , a full derivation shows that the intensity spectrum has a similar form as in eqs . \n ( 15 ) except that the renormalized detuning @xmath78 and the kerr interaction strength @xmath79 are replaced , respectively , by @xmath80 and @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the steady - state value of the oscillation amplitude of the mirror and    @xmath83    is the mechanical susceptibility of the oscillating mirror . the maximum squeezing effect in the intensity spectrum , plotted by the red dashed curve in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] , \n can also be observed in the vicinity of @xmath84 . \n we use the same parameters for calculating the intensity spectrum under the bo approximation . \n therefore , the bo approximation is valid when the frequency of the oscillating mirror @xmath85 is much larger than the frequency of the light field @xmath86    the effect of the bo approximation can also be understood via @xmath87 . \n if the mirror frequency @xmath7 is much larger than the detuning @xmath88 of the cavity field in the rotating frame of reference , @xmath89 plays an important role in the vicinity of @xmath90 . \n when the bo approximation is valid under the condition @xmath91 , and when the macroscopic displacement @xmath92 is extremely small , the mechanical susceptibility is approximately equal to @xmath93@xmath94 which leads the intensity spectrum to have the same form as in eq . \n ( 3 - 1 ) . \n within the bo approximation , the cavity field inside the flexible fabry - prot cavity , driven by an input laser , exhibits a kerr - like nonlinear property . \n it is not difficult to generate a two - mode induced kerr interaction , which is useful for quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements  @xcite .    as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1](b ) , we consider two fp cavities , referred to below as the left and the right cavities with subindexes @xmath15 and @xmath95 , sharing one common oscillating mirror . this mirror is assumed to oscillate with a very small displacement @xmath8 around its equilibrium position . \n thus two cavity fields , with frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the laboratory reference frame , indirectly interact with each other via this oscillating mirror .    in the rotating frame of reference , using the bo approximation discussed above , we can derive the induced effective interaction between the two cavity fields @xmath98where the @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 denote the photon number operator of the left and the right cavity fields . to perform a qnd measurement , the self - modulation term @xmath102 of the probe field \n can be ignored  @xcite . \n therefore , the system hamiltonian for the qnd measurement can be written as @xmath103where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the detunings of the left and right cavity fields , relevant to the frequency @xmath0 of the driving field . \n the kerr interaction in eq . \n ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) satisfies the qnd measurement conditions  @xcite . \n since this two - mode kerr interaction commutes with the free hamiltonians of both cavities , we can nondestructively measure the photon number by observing the other cavity s conjugate observable . \n we have studied the kerr nonlinearity in the vacuum induced by the radiation pressure in typical optomechanical systems . \n such nonlinear interaction can be explicitly obtained via a bo approximation for an ideal case . through a squeezing effect , which should be experimentally observable via the intensity spectrum \n , we verify the validity of the generalized bo approximation by taking into account the dissipation and fluctuation of the cavity field . \n furthermore , we propose a two - mode kerr interaction between two cavity fields for quantum nondemolition measurements , which can be realized by using two cavities sharing one oscillating mirror . \n it is possible to nondestructively measure a cavity photon number by observing another cavity s conjugate observable . \n we are grateful to dr . \n lan zhou for helpful discussions . \n sun was supported by the nsfc with grant nos.90503003 , nfrpc with grant nos . \n 2006cb921205 and 2005cb724508 . \n fn was supported in part by the nsa , lps , aro , and nsf grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 2063942145726, "RequestID": "5efb7cf8ddea4e99572332c5bd097d838acf0b18", "TotalTokens": 3242}

tau - dt - t](c ) . \n concluding , the sznajd dynamics has been applied to the directed network designed as to reproduce the small world effect and clusterization , as in social networks . \n the results on the time @xmath0 of getting stationary state are compared to the analytical calculations for the fully connected network @xcite . \n although the dependence of @xmath0 on the initial state is different than in theory , the system size dependence of @xmath0 is the same . \n the message for the social applications is that the time of attaining the stationary distribution increases linearly with the system size . among other consequences \n , this means that an initial support for a new government persists twice longer in a twice larger country ; larger countries have more time for reforms . \n still , even if the initial state is the longest - living @xmath42 , this time is not infinite , as it is shown in fig . \n [ fig - tau](a ) . \n as remarked in the introduction , all that is valid as long as opinions are adjusted in small groups . \n important political events can reveal a metastable character of the opinion distribution ; however , this possibility remains out of frames of this work . \n the numerical calculations were carried out in ack \n the machine time on hp integrity superdome is financed by the polish ministry of science and higher education under grant no . \n mnii / hp_i_sdagh/047/2004 . \n 99 woodrow wilson , the speech to newspapers editors and publishers at the waldorf \n astoria , 20 april 1915 w. lippmann , _ public opinion _ , 1922 ; free press , ny 1997 j. shamir , m. shamir , _ the anatomy of public opinion _ , university of michigan press , ann arbor 2000 s. wasserman , k. faust , _ social network analysis : methods and applications _ \n , cambridge up , cambridge 1997 a. campbell , p. e. converse , w. e. miller , d. e. stokes , _ the american voter _ \n , j. wiley and sons , chicago 1960 e. noelle -

the spectra always become softer . \n it was early recognized that the spectra of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have a non - thermal character , with emission over a broad energy range ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n this typically indicates emission from an optically - thin source and an initial proposal for grbs was therefore an optically - thin synchrotron model from shock - accelerated , relativistic electrons ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n the number density of the radiating electrons is assumed to be typically a power law as a function of the electron lorentz factor @xmath3 above a minimum value , @xmath4 , with index @xmath5 . \n such a distribution gives rise to a power - law photon spectrum with photon index @xmath6 below a break energy @xmath7 and a high - energy power - law with index @xmath8 . \n however , as mentioned above , this model has difficulties in explaining the observed spectra of grbs , which show a great variation in @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) . in particular \n , a substantial fraction of them have @xmath11 , which is not possible in the model in its simplest form , since @xmath6 is the power - law slope of the fundamental synchrotron function for electrons with an isotropic distribution of pitch angles @xcite . \n the problem becomes even more severe for the case when the cooling time of the electrons is shorter than the typical dynamic timescale . in the typical \n setting of grbs having a relativistic outflow with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath12 , the time scales for synchrotron and inverse compton losses are @xmath13 s @xcite , which is much shorter than both the dynamic time scale @xmath14 , and the integration time - scale of the recorded data , typically 64 ms to 1 s. in such a case the low - energy power - law should be even softer , with @xmath15 @xcite , now contradicting a majority of the observed spectra . \n furthermore , the observed distribution of @xmath9 from _ instantaneous _ spectra is smooth ( see @xcite ) and does not show any indication of preferred values , such as @xmath2 or @xmath16 . \n other variations of the synchrotron or / and inverse compton model have been suggested ( see e.g. @xcite ) to account for these hard spectra . \n the peak energy from the above distribution of electrons is given by @xmath17 . \n in the external shock model @xmath18 and @xmath19 are proportional to the bulk lorentz factor , which makes @xmath20 , which is a very strong dependence , which poses a problem in explaining the relative narrowness of the distribution of peak energies @xcite , even including the x - ray flashes . for the internal shock model the @xmath21 , which is the relative lorentz factor between the two shells that collide and @xmath22 however , the sharing of the energy between the kinetic energy of the electrons and the magnetic fields should lead to a larger dispersion . \n a third complication arises in explaining the observed correlation between peak energy and the luminosity which was discussed by lloyd - ronning et al . @xcite and amati \n @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; the peak energy is correlated with the isotropically equivalent energy given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the actual gamma - ray energy emitted and @xmath27 is the jet opening half - angle of the collimated outflow . \n equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) shows that in the internal shock model @xmath28 is proportional to the lorentz boosted magnetic field strength . the total energy density @xmath29 the typical radius for the internal shocks to occur is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the typical variability time scale , and thus @xmath32 to get a relation similar to that in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) both @xmath33 and @xmath31 have to be quite similar for all bursts , which is difficult to imagine . even though there is no direct way of determining the bulk lorentz factor , various physical models give suggestions on plausible relations between the luminosity and the bulk lorentz factor . \n for instance , @xcite argued for @xmath34 . \n such a relation would thus give @xmath35 , that is , an anti - correlation , in contradiction to the observed behavior ( see also @xcite ) . \n additional assumptions are needed to explain the positive correlation . \n invoking poynting flux and/or pair dominated models the correlation also becomes positive @xcite . \n if the prompt phase is indeed dominated by a thermal component these three issues become natural consequences . \n first , as shown by ryde ( 2004 , 2005 ) the relative strength and the slope of the non - thermal component will determine the value of the low - energy power - law index , @xmath9 , that would be found if the band et al . \n @xcite function were to be used . \n if the thermal component is strong and/or the non - thermal component is hard , the resulting spectrum will have a hard @xmath9 ( see fig.2 ) . \n while if the non - thermal component becomes relatively stronger and/or softer the measured @xmath9-value would be softer ( see fig . \n the observed distribution of @xmath9-values is therefore consistent with this picture and in particular the spectra beyond the `` line - of - death '' @xcite are not conspicuous . a strong spectral evolution , for instance , in a large change in the measured value of @xmath9 , is also easily explained . \n second , the peak of the spectrum is now determined of @xmath36 and is less sensitive to the bulk lorentz factor . \n in fact , if the photosphere occurs during the acceleration phase it is practically independent of @xmath33 . \n rees & mszros @xcite suggest a model where the photospheric emission can become enhanced by dissipative effects below the photosphere ( magnetic reconnections , shocks ) and subsequent comptonization , see also @xcite . \n typical values for the peak energy would be hundreds of kev . \n third , the correlation in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) has a natural explanation since for a thermal emitter the luminosity and the temperature are correlated . \n for instance , equating @xmath28 with the energy density , one gets @xmath37 using that the pair photosphere occurs at @xmath38 ( see rees & mszros @xcite ) then @xmath39 . in the last step , \n @xmath40 was again assumed . \n similarly if the photosphere is emitted during the acceleration phase its temperature will be constant in the observer frame since the comoving cooling by adiabatic expansion is compensated for by the increase in @xmath33 . \n @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the radius at which the linear acceleration starts . \n assuming , for instance , that @xmath43 then again @xmath44 ( see further rees & mszros @xcite ) . finally , for extremely photon starved plasmas @xmath45 . \n the radiative efficiency of the thermal emission can in plausible scenarios be radically increased by , for instance , dissipation processes below the photosphere @xcite . these processes \n would naturally produce large amount of electron - positron pairs with modest lorentz factors , which would compton up - scatter the thermal radiation . \n the observed peak would then be this comptonized peak . \n the non - thermal emission seen in the spectra , could be due to synchrotron emission or inverse compton emission from dissipation regions outside the photosphere . \n ryde @xcite showed that the energy flux in the thermal and the non - thermal components are correlated which might indicate the latter .    in summary , thermal emission \n could indeed dominate over non - thermal emission in standard settings of a grb jet . \n in such scenarios a correlation between the peak energy and the luminosity naturally arises , the details somewhat depending on the dissipation processes . \n in addition , the dispersion in @xmath28 would be smaller and the observed spectral shapes and spectral evolution get natural explanations .", "StartTimeOffset": 2073148327986, "RequestID": "1866e2a14503e2e9cc8d8f73602bffcd228d74ab", "TotalTokens": 2406}

quark interaction . \n the inter - two - quark potential in baryons can be influenced by such nontrivial effects of the other quark . \n to investigate such finite - mass - quark  motional \" effects on the effective inter - two - quark potential , we study the heavy - heavy - light quark ( @xmath0 ) system in this work . \n we treat the two heavy quarks in the @xmath0 system as infinitely heavy , keeping the light - quark mass finite . \n we artificially change the inter - heavy - quark distance @xmath1 , and calculate the energy of the @xmath0 system as a function of @xmath1 , which we call the @xmath0 potential . \n this @xmath0 potential includes not only the gluonic effect but also the nontrivial light - quark effect , and would differ from the static three - quark ( @xmath2 ) potential .    from our previous lattice qcd study @xcite , \n the @xmath0 potential is almost described as a linear and one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential , like the quark - antiquark ( @xmath3 ) potential . however , the effective string tension between two heavy quarks is reduced compared to the static @xmath3 or @xmath2 case , 0.89 gev / fm . \n this reduction would be the result from nontrivial light - quark effects . \n lattice qcd is a powerful tool for calculating hadron masses , potentials , and several qcd properties , but has a difficulty to clarify the light - quark wave function . instead , \n in this paper , we employ a simple potential model , and calculate the @xmath0 potential and the spatial distribution of the light - quark wave function , in order to explain the reduction mechanism of the effective string tension .    in most of ordinary quark models and potential models , \n the quark confining force in baryons is the simple two - body force @xcite . \n however , it is recently found that the confinement potential in baryons is expressed by the y - type flux tube picture @xcite . for more accurate calculations , quark models and potential models \n need to treat the confinement force in baryons as the three - body force . \n in particular , since we are now interested in the light - quark effects on the inter - quark potential , the accurate treatment for the three - quark interaction is important . \n hence , we adopt the three - quark potential from the lattice qcd result , which is the non - perturbative first - principle calculation .    as an example of realistic @xmath0 baryons , the doubly charmed baryon is experimentally observed . in 2002 , \n the selex collaboration at fermilab observed @xmath4 through a weak decay @xmath5 @xcite . \n they also confirmed another decay process @xmath6 @xcite . in their experiments , \n the mass is measured about 3519 mev . \n doubly charmed baryons are also theoretically investigated in lattice qcd @xcite , potential model @xcite , and other approaches @xcite . \n we already know analogous systems to this @xmath0 baryon , for example the h@xmath7 ion in molecular physics , which is also the bound state of two heavy and one light particles . \n however , the interaction in the ground - state @xmath0 system is attractive , while the h@xmath7 ion includes coulomb repulsive force between the two protons . \n additionally , as stated above , the confining force in the @xmath0 baryon is a purely three - body force , not a sum of two - body forces , and has the characteristic geometrical structure . \n then the @xmath0 potential is expected to include non - trivial effects from this feature .    in this paper , we study finite -

quark interaction term as @xmath9 in the @xmath0 system , we treat two heavy quarks as infinitely heavy particles , and one light quark as a non - relativistic constituent quark with the constituent mass @xmath10 . \n the non - relativistic quark model is one of the successful models to describe baryons even for the light - quark sector , and have been used for the study of baryons by many theoretical physicists even at present @xcite . \n apart from irrelevant constants , the hamiltonian is simplified as @xmath11 where the subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 mean the two heavy quarks and the light quark , respectively . \n although we adopt the non - relativistic formalism , we still call this finite - mass quark the  light \" quark in this paper .    as the three - quark interaction @xmath12 , to treat the light - quark effect as precisely as possible , we adopt the lattice qcd result of the static @xmath2 potential @xcite . \n this @xmath2 potential includes the confining potential as the three - body force , instead of the simple sum of the two - body force in ordinary quark models . \n the static @xmath2 potential obtained by quenched lattice qcd is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and these values in eq.([sa3q ] ) are related to the @xmath3 case as @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . since we are not interested in a constant shift of the energy in the non - relativistic formalism , we set @xmath17 . \n the symbol @xmath18 is the length of the color flux tube minimally connecting the three quarks , which is described as follows . when all the angles of the @xmath2 triangle is less than @xmath19 , the y - type flux tube is formed and @xmath20^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when one of the angles of the @xmath2 triangle exceeds @xmath19 \n , @xmath21 once the heavy - quark coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed , the interaction depends only on the light - quark coordinate @xmath24 . \n we can calculate the ground - state light - quark wave function @xmath25 with the variational principle of the energy of the system @xmath26 we determine the ground - state @xmath0 potential @xmath27 by minimizing @xmath28 .    here , we comment on the three - quark interaction @xmath12 with finite - mass quarks . \n the finite - mass effect changes the simple coulomb interaction to the fermi - breit interaction @xcite , which includes spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions . \n these relativistic corrections are suppressed by the inverse of the quark mass . in the @xmath0 system with \n infinitely heavy quarks , most of them give zero contributions as @xmath29 , and the interaction remains the simple form . \n however , the finite - mass effect on the quark confinement potential is unknown . here , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath12 in the @xmath0 system can be written with the static one . \n equivalently , the finite - mass effect is assumed to be taken only via the light - quark wave function spreading . \n the schematic figure of the renormalization group ( rg ) inspired variational calculation . \n the finer - mesh calculation is done with the initial condition constructed from the rougher - mesh result . ] \n we exactly solve the energy variational problem in discretized space . \n we take a cylindrical coordinate @xmath30 , and locate the two heavy quarks on @xmath31 and @xmath32 . \n the ground - state light - quark wave function is mirror symmetric to the @xmath33 plane and rotational symmetric around the @xmath34-axis . \n thus , we have only to calculate on the two - dimensional plane @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) . \n we discretize the space with an  isotropic \" mesh as @xmath38 , and vary the light - quark wave function on each sites to minimize @xmath28 . \n this is equivalent to solving the schr@xmath8dinger equation exactly , and we have no ansatz about the functional form of the light - quark wave function .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the non - relativistic quark model has achieved considerable success in explaining low - energy hadron properties . \n however , the relativistic treatment for the light quark can give rise to the quantitative correction to some properties . \n we give a brief comment on the relativistic correction to our result .    in the relativistic formalism for the light quark , \n the hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) is modified as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the light - quark momentum . \n the interaction term @xmath12 is again the general three - quark interaction in @xmath0 systems . \n one of the relativistic corrections is the higher - order kinetic term from @xmath41 . \n if the higher - order terms do not change the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath0 potential , the non - relativistic formalism works well . as shown in fig . \n [ fig6 ] , the leading - order kinetic term @xmath42 is almost @xmath1-independent , compared to the typical @xmath1-dependence of the energy , namely @xmath43 gev / fm . \n we expect that the higher - order kinetic terms also give rise to small @xmath1-dependent contributions , at least in the large @xmath10 case . \n another possible relativistic correction is modification to @xmath12 . \n while we adopt the static @xmath2 potential as the three - quark interaction in @xmath0 systems , it can be changed by the light - quark relativistic effect . \n several works have dealt the inter - quark potential in mesons and baryons with finite - mass quarks @xcite . \n the finite - mass - quark effect on the potential is rather complicated , and nontrivial @xmath10-dependence can occur .    for the precise statement and quantitative accuracy \n , the relativistic treatment is desired , particularly for the realistic light - quark mass case , i.e. , @xmath44 mev . \n from the above considerations , we can conclude that , when finite - mass quarks exist in baryons , the effective string tension between the other two quarks is reduced compared to the static case . \n the essential reason for the reduction is the \n _ geometrical difference _ between the inter - quark distance @xmath1 and the flux - tube length @xmath45 . as can be seen from fig . \n [ fig4 ] , this geometrical difference always exists for more than two - quark system , regardless of whether the heavy - quark mass is infinite or finite . \n then this is expected to hold not only for @xmath0 systems but also for ordinary baryons , such as nucleons . of course \n , the quantitative difference would exist between @xmath0 systems and ordinary baryons . \n in addition , also in multi - quark systems , the effective string tension can be changed due to the existence of other light quarks . in such systems , \n the effective string tension between two finite - mass quarks would include more complicated finite - mass effects .    in summary \n , we have studied the @xmath0 potential with the non - relativistic potential model , and have investigated the finite - mass - quark motional effect on the inter - heavy - quark potential in baryons . \n we have found the significant reduction of the effective string tension @xmath46 between the two heavy quarks in @xmath0 systems , compared to string tension @xmath47 in the static @xmath2 case . \n the effective string tension @xmath46 depends on the light - quark mass @xmath10 , and slightly depends on @xmath1 . \n the finite - mass - quark existence reduces the effective confinement force , which is conjectured to be a general property for baryons . \n h.  s.  was supported in part by a grant for scientific research [ ( c ) no.19540287 ] from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology of japan . \n 99 a. yamamoto , h. suganuma , and h. iida , arxiv:0708 . \n 3610 , ( 2007 ) . s. capstick and n. isgur , phys . \n d * 34 * , 2809 ( 1986 ) . \n m. oka and k. yazaki , phys . lett . * \n b90 * , 41 ( 1980 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3550, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "recent high resolution movies obtained by hinode spacecraft clearly show continuous helical motions of spicule axes @xcite . \n this phenomenon is known for a long time ( beckers 1972 ) , but no satisfactory explanation has been done yet . \n @xcite suggested that these motions are caused by alfvn waves excited in the photosphere by granular motions or acoustic oscillations . \n photospheric magnetic field is concentrated in thin flux tubes and therefore may support the propagation of kink and torsional alfvn waves ( the tubes also support the propagation of sausage waves , but here we consider only transverse waves ) . the kink wave is a tube wave i.e. the whole tube oscillates with one frequency even if the alfvn speed changes across the tube , while the frequency of torsional waves is different at different surfaces @xcite . \n therefore , the excitation of torsional waves in photospheric magnetic tubes is complicated . \n the oscillations of spicule axis have also been explained in terms of kink waves @xcite , but the chromospheric magnetic field has rather expanded structure . \n therefore , @xcite suggested through monte - carlo simulation that spicules are not wave guides for kink waves . \n the problem is currently under debate and more observations are needed to understand the real process .    on the other hand , \n granular buffeting on an anchored magnetic tube may easily excite a transverse kink pulse . \n the pulse propagates through the stratified photosphere with the kink speed , but the oscillating wake is formed behind the wave front . \n the wake oscillates at cut - off frequency of kink waves and decays as time progresses @xcite \n . however , the magnetic tube undergoes continuous buffeting of granular cells from different sides . \n therefore , another pulse polarized in a different plane may quickly follow . \n the second pulse again propagates with the kink speed and form another wake oscillating with the same cut - off frequency . \n therefore , the superposition of the two oscillations may set up the _ helical motion _ of the tube axis in the photosphere \n . the helical motion will have the photospheric kink cut - off period @xmath0 7 - 8 min \n .    however , when the pulse penetrates into the chromosphere , then two possible scenarios can be developed . \n if chromospheric magnetic field has a tube structure , then the pulse continues to propagate as the kink one . \n but if the magnetic field is not concentrated in tubes , then it will be transformed into the alfvnic pulse . yet \n the pulse will have the same main properties in both cases : it will propagate at either the kink or alfvn speed and the wake oscillating at the chromospheric cut - off frequency will be formed behind the pulse . \n the superposition of the wakes corresponding to different pulses may set up helical motions of magnetic field lines just as in the photospheric case . \n these helical motions may be responsible for the oscillations of spicule axes as seen by hinode movies . \n here we study the phenomenon using the klein - gordon equation for wave propagation in the stratified atmosphere . \n kink wave propagation along vertical thin magnetic flux tube embedded in the stratified field - free atmosphere is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the kink speed , @xmath4 is the density scale height and @xmath5 is the gravitational cut - off frequency for isothermal atmosphere ( temperature inside and outside the tube is assumed to be the same and homogeneous ) . here @xmath6 is the transversal displacement of the tube , @xmath7 is the tube magnetic field , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the plasma densities inside and outside the tube respectively ( the magnetic field and densities are functions of @xmath10 , while the kink speed @xmath11 is constant in the isothermal atmosphere ) . \n ( 1 ) yields simple harmonic solutions @xmath12 $ ] with the dispersion relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wave frequency and @xmath15 is the wave number . \n the dispersion relation shows that the waves with higher frequency than @xmath16 may propagate in the tube , while the lower frequency waves are evanescent . \n kink waves cause the transverse displacement of whole tube . \n the displacement of tube in a simple harmonic kink wave is polarized arbitrarily and the polarization plane depends on the excitation source . \n then the superposition of two or more kink waves polarized in different planes may give rise to the complex motion of the tube . \n the process is similar to the superposition of two plane electromagnetic waves , where the waves with the same amplitudes lead to the circular polarization , while the waves with different amplitudes lead to the elliptical polarization . \n consider , for example , two harmonic kink waves with the same frequency but polarized in @xmath17 and @xmath18 planes : @xmath19 and @xmath20 . \n the superposition of these waves sets up the _ helical wave _ with circular polarization if @xmath21 . as a result \n , the tube axis rotates around the vertical , while the displacement remains constant ( fig . \n 1 ) . if @xmath22 then the resulting wave is elliptically polarized . \n the superposition of few harmonics with different frequencies and polarizations may lead to more complex motion of tube axis . \n however , simple harmonic kink waves hardly be excited in the photosphere . \n the more realistic process is the impulsive buffeting of granules on an anchored magnetic flux tube . for the sake of simplicity , we consider the simplest impulsive forcing in both time and coordinate \n . then eq . \n ( 1 ) looks as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is constant and the pulse is set at @xmath27 , @xmath28 . \n the solution of this equation is the green function for the klein - gordon equation , which can be written as @xcite @xmath29h\\left [ \\omega_k \\left \n ( t- { { z}\\over { c_k } } \\right ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bessel and heaviside functions respectively . eq . ( 4 ) shows that the wave front propagates with the kink speed @xmath11 , while the wake oscillating at the cut - off frequency @xmath16 is formed behind the wave front and it decays as time progresses @xcite . fig . \n 2 shows the plot of transverse displacement @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is expressed by eq . \n the rapid propagation of the pulse is seen , which is followed by the oscillating wake ( the time is normalized by the cut - off period @xmath34 ) . \n just after the propagation of the pulse , the tube begins to oscillate with the cut - off period at each height . \n the amplitudes of pulse and wake increase upwards due to the density reduction , but the oscillations at each height decay in time . \n hence , the transverse impulsive action on the magnetic tube at @xmath27 moment near the base of photosphere ( set at @xmath28 ) excites the upward propagating kink pulse , while the tube in the photosphere oscillates at the photospheric kink cut - off frequency , @xmath16 , which depends on the plasma @xmath35 parameter ( @xmath36 ) inside the tube . in the case of temperature balance inside and outside the tube , the kink speed can be expressed as @xmath37^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath38 is the sound speed and @xmath39 is the ratio of specific heats ( @xmath40 for adiabatic process ) . \n then the photospheric sound speed of 7.5 km / s and @xmath41 gives 6.5 km / s for the kink speed . \n consequently , we may estimate the kink cut - off period as @xmath0 8 min using the photospheric scale height of 125 km . \n hence the magnetic tube will oscillate with @xmath0 8 min period in the photosphere . \n if the external pulse is directed along , say , the @xmath42 axis , then the tube will oscillate in the @xmath17 plane . \n however , the anchored magnetic tube undergoes the granular buffeting from different sides . therefore , suppose that after @xmath43 time another granular cell acts on the same tube along the @xmath44 axis . \n the solution governing the pulse propagation is @xmath45h\\left [ \\omega_k \\left ( t - t_0- { { z}\\over { c_k } } \\right ) \\right ] \\exp{(z/4\\lambda)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the rapidly propagating pulse is again excited with the oscillating wake behind the front . \n the wake oscillates with the same cut - off frequency , but the oscillation is polarized in @xmath18 plane . \n hence there are two transverse oscillations with the same frequency , but polarized in perpendicular planes . \n the time interval between consecutive buffeting @xmath43 ( say , granular life time ) is comparable to the photospheric kink cut - off period . \n therefore , these oscillations will be superimposed , because the oscillation excited by the previous pulse still exists in the same tube . \n the superposition will set up the helical motion of the tube axis with photospheric cut - off period @xmath0 8 min . \n figure 3 shows the superposition of the solutions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) at the height of 250 km above the photosphere . the first pulse is imposed along the @xmath42 direction , which is followed by another pulse in the @xmath44 direction . \n the upper panel corresponds to the same amplitudes of both pulses , but the lower panel corresponds to the case when the first pulse is twice stronger than the second . \n we see that the tube rotates along nearly circular spiral in the first case and along elliptical spiral in the second case . \n the displacement gradually decreases with time . \n therefore , the granular buffeting with same amplitudes excites the nearly circular motion of the tube , while the buffeting with different amplitudes excites the elliptical motion . \n the wave length of oscillations @xmath46 km is quiet long comparing to the width of the photosphere . \n therefore , the photospheric magnetic tube will just rotate around the vertical without additional wave nodes . \n the tube displacement increases with height due to the decreasing density ( fig . \n 2 ) . thus the observations should show that the upper part of the tube rotates with larger amplitude than the lower part . \n we believe that the high resolution observations will reveal the similar behavior of photospheric magnetic tubes . \n the situation is changed when the pulse crosses the photosphere and penetrates into the chromosphere . \n photospheric magnetic tubes may expand in the chromosphere giving rather different geometry than thin tubes . \n on the other hand , chromospheric spicules seem to behave like magnetic tubes . but \n recent monte - carlo simulations ( de pontieu et al . 2007 ) suggest that the spicules are not wave guides for tube waves . \n therefore , this question is currently under debate and more observations are needed to clarify the intrinsic process ( erdlyi & fedun 2007 ) . \n the transverse pulse retains its properties in any case . \n it continues to be the kink pulse in structured magnetic field , but probably is transformed into the alfvnic one in the case of smooth transverse profile of the magnetic field . \n the photosphere and the chromosphere can be approximated as two different regions with different isothermal temperatures , densities and other plasma parameters . \n then the propagation of pulse in the chromosphere is governed by eq . \n ( 3 ) , but with different phase speed and scale height ( @xmath28 now corresponds to the base of the chromosphere ) . \n it must be mentioned , however , that the phase speed remains constant only if the magnetic field is expanded with height . \n this necessarily requires the horizontal component of the magnetic field , which is neglected in the equation . \n therefore , the equation ( 3 ) is valid only near the tube axis , where the magnetic field is predominantly vertical . \n then the photospheric solution ( 4 ) can be directly applied here , but with chromospheric phase speed and scale height . \n the chromospheric scale height @xmath47 can be estimated as @xmath0 500 km for 25 000 k temperature . \n the value of phase speed determines the wave cut - off frequency . \n for example , alfvn wave cut - off frequency is @xmath48 @xcite , which gives the cut - off period of @xmath0 250 s for the alfvn speed of 50 km / s . on the other hand \n , a cavity with higher density concentrations ( for example spicules ) may guide kink waves with smaller phase speed . \n this increases the cut - off period . \n for example , the kink speed of 25 km / s yields the cut - off period of 500 s.    therefore , the transverse pulse may set up the oscillating wake in the chromosphere with the period of 250 - 500 s. the two perpendicularly polarized transverse pulses may form the helical motion in the chromosphere as observed by hinode ( de pontieu et al . \n de pontieu et al . \n ( 2007 ) argued that the helical motion is caused by alfvn waves directly excited in the photosphere . \n the estimated energy flux of the waves was enough to power the solar wind and to heat the quiet corona . \n however , if observed oscillations of spicule axes are caused by wakes formed after the transverse pulse propagation , then the energy transported into the chromosphere / corona can be much higher : _ as almost whole energy of initial perturbation is carried by the pulse , while the energy of the wake is much smaller_.    the energy flux stored in initial transverse pulse at the photospheric level is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the granular velocity being 1 - 2 km / s . \n then for photospheric values of electron density and kink speed , the estimated energy flux is @xmath51 erg @xmath52 s@xmath53 . \n almost whole energy is carried by the pulse , therefore even if the filling factor of magnetic tubes is @xmath54 , the energy flux is more than enough to heat the solar chromosphere / corona . \n we suggest that the propagation of consecutive transverse pulses in the stratified atmosphere , which are excited by photospheric granular buffeting , may set up the helical motions of magnetic flux tubes through the superposition of oscillating wakes formed behind the wave fronts . \n this scenario may explain the continuous motions of spicule axes seen in recent hinode movies . \n the pulses carry almost whole energy of initial perturbations , while the energy in wake oscillations is much smaller . \n therefore , the energy carried into corona by transverse pulses can be much higher than it is estimated by observed oscillations . \n more observations and numerical / analytical works need to look further into this problem .                                         as a function of time @xmath55 and height @xmath10 , where @xmath33 is expressed by eq . \n the time is normalized by kink cut - off period and the @xmath10 coordinate is normalized by the photospheric scale height , @xmath56 km . \n the rapid propagation of the pulse is seen , which is followed by the oscillating wake . \n the pulse propagates with the kink speed and the wake oscillates with the cut - off period . \n the amplitude of the pulse ( and wake ) increases with height due to the decreasing density . ]     and @xmath18 planes . \n upper panel corresponds to the case of same amplitudes , while the lower panel corresponds to the case of different amplitudes . \n the pulses with the same amplitudes set up the nearly circular motion of the tube axis . while the pulses with different amplitudes lead to the elliptical motion of the tube axis . \n the displacement of tube axis gradually decreases with time.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath18 planes . \n upper panel corresponds to the case of same amplitudes , while the lower panel corresponds to the case of different amplitudes . \n the pulses with the same amplitudes set up the nearly circular motion of the tube axis . while the pulses with different amplitudes lead to the elliptical motion of the tube axis . \n the displacement of tube axis gradually decreases with time.,title=\"fig : \" ]", "StartTimeOffset": 2095320952950, "RequestID": "607b97880bd5da96d65101e39a51657c32f75bc2", "TotalTokens": 3708}

field optical imaging can provide the data needed for complementary faint color - selected quasar surveys . \n several surveys are underway which , despite their small size , will form useful comparisons to the 2df and sdss surveys ( agn will also turn up in faint galaxy surveys such as discussed by le fevre et al . , this volume ) . \n the eventual goal for optical quasar studies is to reach @xmath17 at all redshifts @xmath18 . \n the big throughput camera on the ctio 4-m ( wittman et al . 1998 ) offered the first opportunity to image the wide fields required for faint quasar surveys at @xmath20 . \n a group of quasar enthusiasts  julia kennefick ( caltech ) , pat osmer & eric monier ( ohio state ) , malcolm smith ( ctio ) , richard green ( noao ) and myself  have used the btc for two separate but complementary surveys .    in 19971999 \n , we obtained 7 deg@xmath21 of @xmath22 imaging data for a big faint quasar survey . \n we expect to find @xmath23120 quasars at @xmath24 and @xmath2340 at @xmath25 via followup spectroscopy to @xmath26=23.5 . at these redshifts quasars have redder @xmath27 and bluer @xmath28 colors than the stellar locus . \n this survey will define the shape of the quasar luminosity function from @xmath29 at @xmath30 , and its evolution at @xmath31 , with accuracy equal to current knowledge for @xmath32 ( fan et al . \n a data paper is nearing submission ( hall et al . \n , in preparation ) , and we hope to begin spectroscopy in earnest in 2001 .    a second survey was also begun in 1997 to look for @xmath4@xmath335 quasars using @xmath34 imaging , dubbed btc40 for its coverage of 40 deg@xmath21 ( kennefick et al . \n , in preparation ) . \n a selection criterion of @xmath35 is sensitive to @xmath36 quasars and only the latest m dwarfs . \n however , the surface density of these very late m dwarfs is sufficiently high that they dominate candidates selected this way . \n thus we added @xmath37 band imaging to the survey to have two colors with which to distinguish @xmath36 quasars from stars . \n we expected anywhere from 1 to 25 @xmath36 quasars to @xmath38=22 in the survey . \n to date we have spectroscopically confirmed two @xmath39 quasars , but none at @xmath36 . \n part of this is the difficulty of following up @xmath40 candidates on 4-m class telescopes . \n our @xmath41 quasar surface density agrees with that found in the sdss ( fan et al . \n 2000 ) , but we hope to extend our spectroscopy to lower luminosities using 8-m class telescopes in the near future . \n the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) obtained spectra for about 6200 galaxies to a nominal limit of @xmath26=21.5 . as a side benefit it yielded a sample of at least 47 agn with @xmath42 and average @xmath43 ( hall et al . \n 2000 ) , spectroscopically selected by broad emission lines , nev emission , or feii absorption . \n at least 80% of the cnoc2 agn can be recovered by color selection , in agreement with previous , mostly smaller samples for which multiple selection methods were employed . \n this does not address the ability of optical flux - limited samples to recover agn which experience significant dust extinction , just the fraction of agn to a given optical flux limit which have colors sufficiently distinct from stars to be identified . \n note that @xmath2320% of these agn are classified as resolved or probably resolved ( in cfht seeing ) , a potential selection effect which must be considered in faint quasar surveys which target only unresolved objects . \n the cnoc2 agn include several unusual objects : one with a very strong double - peaked mgii emission line , one with the first recognized oiii@xmath53133 broad absorption line , and one with as yet unidentified emission and absorption lines . \n the broad emission line subsample of predominantly low - luminosity agn , although small , has some intriguing properties . \n it may have a higher incidence of associated mgii and civ absorption , possibly because such absorption is anti - correlated with optical luminosity or is becoming less frequent with cosmic time , or possibly because the sample is not biased against objects reddened by dust associated with the absorbing gas or with resolved spatial structure such as companions , tidal tails or large host galaxies , environments which may be more likely to have extensive gas envelopes which show up as associated absorption . \n the quite similar spectra of broad - line agn over a range of @xmath2310@xmath44 in luminosity implies that the parameters determining the emergent spectra scale nearly uniformly with luminosity . for a given line , an anticorrelation of emission line equivalent width with continuum luminosity  a baldwin effect ( beff ) \n means that the scaling is not exactly homologous for that line . the broad emission line cnoc2 agn subsample has average equivalent widths ( @xmath45 ) for mgii@xmath52798 and ciii]@xmath51909 which agree with the predictions of previous studies of the beff , but as seen in figure 1 , the average @xmath45 for civ@xmath51549 and ly@xmath6 are smaller than predicted by previous studies of the beff at lower redshift \n this may imply that the slopes of the civ and ly@xmath6 baldwin effects evolve with redshift , steepening with cosmic time . \n other faint agn samples are consistent with these results , namely agn from the cfrs and hdf ( see figure 1 ) , spectroscopically selected agn from the cnoc1 cluster galaxy redshift survey , and low s / n spectra of agn from the deep multicolor survey ( osmer et al . \n a similar result was also reported by zitelli et al . \n ( 1992 ) for civ , and by boyle et al . \n ( this conference ) for more luminous 2qz quasars . \n a current favored model explains the beff as a result of the luminosity dependence of agn continuum spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , wherein more luminous agn have softer ionizing continua ( osmer & shields 1999 ) . \n evolution in the beff might indicate evolution with cosmic time of agn seds at a given luminosity , which might arise from evolution in the relation between agn luminosity and black hole mass ( wandel 1999 ) . \n however , an earlier model for the civ beff postulated a smaller ionization parameter @xmath46 ( the ratio of ionizing photon to gas densities ) in more luminous agn and predicted no ly@xmath6 beff ( shields & ferland 1993 ) . \n a @xmath46-@xmath12 anticorrelation has also been recently suggested on entirely independent grounds , namely to explain reverberation mapping results on a subsample of palomar - green agn ( kaspi et al . \n 2000 ) . given the theoretical implications , further data on high-@xmath4 low - luminosity agn from well - understood samples is needed to confirm our possible evidence for redshift evolution of the slope of the baldwin effect in ly@xmath6 and civ . \n the @xmath22 and @xmath48 color selection techniques used to identify @xmath49 and @xmath50 quasars , respectively , can be extended to @xmath51 quasars using @xmath52 imaging . \n we are conducting such a survey using data from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; gladders & yee 2000 and gladders , this conference ) , a 100 deg@xmath21 @xmath53 survey for @xmath54 galaxy clusters . as a side benefit , \n this survey should yield a sample of several hundred t , l and m7m9 dwarfs . \n candidate @xmath51 quasars and brown dwarfs are identified to @xmath55 by requiring @xmath56 ; the only plausible contaminant at such colors is extremely luminous @xmath36 galaxies . \n @xmath57-band followup then separates the three populations : t dwarfs have red @xmath58 , l dwarfs have moderate @xmath58 , and @xmath47 quasars have blue @xmath58 ( figure 2 and zheng et al . \n 2000 ) . in pilot \n @xmath57 imaging of 28 targets sparsely sampled from @xmath59 deg@xmath21 , we are 28 for 28 in confirming that our @xmath60 candidates are real and fall within the expected @xmath58 color ranges : 23 have colors of m7l8 dwarfs and 5 of l8 to t dwarfs ( figure 2 ) . \n the rcs can reach 22.5 magnitudes fainter than sdss or 2mass in its selection of candidate @xmath47 quasars and l and t dwarfs . \n this means fainter quasars ( and more of them ) and cooler brown dwarfs ( on average ) . \n the full 100 deg@xmath21 survey could yield anywhere from 0 to @xmath23100 @xmath47 quasars , as well as more than 50 t dwarfs and 450 l dwarfs ( dantona et al . \n large surveys of bright quasars need complementary surveys of faint quasars if redshift and luminosity dependences of various quasar properties are to be disentangled . \n together these surveys will enable study of the properties and evolution of quasars over the entire optically accessible @xmath18 range . \n the bfqs and btc40 surveys are first steps toward large faint quasar surveys , for which 4-m class telescopes can provide imaging and some spectroscopy , but for which 8-m class telescopes are needed for fainter candidates and detailed spectral studies . \n the rcs is an excellent database in which to look for low - luminosity @xmath61 quasars , using snapshot near - ir imaging to separate them from very late m , l and t dwarfs with similarly red @xmath62 colors . \n comparison of low - luminosity quasars from the cnoc2 survey to high - luminosity quasars at the same redshifts suggests an unexpected variation with redshift of the baldwin effect for civ and ly@xmath6 , illustrating the potential for surprises in the new era of wide -

color cv entanglement can be produced by nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , optical superlattice and second - order nonlinearity media @xcite . \n alternatively , cv entanglement can also be produced in coherent atomic systems , whose entangled beams have narrower linewidths and longer coherence times ; in particular , they can be used for free - space quantum teleportation @xcite , such as , from a satellite to a ground station . such entanglement using four - wave mixing ( fwm ) \n has been predicted by ref . \n all those results above endow us the feasibility and necessity to realize our scheme . based on those processes , we extend the scheme to generate six - partite cv entanglement by intracavity four - wave - mixing cascaded with double such generations in a four - level atomic system . \n and we theoretically demonstrate such possibility of multy - partite entanglement using third - order nonlinearity according to the inseparability criterion for multipartite cv entanglement proposed by van loock and furusawa . \n this paper is arranged as follows . \n the physical model and its hamiltonian are discussed in sec . \n iii gives the equations of motion of the system and sec . \n iv provides a linearized fluctuation analysis to calculate the measurable output fluctuation spectra . \n these output spectra are further discussed in sec . \n v and they demonstrate the violation of the optimized vlf criteria and some entanglement characteristics . at last , \n we draw some brief conclusions in sec . vi . \n we consider an ensemble of independent four - level atoms inside a resonant optical cavity . the proposed experimental setup for this scheme is shown in fig . 1(a ) . \n a vapor cell containing a four - level atomic system is placed inside a fabry perot cavity , using lasers whose frequency are @xmath0 and @xmath1 as pumps , where the virtual energy level diagram of three cascaded fwm effects are shown in fig . \n 1(b ) . those generated six beams are transmitted out through the coupling mirror 2 with partial tramittion coefficient , then being splitted by the prism . \n spatially separated beams can be measured using method as ref . \n @xcite to determine the entanglement relationship .    as shown in fig . \n 1 , the lower levels , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of the atoms are coupled to the excited level @xmath5 by two driving lasers of frequencies @xmath0 , @xmath1 . \n there are three fwm processes which are indicated in fig . \n 1(b ) , that @xmath6 and @xmath7 compose the first fwm process , where @xmath6 implies @xmath0 and @xmath1 stimulated from @xmath2 and @xmath3 to virtual levels , @xmath7 implies @xmath8 and @xmath9 falling from virtual levels to @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively . \n similar are to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n and we suppose all the virtual levels are detuned with @xmath5 .    in present scheme , \n we only concentrate on the entanglement characteristics among optical fields instead of these between atoms and optical fields . \n so the interaction hamiltonian of the three cascaded fwm processes could be written as @xmath14 + \\textup{h.c . } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 ( i=1,2,3 ) are the dimensionless nonlinear coupling coefficients and are commonly taken to be a real number , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are corresponding to the light field generation and annihilation operators repectively .    considering the driving fields in the cavity , \n the hamiltonian for the pump beams is given by @xmath18 + \\textup{h.c . } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 ( i=1,2 ) is the classical pump and coupling laser amplitude . \n the loss of the @xmath20th mode @xcite in the cavity can be written as @xmath21 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 stand for the damping rates for the corresponding cavity modes which are related to the amplitude transmission coefficients . \n we now consider the full physical system , where the four -

state solutions . \n @xmath42    in order to simplify the calculation , the same damping rate and the same classical pumping laser amplitudes in the cavity are assumed ( i.e. , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . \n similarly , the same nonlinear coupling coefficient are assumed ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) . \n threshold can be obtained if @xmath48 . \n the values of the two threshold are expressed as following respecively , @xmath49    when @xmath50 , there is only one set of nonzero solutions for all six modes . if @xmath51 , there will be two sets of nonzero solutions for all six modes . \n when there exists a threshold the analytical expressions of stationary solutions for different values of the pump amplitude are    \\(i ) @xmath52 @xmath53    \\(ii ) @xmath54 @xmath55    \\(iii ) @xmath56 @xmath57    if @xmath58 , there is no threshold in this system . on this condition \n the signal and the idler modes will not be excited no matter how large the pump amplitude is . thus , \n when a threshold does not exist the analytical expressions of the stationary solutions are @xmath59    in the following , we decompose the system variables @xmath60 into their steady - state values @xmath61 and small fluctuations around the steady - state values @xmath62 as @xmath63 \n . then equation ( 5 ) can be linearized as @xmath64 where @xmath65^{t}$ ] ; m , the drift matrix , is given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68    if the requirement that the real part of the eigenvalues stay positive is satisfied , the fluctuation equations will describe an ornstein -

output relations @xcite . in particular , the output fields spectral variances and covariances have the general form @xmath70 similar expressions can be derived for the @xmath71 quadratures . \n in order to investigate multipartite entanglement , and particularly show that the system under consideration demonstrates true six - partite entanglement , we define quadrature operators for each mode as @xmath72 such that @xmath73=2i$ ] . \n the conditions proposed by van loock and furusawa @xcite , which are a generalization of the conditions for bipartite entanglement , are sufficient to demonstrate multipartite entanglement .    using the quadrature definitions , \n the six - partite inequalities are @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the variance and @xmath76 are arbitrary real parameters used to optimize the violation of these inequalities . \n it is important to note that in the uncorrelated limit these optimized vlf criteria approach 4 . \n hence , without optimization , some entanglement which is presented may be missed .    from now on , we numerically calculate the values of vlf inequalities , and these are the quantities that can be measured in experiments . \n note that in our symmetrical situation , inequalities i2-p1 and s2-p2 are equal ; the same are to p1-s1 and i1-p2 . to simplify , we write the subscript s1-i1 as a , p1-s1 and i1-p2 as b , i2-p1 and s2-p2 as c separately .    when below the threshold or without threshold , the powers of the pump are much higher than others and the steady - state values of the other output beams are all equal to zero . \n therefore , the quantum characteristics of the pump and other beams in such situation are not considered .     with + @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . + here @xmath79 and @xmath54 . ]     with + @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . + here @xmath79 and @xmath54 . ]    in fig 2 , we plot the minimum of the inequalities as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath80 with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in this case , @xmath83 so that the two supposed thresholds coincide to be one threshold . \n it is obvious that the minimal values of inequalities are all less than 4 in a wide range of analysis frequencies , which is sufficient to demonstrate that all the six beams are cv entangled with each other . in general , the smaller the value of the inequality , the stronger the degree of entanglement and quantum correlation is . for large frequencies \n the inequalities approaches 4 , which is the result of our optimization . in fig . \n 2 , we can also see that the value of @xmath84 is comparatively smaller than @xmath85 , which indicates that the degree of entanglement of second - class output is bigger . \n it is similar to those situations in the four wave mixing process .    in fig . \n 3 , we plot the minimum of the inequalities as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath80 with @xmath86 and the other parameters remain unchanged . again , the minima of the inequalities are less than 4 when above threshold , and it verifies that the all field modes are entangled .     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ] \n however , we are unable to decide the real entanglement when @xmath56 because of the two possible stationary solutions . because the solution of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) usually depends on the initial value of variables . while the variables of ode here are set initially as gaussian states and randomly generated at each specific situation . \n it should be expected that all those variables will fall into one of the stationary solutions as the time approaches infinity , with a certain distribution of these two stationary solutions . \n therefore , we calculate the minimum of the inequalities beyond the larger threshold @xmath88 using each stationary solution separately .     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]    in the following , we plot the minimum of the inequalities as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath80 using each stationary solution at different @xmath89 , with other parameters unchanged . \n we find an interesting result . as shown in fig . 4 and fig . \n 5 , when @xmath89 is a little bigger than @xmath88 , the stationary solution @xmath90 shows a relatively competitive result , just as results in fig . 2 and fig . \n 3 . the stationary solution @xmath87 does not work effective and the minimum value of @xmath91 is almost near 4 . \n it is because the output beams other than the pump is so lightly occupied if @xmath87 . \n in other words , @xmath61 ( i = s1,i1,s2,i2 ) is close to zero .    on the other hand , in fig . \n 6 and fig . 7 , the situation is reverse . for solution @xmath90 \n , it seems that , as the intensity of the pump power increases , the gain of other beams begins to saturate . \n usually , when the intensity of the pump beams is higher than those of others , their quantum characteristics tend to vanish and the degree of quantum entanglement will be small \n . however the solution @xmath87 is greater at this time , which seems to be more effective in a wide range of @xmath89 .     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]    in fig . 8 and fig . \n 9 , we numerically search the minimum of @xmath92 in all frequencies , as a function of the pump power parameter @xmath89 , also with other parameters unchanged . in these figures \n , we can see clearly that the stationary solution @xmath90 is valid when @xmath89 is small just like the usual cases , see ref . \n @xcite . and \n solution @xmath87 is effective even @xmath89 is tens of times larger than @xmath88 . \n this directly confirms previous idea . \n we hope this can be considered as an effect of optical bistability . \n although we can not confirm the proportion of photons resulting in the stationary solution @xmath87 , it really enlarges the range of @xmath89 to be effective . \n we propose a scheme to produce bright six - partite cv entanglement in an optical cavity operating above threshold in a four - level atomic system , which has been theoretically demonstrated using both vlf criterion of multipartite cv entanglement and the input - output relations . \n this result is experimentally feasible and can have a larger range of pump power to produce an effective multi - partite entanglement ; it is much well - developed , compared with a basic system using the third - order nonlinearity media . \n moreover , the bright six - partite entangled beams could be separated spatially , with narrow linewidths after generation , which have significant use in quantum network and free - space teleportation . \n this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( grants no . \n 601102053 ) , and shanghai jiao tong university prp ( grants no . t030prp19035 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2115851437392, "RequestID": "e9d35cc6cb5286f89b34e7e8ec46fb88385b10f5", "TotalTokens": 3487}
{"ContextTokens": 4075, "GeneratedTokens": 260, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last two decades , discoveries of the kuiper belt @xcite , as well as planets orbiting stars other than the sun @xcite , have supplied the centuries - old quest to understand the formation of the solar system with fresh constraints and insights into physical processes at play . among a multitude of newly proposed formation scenarios , \n the  nice \" model @xcite is particularly notable , as it has attained a considerable amount of success in reproducing the various observed features of the solar system . within the context of the scenario envisioned by the nice model , \n giant planets start their post - nebular evolution in a compact , multi - resonant configuration , and following a brief period of dynamical instability , scatter onto their current orbits @xcite . \n the first success of the nice model lies in its ability to quantitatively reproduce the observed orbits of the giant planets , as well as their dynamical architecture ( i.e. secular eigenmodes of the system ) . \n simultaneously , the brief instability , inherent to the model , provides a natural trigger to the late heavy bombardment @xcite , as well as a transport mechanism for emplacement of dynamically  hot \" kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) from inside of @xmath0au @xcite . \n meanwhile , it has been recently demonstrated that survival of a dynamically  cold \" primordial population between neptune s current 3:2 and 2:1 exterior mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) is fully consistent with a nice model - like evolution of the planets , implying an _ in - situ _ formation of the cold classical population of the kuiper belt @xcite . \n finally , the presence of jupiter s and neptune s trojan asteroids has been attributed to chaotic capture of planetesimals during the instability @xcite . \n all successful realizations of the nice model to date have been comprised exclusively of the four currently present giant planets . \n however , there exists no strong evidence that suggests that additional planets were not present in the solar system , at the epoch of the dispersion of the nebula . \n in fact , theoretical arguments , presented by @xcite point to a possibility of initially forming as many as five ice giants , three of which get subsequently removed via ejections ( see however @xcite ) . \n the dynamical sensibility of such a scenario is further strengthened by the fact that a considerable fraction of standard nice model simulations result in an ejection of an ice - giant after an encounter with at least one of the gas giants .    in this paper \n , we explore an instability - driven dynamical evolution of a 5-planet system ( 2 gas giants + 3 ice giants ) with an eye towards identifying a pathway towards reproduction of solar system - like dynamical architecture . in principle \n , the realm of possibility available to this study is enormous . \n consequently , rather than performing a comprehensive parameter - search , here we limit ourselves to systems that contain an additional uranus - like planet , with the aim of presenting a few proof - of - concept numerical experiments . \n the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 \n , we describe our numerical setup . in section 3 , we show that in our model , the planetary orbits , their secular eigenmodes , as well as various populations of the kuiper belt are approximately reproduced . \n we conclude and discuss our results in section 4 . \n the numerical setup of the simulations performed here was qualitatively similar to those presented by @xcite and @xcite . \n particularly , the five giant planets were initialized in a compact , multi - resonant initial condition , surrounded by a massive planetesimal disk that extended between its immediate stability boundary and @xmath1au . \n two of the three ice - giants were taken to have the same mass as uranus and were initially placed next to saturn and as the outermost planet respectively . \n the middle ice - giant was taken to have neptune s mass . in all simulations , \n jupiter and saturn started out in a 3:2 mmr , in accord with the results of hydrodynamical simulations of convergent migration of the planets in the solar nebula . \n the ice giants were also sequentially assembled into first order mmrs by applying dissipative forces , designed to mimic the presence of the nebula @xcite . \n following resonant locking , each assembled multi - resonant initial condition was evolved in isolation for 10myr , as an immediate test of orbital stability . \n this procedure yielded a total of 81 stable multi - resonant initial conditions . \n the search for adequate dynamical evolutions was performed in two steps . \n first , we evolved 10 permutations of each initial condition , with planetesimal disks composed of @xmath2 planetesimals . \n disk masses were chosen randomly between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n the density profiles followed a power - law distribution , @xmath5 where the power - law index , @xmath6 , was chosen randomly between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n the planetesimals were initialized on near - circular orbits ( @xmath9 ) . to reduce the already substantial computational cost , self - gravity of the planetesimal swarm was neglected . \n subsequently , we eliminated all initial conditions that did not yield any final systems that were comprised of 4 planets , reducing the number of viable initial conditions to 25 . \n then , an additional 30 permutations of these initial conditions were integrated with disks composed of @xmath10 planetesimals ( but otherwise identical to those described above ) . \n each integration was performed using the _ mercury6 _ integration software package @xcite and spanned 50myr . \n the calculations were performed on caltech s _ pangu _ super - computer . \n after their completion , simulations that were deemed successful were reintegrated with the use of tracer simulations ( see @xcite ) , to address the dynamical evolution of a locally formed population of kbos . in particular , each run was supplemented with an additional disk of mass - less particles that resided in the cold classical region of the kuiper belt ( i.e. between the final exterior 3:2 and 2:1 mmrs of neptune ) . \n out of the 810 integrations that were initially performed , 214 ( @xmath11 ) cases featured an ejection of a single ice - giant , yielding a system composed of 4 planets . \n perhaps unsurprisingly , in most cases the ejected planet is the ice - giant that neighbors saturn . of the 750 simulations that were performed following the elimination of initial conditions \n , 33 evolutions resulted in orbits reminiscent of the solar system . \n specifically , we searched for solutions where the saturn - jupiter period ratio exceed @xmath12 , while the final semi - major axes of the ice - giants were within @xmath13au of their observed counterparts . \n no strong requirements were placed on the planetary eccentricities and inclinations . \n it is noteworthy that evolving the giant planets onto solar system - like orbits is insufficient for a simulation to be deemed successful for indeed , there are additional constraints that must be satisfied . \n the first orbital constraint is the reproduction of the secular architecture of the system . \n the secular orbital angular momentum exchange ( i.e. eccentricity evolution ) of a planetary system containing @xmath14 secondaries can be approximately represented as a superposition of @xmath14 eigenmodes , each corresponding to a fundamental frequency of the system ( see ) . \n physically , the maximum eccentricity that a given planet attains in its secular cycle is equal to the sum of all of its corresponding eigenmode amplitudes . in the context of the traditional nice model \n , some difficulty has been noted in correctly reproducing the dynamical character of jupiter s and saturn s eccentricity evolution . \n particularly , it has been shown that smooth passage of jupiter and saturn through the 2:1 mmr has a tendency to under - excite the @xmath15 eccentricity eigenmode as well as their mutual inclinations . \n this difficulty can be overcome sometimes by invoking a close - encounter between an ice - giant and the gas giants . \n consequently , we have checked , using fourier analysis ( see for example ) , the relative strength of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 eigenmodes in all simulations whose orbital end - state resembled the solar system . \n we did not restrict the success criteria of our simulations to include the correct reproduction of the mean eccentricities of the planets and in some cases , the mean final eccentricities ( namely those of the ice - giants ) exceeded their observed counter - parts by as much as a factor of @xmath17 . \n this is , however , likely an artifact of the coarse representation of the planetesimal disk and the resulting dynamical friction , that we employed in our calculations and should not be viewed as a major drawback .    in total \n , we found ten cases ( corresponding to eight different initial conditions ) where their amplitudes are satisfactorily reproduced . \n specifically , in these ten cases , the amplitude of jupiter s @xmath15 eigenmode exceeds that of the @xmath16 eigenmode , while the amplitudes are roughly the same for saturn \n . we made no attempt at quantitatively matching the pair s inclination eigenmodes , however their reproduction does not appear to be problematic . \n we also examined the amplitudes of the secular eigenmodes of uranus and neptune . \n generally it appears that the dynamical architecture of the ice - giants is set in an essentially random manner , depending on the particular encounter history . \n consequently , we decided to not use ice - giant secular architecture as a distinctive property in our analysis . \n successful formation of the kuiper belt is another important constraint of the nice model . @xcite \n have shown that the excited populations of the kuiper belt are naturally emplaced from inside of @xmath0au during the instability . given that this aspect of the planetary evolution is not particularly different between the 4-planet and the 5-planet scenarios , there is little reason to speculate that the dynamical pathway for formation of the resonant , scattered , and hot classical populations of the kuiper belt will be inhibited . \n the same is likely to be true for chaotic capture of trojan asteroids . \n the cold classical population of the kuiper belt , however , is a different story . \n a series of observational dissimilarities between the cold classical population and the rest of the kuiper belt ( e.g. uniquely red colors ; strongly enhanced wide binary fraction @xcite ) suggest that the cold classicals formed in situ , and maintained dynamical coherence despite neptune s temporary acquisition of high eccentricity and inclination ( a characteristic orbital feature of the cold classical population is inclination that does not exceed @xmath18 @xcite ) . in a recent study \n , @xcite showed that local formation of the cold classicals is fully consistent with an instability - driven evolution of the planets , given favorable conditions during the instability . \n particularly , @xcite required the apsidal precession and nodal recession rates of neptune to be comparatively fast to prevent secular excitation of the cold classical orbits , in addition to a sufficiently small apohelion distance of neptune , to avoid orbital excitation due to close encounters .        in a 5-planet scenario , \n the retention of unexcited orbits of the cold population can be jeopardized by the ejecting planet . \n this possibility served as a premise for recalculation of the dynamical evolution of test particles in the cold classical region , with the aid of tracer simulations . \n we found that in only three of the ten simulations where the secular eigenmodes were successfully reproduced , a primordial cold classical population of the kuiper belt also retained unexcited orbits . \n consequently , it appears that the retention of an unexcited cold belt is not the norm of the 5-planet scenario . \n this is not surprising , since dynamical excitation can only be avoided if ejection and close encounter timescales are sufficiently short . from a quantitative point of view , \n our simulations imply that dynamically cold orbits can only be sustained if the ejecting ice - giant spends @xmath19 years or less crossing the classical kuiper belt region . as a result \n , we can expect that the incorporation of yet additional ice - giants into the primordial solar system ( as suggested by @xcite ) will further diminish the chances of reproducing the cold classical kuiper belt , since all ejecting planets would have to do so very rapidly . \n two of the three successful simulations discussed above are presented in figures ( 1 - 3 ) . \n specifically , figure ( 1 ) shows the orbital evolutions of the runs , while figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) show the eccentricity and inclination distributions of planetesimals in the kuiper belt region respectively . \n the red and blue dots , shown in figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) depict the orbital distribution of emplaced and local planetesimal populations respectively at @xmath20myr . \n the red and blue triangles depict the planetesimals whose orbits remain stable at @xmath21myr . \n the starting multi - resonant initial condition of the simulation presented in panels ( a ) of the figures is one where saturn and the first ice - giant are locked in a 2:1 mmr , while both pairs of ice - giants are locked in 5:4 mmrs . \n the planetesimal disk in this simulation was comprised of @xmath10 particles and contained a total of 26@xmath22 . in this evolution , \n the local population of test particles suffers numerous short close encounters with the ejecting ice giant , yielding a more excited and depleted cold classical population , compared to that of run ( b ) . \n note also that at @xmath23myr , the ice - giant eccentricities are considerably greater than that of uranus and neptune . \n these high eccentricities do not get damped away by dynamical friction in the following 500myr of dormant evolution . \n consequently , in this simulation , the inner edge of the cold belt gets dynamically depleted over the following 500myr . \n it is furthermore noteworthy that another simulation that originated from the same initial condition reproduced the eigenmodes of the system correctly , although the primordial cold kuiper belt in this integration was entirely destroyed by close encounters . \n the starting multi - resonant initial condition of the simulation presented in panels ( b ) of the figures is one where saturn and the first ice - giant are locked in a 3:2 mmr , the inner pair of ice - giants is locked in a 2:1 mmr , and the outer pair of the ice - giants is locked in a 4:3 mmr . in this simulation , \n the disk consisted of @xmath2 particles and had a cumulative mass of @xmath24 . \n incidentally , the frequency spectrum of the eccentricity vectors of jupiter and saturn produced in this simulation , matches that of the real jupiter and saturn exceptionally well , signaling a nearly ideal reproduction of the secular eigenmodes . \n particularly , the simulation yields ( in the notation of @xcite ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 where as the solar system is characterized by @xmath27 and @xmath28 . \n the scaling of the eigen - vectors are also well reproduced : @xmath29 while the solar system has @xmath30 . in this simulation , \n the cold kuiper belt suffers only a single short encounter with the escaping ice - giant , allowing for the orbits ( inclinations in particular ) to remain dynamically cold . \n in this paper , we have presented a successful realization of the nice model which starts out with 5 planets . \n the numerical experiments presented here explicitly show that such an evolution is plausible since the resulting 4-planet systems can closely resemble the solar system . \n particularly , in both simulations presented here , the secular architecture of the outer solar system is well reproduced . \n furthermore the demonstrated survival of a local , primordial cold classical kuiper belt suggests that all constraints that can be matched with a 4-planet model can also be matched with a 5-planet model to an equal degree of satisfaction . \n it is noteworthy that ejection was not always necessary in our simulations to generate a 4 planet system . in a handful of runs ( \n one of which successfully reproduced the secular eigenmodes , but not the cold kuiper belt ) , one of the ice - giants ended up merging with saturn . in principle , such a scenario may help explain saturn s enhanced metallicity in comparison with jupiter . \n although , here again the explanation is not unique ( see and the references therein ) .    in a traditional realization of the nice model , \n the rate of successful reproduction of the secular eigenmodes is rather low i.e. @xmath31 of the integrations for a favorable initial condition @xcite . \n this is in part because an ice - giant / gas giant encounter often leads to an ejection of the ice - giant , leaving behind only three planets . \n thus , the need for an ice - giant / gas - giant encounter in the orbital history of the solar system is in itself motivation for a 5-planet model \n .    the statistics of simulations presented in this work suggest that a 5-planet model is neither more nor less advantageous . \n recall that the probability of ending up with only 4 planets is @xmath32 . \n the probability of reproducing the secular eigenmodes of jupiter and saturn is @xmath33 . \n naively , this yields an overall probability of success of only @xmath34 . \n however , it is important to keep in mind that the characteristic outcomes are generally dependent on initial conditions and runs that originated from the initial condition presented in panels ( a ) correctly reproduced the secular eigenmodes in 2 out of 30 simulations . \n this statistic is similar to the 4-planet model . \n finally , the @xmath35 probability of also retaining an unexcited cold classical kuiper belt puts the 5-planet model and the 4-planet model on equal footing in terms of success rate @xcite . \n that said , it is important to note that this success rate is only characteristic of the particular 5-planet model that we have constructed . \n in other words , it is likely that if one allows the mass of the ejected planet to also be a variable parameter , tuning of the initial state may in principle lead to a more frequent reproduction of the solar system . \n the results presented in this work imply that the solar system is one of many possible outcomes of dynamical evolution , and can originate from many possible initial conditions . as a result , \n the possibility of having an extra planet initially present in the system , yet its ejection leaving no observable signature erases any hope for construction of a deterministic model for solar system evolution . \n the forward process - like nature of the nice model is not surprising , given that the solar system exhibits large - scale chaos , characterized by lypunov times that are comparable to orbital timescales , during the instability . \n moreover , the similarity between the orbital architectures of simulations whose outcomes were deemed unsuccessful in this work and those of extra - solar planetary systems further confirms that planet - planet scattering is likely to be the physical process responsible for shaping the orbital distribution of planets @xcite . \n consequently , we conclude that an instability - driven dynamical history remains a sensible choice as a baseline scenario for solar system s early dynamical evolution . + \n * acknowledgments * we thank alessandro morbidelli , hal levison , david nesvorny and peter goldreich for useful conversations . \n we thank naveed near -

[ sec : ligo_cavs ] was simulated with this limited map , resulting in 815ppm impurity in the circulating beam . \n this is a very good improvement on the original impurity of 0.114 , illustrating that a high beam purity is achievable with these mirror requirements . to achieve an even higher beam purity \n will involve reducing the amplitudes of these polynomials further , as well as additional zernike requirements . \n we have investigated the coupling which occurs when laguerre - gauss modes are incident on a mirror with surface distortions . \n taking an analytical approach we used zernike polynomials to represent mirror surface distortions and derived an approximate equation for the significant coupling when an lg mode is reflected from a surface defined by a particular zernike polynomial . \n this derivation resulted in a condition for significant coupling , @xmath19 , where @xmath8 is the azimuthal index of the zernike polynomial and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the azimuthal indices of the incident and coupled modes respectively . \n this is a significant result as it allows us to predict which order 9 modes will be largely coupled by particular zernike polynomials and suggest which modes will have large amplitudes in the arm cavities    we investigated the performance of lg@xmath0 in high finesse cavities by simulation with advanced ligo mirror maps . \n this illustrated the degraded purity of the circulating beam in realistic cavities due to higher order mode degeneracy . \n the results were then analysed by looking at the zernike polynomials representing our example mirror map . \n the analysis and results were consistent with the predictions made from eq . \n [ eq : k_eq ] . \n this suggested that astigmatism was causing a significant amount of coupling , particularly into the lg@xmath22 and lg@xmath23 modes . \n this was confirmed when the cavity was simulated again with the astigmatism removed from the mirror map and we observed a dramatic increase in the lg@xmath0 mode purity . \n the analytical description enabled us to identify the specific zernike polynomials which cause large couplings as well as the lg modes which would dominate as a result . using this \n we were able to derive certain requirements for our example mirror map , etm08 , in terms of limits on the amplitudes of the zernike polynomials z@xmath24 , z@xmath25 and z@xmath26 ( table  [ table : limits ] ) . using this map \n the resulting circulating beam impurity was found to be 815ppm , a significant reduction from the original impurity of 0.114 . \n this investigation has demonstrated that a high beam purity is achievable using an lg@xmath0 beam when modifications are made to the low order zernike polynomials in advanced ligo mirrors . implementing the lg@xmath0 beam in gravitational wave detectors \n will be challenging as we require very small amplitudes on these lower order polynomials . \n we should also consider that the example mirror surfaces considered here refer to uncoated substrates . \n the coating process is likely to add to the lower order features in the mirror surfaces . \n however , using this analytical approach we can derive specific requirements for the mirror surfaces leading to designs for suitable mirrors for these higher order beams . \n we would like to thank garilynn billingsley for providing the advanced ligo mirror surface maps and for advice and support on using them . \n we would also like to thank david shoemaker and stefan hild for useful discussions . \n this work has been supported by the science and technology facilities council and the european commission ( fp7 grant agreement 211743 ) . \n this document has been assigned the ligo laboratory document number ligo  p1100081 . \n the product of two laguerre - gauss modes is : @xmath27 the following derivation follows from eq . \n [ eq : m_condition ] . \n currently we are concerned with the magnitude of the coupling coefficients , so we ignore any constant phase shifts and integrate with respect to @xmath12 : @xmath28 in order to further simplify the equation the following variable substitution is made : @xmath29 and a new limit to the integral : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the zernike radius . \n this gives the integral : @xmath32 substituting in the sums representing the laguerre polynomials and the radial zernike function as a function of @xmath33 gives : @xmath34 this type of integral results in the lower incomplete gamma function : @xmath35 when @xmath36 is equal to @xmath7 , an integer , the function is given by the following sum : @xmath37 therefore , the final equation for this approximation of the magnitude of the coupling coefficients is given by : @xmath38 \n clipping loss is given by : @xmath39 where the integral represents the normalised power reflected by a perfect mirror . \n @xmath40 defines an infinite plane perpendicular to the beam axis . \n the magnitude squared of an lg mode is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the beam radius , @xmath43 and @xmath20 are the mode indices and @xmath4 is the radial position . integrating over the surface and taking a similar approach as for the coupling coefficients \n we get : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath31 is the radius of the mirror and @xmath46 is the lower incomplete gamma function . \n for certain zernike polynomials ( those with non - zero @xmath8 ) their amplitudes in a surface depend on the orientation of that surface with respect to the zernike surface . \n for example , consider the two polynomials responsible for astigmatism , z@xmath47 . \n the two polynomials actually describe the same shape , with one just rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other . therefore , rotating a surface , such as the one described by mirror map etm08 , will change the amplitudes of these two polynomials within the surface . fig . \n [ fig : etm08_zs_rotated ] illustrates this effect . \n the plots show the amplitudes of the order 2 zernike polynomials present in the etm08 mirror surface as it is rotated . \n as expected the amplitude of the z@xmath48 polynomial remains constant as it has no angular dependence . \n the amplitudes of the z@xmath47 polynomials oscillate and , at a certain rotation ( around 120@xmath49 ) the astigmatism of the surface is completely described by z@xmath50 , and 90@xmath49 later completely described by z@xmath51 . \n the root mean squared amplitude ( @xmath52 ) of the polynomials remains constant . \n we have used zernike polynomials to describe mirror surface distortions and analyse the coupling that occurs from lg@xmath0 into other order 9 modes . \n this approach appears to be very suitable as we have been able to identify specific polynomials which extract significant amounts of power from the input mode . \n however , there is an alternative method used to investigate mirror surface distortions , which involves looking at the spatial frequencies present in real mirrors . in this section \n we compare these two methods . \n to look at the spatial frequencies present in realistic mirrors we perform a 2d fourier transform of the surface height data . \n the resulting spectra is then analysed and synthetic maps are created with the same spatial frequencies . \n this method focuses on identifying particular spatial wavelengths which cause a large degree of coupling from lg@xmath0 . \n many synthetic maps are created and used in simulations of gravitational wave detectors . a statistical approach \n is then taken to determine the extent of the coupling when specific spatial frequencies are present in the mirror .    in the zernike approach \n we look at the different polynomials present in mirror surface distortions . \n this can be thought of as equivalent to looking at the spectra of the mirror surfaces as the different polynomials represent different spatial frequencies . \n the plot in fig . \n [ fig : map_spectra ] illustrates this . \n the spectrum of the etm08 advanced ligo mirror map is shown , along with the spectra of maps made up from the zernike polynomials present in the etm08 mirror . \n each of the zernike maps recreates the ligo map with polynomials up to a certain order . \n the plots show that as the order of zernike polynomials present increases the higher spatial frequencies are represented in the mirror map . \n this is because these higher order polynomials represent the higher order spatial frequencies . \n looking at the spatial frequencies present in the zernike polynomials we found that the frequencies depended on the order , @xmath7 . \n a consequence of this is that if we just consider the spatial frequencies present in the mirror maps we will not be able to distinguish between polynomials with different @xmath8 . as we have seen , the azimuthal index is very significant as it determines which modes are largely coupled from lg@xmath0 . therefore looking at the spatial frequencies does nt identify the important shapes in the mirror surfaces . \n the zernike approach would seem to be the most suitable as this allows us to identify the interesting polynomials and modes .                                ` \n zernike polynomials and their use in describing the wavefront aberrations of the human eye ' ( stanford university , 2003 ) http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/2003/psych221/projects/03/pmaeda/index.html", "StartTimeOffset": 2130776779050, "RequestID": "454eea6790668103d56b6dbfb98b4b8dfacf8425", "TotalTokens": 3318}

{"ContextTokens": 4002, "GeneratedTokens": 263, "SynthesizedBody": "after decades of theoretical and observational studies of cool giant and supergiant stars , the mechanisms by which the wind acceleration occurs are still poorly understood . \n compared to the sun , these stars are known to present continuous mass loss process occuring at high rates , typically @xmath0 \n m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 , but in low velocity winds ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 ) ( dupree 1986 , lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) . \n radiative pressure on grains transfers momentum to these particles being responsible for their acceleration and , if gas and dust are dynamically well coupled , grains drag the gas outwards resulting in the mass ejection . \n however , for stationary envelopes ( @xmath4 pre - agb phase ) dust driven theoretical models have lately failed in reproducing the wind properties , mainly because the dust - gas coupling is not effective ( sandin & hofner 2003 ) . \n observationally , guandalini @xmath5 @xmath6 ( 2005 ) found no strong correlation between the mass loss rates and the luminosities of agb stars . \n their main conclusion is that , if radiative pressure is important in powering these stellar winds , it must occur in addition to other mechanism . \n another drawback to the radiation pressure models is the need for the dust formation region to be close to the star . \n recent high resolution doppler measurements show that winds are mainly accelerated near the stellar surface ( @xmath7 ) ( airapetian , carpenter & ofman 2003 ) , while grains are expected to grow and survive at even larger distances .    in this sense \n , another mechanism must be used to accelerate the gas near surface . \n the most promising mechanism for the winds of cool stars is the transference of momentum and energy to the wind from mhd waves . \n hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) showed that it would be possible to reproduce the observed low wind velocities and the high mass loss rates of the cool giant and supergiant stars if some kind of wave damping mechanism is effective at the wind basis ( @xmath8 r@xmath9 ) . \n jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989 ) studied the effects of different damping mechanisms and magnetic field divergence and they showed that the magnetic field divergent geometry can rapidly dilute the wave flux and also slow down the wind . their magnetic field geometry was based on empirical relations found from observations of the solar wind . \n this because in general , in lack of direct measurements of the magnetic field fluctuations and structure in other stars , we have to simply extrapolate our knowledge from solar observations .    in this work , \n we model the acceleration and heating of a late - type supergiant stellar wind considering an outwarded flux of alfvn waves . \n we solve the mhd equations to , self - consistently , determine the magnetic field geometry and the wind temperature and velocity profiles . in section 2 \n , we describe the model basic equations . in section 3 \n we present the results and the discussions , followed , by the work conclusions . \n the basic wind equations are based on mass , momentum , energy and magnetic flux conservation . \n the first is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the flow velocity , @xmath12 is the gas density and @xmath13 is the flow cross - section area at a distance @xmath14 from the center of the star . \n the index \n @xmath15 \" indicates the variable is being evaluated at the stellar surface .    assuming a steady flow , the momentum equation can be written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the thermal pressure , @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 is the gas temperature \n , @xmath20 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath21 the gravitational constant and @xmath22 the wave magnetic field amplitude . in equation ( [ momentum ] ) , the right hand side contains the gravitational force density and the thermal and wave pressure gradients , respectively . \n the last term represent the magnetic force . the wave amplitude ( @xmath22 ) is related to the wave energy density ( @xmath23 ) by @xmath24 .      typically , \n considering magnetic field strengths @xmath25 g , the wind basis is characterized by the relation @xmath26 , @xmath27 the plasma is magnetically dominated . in this case , if we assume the wind to be initiated at funnels anchored at the stellar surface , which are surrounded by a plasma with lower magnetic field strength , the magnetic pressure inside will push the gas and the funnel field lines will expand . \n the funnel cross - section radius ( @xmath28 ) will grow super - radially up to a limit value ( @xmath29 ) . \n this limiting cross - section radius depends both on the relation between external and internal magnetic field strengths and on the filling factor ( @xmath30 ) . \n as the area increases , the internal magnetic strength diminishes until the equilibrium between internal and external magnetic pressures is reached . if the internal magnetic field strength is much larger than the external , the flux tubes cross - section will depend on the filling factor only . \n the filling factor is the ratio between the area of the stellar surface covered by funnels and the total area . \n the averaged maximum area that a funnel could reach would be @xmath31 or , in terms of the cross - section radius : @xmath32 . \n for the quiet sun , the funnels that merge to form the coronal holes cover about 10% of the total surface .    in this work , at the wind basis , \n we assume the plasma to be magnetically dominated and the left hand side of equation ( [ momentum ] ) may be neglected if compared to the other terms . \n then , by using @xmath33 and a power series expansion method proposed by pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) , we can determine self - consistently the magnetic field geometry without assuming any empirical function for the funnel cross - section with distance . \n following pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) , using the thin fluxtube approximation , equation ( [ momentum ] ) and @xmath33 are described near stellar surface , which in our model occurs up to @xmath34 , by : @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scale height . \n the thin fluxtube approximation is reliable when the cross - section radius @xmath28 is negligible compared to both the scale height of the external medium and any variation scales along the tube ( spruit 1981 ; longcope and klapper 1997 ) .    expanding all variables as power series in @xmath39 ( @xmath27 along the tube radius ) , and neglecting terms of orders higher than 2 , equations ( [ a ] ) @xmath40 ( [ c ] ) give rise to a differential equation for the fluxtube cross -

radial ( @xmath47 ) at the wind basis up to the merging radius when @xmath46 becomes 2 . \n @xmath46 is determined from equation ( [ d ] ) .      in a consistent model , to avoid assuming any empirical function for the magnetic field geometry and to determine the wind temperature at each wind position ( @xmath14 ) , we have to solve the energy equation , which is determined from the balance between wave heating and the adiabatic expansion and radiative coolings ( hartmann , edwards & avrett 1982 ) . \n thus , neglecting conduction , we write the energy equation as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the wave heating rate , @xmath27 the rate at which the gas is being heated due to dissipation of wave energy , and @xmath50 is the radiative cooling rate , both in erg  @xmath51  s@xmath2 . \n the wave heating can be written as @xmath52 and the radiative cooling is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron density , @xmath55 is the hydrogen density and @xmath56 is the radiative loss function . here , we adopt the @xmath56 function given by schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1993 ) and calculate @xmath54 with the modified saha equation given by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) .    the wave energy density at each step may be calculated using a wkb approximation , from the wave action conservation . \n this approximation can often be employed when the properties of the medium vary slowly on a scale comparable to the wavelength ( usmanov _ et al . \n _ 2000 ) . under this assumption , \n the wave energy density is dissipated as follows : @xmath57 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the alfvn - mach number , @xmath59 the alfvn speed and @xmath60 the wave damping length . \n also , the wave flux ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath62 is evaluated by @xmath63 . \n we consider the non - linear damping mechanism , which length is given by ( jatenco - pereira & opher 1989 ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the averaged squared perturbation velocity amplitude and @xmath66 is the damping length at the wind basis , which is mainly dependent on the assumed wave frequency spectrum ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) . here \n , we will let it as a free parameter . \n the equations presented here fully describe the wind parameters and the magnetic field geometry under the given assumptions . in the next section \n , we show the main results by applying these equations in a typical cool supergiant star and compare them with previous works . \n for the last decades , the validity of a wind model was limited to simply reproduce the terminal velocity and the mass - loss rate of a given star . as a consequence \n , a number of accelerating mechanisms were found in accordance to observations . \n however , with the appearance of high resolution observations from more sensitive intruments , in the near future , the radial profiles of the wind parameters will become measurable and will be decisive on the choice of the wind model .    here , we obtained the wind paramenter profiles applying the described model on a cool supergiant star with @xmath67 = 16 m@xmath68 , @xmath69 r@xmath68 , @xmath70 g @xmath51 , @xmath71 g and @xmath72 k , as used by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) in their model star 4 . \n we also assumed a filling factor @xmath73 , according to solar observations . \n for these stars , observational data reveal typical mass - loss rates of @xmath74 m@xmath68 yr@xmath2 and terminal velocities of @xmath75 km s@xmath2 . \n unfortunately , the available data are limited in spatial resolution for most of the stars , and it is not possible to fit the complete radial profiles . \n ( dashed line ) and that determined self - consistently in our model ( solid line ) . ]    assuming a surface magnetic field strength @xmath71 g , an alfvn waves flux of @xmath76 erg @xmath77 s@xmath2 at the wind basis and a low damped wave flux ( @xmath78 r@xmath79 ) , both the wind terminal velocity and the mass loss rate obtained were consistent with the observations . \n this value corresponds to a wave amplitude of @xmath80 , which is very plausible for a turbulent medium as that at the stellar surface ( suzuki & inutsuka 2005 ) . \n the velocity and temperature profiles for this case are shown in figure [ fig ] . \n the velocity profile reveals a peak of @xmath81 km s@xmath2 at @xmath82 r@xmath79 , and slightly decreases for larger distances until reaching the observed value . \n the temperature profile presents an initial negative gradient reaching temperatures @xmath83 k in a narrow region . also , near @xmath84 r@xmath79 the temperature reaches the maximum value of @xmath85 k. for @xmath86 r@xmath79 , where the wave heating and the radiative losses are low , the temperature decreases due to the adiabatic expansion . \n we propose a self - consistent wind model to determine the parameters profiles for a supergiant late - type star . to determine the magnetic field geometry we used an expansion method over the wind physical parameters as proposed by pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) . near surface , \n the magnetic pressure inside the flux tubes are higher than that of the surrounding medium , forcing the field lines to curve . \n we found an initial super - radial expansion factor @xmath87 at the wind basis , much higher than the value used by previous authors ( e.g. jatenco - pereira & opher 1989 , bravo & stewart 1997 , dobrzycka _ et al . \n _ 1999 ) that included empirical relations to account for the magnetic field geometry based on solar observations .    considering a supergiant late - type star \n , we obtained the wind velocity and temperature profiles . \n typically , alfvn waves driven winds result in high velocity winds ( @xmath81 km s@xmath2 ) , unless some strong wave damping mechanism takes place at the wind basis . \n we showed that this conclusion is correct in the case of low divergent magnetic field structures . in this work , \n the strong divergence is responsible for a rapid wave spatial dilution near surface , resulting in a lower wind velocity even for low damped waves . \n the obtained results were consistent to the typical mass - loss rate ( @xmath74 m@xmath68 yr@xmath2 ) and the terminal velocity ( @xmath75 km s@xmath2 ) observed for these objects . \n the velocity profile reveals an efficient acceleration at @xmath88 , reaching the maximum value @xmath89 km s@xmath2 . in this region \n the wind is mainly accelerated by the wave energy density and the thermal pressure gradients . \n afterwards , the absence of the wave acceleration and the cooling gas result in a decrease of the velocity to the observed values . \n for the temperature , assuming a weakly damped wave flux , the radiative losses and the expansion cooling are dominant near surface , and the temperature gradient is initially negative . \n the temperature falls to @xmath90 k in a sharp region and then , as density decreases as the wind accelerates and the flux tube expands , it increases up to @xmath91 k at @xmath82 r@xmath79 . for higher distances , \n where the radiative losses are low and the wave heating is no longer effective , the temperature decreases mainly due to the adiabatic expansion . \n although the present calculations provided a new and interesting picture of the physical processes involving the heating and the acceleration mechanisms of cool stellar winds , the model presents a limitation . \n the wind equations were solved considering the thin fluxtube approximation . mainly for a high divergence wind , a complete 2-d set of equations \n must be employed in order to obtain more precise results . \n this step should be concluded in the near future . \n a. a. vidotto and d. falceta -

neighbor spacing distributions for an @xmath20 lattice at @xmath21 ( confined phase ) and at @xmath22 ( coulomb phase ) , averaged over 20 independent configurations , are depicted in fig . \n both are well described by the chue of rmt . \n no signs for a transition to poisson regularity are found . \n the deconfinement phase transition does not seem to coincide with a transition in the spacing distribution . \n for very large values of @xmath6 far into the deconfinement region , the eigenvalues start to approach the degenerate eigenvalues of the free theory , given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lattice constant , @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites in the @xmath26-direction , and @xmath27 . in this case \n , the spacing distribution is neither wigner nor poisson . \n it is possible to lift the degeneracies of the free eigenvalues using an asymmetric lattice where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , etc . \n are relative primes and , for large lattices , the distribution is then poisson , @xmath2 , see fig . \n we have continued our investigations with a study of the distribution of the small eigenvalues in the whole phase diagram . \n the banks - casher formula @xcite relates the dirac eigenvalue density @xmath30 at @xmath31 to the chiral condensate , @xmath32 . the microscopic spectral density , @xmath33 should be given by the appropriate prediction of rmt  @xcite , which also generates the leutwyler - smilga sum rules  @xcite . \n we present results in fig . \n [ fig4 ] for su(3 ) theory and the staggered dirac operator on a @xmath34 lattice from 5000 configurations for @xmath35 and 3000 configurations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 around the critical temperature @xmath38 . in the confinement phase , both the microscopic spectral density @xmath39 and \n the distribution @xmath40 of the smallest eigenvalue agree with the rmt predictions of the chue for topological charge @xmath41 @xcite . \n our analog presentation for u(1 ) theory is from 10000 configurations on a @xmath34 lattice around the critical coupling . in the left plot of fig . \n [ fig5 ] a comparison with rmt for the microscopic spectral density @xmath42 yields again quite satisfactory agreement in the confinement . \n the analytical rmt result for the ( quenched ) chue and @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath44/2 $ ] , where @xmath45 denotes the bessel function . \n the chiral condensate @xmath46 can be obtained by extrapolating the histogram for @xmath30 to @xmath31 and using the banks - casher relation  @xcite . \n the right plot in fig . \n [ fig5 ] exhibits the distribution @xmath47 of the smallest eigenvalue , being in the chirally broken phase in accordance with the prediction of the ( quenched ) chue of rmt for topological charge @xmath43 , @xmath48 . \n the quasi - zero modes which are responsible for the chiral condensate @xmath49 build up when we cross from the deconfinement into the confined phase \n . figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] demonstrate that both @xmath30 and @xmath50 plotted with varying @xmath6 on identical scales , respectively , can serve as an indicator for the phase transition .    in fig . \n [ fig6 ] we turn to a discussion of the spectrum in the quark - gluon plasma and coulomb phase . from rmt a functional form of @xmath51 \n is expected at the onset of the eigenvalue density  @xcite . \n a fit to the data in the regime up to @xmath52 yields @xmath53 for the non - abelian and @xmath54 for the abelian theory , in agreement with recent studies  @xcite . \n this suggests that both theories correspond to universality class @xmath55 . for this class \n a microscopic level density involving the airy function can be deduced from rmt  @xcite . \n a rescaling of our data from the @xmath34 lattice to this functional form is not satisfactory for both theories  @xcite \n . the reason might be ( i ) that the lowest eigenvalue is still influenced by quasi - zero modes from the confinement and ( ii ) that already the first eigenvalues lie above an analogue of the thouless energy . with increasing lattice size these effects should decrease . \n further , we checked that the high - end of the spectrum behaves similar to the low - end and thus deviates from the results of the ordinary ue of rmt  @xcite . \n again the question arises whether larger lattices possess spectral edges closer to the microscopic semi - circle universality . \n the aim of this contribution was to work out two different types of universalities inherent in quantum field theories with a covariant derivative and their interpretation in terms of rmt . \n the first type concerns the bulk of the spectrum of the dirac operator . the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath0 agrees with the rmt result in both the confinement and the deconfinement phase of pure gauge theory and of full qcd , except for extremely large values of @xmath6 where the eigenvalues are known analytically . \n the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of 4d u(1 ) quenched lattice gauge theory is described by the chue of rmt in both the confinement and the coulomb phase . even in the deconfinement phase , \n gauge fields retain a considerable degree of randomness , which apparently gives rise to quantum chaos in these theories .    the second type of universality concerns the low - lying spectra of the dirac operators of both qcd and qed . in all cases considered \n , one finds that in the phase in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken the distribution @xmath47 and the microscopic spectral density @xmath39 are described by chiral rmt . \n when chiral symmetry is restored one has to rely on ordinary rmt with the related space - time symmetries , but one finds for our lattice size only universal behavior of the macroscopic density @xmath30 . \n 99 t. banks and a. casher , nucl . \n b 169 ( 1980 ) 103 . m.a . \n halasz and j.j.m . \n verbaarschot , phys . \n lett .  74 ( 1995 ) 3920 ; m.a . \n halasz , t.  kalkreuter , and j.j.m . \n verbaarschot , nucl . \n .  suppl . ) \n 53 ( 1997 ) 266 . \n o. bohigas , m .- j . \n giannoni , and c. schmit , phys . \n 52 ( 1984 ) 1 . \n bir , n. hrmann , h. markum , and r. pullirsch , nucl . \n b ( proc .  suppl . ) 86 ( 2000 ) 403 . \n verbaarschot , phys . \n lett .  72 ( 1994 ) 2531 . \n d. fox and p.b . \n kahn , phys . \n 134 ( 1964 ) b1151 ; t. nagao and m. wadati , j. phys . \n ( 1991 ) 3298 ; 61 ( 1992 ) 78 ; 61 ( 1992 ) 1910 . \n r. pullirsch , k. rabitsch , t. wettig , and h. markum , phys . \n b 427 ( 1998 ) 119 . m.l . \n mehta , _ random matrices _ \n ( academic press , san diego , 1991 ) . b.a . berg and c. panagiotakopoulos , \n 52 ( 1984 ) 94 . \n berg , h. markum , and r. pullirsch , phys . \n d 59 ( 1999 ) 097504 . e.v . \n shuryak and j.j.m . \n verbaarschot , nucl . phys . a 560 ( 1992 ) 306 ; j.j.m . verbaarschot and i. \n zahed , phys . \n 70 ( 1993 ) 3852 . \n h. leutwyler and a.v . \n smilga , phys . \n d 46 ( 1992 ) 5607 . m. gckeler , h. hehl , p.e.l . \n rakow , a. schfer , and t. wettig , phys . \n d 59 ( 1999 ) 094503 . b.a . \n berg , h. markum , r. pullirsch , and t. wettig , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 4090, "GeneratedTokens": 162, "SynthesizedBody": "the description of the internal structure of the strongly interacting particles is one of the key goals of qcd . at moderate energy scales , \n the hadronic representation supersedes the partonic description , making it challenging to describe the dynamics of scattering processes and hadronic structure . on the other hand \n , it is well known that the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) present a framework for connecting the low and high - energy regimes . \n deep inelastic processes allow us to look with a good resolution inside the hadron and to resolve the very short distances , _ \n i.e. _ small configurations of quarks and gluons . \n the insight into the structure of hadrons is regulated by factorization theorems : the large virtuality of the photon , @xmath2 , involved in dis processes allows for the factorization of their amplitudes into hard ( perturbative ) and soft ( nonperturbative ) contributions . at short distances , one singles out a hard scattering process described through perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . \n the large distance part of the process , _ i.e. _ the pdf , reflects how the quarks and gluons are distributed inside the target . \n so far , we have introduced two different concepts : a first transition from the hadronic to partonic representation is defined by a _ hadronic scale _ of a few hundred mev@xmath3 ( see _ e.g. _ discussion in ref . [ ] ) ; a second scale , namely , the _ factorization scale _ , typically @xmath4 gev@xmath3 , is introduced through the virtuality of the photon . \n although , as we have just explained , the perturbative stage of a hard collision is distinct from the nonperturbative regime characterizing the hadron structure , experimental observations suggest that , in specific kinematical regimes , both the perturbative and nonperturbative stages arise almost ubiquitously , in the sense that the nonperturbative description follows the perturbative one . \n this third concept is known as _ parton - hadron duality _ , and we will here understand it as being yet another manifestation of the perturbative to nonperturbative transition in qcd .      the standard procedure to fix the hadronic ( nonperturbative ) scale pushes perturbative qcd to its limit . \n the hadronic scale turns out to be of a few hundred mev@xmath3 , where the strong coupling constant has already started approaching its landau pole . \n however , the relative stability of the n@xmath6lo evolution is what justifies the perturbative approach . \n an even lower hadronic scale makes sense when considering a freezing of the coupling constant in the infrared region . \n the standard scheme of scale fixing can then be extended to a nonperturbative evolution framework where the effective coupling is free of landau pole , _ \n e.g. _ refs . \n [  ] , while being parameterized with a physical set of parameters  [ ] .    on the other hand , \n the factorization scale fixing procedure is carried out entirely within the domain of pqcd , thus relying on the knowledge of @xmath5 . \n although these two approaches have been considered so far complementary to each other , a unified description might derive through the definition of the effective coupling , as they both broaden the ways of analyzing the freezing of the running coupling constant . \n it is in this direction that the new procedure proposed in refs . \n [ ] broadens the ways of analyzing the freezing of the running coupling constant : t - odd tmds are possible candidates to study the behavior of @xmath5 at intermediate and low @xmath2 , along with the observables proposed in ref . \n [ ] ( polarized dis sum rules ) and in  [ ] ( perturbative evolution of large @xmath1 proton structure functions ) \n .    in this contribution we focus on the analysis of ref . \n [ ] , where the implications of parton - hadron duality are explored in the large @xmath1 region of inclusive electron proton scattering experiments ( bloom  gilman duality  [ ] ) . \n our ultimate goal is to provide a procedure on how to match nonperturbative models to pqcd , using experimental data . \n the relevant kinematical variables are : @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the proton mass and @xmath9 the energy transfer in the lab system ) , the four - momentum transfer , @xmath2 , and the invariant mass for the proton , @xmath10 , and virtual photon , @xmath11 , system , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . for large values of bjorken @xmath14 , and @xmath2 in the multi - gev@xmath3 region , one \n has @xmath15 gev@xmath3 , _ i.e. _ the cross section is dominated by resonance formation . while it is impossible to reconstruct the detailed structure of the proton s resonances , these remarkably follow the pqcd predictions when averaged over @xmath1 . \n although bloom \n gilman duality was observed at the inception of qcd , quantitative analyses could be attempted only more recently , having at disposal the extensive , high precision data from jefferson lab  [ ] . \n pqcd - based studies  [  ] , have been presented that include higher - twist contributions or , more generally , the evidence for nonperturbative inserts , which are required to achieve a fully quantitative fit . \n in addition , nlo pqcd evolution at large @xmath1 can be sensitive to large @xmath1 resummation ( lxr ) effects . \n the consequence of lxr is a shift of the scale at which @xmath5 is calculated to lower values , with increasing @xmath1 ( see for instance refs .  [ ] ) . \n this introduces a model dependence within the pqcd approach in that the value of the qcd running coupling in the infrared region being regulated by lxr ( as we explain below ) simultaneously leads to a suppression of higher - twist effects . \n the higher - twist effects get , in fact , absorbed in the coupling s infrared behavior . \n in section 2 we single out the nonperturbative outcome from a quantitative analysis of the bloom \n gilman parton - hadron duality . \n specifically , we analyze the role of the running coupling constant in the infrared region in tuning the experimental data  [ ] . \n the new approach on the freezing of the running coupling constant and its role on the extraction of tmds from experiment [ ] is summarized in section 3 . in section 4 \n we draw our conclusions . \n bloom  gilman duality implies a one - to - one correspondence between the behavior of the structure function , @xmath16 , for unpolarized electron proton scattering in the resonance region , and in the pqcd regulated scaling region . \n a quantitative definition of duality is accomplished by comparing limited intervals ( integrated in bjorken-@xmath1 over the entire resonance region ) defined according to the experimental data , _ \n e.g. _  [ ] . \n hence , we compare the scaling results as a theoretical counterpart , or an output of pqcd , in the same kinematical intervals , and at the same scale @xmath2 . namely we consider the ratio , @xmath17 we consider duality to be fulfilled if @xmath18 is @xmath19 . \n note that the definition in eq.([dual1 ] ) relies on the fact that the pqcd evaluation , @xmath20 , is very well constrained in the region of interest ( @xmath21 ) despite it does not correspond directly to measured data . \n @xmath22 is an input that once fed into the evolution equations determines the structure functions behavior at much larger @xmath2 . \n however , the error on this type of backward evolution is expected here to be small , being dominated by the valence contribution ( a quantitative analysis of the latter will be carried out in an upcoming study [ ] ) . had we applied the same procedure to low @xmath1 where the singlet and gluon distributions govern @xmath23 , we would have gotten a much larger error at low @xmath2 because of the strong correlation with the value of @xmath5 .    besides perturbative evolution one has to take into account several hadronic corrections to @xmath22 . for instance , if we evolve the structure functions to nlo , we find that duality is violated by a given amount . \n however target mass corrections ( tmcs ) are important here and move the ratio closer to unity . the most important effect for our purposes \n is the effect of lxr , that we develop hereafter . \n large @xmath1 threshold resummation effects ( lxr ) arise formally from terms containing powers of @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the longitudinal variable in the evolution equations , that are present in the wilson coefficient functions @xmath26 . \n below we write schematically how the latter relate the parton distributions to _ e.g. _ the structure function @xmath16 , @xmath27 where we have considered only the non - singlet ( ns ) contribution to @xmath16 since only valence quarks distributions are relevant in our kinematics . \n the logarithmic terms in @xmath26 become very large at large @xmath1 , and they need to be resummed to all orders in @xmath5 . \n resummation was first introduced by linking this issue to the definition of the correct kinematical variable that determines the phase space for the radiation of gluons at large @xmath1 . \n this was found to be @xmath28 , instead of @xmath2  [ ] . as a result , \n the argument of the strong coupling constant becomes @xmath25-dependent : @xmath29  [ ] . in this procedure , however , an ambiguity is introduced , related to the need of continuing the value of @xmath5 for low values of its argument , _ \n i.e. _ for @xmath30  [ ] . \n since the size of this ambiguity is of the same order as the higher - twist corrections , it has been considered , in previous work  [ ] , as a source of theoretical error or higher order effects . \n we propose an accurate analysis  [ ] from which one can extract @xmath5 for values of the scale in the infrared region . \n to do so , we investigate the effect of varying the form of the running coupling on the evolution equations . \n we consider the following choices :    @xmath31 ;    an expansion of @xmath32 in @xmath33 , to nlo , @xmath34    the complete @xmath25 dependence of @xmath32 .    the running of each of the three versions of the coupling constant starts being very different when @xmath35 . \n we illustrate this behavior on fig . \n [ alphas_q ] for @xmath36 . \n the infrared behavior of the coupling constant with argument @xmath2 starts to matter to lower @xmath2 values than for a coupling constant which argument is @xmath37 . on the other hand \n , the corresponding landau poles do not coincide : for small @xmath2 values and large-@xmath25 , the argument of @xmath32 differs from the logarithmic terms taken into account in the nlo expansion . \n the asymptotic value differs for @xmath32 and expansion w.r.t . \n @xmath31 , as shown in the inner frame . \n the meaning of lxr becomes very clear from fig.[alphas_q ] . \n it is now understood that the only free parameter in testing the realization of duality here , is related to @xmath5 . by playing with the argument of the running coupling constant \n , we can tune the scaling structure function and extract the low @xmath2 behavior that determines duality . \n for instance , by setting a maximum value for @xmath25 one would prevent the dglap evolution from including extremely large values of the coupling constant . moreover , this @xmath38 could define a criterion of convergence of the expansion w.r.t the complete @xmath32 , as illustrated in fig . \n [ alphas_z ] . \n this exercice has to be repeated for each experimental data point . \n we observe from our analysis that the maximum value of @xmath25 or , equivalently , the scale in which the running of the coupling is stopped changes from one to another data point . \n a rough qualitative parameterization of the realization fo duality would look like fig .  [ compar ] , where we have use the cornwall s effective charge resulting from a massive gluon propagator  [ ] . in effect \n , the dynamical gluon mass generation leads to the freezing of the qcd running coupling constant . \n the nonperturbative generalization of @xmath31 comes , here , in the form    @xmath39^{-1 } \\quad . \n \\label{alphalog}\\ ] ] the zero gluon mass limit leads to the lo perturbative coupling constant momentum dependence . \n the @xmath40 in the argument of the logarithm @xmath41^{-1 -\\gamma } , \\label{rmass}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , tames the landau pole . \n the mass @xmath40 can be understood as a constituent gluon mass , and depends non - trivially on the momentum transfer @xmath2 . as a consequence @xmath31 freezes at a finite value in the ir  [ ] . \n an analysis of the complete data set collected at jlab in addition to the existing large @xmath1 data will allow us to carry our study to a quantitative level  [ ] . \n three nonperturbative representations of the coupling constant will there be analyzed  [  ] . \n now , trying to match nonperturbative model with pqcd evolution , we examine the consequences on the hadronic scale in considering the same cornwall s effective charge in the evolution of the pdfs , evaluated in hadronic models .    in qcd all matrix elements must have a scale associated to them as a result of the rge of the theory . \n a fundamental step in the development of the use of hadron models for the description of properties at high momentum scales was the assertion that all calculations done in a model should have a rge scale associated to it  [ ] . \n the momentum distribution inside the hadron is only related to the dynamical scale and not to the momentum governing the rge . \n thus a model calculation only gives a boundary condition for the rg evolution as can be seen for example in the lo evolution equation for the moments of the valence quark distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the anomalous dimensions of the ns distributions . for calculations in the bag model , \n the dynamics it describes is unaffected by the evolution procedure , and the model provides only the expectation value , @xmath45 , which is associated with the hadronic scale . when considering the nonperturbative solution of the dyson \n schwinger equations , that results in the appearence of an infrared cut - off , the gluon mass eq . \n ( [ rmass ] ) will only affect the evolution of the pdfs . \n the generalization of the coupling constant results to the structure function imply that the lo evolution eq . \n ( [ moments ] ) simply changes by incorporating the nonperturbative coupling constant evolution eq . \n ( [ alphalog ] ) . in other words , \n the hadronic scale that ensues from the nonperturbative procedure is quantitatively different from the perturbative scheme . \n however , the results from both procedure are close , what give us confidence on the perturbative procedure even at low scales . \n we note however , that the corresponding hadronic scale , for the sets of parameters chosen in fig . \n [ compar ] , turns out to be slightly smaller than in the perturbative case ( @xmath46 gev@xmath47 ) . \n the physical meaning here would be that the nonperturbative approach seems to favor a scenario where at the hadronic scale we have not only valence quarks but also gluons and sea quarks . \n the application of the nonperturbative framework to the evaluation of the t - odd tmds illustrates the uncertainty on model predictions coming only from the matching with rge . in ref . \n [ ] we have considered the errorband resulting from the uncertainty of the initial value of @xmath48 on the bag model evaluation of the sivers and boer - mulders functions . \n this observation shows that the naive scenario may well serve to make predictions , within a reasonably small band , which should not be far from experimental expectations . within this interpretation , \n t - odd tmds are possible candidates to study the behavior of @xmath5 at intermediate and low @xmath2 , though still biased by strong theoretical difficulties such as the tmd evolution  [ ] or ambiguities due to the choice of the hadronic representation . \n a combined analysis of the extractions of the running coupling constant in the infrared region suggests a novel definition of the effective charge  [ ] , following the example of ref . \n [ ] where the effective coupling constants are phenomenologically inferred from different processes , and to calculations based on schwinger  dyson equations . \n this analysis also bears potential important consequences for the connection of low scale / hadronic models with experiments in the multi - gev region . \n we are grateful to j.p . \n chen , a. deur , and v. vento for fruitful discussions . \n j.  m.  cornwall , phys .  rev . \n d * 26 * , 1453 ( 1982 ) . \n a.  c.  aguilar , d.  binosi , j.  papavassiliou and j.  rodriguez - quintero , phys . \n d * 80 * , 085018 ( 2009 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3490, "GeneratedTokens": 247, "SynthesizedBody": "gravothermal oscillations are one of the most interesting phenomena which may arise in the post - collapse evolution of a star cluster . \n the inner regions of a post collapse cluster are approximately isothermal and are subject to a similar instability as the one found in an isothermal sphere in a spherical container , as studied by @xcite and @xcite . \n gravothermal oscillations , which are thought to be a manifestation of this instability , were discovered by @xcite whilst studying the post - collapse evolution of star clusters using a gas model . for a gas model of a one - component cluster \n it was found that gravothermal oscillations first appear when the number of stars @xmath0 is greater than 7000 @xcite . \n this value of @xmath0 has also been found with fokker - planck calculations @xcite and by direct @xmath0-body simulations @xcite . \n however , in a multi - component cluster the situation is more complicated . \n the presence of different mass components introduces different dynamical processes to the system such as mass stratification . \n multi - component systems try to achieve kinetic energy equipartition between the components , which causes the heavier stars to move more slowly and sink towards the centre . \n this can lead to the spitzer instability @xcite in which the heavier stars continuously lose energy to the lighter stars without ever being able to reach equipartition . \n @xcite found that the post - collapse evolution for multi - component models was stable to much higher values of @xmath0 than in the case of the one - component system and that the value of @xmath0 at which gravothermal oscillations appeared varied with different mass functions .    in order to gain a deeper understanding of gravothermal oscillations , it is desirable to work with simpler models in which some of the effects which are present in real star clusters are ignored or simplified . \n for example , real star clusters have a range of stellar masses present , but in the current paper , the stellar masses are limited to two . \n gaseous models are often used in this kind of research @xcite because they are computationally efficient . \n @xcite have already completed research in this area using fokker - planck models . \n however , their research was limited to mostly spitzer stable models and only a small range of stellar mass ratios . \n the study in the present paper looks at the more general spitzer unstable models using various stellar mass and total mass ratios . \n there is also evidence of gravothermal oscillations in real star clusters . \n @xcite modelled the cluster ngc 6397 using monte carlo models and found fluctuation in the core radius . \n their timescale suggests that they are gravothermal . \n subsequently , they confirmed these fluctuations using direct @xmath0-body methods with initial conditions generated from the monte carlo model @xcite . \n two - component clusters may seem very unrealistic but there is reason to believe that they may be a good approximation to multi - component systems . \n @xcite were able to find good approximate matches for half - mass radius @xmath1 , central velocity dispersion @xmath2 , core density @xmath3 and core collapse time @xmath4 between two - component models and eleven - component models which were designed to approximate a power law imf . \n also see @xcite for a discussion of the realism of two - component models . \n this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 \n , we describe the models which are used . \n this is followed by section 3 , in which the results concerning gravothermal oscillations are given . \n section 4 is concerned with the results of the core collapse times . in section 5 , \n the results of @xmath0-body simulations are given . \n finally section 6 consists of the conclusions and a discussion . \n in our model , we ignore primordial binaries and stellar evolution , and assume that the energy generating mechanism is the formation of binary stars in three body encounters and subsequent encounters of binaries with single stars . \n in a one - component model the rate of energy generation per unit mass is approximately @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the stellar mass , @xmath7 is the number density , @xmath8 is the one dimensional velocity dispersion of the core and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant . \n @xcite , whose results on the 1-component model we shall occasionally refer to , used a similar formula , with a coefficient which is , in effect , in the range 140170 ( depending on the value of @xmath0 ) . \n the equations of the two - component gas model @xcite are given below : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 ( m_{3-i } \\sigma^2_{3-i } - m_i \\sigma^2_i )   \\big ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 . \n this model in turn is ultimately inspired by the one - component model of @xcite .    . \n subscript @xmath16 corresponds to the @xmath17 component , @xmath18 refers to the more massive component @xmath19 [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      vs time , where @xmath20 is defined as in nbody6 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath24 . ]    for the case of the runs with @xmath0 equal to @xmath25 and @xmath26 no behaviour was found which could be described as gravothermal oscillation . \n this is in agreement with the gas code , which gave @xmath27 . \n however , the @xmath24 case does show a cycle of expansion and contraction of the core over the time interval @xmath28 to @xmath29 units ( see fig . \n [ nbody32 ] ) . in order to check that the expansion was not driven by sustained binary energy generation \n , we consider the evolution of the relative binding energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total binding energy of the binaries and @xmath32 is the absolute value of the total energy of the cluster , over this time period . \n this is plotted in fig . \n [ nbody32gto ] along with the core radius . \n there are small changes in the binding energy of binaries over this period , decreases as well as increases , but this can not fully account for the expansion phase that is observed , as there are other periods with similar binary activity in which no sustained expansion occurs . \n also , the time scale of the expansion is much longer than the relaxation time in the core ( @xmath33 0.5 in time units ) . \n therefore , we assume that the expansion must be driven by phenomena outside the core , and gravothermal behaviour is a plausible explanation .    several other pieces of evidence point to this conclusion . fig . \n [ nbody32lagr ] shows the density in lagrangian shells of the heavier component . as discussed in section [ sec : doi ] ( e.g. fig . \n [ fig : pc1 ] , top ) the region further away from the core is seen to contract while the core expands . \n also , in the cycle of @xmath34 vs the core velocity dispersion @xmath35 , the temperature is lower during the expansion where heat is absorbed and higher during the collapse where heat is released ( fig . \n [ nbody32gto ] , bottom ) . \n this is similar to the cycles found by @xcite for one - component models and is another sign of gravothermal behaviour . \n the results from the @xmath24 gas run are shown in fig . \n [ gas32gto ] for comparison . \n the @xmath36 run shown in figs . \n [ fig:64k ] and [ fig:64 kb ] has large amplitude oscillations . \n there is a part of the expansion which is shown in fig . [ fig:64 kb ] between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in which the relative binding energy of binaries is nearly constant . \n therefore binary activity can not be what is driving the expansion . \n [ fig:64 kb ] ( bottom ) shows the evolution of the profile of @xmath39 over part of the expansion . \n a negative temperature gradient is visible towards the end of this expansion and this is what is driving the expansion . from the results of the @xmath24 and @xmath36 \n runs it seems that the value of @xmath40 obtained by the gas code is a reasonable indicator of stability for the case in the sense that none of the signs of gravothermal behaviour were found for @xmath41 . \n the main focus of this paper has been on the gravothermal oscillations of two - component systems . \n the critical value of @xmath0 for the onset of instability has been found for a range of stellar mass ratios and total mass ratios using a gas model . \n the case of @xmath22 and @xmath21 was further investigated using the direct code nbody6 . \n the value of @xmath42 obtained from the gas code seems to be a good indicator for stability in runs for this case . \n based on this , it is a reasonable assumption that the other @xmath42 values would give an indication of the stability for direct systems . \n the values of @xmath42 for the two - component model were found to be much higher than for the one - component case and were found to vary with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . however , the value of @xmath45 at the stability limit was found to vary much less than @xmath0 itself . \n this seems to suggest that instability depends on the properties of the heavy component ( see [ sec : lsm ] ) . a possible explanation of this is given in section [ sec : lsm ] . \n the physical manifestation of the oscillations was investigated for the case of small - amplitude periodic oscillations in the gas model . \n it has been pointed out that the collapse of the region between @xmath20 and @xmath1 is an important mechanism which can halt the expansion phase of a gravothermal oscillation . \n this mechanism should also be present in one - component models and it would be an interesting topic for future work to see how this mechanism would behave with different stellar mass functions . \n @xcite argued that two - component clusters may be realistic approximations of multi - component clusters , where the two components are neutron stars and main sequence stars and the effect of white dwarfs ( heavier than the turnoff mass ) was assumed to be negligible . \n they also only studied cases that were spitzer stable , which means that the components were able to achieve equipartition of kinetic energy . \n for the two - component case , it is only possible for it to be spitzer stable if there is only a small amount of the heavier component present . as there is a significant range of stellar masses in a real star cluster \n , it is likely that some form of the spitzer instability will be present .    to apply our ideas to a multi - component system \n , it may be possible to group the heavier components together if they are able to achieve approximate thermal equilibrium . \n this could be considered as a single heavier component which is spitzer unstable with respect to the remaining components . \n this would help to reduce a multi - component system to the two - component case studied in this paper .    nevertheless , it is not clear quantitatively how the considerations of this research are to be applied to a multi - component cluster . \n furthermore , we have ignored many things such as primordial binaries , tidal fields and stellar evolution and these are important in the evolution of a real star cluster . \n further study is needed in order to understand the phenomenon that is gravothermal oscillation . \n we are indebted to s. aarseth and k. nitadori for making publicly available their version of nbody6 adapted for use with a gpu . \n we thank the anonymous referee for helping us to clarify the paper . \n our hardware was purchased using a small project grant awarded to dch and dr m. ruffert ( school of mathematics ) by the university of edinburgh development trust , and we are most grateful for it . \n pgb is funded by the science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) . \n 99 antonov v. a. , 1962 , vest . \n leningrad gos . \n , 135 ( english translation in goodman j. , hut p. , eds , iau symp . \n 113 , dynamics of globular clusters . \n reidel , dordrecht , p. 525 ) bettwieser e. , sugimoto d. , 1984 , mnras , 208 , 493 bettwieser e. , sugimoto d. , 1985 , mnras , 212 , 189 binney j. , tremaine s. , 2008 , galactic dynamics , second edition ( princeton@xmath46 princeton university press ) chernoff d.f . \n , weinberg m.d . , 1990 , apj , 351 , 121 cohn , h. , hut , p. , wise , m. , 1989 , apj , 342 , 814 fregeau j.m . \n , joshi k.j . , portegies zwart s.f . \n , rasio f.a \n . , 2002 , apj , 570 , 171 giersz m. , heggie d.c . , 1996 , mnras , 279 , 1037 giersz m. , heggie d.c . , 2009 , mnras , 395 , 1173 goodman j. , 1993 , in structure and dynamics of globular clusters , asp conf . \n djorgovski , s.g . , meylan , g. , asp , san francisco , p. 87 \n goodman j. , 1987 , apj , 313 , 576 grkan m.a . , freitag m. , rasio f.a . , 2004 , \n apj , 604 , 632 heggie d.c . , aarseth s. j. , 1992 , mnras , 257 , 513 heggie d.c . , \n giersz m. , 2009 , mnras , 397 , 46 heggie d.c . , hut p. , 2003 \n , the gravitational million body problem ( cambridge@xmath46 cambridge university press ) heggie d. c. , mathieu , r. d. , 1986 in the use of supercomputers in stellar dynamics , ed . hut , p. , mcmillan , s. l. w. , springer -

{"ContextTokens": 3238, "GeneratedTokens": 161, "SynthesizedBody": "the spin field effect transistor ( spinfet ) proposed by datta and das @xcite and its various clones ( see , for example , @xcite ) all operate on the principle of modulating the transmission of electrons through the device by controlling the spin orbit interaction strength in the channel with a gate potential . here , we describe a different type of spinfet where the gate potential modulates transmission resonances in the channel , instead of the spin orbit interaction . by changing the gate potential \n , we can move the fermi level in the device from regions of maximum transmission ( pass bands ) to regions of minimum transmission ( stop bands ) , thus modulating the device conductance . \n an immediate benefit of this approach is a much reduced switching voltage . \n spin orbit interactions in technologically important semiconductors are typically weak and weakly sensitive to external potentials @xcite . as a result , a large swing in the gate potential ( few volts ) is often required to turn a short channel spinfet of the traditional type on or off @xcite . \n that results in considerable dynamic energy dissipation during switching . \n in contrast , our strategy is to modulate transmission resonances ( ramsauer and fano - type resonances ) that occur in the channel of traditional spinfets @xcite with a gate potential . \n since the resonance widths ( in energy ) are very small , a few mv change in the gate potential can take the device from on - resonance to off - resonance and switch it on or off . \n this approach results in a very small switching voltage ( a few mv instead of the few volts required in traditional spinfets ) resulting in much reduced dynamic energy dissipation @xcite . \n the downside of this strategy is that the temperature of operation must be low so that the thermal broadening in the electron energy remains much smaller than the widths of the transmission resonances . \n typically , this limits the temperature of operation to @xmath0 1 k for realistic device parameters @xcite . here \n , we show that this problem can be somewhat mitigated by using a dual - gate configuration ( inter - digitated gate ) which allows us to apply two different gate biases on different regions of the channel \n . this will allow us to engineer the conduction band profile within the channel in a way that will broaden the transmission resonances and extend the temperature of operation to higher temperatures . \n two additional benefits are : ( 1 ) the ratio of on - to - off conductance remains large over an extended temperature range , and ( 2 ) the device exhibits sharp turn - on or turn - off characteristics , making it ideal for application as an inverter . the inverter type behavior is much sought after in boolean logic circuits . \n the proposed spinfet with the dual - gate configuration is shown in fig . \n the structure consists of one or several quantum wires in parallel ( each with the lowest subband occupied ) sandwiched between two half - metallic ferromagnetic contacts . \n the use of parallel channels increases the overall conductance of the device . \n the potential on the outer gate ( @xmath1 ) is selected such that underneath this gate , the conduction band edge in the channel is at a location @xmath2 above the bottom of the majority spin band in the ferromagnets ( see fig . \n the bias on the inner gate ( @xmath3 ) is varied to modulate the conduction band edge underneath this gate by an amount @xmath4 around the quiescent value . \n accordingly , the conduction band profile @xmath5 along the channel will form the basic unit of a superlattice along the direction of current flow as shown in fig . \n the source and drain ferromagnets are magnetized along the channel ( x - direction ) and their magnetization vectors point in the same direction ( parallel magnetization ) . \n the superlattice potential causes miniband formation for majority spins entering from the source and exiting at the drain . \n when the fermi level is inside a miniband , the transmission through the device is relatively large and the transistor is on . by changing @xmath6 , one can move the miniband away from the fermi level ( or vice versa ) , thereby decreasing the transmission probability and turning the transistor off . \n the optimal device will require minimal change @xmath6 to turn the transistor on or off . \n furthermore , in order to reduce fabrication complexity , we also prefer fewest repetitions of the superlattice unit ( as few inter - digitated gates as possible ) . here , we show that even a single period of the superlattice unit , implemented with just a single pair of gates , is sufficient to yield a very low switching voltage of about 2.6 mv , and yet a large conductance on / off ratio of about 60 , up to a temperature of 10 k. the analysis described here can be easily extended to the case of multiple periods . \n use of multiple periods can enhance device performance by extending the temperature of operation to higher temperatures .    for simplicity \n , the conduction band diagram along the direction of current flow is modeled as shown in fig . \n the contact potentials are approximated by two positive delta - scatterers of strength @xmath7 at the contact / channel interfaces . \n this model is fairly accurate for heavy doping in the channel when the schottky barriers at the contact / channel interfaces become very narrow . \n the energy bands in the ferromagnets are modeled after the stoner - wohlfarth model which assumes that the majority and minority spin bands are split by an exchange energy @xmath8 . \n the fermi level is below the bottom of the minority spin band , so that the ferromagnets are 100% spin polarized at low temperatures ( i.e. they are half metallic ) . \n there is a rashba spin orbit interaction in the channel because of the symmetry breaking electric field at the heterointerface , but we assume that it is independent of the gate potential since the latter is never varied by more than a few mv and the spin orbit interaction strength is weakly sensitive to gate potentials @xcite . \n we calculate the conductance through the device using the ballistic model for spin transport developed in refs . @xcite . \n the @xmath9- and @xmath10-components of the wavefunction in the channel will be slightly different under the two gates for non - zero values of @xmath11 , but this subtlety is neglected here since @xmath12 is never any more than just a few mev , as we show later . for the same reason , \n any difference between the rashba - spin orbit coupling constants under the two gates is ignored . \n to calculate the linear response conductance of the spinfet under various gate biases , we first calculate the spin dependent transmission probability of an electron through the device following the recipe of refs . \n this technique is fairly involved and the reader is referred to refs . @xcite for the details . \n the results presented here are based on the assumption of the device parameters listed in table i.    fig . \n 3 is a plot of the zero temperature conductance ( in units of @xmath13 ) for the two following biasing configurations : ( a ) the curve labeled `` 1 '' corresponds to the case when the bias on the inner gate is fixed at @xmath14 = 4192 mev ( which corresponds to a transmission resonance when all gates are biased at the same potential ) , while the bias on the outer gate is varied by @xmath15 around the quiescent value of 4192 mev ; ( b ) the curve labeled `` 2 '' corresponds to the second biasing configuration when the bias on the outer gate is kept fixed at @xmath14 = 4192 mev and the bias on the inner gate is varied by @xmath15 around the quiescent value . \n a comparison of the curves labeled `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' reveals that it is advantageous to operate the device with @xmath16 = 2.58 mev , indicated by a vertical arrow in fig . \n 3 . with this value of @xmath16 , switching from the biasing configuration `` 1 '' ( @xmath17 ) to `` 2 '' ( @xmath18 ) switches the device from on ( @xmath19 ) to off ( @xmath20 ) . \n 4 is a plot of the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath21 in the two biasing configurations discussed above . \n hereafter , we label these two configurations `` on '' and `` off '' since they correspond to on and off states of the transistor . \n both in the on and off states , @xmath21 contains several peaks and troughs due to ramsauer and fano resonances in the conductance of the channel , features which we have analyzed thoroughly in the past @xcite . in the energy range [ 4198.5 - 4200.5 ] \n mev , the transmission coefficient reaches unity several times when the spinfet is biased in the on configuration but is close to zero when biased in the complementary scheme . \n therefore , the energy range [ 4198.5 - 4200.5 ] mev constitutes the `` pass band '' in the on configuration and also the `` stop band '' in the off configuration . \n consequently , if we place the fermi level within this energy range ( by appropriate channel doping , or even using a back gate ) , then we can switch the device on or off by going from the one gate biasing scheme to the other . since this requires changing the bias on any gate by at most 2.58 mv , \n the effective switching voltage @xmath22 is only 2.58 mv . \n we can estimate the dynamic energy dissipated during switching . \n assuming that the gate capacitance @xmath23 ( including interconnects ) is about 1 ff , the maximum energy dissipated during a switching event is @xmath24 = 3.3 @xmath25 10@xmath26 joules , which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude smaller than what a typical transistor dissipates in the pentium iv chip today @xcite .    the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for @xmath21 in the on configuration ( distance between points @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig . \n 4 ) is roughly 1.5 mev . \n this is the effective width of the pass band . \n it is about three times the distance between the points @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which is the fwhm of the transmission coefficient versus energy curve when the inner and outer gates are biased at the _ same _ potential ( corresponding to @xmath31 under both gates ) . \n therefore , the use of a dual gate , as opposed to a single gate , has broadened the transmission resonance by a factor of 3 . \n 5 shows the transfer characteristic of the device ( conductance versus gate voltage ) at zero temperature . \n this plot displays the change in the conductance as the potential on the inner gate is gradually increased from 4192 mev to 4192 + @xmath32 mev while simultaneously reducing the potential on the outer gate from 4192 + 2.58 mev to 4192 + 2.58 - @xmath32 mev . \n we see that transistor has a fairly sharp switching characteristic  the transition width is only about 2 mv  which is the hallmark of a good inverter . \n the transistor performance obviously degrades at high temperatures because of thermal averaging over electron energy . \n thermal averaging can be viewed as a convolution of @xmath21 with a function of width roughly equal to 4 @xmath33 @xcite . \n therefore , the device performance is not expected to deteriorate substantially until @xmath34 , which is the distance between the points @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig . \n 4 . setting @xmath35 = 1.5 mev , we find that the upper limit on the temperature is about 5 k. over the energy range of 1.5 mev , the conductance in the off state stays very close to zero since @xmath21 remains approximately zero in this energy range . \n therefore , the dual - gate spinfet will retain a large on to off conductance ratio up to a temperature of at least 5 k.    the temperature dependence is shown in fig . \n 6 where the conductance of the device is plotted as a function of temperature for the two biasing configurations discussed above . \n table ii lists the values of the conductance on / off ratio calculated as a function of temperature for @xmath16 = 6 mev . \n the on / off ratio is about 60 at @xmath36 . \n this is comparable to what is typically obtained today with carbon nanotube transistors . \n one deleterious effect of high temperatures is that the maximum on conductance has dropped to @xmath37 . \n this can be remedied by using multiple parallel channels to increase the total device conductance , while still maintaining a large conductance on / off ratio . \n in conclusion , we have shown that using a dual gate configuration , it is possible to realize short - channel spinfets with large conductance on / off ratio at temperatures above that of liquid helium . \n these spinfets possess excellent inverter characteristics , making them ideal for low power logic circuits . \n the sharp turn - off behavior is conducive to good noise margin and restoration of logic levels at circuit nodes @xcite for fault - tolerant computing and signal processing . \n the very small power dissipation will also allow extremely high integration density . \n * figure 1 * : ( top ) cross -

\n my first answer is that a wide range of possibilities becomes open for strategies and setups aiming at exploring lepton cp violation through neutrino oscillation . \n i believe that in the context of conventional superbeam @xcite unambiguous evidence for lepton cp violation requires a megaton scale water cherenkov detector , or a @xmath17 kton liquid ar detector @xcite . yet , the suggested large value of @xmath0 , still need to be confirmed and assumed here , stimulates to examine other possibilities such as reactor - accelerator combined method @xcite , combining different accelerator measurement @xcite , or the one adding one more new facility which may or may not require an extensive cost @xcite . \n some more exotic options are discussed in @xcite . \n it is notable that the cern - memphys project , despite an almost vacuum setting , has a reasonable sensitivity to the mass hierarchy to @xmath18 before combining with atmospheric neutrino data @xcite . \n sometime ago the cp sensitivity achievable by the reactor - accelerator combined method was examined in detail @xcite . \n the results obtained in this analysis indicate that combining data taken and to be taken by all planned experiments is not enough to guarantee discovery of cp violation in @xmath11 coverage of more than 30% in most of the allowed region of @xmath0 even though one assumes that the mass hierarchy is known . \n it should be noticed , as observed and emphasized in @xcite , that the cp sensitivity is severely damaged by the parameter degeneracy due to unknown neutrino mass hierarchies @xcite . \n for a recent overview of the parameter degeneracy see @xcite . \n i believe that the one of the most important implications of the assumed large value of @xmath0 is that one can think of `` all in one '' ( _ obento _ in japanese , everything in a lunch box ) approach . as we saw in the above , a traditional approaches for cp and the mass hierarchy entailed in aggressive proposals @xcite to include a very small value of @xmath0 within the scope . though powerful and \n the redundancy is of course welcome , they may not be the optimal cost - effective apparatus for large @xmath0 . \n to my opinion , what is good in living in the world with large @xmath0 is that one can achieve the same goal by less expensive `` all in one '' setting . \n more concretely , i mean by it a single detector ( such as a megaton water cherenkov detector ) assuming prior existence of intense neutrino beam . \n timely enough the loi of hyper - kamiokande ( hyper - k ) project has just appeared @xcite . \n therefore , let us briefly discuss the spirit of the `` all in one '' approach by taking this concrete setting .    with intense neutrino beam from 1.66 mw proton driver at j - parc it is demonstrated that hyper - k with 0.56 megaton fiducial mass has a superb performance for discovery of cp violation , which covers most of the region of @xmath0 allowed at 3@xmath19 cl @xcite . \n see fig . \n 24 of @xcite which assumes the known mass hierarchy and for 1.5 ( 3.5 ) years of neutrino ( antineutrino ) running . \n it shows a remarkable accuracy of determination of @xmath11 with 1@xmath19 error smaller than 20 degree for @xmath20 . \n however , if the mass hierarchy is unknown the analysis suffers from the sign-@xmath21 degeneracy @xcite . \n while allowing clean measurement of cp violation , a drawback of setting with such short baseline is that it is difficult to determine the mass hierarchy , another important goal of future neutrino experiments . \n that is why many proposals for determining all the unknowns in neutrino parameters exploit baselines of several thousand km . \n if @xmath0 is large , however , the mass hierarchy can be determined by high - statistics observation of atmospheric neutrinos , the idea discussed by many authors . \n see e.g. , @xcite for early references . \n the analysis presented in @xcite indicates that the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy depend very much on which octant @xmath22 lives but it can be carried out by @xmath23 years running of hyper - k for large @xmath0 . \n it should also be mentioned that having other capabilities such as proton decay discovery is of crucial importance . \n i emphasize that the realization of `` all in one '' approach is , of course , not limited to this particular version discussed above . \n but , it is certainly encouraging to see the concrete example appeared which is armed with the realistic simulations based on their long - term experiences at super - k . \n is theoretical treatment of neutrino oscillation well oiled when a large value of @xmath0 close to the chooz limit is established ? \n for example , does the well known treatment of the degeneracy @xcite need modification ? \n if yes , to what extent ?     computed numerically as a function of energy ( green dashed line ) , the one calculated by the cervera _ \n _ formula ( blue dash - dotted line ) , and with our formula with large @xmath0 corrections ( red solid line ) . \n the left and the right panels are for baselines @xmath24 km and @xmath25 km for which the matter density is taken as 2.8 g/@xmath26 and 3.6 g/@xmath26 , respectively . , title=\"fig:\",width=241 ]   computed numerically as a function of energy ( green dashed line ) , the one calculated by the cervera _ \n _ formula ( blue dash - dotted line ) , and with our formula with large @xmath0 corrections ( red solid line ) . the left and the right panels are for baselines @xmath24 km and @xmath25 km for which the matter density is taken as 2.8 g/@xmath26 and 3.6 g/@xmath26 , respectively . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=241 ]    to answer these questions a framework dubbed as `` @xmath27 perturbation theory '' ( @xmath28 ) has been formulated @xcite by assuming @xmath29 , which roughly corresponds to the chooz limit . by doing \n so one can systematically compute the large-@xmath0 corrections to the cervera _ \n et al . _ formula @xcite \n . while large corrections arise in certain limited region of energy and baseline as indicated in fig . \n [ fpemu_1000 - 4000 ] , one can show on general ground that the correction terms are of order @xmath30 . \n ( by general argument one can show that they are the terms proportional to either @xmath31 or @xmath32 @xcite . ) therefore , the large-@xmath0 correction to the degenerate solutions obtained with the cervera _ \n _ formula , generally speaking , is not sizable . \n see @xcite for more detail . \n assuming that the t2k and minos hints for large @xmath0 will be confirmed , i argued that we are at the turning point of thinking of our strategy of how to explore the remaining unknowns in the lepton flavor mixing . in particular , it allows us to rely on `` all in one '' approach . \n i hope that the personal view can be strengthened by further exploration toward nufact 2012 . \n this work was supported in part by kakenhi , grant - in - aid for scientific research no . \n 23540315 , japan society for the promotion of science . \n 99      m.  apollonio _ et al . _ [ chooz collaboration ] , eur . \n j.   c * 27 * , 331 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0301017 ] ; see also , the palo verde collaboration , f.  boehm _ et al . _ , phys .  rev . \n d * 64 * , 112001 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0107009 ] . for \n a bound from accelerator experiment , see m.  h.  ahn _ \n et al . _ [ k2k collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * 93 * , 051801 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0402017 ] . \n p.  adamson _ et al . \n _ [ the minos collaboration ] , phys .  rev . \n d * 82 * , 051102 ( 2010 ) [ arxiv:1006.0996 [ hep - ex ] ] . \n s.  geer , phys . \n d * 57 * , 6989 ( 1998 ) [ erratum - ibid . \n d * 59 * , 039903 ( 1999 ) ] [ arxiv : hep - ph/9712290 ] ; a.  de rujula , m.  b.  gavela and p.  hernandez , nucl . \n b * 547 * , 21 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/9811390 ] . \n p.  zucchelli , phys . \n b * 532 * , 166 ( 2002 ) . \n j.  bouchez , m.  lindroos and m.  mezzetto , aip conf . \n * 721 * , 37 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0310059 ] . \n j.  burguet - castell , d.  casper , j.  j.  gomez - cadenas , p.  hernandez , f.  sanchez , nucl . \n phys .   * \n b695 * , 217 - 240 ( 2004 ) . \n [ hep - ph/0312068 ] . \n m.  ishitsuka _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n d * 72 * , 033003 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0504026 ] . \n t.  kajita _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n d * 75 * , 013006 ( 2007 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0609286 ] . f.  dufour _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n rev .   * d81 * , 093001 ( 2010 ) . \n [ arxiv:1001.5165 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  bandyopadhyay _ et al . \n _ [ iss physics working group ] , rept .  prog . \n * 72 * ( 2009 ) 106201 [ arxiv:0710.4947 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n h.  minakata and h.  nunokawa , phys . \n b * 495 * , 369 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0004114 ] ; j.  sato , nucl . \n instrum . \n * a472 * ( 2001 ) 434 [ arxiv : hep - ph/0008056 ] ; b.  richter , arxiv : hep - ph/0008222 . \n see , e.g. , p.  huber , m.  lindner , m.  rolinec , t.  schwetz , w.  winter , phys . \n rev .   * d70 * , 073014 ( 2004 ) . \n [ hep - ph/0403068 ] . \n o.  mena , h.  nunokawa , s.  j.  parke , phys . \n rev .   * d75 * , 033002 ( 2007 ) . \n [ hep - ph/0609011 ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 2207119108212, "RequestID": "b099b67edf4b8a9d913156ebe808a5bc9e8d577e", "TotalTokens": 3481}

out , i.e. @xmath33 . \n the chemical freezeout is defined as a time scale , at which there is no longer particle production and the collisions become entirely elastic . in case of phase transition , @xmath32 is expected to be larger than one , because of the large degrees of freedom , weak coupling and expanding phase space above the critical temperature to qgp . \n the quark chemistry is given by relating the _ hadronic _ \n chemical potentials and @xmath34 to the quark constituents . \n @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the number of light and strange quarks , respectively . \n @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath4 are the light and strange quark quantum number , respectively \n . the baryochemical potential for the light quarks is @xmath38 . the iso - spin chemical potential @xmath39 . \n therefore , vanishing @xmath12 obviously means that light quarks are conjectured to be degenerate and @xmath40 . \n the strangeness chemical potential , @xmath11 , is calculated in hrg model as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath13 . at finite @xmath2 and @xmath13 , \n @xmath11 is calculated under the condition of the overall strangeness conservation . \n absolving chemical freezeout means that the hadrons finally decay to stable hadrons or other resonances [ eq : n2 ] n_i^final & = & n_i^direct + _ \n ji b_ji n_j , where @xmath41 being decay branching ratio of @xmath42-th hadron resonance into @xmath15-th _ stable _ particle . \n the particle number density in grand -

canonical statistical set of the thermodynamic parameters has been used . \n corrections due to van  der  waals repulsive interactions has not been taken into account  @xcite . \n seeking for simplicity , one can for a moment assume the boltzmann approximations , especially at ultra - relativistic energy , in order find out the parameters , on which @xmath9 ratio depends . \n then , at finite isospin fugacity @xmath44 , & & = ( _ |u^2 _ |d)^2 \n . [ naptip - p ] \n as mentioned above , the formation of deconfined qgp strongly depends on the initial conditions in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions , where the baryon number transport ( deceleration of the incoming particle ) or even its entire stopping is assumed to be achieved @xcite . \n therefore , it is widely conjectured that such deconfined matter would not be produced , especially in @xmath1 collisions at low energies . on the other hand , \n the degrees of baryon number transport likely affects the overall dynamical evolution of the system . \n the initial parton equilibrium @xcite , thermal / chemical equilibrium @xcite , time evolution @xcite and the final particle production @xcite are affected as well .    in fig . \n [ fig:1a ] , @xmath9 ratios are given in dependence on center - of - mass - energy @xmath0 ranging from ags to lhc . \n the @xmath1 collisions ( empty symbols ) are compared with the heavy - ion collisions ( solid symbols ) . in the nucleus - nucleus collisions , \n the spatial and time evolution of the system is too short to assure initial conditions required in order to derive the parton matter into deconfined qgp . \n we notice that @xmath9 ratios up to rhic energy are smaller than unity indicating an overall excess of @xmath45 over @xmath46 . \n this would also imply that a certain fraction of the baryon number is likely transported from the incident projectile at beam rapidity to mid - rapidity region of the system . \n thus up to rhic energy , the mid - rapidity region seems to have finite net - baryon number .    as mentioned above \n , hrg model has been successfully utilized to describe heavy - ion collisions and the thermodynamics of lattice qcd as well @xcite . \n the collective flow of the matter in heavy - ion collisions makes it obvious that hrg model underestimates the @xmath9 ratios measured in the @xmath1 collisions , especially at low energies . on the other hand , \n the ratios from the heavy - ion collisions @xcite are very well reproduced by hrg model . in both types of collisions \n , there is a dramatic increase in the @xmath9 ratio . \n for instance , in rhic heavy - ion collisions , the ratio is @xmath47 ( @xmath48gev ) , which is obviously much higher than the ones measured at sps ( @xmath49 at @xmath50gev ) @xcite and ags ( @xmath51 at @xmath52gev ) @xcite \n . also in the @xmath1 collisions , the @xmath9 ratios obviously increase from na49 over isr and @xmath53gev - rhic to alice . \n up to rhic energy , it is obvious that the matter - antimatter asymmetry decreases from nearly @xmath54 at ags to @xmath55 and @xmath56gev - rhic . at lhc energy , while the differences between @xmath9 ratios of @xmath1 and heavy - ion collisions apparently disappear , their values approach unity , i.e. almost @xmath57 matter - antimatter asymmetry .    the dashed line in fig . \n [ fig:1a ] gives the fitting according to regge model , which reasonably describe the @xmath9 data from different @xmath1 collisions . \n this fitting is elaborated in ref . \n the baryon pair production is assumed to be governed by pomeron exchange and baryon transport by string - junction exchange @xcite . \n therefore , it has been concluded that alice results seem to be consistent with the baryon number transport . \n the solid line gives the results from hrg model , section [ sec:2 ] . \n no fitting has been utilized . over the whole range of @xmath0 , the two parameters @xmath34 and \n @xmath8 remain constant , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . \n it seems to be a kind of a universal curve . \n it describes very well the heavy - ion results . \n also alice @xmath1 results are reproduced by means of hrg model . \n so far , it can be concluded that the future heavy - ion program of alice likely will produce @xmath9 ratios similar , when not entirely identical , to the ones measured in this current @xmath1 program . \n secondly , the ratios run very close to unity implying almost vanishing matter - antimatter asymmetry \n . some astrophysical consequences of these results will shortly be elaborated below . on the other hand , it can also be concluded that the thermal models including hrg seem to be able to perfectly describe the hadronization at very large energies and the condition deriving the chemical freezeout at the final state of hadronization , the constant degrees of freedom or @xmath60 , seems to be valid at all center - of - mass - energies raging from ags to lhc . \n expression ( [ naptip - p ] ) can be used to calculate the antiproton ( antiquark ) chemical potential . at a vanishing isospin chemical potential @xmath12 , i. e. \n degenerate light quarks & & ( -2_|p / t_ch ) = ( -6_|q / t_ch ) , [ naptip -

antimatter asymmetry is one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics . \n the well - known sakharov s conditions @xcite ; baryon number violation and c and cp violation besides out - of - equilibrium processes ; are conjectured to give a solid framework to explain why should matter become dominant against antimatter with the universe cooling - down of expansion . recently , a fourth condition has been suggested ; @xmath68-@xmath69 violation , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 being baryon and lepton quantum number , respectively . in standard model , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not conserved , explicitly . \n non - perturbatively , they can be violated through sphalerons , for instance , which derive the two - direction conversion @xmath70 with a certain number of selection rules @xcite . that the heavy - ion program seems to give systematic tools to survey the evolution of matter -

) turns out to be an important criterion to identify . on the other hand \n ,  regions may exist with pdr s encompassing a large velocity range . \n a fundamental criterion for  identification remains the lack of counterparts in lines from ionized species . \n large variations of the line intensity ratio /  with @xmath4 constitute another useful criterion ( table  [ table_m42 ] ) , since fluorescence will generally not result in the same decrement as the one corresponding to recombination .    as a result of the present high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise observations , \n the identification of deuterium balmer lines is now very safe . \n detection of deuterium balmer emission in five  regions is reported . \n these are first detections in four targets , including an extragalactic one . \n detection was made feasible thanks to the large collecting area of the 8.2 m vlt mirror and the high efficiency of uves . \n fluorescence is confirmed as the probable excitation mechanism of , recombination being excluded . \n spectroscopic criteria leading to virtually certain identification of  in any given  region are now clearly established . \n possible ways to determine d / h from  balmer lines were discussed in paper  i. one method requires a knowledge of the @xmath4 for which the line ratio /  starts decreasing . \n the detection of  up to d9 , and possibly d16 , in orion suggests this as a promising way of investigation . \n comparison of  to  fluorescence lines , present in the uves spectra and also produced in the pdr , may be another way to explore .", "StartTimeOffset": 2225933943360, "RequestID": "ad0590d5585dc9c44ca255027b567be01e5aabe9", "TotalTokens": 2219}
{"ContextTokens": 3386, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of accretion dynamics of charged particles in the vicinity of a compact gravitational source is of observational as well as theoretical interest ; particularly for the information it reveals about the nature and influence of the background spacetime on the various physical processes occurring in the star s vicinity . whereas a compact star is formed largely of a degenerate plasma@xmath0 , matter surrounding the star exists in a highly ionized , though  a less dense , state@xmath1 . in this region \n the charged particles are more free to move while not accreted to relativistic velocities , and the dynamics of these charged particles is governed not only by the gravitational but also by the electromagnetic field of the star . \n however the electromagnetic field is itself  effected by the geometry of the background spacetime . \n therefore it is of importance and of astrophysical relevance that the two - fold effects ; namely , the coupling of the gravitational and the electromagnetic field of the star , as well as the direct effects of the background spacetime on the motion of a charged particle , must be addressed together@xmath2 .    here \n we present an investigation of these effects on the dynamics of an accreted  charged particle lying in the star s plasma atmosphere . to pose the problem quantitatively \n we consider a slowly rotating isolated compact star as the source of gravitational field which defines the geometry of the background spacetime . an axially symmetric , highly conducting plasma with a stationary , axially symmetric electromagnetic field is assumed to constitute the star s atmosphere . \n we regard the electromagnetic field as perturbed by the background spacetime , however the back - reaction of the electromagnetic field on the spacetime curvature is neglected and the standard kerr metric ( in its linearized form ) is used for the fixed background spacetime . for the plasma surrounding the star the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation \n is assumed , as such the plasma is considered as an ideal highly conducting mhd fluid@xmath3 . \n the formulation of the electromagnetic field equations is based on a generalized definition of the electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal mhd fluid in a curved spacetime@xmath4 . \n the direct effects of the spacetime dragging on the particle dynamics are discussed in the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation to the geodesic equation@xmath5 . \n the gem approximation , which assumes the charged particle motion to be slow , is generally valid in the case of stable compact stars ( i.e. non - collapsing objects ) . \n also for the case of a magnetized compact star with a dipole field the gem approximation is applicable except at or very close to the poles where particle velocities can be relativistic due to intense magnetic field . \n generally the accretion occurs well below the relativistic limit and so the gem approximation can be used . throughout \n we take the velocity four vector as defined by a comoving observer zamo ( zero angular momentum observer ) . \n the zamo is a useful class of observers , relevant to astrophysics , circling the gravitational source with a given angular velocity at a fixed radial distance and polar angle@xmath6 . \n the paper is organized as follows . in the first part of our analysis , \n comprising section ii , we obtain exact solutions of the general relativistic maxwell equations using the generalized definition of the electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal , highly conducting mhd fluid in linearized kerr spacetime . \n the solution obtained shows that in the slow rotation approximation the effects of rotation on the electromagnetic field are absent . \n then , in section iii , assuming the star to be a sphere of homogeneous mass density , we study numerically the dynamics of the charged particle using the gem approximation . in this approximation \n the direct effects of rotation ( i.e. via frame - dragging ) on particle trajectories are found to oppose that of the electromagnetic field , hence the particle motion is a result of balancing and counter - balancing of these effects . \n lastly , in section iv , we give a discussion and a summary of the main conclusions of the paper . \n the exterior spacetime to a slowly rotating compact gravitational source of mass @xmath7 is described by the linearized kerr metric . in the boyer - lindquist \n coordinates the metric can be written as the general line element :    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    and @xmath10 is the angular velocity of a free falling frame brought into rotation by the frame dragging of the spacetime . here and in what follows the greek indices run as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . \n also throughout we assume the gravitational units in which @xmath13 . \n the general relativistic form of the maxwell equations is @xmath14@xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 represents the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath18 given by the einstein field equations . here \n @xmath19 is the generalized electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal mhd fluid given by a unique tensorial expression :    @xmath20    and @xmath21 is current four vector . in general the current four vector \n is the sum of two terms corresponding to a convection and to a conduction current :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the proper charge density , @xmath24 is the conductivity of the fluid , and @xmath25 is the unit velocity @xmath26-vector . \n the volume element 4-form @xmath27 and its dual @xmath28 are defined by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the levi -civita symbol , which is @xmath31 or @xmath32 for an even , odd , or non -

vanishing components to the electromagnetic field are given by equations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) . \n clearly in both cases the electromagnetic field is independent of @xmath95 .    in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) \n we give plots for the magnetic ( electric ) field components @xmath49 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 \n according to the general theory of relativity the trajectory of a particle in the field of a massive object is determined by the geodesic equation :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the christoffel symbol . to linearize the geodesic equation we assume that the metric tensor can be expressed as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 is the minkowski metric tensor and @xmath107 is a small perturbation to the spacetime metric such that @xmath108 . \n we can take time @xmath109 for the affine parameter @xmath110 . further requiring @xmath111 for a ` slow ' moving particle we obtain@xmath112 @xmath113 where    @xmath114    and    @xmath115    @xmath116 being the mass density and @xmath117 is the volume of the gravitational source . \n this approximation , due to its formal analogy to the classical electromagnetic theory , is referred to as the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation to the general theory of relativity ( see reference [ 16 ] and [ 17 ] for different interpretations ) . thus in expression \n ( 40 ) @xmath118 is called the gravitoelectric ( ge ) force per unit mass whereas the term @xmath119 is called the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) force for a unit mass . in particular the gm force , being independent of the choice of a particular coordinate system used , is general relativistically significant .    in the slow rotation approximation the deformation to the star due to the effects of rotation \n are small compared to the  radially attractive ge force ; hence we take the star to be a slowly rotating sphere of homogeneous mass density . then using gem analogy , \n we obtain :    @xmath120    and @xmath121 where @xmath7 is the mass , @xmath122 is the radius and @xmath123 is the angular velocity of the star . \n thus in the field of a slowly rotating compact star , the net force acting on a particle of mass @xmath124 and charge @xmath125 is the sum of the gravitational and the electromagnetic forces :    @xmath126    to specify the physical situation we study the motion of the charged particle in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath127 and take @xmath128 to be along the positive @xmath129-axis . \n furthermore , since now the effective component of the gm force lies in the @xmath130-plane , we assume that the @xmath130-plane is the equatorial plane of the star and the particle s motion is confined to this plane only . \n then for the case of non - vanishing poloidal magnetic field we transform expressions ( 33)-(36 ) and ( 42)-(43 ) into the cartesian coordinates , and obtain the equations of motion in the equatorial plane ( i. e. for @xmath61 ) :    @xmath131    @xmath132    where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . notice that here the case of vanishing poloidal magnetic field is obtained for @xmath136 whereas requiring @xmath94 does not alter the equations of motion ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) . \n we numerically solve the equations of motion ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) for the initial conditions @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and plot ( in figure ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) ) the solutions for various values of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . \n we have considered the dynamics of a charged particle in a highly , conducting plasma surrounding a slowly rotating compact gravitational source . \n the effects of background spacetime have been discussed , both directly on the particle s motion and indirectly via an axially symmetric electromagnetic field around the star . \n we found ( equations ( 33 ) to ( 36 ) ) that when slow rotation is assumed for the compact source the spacetime dragging does not modify or reduce the electromagnetic field of the star . \n hence the field remains , in this approximation , the same as for the schwarzchild spacetime . \n however the motion of the particle is directly influenced via gravitational field of the star . \n our numerical analysis of the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic field shows ( fig . \n ( 3 )  to ( 6 ) ) that whereas the electromagnetic effects dominate the overall dynamics of the charged particle at sufficiently large distances , the gravitational field also becomes important closer to the surface of the star especially if the star is rotating fast enough . \n firstly we observe that the effects of the electric field is to lift a charge particle from close to the surface of the star ( fig . \n ( 3 ) ) and make them move along the magnetic field lines . here \n are now two possibilities : one , if the magnitude of the magnetic field is larger than the magnitude of the electric field the particle following a helical trajectory falls into the star ( case ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in fig . ( 4 ) ) ; two , if the magnetic field strength is weaker or is even comparable to the electric field strength , then the electrical effects become dominant and the particle escapes from falling into the star ( case ( d ) , and ( e ) in fig.(4 ) ) .    on the other hand \n the effects of gravitational field can be regarded as opposing that of the electromagnetic field . in figure ( 5 ) we notice thatthe ge force attracts the particle towards the star s surface against the electric field . furthermore it is clear from figure ( 6 ) that the gyroradius of the helical trajectory of the particle is increased due to the gm force ; hence the gm force weakens the effects of the magnetic field .    summing up these observations \n we note that the accretion of a charged particle in vicinity of a compact star is mainly due to the ge and magnetic effects . \n these effects are especially dominant at a sufficiently large distances from the star . however _ close _ to the star the particle trajectory is also effected by the gm force as well as electric field which cause accerted charged particles to follow open lines of force . for a sufficiently fast rotating star and an electric field comparable to the magnetic field the above mechanism ( gm + electric ) may contribute to opposing the in - fall of the plasma surrounding the compact star .", "StartTimeOffset": 2235948156372, "RequestID": "4efb2c292f5bf997ef6a4cdbfb8f97c41800c7dc", "TotalTokens": 3561}

[ layer ] . \n the depth of the first minimum in the spectra scales linearly with the magnetic moment of the top layer while the energy of this minimum reflects the @xmath0-band width . as can be seen from fig . \n [ lattice ] , the nonlinear spectra reveal the structural changes induced by different substrates or temperatures . in fig . \n [ semi ] we compare the _ ab initio _ nonlinear kerr spectrum for the fe(001 ) monolayer with tight - binding calculations . from the results of fig . \n [ semi ] it becomes obvious that it is necessary to use _ ab initio _ \n calculations for the films if only bulk tight - binding parameters are available \n . however , tight - binding calculations may be adequate if one uses as input parameters those determined from _ ab initio _ calculations for thin films . \n we expect generally also interesting results for @xmath14 at heterogeneous interfaces like fe / cu(001 ) . \n for example , it is of interest to find out how the substrate interferes with the electronic structure of the thin film . \n for this reason we performed calculations of the fe / cu bilayer . \n results are shown in fig . \n [ bilayer ] . \n the additional peak structure reveals the electronic influence even of the nonmagnetic cu on the nonlinear magneto - optic response of thin films . \n this might be of general significance also with respect to the analysis of quantum well states ( tuning of interface properties , @xmath3 in substrate , m in films ) . \n that shg is very symmetry sensitive is furthermore particular demonstrated by its polarization dependence and by the remarkable enhancement of the kerr rotation@xcite . \n the latter important result was first theoretically derived by pustogowa _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite and later observed in experiments by bhmer _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite and koopmans _ et al . _ \n @xcite . \n first , we note that due to the symmetry sensitivity already shg exhibits a corresponding polarization dependence , which interestingly is very different for transition and noble metals  @xcite . \n the latter results , since @xmath19 and @xmath0 electrons feel the breakdown of inversion symmetry at the interface differently . \n this symmetry dependence mainly results from the matrix elements in @xmath14 , see eq . \n ( [ gl1 ] ) . \n the different possible optical excitations contributing to @xmath14 for noble and transition metals are illustrated in fig . \n obviously , shg yields interesting information on the electronic structure even for @xmath2=0 and when no kerr effect is present . \n this area needs further analysis and might offer interesting new results  @xcite .    extending the symmetry analysis to the magnetic case we determine the kerr rotations for different configurations and polarizations . \n the general analysis can be performed by using for @xmath19 and @xmath20 polarization ( see  @xcite ) @xmath21 where in the longitudinal configuration the susceptibility tensor is given by @xmath22 and in the polar configuration by @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the angles of polarization of the reflected frequency doubled and of the incident light , @xmath26 are the amplitudes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fresnel coefficients , and @xmath29 are the linear transmission coefficients for the fundamental light . then , from @xmath30 we determine the kerr rotation for the polar and longitudinal configuration and for @xmath19 and @xmath20 polarized incident light . \n the following results are obtained : + for the longitudinal configuration ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) polarized incident light one gets @xmath32 \n @xmath33 for the polar configuration ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) polarized incident light one gets @xmath35 @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 contain explicitly the whole information about the kerr geometry ( directions of light incidence and polarization , crystal magnetization ) and about the linear transmission and reflection ( see  @xcite ) .    summarizing the results , we find that generally @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is in agreement with the experiment by koopmans _ \n et al . _ \n numerical results of our theory using as input parameters the phase ratio of the various different tensor elements from ni and linear complex indices of refraction are presented in fig . \n [ angle ] . \n these results demonstrate clearly that the nonlinear kerr angle depends sensitively on the direction of the magnetization and the incident beam , as well as on the light polarization . depending on the experimental conditions the nonlinear kerr angle might become even as large as 90@xmath40 . \n moreover , also the ellipticity will yield correspondingly large magnetic effects . from these results \n we conclude that the enhanced nonlinear kerr rotation allows for the determination of easy axis and canted - spin configurations due to large magnetic contrast of different interfaces . \n this selective discussion demonstrates the usefulness of nonlinear magneto - optics as a promising spectroscopy . \n our results show that shg is a new sensitive tool for determining magnetic interface properties such as the interplay of structure and magnetism , magnetic anisotropy , and magnetic reorientation . \n in contrast to linear optics , which probes characteristic film - averaged features , the nonlinear kerr effect originates essentially from the surface and interfaces and thus allows the analysis of buried interfaces .    for future studies on the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect \n it will be interesting to analyze magnetic anisotropy and easy axis , magnetic structure and domains , multilayers , and magnetostriction effects . \n nonlinear optics at interfaces is a bulk - background - free technique and therefore , should yield a pronounced visibility of quantum well states and enhanced nonlinear paramagnetic kerr oscillations in the presence of an external field . \n an important future development of the nonlinear kerr effect might result from femto - second dynamics which is able to follow the charge and spin dynamics of metallic interfaces in real time without involving the lattice . \n w. hbner and k. h. bennemann , phys . \n b * 40 * , 5973 ( 1989 ) . \n r.p . pan , h. d. wei , and y. r. shen , phys . \n b * 39 * , 1229 ( 1989 ) . \n w. hbner , k. h. bennemann , and k. bhmer , phys . \n b * 50 * , 17597 ( 1994 ) . \n w. hbner and k. h. bennemann , accepted for publication in phys . \n b. j. reif , j. c. zink , c. m. schneider , and j. kirschner , phys . \n lett . * 67 * , 2878 ( 1991 ) . \n h. a. wierenga , m. w. j. prins , d. l. abraham , and th . \n rasing , phys . \n b * 50 * , 1282 ( 1994 ) \n . h. a. wierenga , w. de jong , m. w. j. prins , th . \n rasing , r. vollmer , a. kirilyuk , h. schwabe , and j. kirschner , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 1462 ( 1995 ) . \n u. pustogowa , w. hbner , and k. h. bennemann , phys . \n b * 49 * , 10031 ( 1994 ) ; appl . phys . \n a * 59 * , 611 ( 1994 ) . \n k. bhmer , j. hohlfeld , and e. matthias , appl . \n phys . a * 60 * , 203 ( 1995 ) . \n b. koopmans , m. groot koerkamp , th . \n rasing , and h. van den berg , phys . \n rev . lett . \n * 74 * , 3692 ( 1995 ) . \n w. hbner , phys . \n b * 42 * , 11553 ( 1990 ) . \n u. pustogowa , w. hbner , k. h. bennemann , submitted for publication . \n m. methfessel , phys . \n b * 38 * , 1537 ( 1988 ) ; m. methfessel , c. o. rodriguez , and o. k. andersen , _ ibid . _ * 40 * , 2009 ( 1989 ) ; m. methfessel and m. scheffler , physica b * 172 * , 175 ( 1991 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2247390174558, "RequestID": "0017bfb1853aaaca127c47f233aa68b5b2527d5f", "TotalTokens": 2779}

hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , perhaps excited by the broadband echo of a magnetic collapse . \n the turbulence may host shocks and other forms of dissipation if critical velocities @xcite or electric current densities @xcite are exceeded . \n associated with dissipation are ( collisional or anomalous ) resistivity and non - conservative electric fields , which sustain , locally , the electric current against dissipative drag in order to meet the global constraints . \n however , a detailed balance on the level of individual charge carriers is impossible because the dissipative drag depends on particle position _ and _ velocity , whereas the electric field is a function of position only . \n thus the electric field may compensate the bulk drag , but a ( high - energy ) population can be left over and exposed to acceleration @xcite . \n this lack of detailed balance is in the heart of dissipative acceleration mechanisms . in plasmas \n , dissipation occurs at ` ruptures ' of the magnetic structure , and is therefore localized around critical points of the magnetic field . \n the above scenario , first envisaged by parker @xcite for the solar atmosphere , has since been explored in a large number of numerical studies @xcite . on the theoretical side , most stochastic acceleration theories @xcite base on fokker - planck approaches , thus transferring two - point functions of the electromagnetic fields into drift and diffusion coefficients of particles by probing the fields along unperturbed trajectories . \n dynamical particle averages are then replaced by field ensemble averages , neglecting the fact that real particles move in _ one _ realization of the random field . as a result , diffusive behaviour \n may be predicted even if particles are trapped in a single realization of the random field .    in order to investigate the full diversity of orbit behaviour one must resort to numerical simulations . in the present contribution \n we analyze the behaviour of test particles in resistive mhd turbulence with localized dissipation regions , with particular emphasis on the validity of a fokker -

program simulating the sznajd model in the mentioned variant on a square lattice is listed in @xcite . \n the method of _ damage spreading _ was first used by s. kaufmann in biology @xcite and is an useful tool to investigate the development of two systems that obey the same kind of dynamic rules and differ only in a slight modification . \n the strategy is very simple : + a replication @xmath6 of the initial system @xmath7 is created and a certain amount of elements is changed in @xmath6 ( _ initial damage _ ) . \n then both systems develop under exactly the same conditions ( i.e. the same sequence of random numbers ) towards consensus and one observes the impact the initial damage has . + here the systems are two lattices , the initial damage consists in a single persons opinion change and the rule for the dynamics is the sznajd rule . \n the effect of the opinion change can be measured by the fraction of different opinions on both lattices at a certain moment and is called the _ damage _ @xmath8 ( consistent to the already defined initial damage ) or _ hamming - distance_. the damage is determined by a site - by - site comparison of both lattices while going through the lattice like a typewriter . \n each site with a difference in opinions is summed up . \n the first used of _ damage spreading _ in the sznajd model was in @xcite where more than one opinion were changed . \n + in the sznajd model two different szenarios are possible : + the damage dies out ( @xmath8@xmath90 ) or the damage spreads over the whole lattice ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath2 ) . \n the last case ends up in a reversal of the consensus opinion of the unchanged lattice and is called _ \n total damage_. when one of these two _ equilibrum states _ is reached , the simulation can stop . \n + as already mentioned , the state of consensus is determined by the probability @xmath3 for opinion 1 if @xmath3@xmath10@xmath11 . \n a single change of opinion does not alter this probability . \n therefore the most interesting case is @xmath3@xmath12@xmath11 where total damages are most probable ( see fig . \n [ tdl ] ) although the values are very low . \n the further investigation was therefore limited to this case and it was decided to change the opinion in the center of the lattice to know the initial location of the damage . furthermore it should be mentioned that lattice - sizes of a prime number are used to enable long periods and minimal correlations of the random - number - sequences generated by multiplication with 16807 . \n the _ distance _ of a damaged site to the initial damage ( in the center ) is measured in the _ manhattan - metrics _ and the _ range _ of the damage in every timestep is the maximal distance occurring in that timestep . \n all values were averaged over 10,000 simulations . \n one result of the simulations concerning the temporal spreading of the damage is that the timespans needed to reach equilibrium ( in the sense mentioned above ) of the lattice size obey a power law . \n this could be found in cases of extinction as well as in cases of total damage ( see figure [ power1 ] ) . \n similarly the differences in times needed to reach consensus as a function of the lattice size follow a power law ( figure [ power1 ] ) . \n this means that a consensus can be delayed or accelerated dependending on the size of the system and is a quite interesting effect : it could be sometimes quite crucial whether a consensus happens in this moment or ten years later . + \n furthermore it is supposed that in cases of extinction the time @xmath13 scales with the systems size @xmath2 and the damage is a function of this scaled time ( @xmath14 ) ( see figure [ scalet ] ) . \n the distance scales with @xmath16 and the value ( damage @xmath17@xmath16 ) is a function of this scaled distance ( @xmath18 ) . \n this relation causes a comparison to a diffusion process for which such a @xmath16-dependence is characteristic . if the range of the damage ( see fig . \n [ reichweite ] ) is averaged over only those runs in which the damage is still alive at the moment considered , the damage increases @xmath19@xmath16 and therefore spreads like in a diffusion process ( see inset of fig . \n [ reichweite ] ) but finally dies out . \n finally : + can the change of an opinion into the consensus - opinion of the benchmark - simulation cause a total damage ? + \n the simulations show that it is indeed possible that an opinion changed into the consensus opinion causes the opposite consensus . \n +      the results confirm the intuitive assumption that there is hardly any chance for one person to change the consensus , that the effect of this change dies out after a certain time and its range decreases with time . \n the _ consensus times _ were compared and it turned out that the consensus can be delayed or accelerated by this slight modification and that the amount of the difference in the consensus times obeys a certain power law as well as the lifetime of the effect . \n + moreover two _ scaling laws _ concerning temporal and spatial aspects could be observed up to a certain size of population . \n 99 b. m. roehner , d. sornette und j.v . \n andersen , _ int . \n c 15,809 ( 2004 ) _ \n r. geipel , r. hrta , j. pohl , risiken i m mittelrheinischen becken , _ deutsche idndr -

{"ContextTokens": 3340, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "under the extreme temperatures and densities of the solar core , the plasma is fully ionized . \n the free electrons and ions interact via the coulomb potential @xmath0 in this coulomb system , nearby plasma is polarized by each ion . when two ions approach with the possibility of engaging in a nuclear reaction , each ion is surrounded by a screening cloud . \n thus each ion is attracted by the electrons and repelled by the protons in its partner s cloud . \n the combined effect of the particles in the screening clouds on the potential energy of the pair of ions is referred to as screening . \n this screening effect reduces the standard coulomb potential between approaching ions in a plasma to a screened potential which includes the contribution to the potential from the surrounding plasma . \n the reduced potential enables the ions to tunnel through the potential barrier more easily , thus enhancing fusion rates . \n @xcite derived an expression for the enhancement of nuclear reaction rates due to electron screening . by solving the poisson - boltzmann equation for electrons and ions in a plasma under the condition of weak screening ( @xmath1 ) , salpeter arrived at an expression for the screening energy that is equivalent to that of the debye - hckel theory of dilute solutions of electrolytes @xcite , @xmath2 where the debye length , @xmath3 , is the characteristic screening length of a plasma at temperature @xmath4 with number density @xmath5 , @xmath6 \n although salpeter s approximation for screening is widely accepted , several papers over the last few decades ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) have questioned either the derivation itself or the validity of applying the approximation to hot , dense , coulomb systems like the plasma of the solar core . various work deriving alternative formulae for _ electrostatic _ screening @xcite were refuted in subsequent papers ( see * ? ? ? * for a summary of arguments in salpeter s defense ) . \n however , the question of _ dynamic _ screening remains open . \n dynamic screening arises because the protons in a plasma are much slower than the electrons . \n they are therefore not able to rearrange themselves as quickly around individual faster moving ions . since nuclear reactions require energies several times the average thermal energy , the ions that are able to engage in nuclear reactions in the sun are such faster moving ions , which therefore may not be accompanied by their full screening cloud . \n salpeter uses the mean - field approach in which the many - body interactions are reduced to an average interaction that simplifies calculations . \n this technique is quite useful in thermodynamical calculations that rely on the average behavior of the plasma . \n however , dynamic effects for the fast - moving , interacting ions lead to a screened potential that deviates from the average value . the nuclear reaction rates therefore differ from those computed with the mean - field approximation . \n @xcite used the method of molecular dynamics to model the motion of charges in a plasma under solar conditions in order to investigate dynamic screening . \n the advantage of the molecular - dynamics method is that it does not assume a mean field . nor \n does it assume a long - time average potential for the scattering of any two charges , which is necessary in the statistical way to solve poisson s equation to obtain the mean potential in a plasma . \n shaviv and shaviv attribute the differences between their simulations and salpeter s theory to dynamic effects . \n since their claims have been met with skepticism , we have conducted independent molecular - dynamics simulations to confirm the existence of dynamic effects . \n * for consistency , we developed molecular - dynamics simulations using the same basic numerical methods as shaviv and shaviv . to quell the skeptics , we evaluated the validity of each assumption and approximation before implementing it in our own simulations . \n previous publications @xcite describe this process and show that we did not find any errors in the methods used by shaviv and shaviv . \n once we validated their techniques , we used our independently developed simulations to examine dynamic effects in screening . * \n our numerical simulation consisted of a 3-dimensional box with 1000 particles ( half protons and half electrons ) interacting via the coulomb potential . the temperature and density of the solar core ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) provided the velocity distributions and inter - particle spacing . \n we applied periodic boundary conditions and the minimum - image convention . in order to deal with the long - range nature of the coulomb potential \n , we implemented a cut - off radius . with this method , particles separated by a greater distance than the cut - off radius \n were not included in the potential sums as explained in section [ sect : long - range ] . \n quantum effects were included through the use of effective potentials as desribed in section [ sect : qm_effects ] . \n detailed analysis of the use of a cutoff radius and effective quantum potential as well as tests of our simulations can be found elsewhere @xcite . \n the long - range nature of the coulomb potential introduces additional challenges to a molecular - dynamics simulation . for many of the materials \n commonly modeled using molecular dynamics , short - range potentials such as the lennard - jones potential of a simple fluid @xmath9\\ ] ] are appropriate . \n this potential decreases drastically with the separation of the two particles . \n therefore it can be truncated quite reasonably at a distance of @xmath10 . \n the coulomb potential , on the other hand , decays slowly with particle separation . \n particles at much greater distances must be included in order to accurately compute the force on each particle . \n ideally , the contribution of each of the infinite image particles should be included in the potential sums and the potential should never be truncated . \n unfortunately this would take infinite computing time and is therefore impractical . \n fortunately , more efficient techniques have been developed to compute long - range interactions ( see , for example , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) .    in their simulations , \n shaviv and shaviv took advantage of the screening of the plasma to shorten the effective range of the potential . \n they assume that interactions between particles that are farther apart than a few debye lengths will be screened by the surrounding plasma . \n we have tested the truncation of the potential and determined that this assumption is appropriate for our simulation @xcite . \n this enables us to truncate the interactions beyond a few debye lengths , reducing the infinte - range potential to a manageable long - range potential . \n when particles in a two - component plasma are closer than the thermal debroglie wavelength @xmath11 the effects of quantum diffraction and symmetry become significant . \n the thermal debroglie wavelengths for our system are shown in table [ table : debroglie_wavelengths ] . \n .thermal debroglie wavelenghts at @xmath12 [ table : debroglie_wavelengths ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the average interparticle distance in our model is @xmath13 . since @xmath14 , \n a classical treatment is generally sufficient for the protons . \n however , it will be common to have two electrons that are separated by a distance less than @xmath15 , requiring quantum mechanical treatment . \n we therefore include the quantum approximations used by @xcite , i.e. the effective pair potentials derived for a hydrogen plasma by @xcite . \n quantum diffraction effects are described by @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the pair . @xmath19 \n the exclusion principle between electrons is included by adding @xmath20 these potentials only differ from the classical coulomb potential at short distances , where quantum effects are relevant . \n [ plotone ] shows the contribution to the effective potential from quantum corrections to the electrons and protons . \n it is clear that quantum effects for electrons can not be neglected at the high temperature of the solar core . \n the correction for proton - proton pairs is negligible , but electron - proton pairs do experience diffraction effects at close distances . \n therefore we include quantum corrections for both electron - electron and electron - proton interactions . \n 0.5 cm      the goal of this work is to compute the energy exchanged between a pair of approaching protons and the surrounding plasma in order to evaluate the screening energy and the dependence of the screening energy on the relative kinetic energy of the pair . in order to accomplish this goal \n , we use a method similar to that of shaviv and shaviv . the technique for tracking approaching proton pairs and the energy they exchange with the plasma \n is described below . \n \\1 . for each proton @xmath21 , find all protons approaching it . \n choose the closest approaching proton and call it the partner of proton @xmath21 . \n track the pair as they approach and then move apart . \n record their distance of closest approach , @xmath22 , and the energy of the pair at their closest point @xmath23    \\3 . \n continue tracking the pair until they are separated by a distance @xmath24 . for our simulations \n , @xmath25 is a sufficient distance to represent the separation of the pair . at this point , \n record the far - apart energy of the pair @xmath26 beyond this point , the pair is no longer tracked . \n find a new partner for proton @xmath21 , and repeat the process for @xmath21 and its new partner . \n since a proton pair s departure from their closest point to a distance @xmath24 is symmetric to an approach from @xmath24 to @xmath22 , we use the information obtained from the departure to examine the dynamic effect of the plasma on the screening enhancement for interacting proton pairs as they approach a separation at which nuclear reactions are possible . the dynamic information of each proton and its partner _ du jour _ are recorded at each time step . \n first we examine the distribution of the distance of closest approach of proton pairs . fig . \n [ plottwo ] shows the number of pairs that achieved each closest distance @xmath22 . \n we see that most pairs are able to get at least as close as the average distance of neighboring protons @xmath27 . \n .,width=566 ]    -0.2 cm    0.3 cm    as seen in fig . \n [ plotthree ] , pairs of protons with higher far - apart kinetic energy @xmath28 are more likely to get closer to each other than pairs with lower far - apart kinetic energy .     and the closest separation of the pair @xmath22.,width=566 ]    the screening energy is the energy exchanged between a pair of protons and the surrounding plasma . \n it represents the combined effect of the neighboring protons and electrons on the interacting pair . \n salpeter s mean - field theory gives an expression for the average screened coulomb potential that includes the energy exchanged between interacting protons and the plasma during their approach @xmath29 salpeter s theory averages the effect of the kinetic energy of each particle so that the screening energy only depends on distance . \n however , our simulations show that the screening energy also depends on the kinetic energy of the protons . \n protons with high kinetic energy tend to gain less energy from the plasma during the interaction , while protons with low kinetic energy gain more energy from the plasma . \n @xcite refer to this as the dynamic effect .    for the purpose of comparison \n , we define the screening energy in the simulations to be the difference in the energy of the pair when they are far apart and when they are close together . \n @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 since all pairs have the same far - apart distance @xmath24 , @xmath33 this yields a screening energy of @xmath34    a key ingredient in this equation for the screening energy is the difference in the kinetic energy of a pair when the partner protons are far apart and when they are at their closest separation . \n @xmath35 here we examine the relationship between the average change in the kinetic energy of a pair and their distance of closest approach , shown in fig . \n [ plotfour ] . \n this energy change is compared with the coulomb potential and the screened coulomb potential from debye - hckel theory . \n we see that at the distance of closest approach , the average kinetic energy exchanged between a pair of protons and the surrounding plasma has the form of the screened coulomb potential . \n @xmath36 on average , the protons interact in a mean field potential of @xmath37 as salpeter s theory states . \n we can rewrite the average screening energy as @xmath38 as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , leaving us with @xmath41 the average screening energy in the simulation is the same as the average screening energy derived in salpeter s theory . \n this confirms that _ on average _ , the system can be described by the screened coulomb potential of the debye - hckel theory as salpeter contends .     on the closest distance @xmath22 , \n compared with the coulomb potential and screened coulomb potential.,width=566 ]    -0.4 cm    .3 cm    in order to see the dynamic effect on screening , we must look at the relationship between the screening energy and the far - apart kinetic energy of proton pairs . \n [ plotfive ] shows the average energy gained from the plasma by pairs of protons with a given far - apart kinetic energy in the simulation . for comparison , \n the debye - hckel screening energy computed at a distance equal to the average closest - approach disance of pairs of protons with each far - apart kinetic energy is also shown . \n the screening energy of a pair of interacting protons depends on the relative kinetic energy of the pair . \n pairs with far - apart kinetic energy greater than the thermal energy tend to gain less energy from the plasma than the mean - field screening energy , while pairs with lower far - apart kinetic energy gain energy more energy from the plasma than the mean - field screening energy . \n @xmath42    @xmath43    when the screening energy from the simulation is averaged over pairs with all @xmath44 , the result is the same as in salpeter s theory . \n this reaffirms that salpeter s theory is appropriate as a mean - field treatment . \n however , the dynamic effect becomes relevant when pairs with high relative kinetic energy are singled out , as in solar nuclear reactions . \n pairs with far - apart kinetic energy near the gamov energy of p+p reactions ( @xmath45 ) will , on average , lose energy to the plasma rather than gaining energy . \n because of this dependence of the screening energy on the relative kinetic energy of a pair of interacting particles , we conclude that the mean - field approach is not appropriate for computing nuclear reaction rates . \n ( squares ) on the far - apart kinetic energy @xmath46 . \n the debye - hckel screening energy computed at the averege closest - approach distance of pairs of protons with a given far - apart kinetic energy is shown ( circles ) for comparison.,width=566 ]    -0.4 cm    .3 cm \n our simulations confirm that the static debye screening potential describes the average behavior of the plasma as a whole . \n therefore it remains the appropriate treatment for mean - field properties of the system . \n however , dynamic effects are important when particles are singled out based on their velocities . \n pairs of particles with greater relative velocities experience less screening than pairs of particles with lower relative velocities . \n this effect is relevant in nuclear reactions in the sun because they occur at energies that are several times greater than the thermal energy . \n the fast protons from the high - end tail of the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution are most likely to take part in these reactions . \n thus the mean - field approach is not valid in this case . \n we agree with shaviv and shaviv that the formalism for screening in solar nuclear reaction rates should be amended to account for this dynamic effect .", "StartTimeOffset": 2285058072222, "RequestID": "2d45280b4669de0af1165093e352146e63c486e6", "TotalTokens": 3525}

? ? \n * bibby & crowther ( 2012 ) ) , which is most likely due to the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution of hst which allows us to detect fainter wr stars . \n this work highlights the effectiveness of high , spatial resolution narrow - band observations in detecting wr stars . \n if we hope to confirm or , equally important , rule out wr stars as the progenitors of type ib / c sne , then we require a _ complete _ sample of wr stars in several nearby galaxies . \n \\(i ) investigate how the number of wr stars varies with the number of o stars and red supergiants ( rsg ) across the galaxy as a function of metallicity and compare the results to predictions from theoretical evolutionary models . \n \\(iv ) expand our existing catalogue of wr stars which can then be referred to in the event that a type ib / c sne occurs in one of these galaxies . \n this will allow strong , direct observational evidence for , or against , the wr - sne connection .", "StartTimeOffset": 2290902355314, "RequestID": "369a0e208a572b06813e2ddf891b4cee026ef6d3", "TotalTokens": 1560}

[ fig : wz](a ) @xcite . \n one gap , @xmath16 , is associated with photon exchange , while the other , @xmath17 , is associated with the @xmath14 . \n the cross section is proportional to the quark distribution at a large scale and not too small @xmath18 , where the uncertainties of the parton densities are small . to select these events in the early lhc runs \n , we can use the rapidity gap trigger combined with a high @xmath19 lepton or jet trigger . \n an important point here is that the minimum value of @xmath20 of the photon , @xmath21 , is not negligible . \n note that the momentum fraction @xmath22 associated with the upper proton can be measured by summing the momentum fractions of the outgoing @xmath14 and the hadrons observed in the calorimeters . as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : w3 ] the rescattering reduces the cross section by the factor @xmath7 . the curves in fig . \n [ fig : w3 ] were calculated within the scenario where the valence quark is allocated to the component with the smallest absorption and the sea quark to the absorptive component with largest cross section . since the valence quark contribution is more important for @xmath23 production and for the configuration with the largest gap size @xmath24 , the expected gap survival factor @xmath7 is found to be larger .     as a function of @xmath25 calculated using the global soft model of @xcite , assuming that the valence ( sea ) quarks are associated with the weak ( strong ) absorptive components . \n the small spread of the predictions arising from the different partonic content of the diffractive eigenstates means that @xmath14+gaps events offer a meaningful test of the @xmath7 factor.,height=340 ]    in the first lhc data runs the ratio ( @xmath14+gaps/@xmath14 inclusive ) will be measured first . \n this measurement is a useful check of the models for soft rescattering . a good way to study the low impact parameter ( @xmath26 ) region is to observe @xmath15 boson production via @xmath27 fusion , \n see fig . \n [ fig : wz](c ) . here , \n both of the rapidity gaps originate from heavy boson exchange , and the corresponding @xmath26 region is similar to that for exclusive higgs production . \n the expected @xmath15+gaps cross section is of the order of 0.2 pb , and @xmath7=0.3 for @xmath28 and for quark jets with @xmath29 gev @xcite . \n one problem is that even with the @xmath29 gev cut , the qcd background arising from qcd @xmath30 central exclusive production is comparable to the electroweak @xmath31 jet signal . \n therefore , we should concentrate on the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath15 boson , which results in a smaller event rate . \n when the forward proton detectors become operational we can do more . \n both the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the protons can be measured , and we can study the @xmath32 behaviour of the cross section sections and scan the proton opacity @xcite . \n the cross section for the cep of a system @xmath33 essentially has the form @xcite @xmath34 here the factor @xmath35 arises from the integration over the proton transverse momentum . \n also , @xmath5 denotes the generalized unintegrated gluon distribution in the limit of @xmath36 . \n the distribution @xmath5 has not yet been measured explicitly . however , in our case it can be obtained from the conventional diagonal gluon distribution , @xmath37 , known from the global parton analyses , see @xcite for details . \n the main uncertainty here comes from the lack of knowledge of the integrated gluon distribution @xmath38 at low @xmath18 and small scales . \n for example , taking @xmath39 we find that a variety of recent mrst @xcite and cteq @xcite global analyses give a spread of @xmath40 \n . these are big uncertainties bearing in mind that the cep cross section depends on @xmath41 . \n [ t ]     production via ( a ) photon exchange , and ( b ) via odderon exchange.,height=188 ]    to reduce the uncertainty associated with @xmath5 we can measure exclusive @xmath42 production . \n measurement performed by cms @xcite looks quite encouraging . ] \n the process is shown in fig . \n [ fig : upsilon](a ) . \n the cross section for @xmath43 @xcite is given in terms of exactly the same unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath5 that occurs in fig . \n [ fig : parts ] \n . there may be competition between production via photon exchange , fig . \n [ fig : upsilon](a ) , and via odderon exchange , see fig . \n [ fig : upsilon](b ) . to date , odderon exchange has not been observed . on the other hand \n , a lowest - order calculation indicates that the odderon process ( b ) may be comparable to the photon - initiated process ( a ) ( for example , @xcite ) . \n if the upper proton is tagged , it will be straightforward to separate the two mechanisms since odderon production has no @xmath44 . \n singularity characteristic of the photon . \n the expression for @xmath45 is given in @xcite . in order to use this process to constrain the gluon distribution \n it would be preferable to tag the lower proton . \n traditionally , the search for the exclusive dijet signal at the tevatron , @xmath46 , is performed @xcite by plotting the cross section in terms of the variable @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mass of the whole central system . \n the @xmath49 distribution is strongly smeared out by qcd bremsstrahlung , hadronization , the jet searching algorithm and other experimental effects @xcite .     of the whole central system \n does not necessarily occur at @xmath50 . \n the rapidity interval containing the three jets is denoted by @xmath51 , outside of which there is no hadronic activity.[fig:2],height=264 ]    to weaken the role of smearing it was proposed in ref . \n @xcite to study the dijet distribution in terms of a new variable r_j  =  2e_t  ( cosh  ^*)/m_a  , [ eq : j ] where only the transverse energy and the rapidity @xmath52 of the jet with the _ largest _ @xmath53 are used in the numerator . here \n @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rapidity of the whole central system . \n clearly the jet with the largest @xmath53 is less affected by hadronization , final parton radiation etc . at leading order , it is sufficient to consider the emission of a third jet , as shown in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] , where we take all three jets to lie in a specified rapidity interval @xmath51 . \n the cross section @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath57 , for the exclusive production of a pair of high @xmath53 dijets accompanied by a third jet was calculated and discussed in @xcite . \n it was shown that the measurements of the exclusive two- and three - jet cross sections _ as a function of @xmath53 _ of the highest jet allow a detailed check of the sudakov physics ; with much more information coming from the observation of the @xmath51 dependence .    a clear way to observe the effect of the sudakov suppression is just to study the @xmath53 dependence of exclusive dijet production . \n on dimensional grounds we would expect @xmath58 . \n this behaviour is modified by the anomalous dimension of the gluon and by a stronger sudakov suppression with increasing @xmath53 . \n already the existing cdf dijet data @xcite exclude predictions which omit the sudakov effect . \n , and the soft rescattering is on an intermediate parton , giving rise to a gap survival factor @xmath59 ; ( b ) and ( c ) are the reggeon and qcd representations , respectively.,height=226 ]    the soft - hard factorization implied by fig .  [ \n fig : parts ] could be violated by the so - called enhanced reggeon diagrams , caused by the rescattering of an intermediate parton generated in the evolution of @xmath5 . such a diagram is shown in fig . \n [ fig : enh](a ) . \n the contribution of the first pomeron loop diagram , fig . \n [ fig : enh](b ) was calculated in pqcd in ref . \n @xcite . a typical diagram is shown in fig . \n [ fig : enh](c ) . for lhc energies \n it was found that the probability of such rescattering may be numerically large . \n the reason is that the gluon density grows in the low @xmath18 region and , for low @xmath32 partons , approaches the saturation limit . however , as shown in @xcite , the enhanced diagram should affect mainly the very beginning of the qcd evolution  the region that can not be described perturbatively and which , in the calculations of @xcite , is already included phenomenologically .    experimentally , we can study the role of semi - enhanced absorption by measuring the ratio @xmath60 of diffractive events for @xmath14 ( or @xmath42 or dijet ) production as compared to the inclusive process @xcite . \n that is r  =  =   s^2s^2_en_over  b_t , [ eq : ren ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the parton densities determined from the global analyses of inclusive and diffractive dis data , respectively . for @xmath14 or @xmath63 production \n the parton densities @xmath64 are quark distributions , whereas for dijet or @xmath42 they are mainly gluon densities . \n experimentally , we can observe a double distribution @xmath65 , and form the ratio @xmath60 using the inclusive cross section , @xmath66 . \n if we neglect the enhanced absorption , it is quite straightforward to calculate the ratio @xmath60 of ( [ eq : ren ] ) . \n the results for a dijet case are shown by the dashed curves in fig . \n [ fig : upsd ] as a function of the rapidity @xmath55 of the dijet system . \n the enhanced rescattering reduce the ratios and lead to steeper @xmath55 distributions , as illustrated by the continuous curves .     of ( [ eq : ren ] ) for the production of a pair of high @xmath53 jets with ( continuous curves ) and without ( dashed curves ) \n enhanced soft rescattering on intermediate partons.,height=566 ]    perhaps the most informative probe of @xmath67 is to observe the ratio @xmath60 for dijet production in the region @xmath68 gev . \n for example , for @xmath69 15 gev we predict @xmath70 0.25 , 0.4 and 0.8 at @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . \n the addition of forward proton detectors to lhc experiments will add unique capabilities to the existing lhc experimental programme . for certain bsm scenarios \n , the tagged - proton mode may even be the higgs discovery channel . \n there is also a rich qcd , electroweak , and more exotic physics , menu . \n the uncertainties in the prediction of the rate of a cep process are potentially not small . \n therefore , it is crucial to perform checks of the theoretical formalism using processes that will be experimentally accessible in the first runs of the lhc @xcite . \n most of the diffractive measurements described above can be performed , without detecting the forward protons , by taking advantage of the relatively low luminosity in the early lhc data runs . \n this allows the use of a veto trigger to select events with a large rapidity gap(s ) . in this way \n we are able to probe the various individual components of the formalism used to predict the cep cross sections .    to summarise , the gap survival factor , @xmath7 , caused by eikonal rescattering , may be studied as illustrated in fig  [ fig : w3 ] and the possible enhanced , @xmath67 , contributions as shown in figs . \n [ fig : enh ] and [ fig : upsd ] . the relevant unintegrated gluon distribution , @xmath5 , \n can be constrained by observing @xmath42 production , see fig . \n [ fig : upsilon ] , and the qcd radiative effect , @xmath6 , may be checked by observing exclusive two- and three - jet events . \n when the forward proton detectors are operating much more can be done . \n first , it is possible to measure directly the cross section @xmath73 for single diffractive dissociation and also the cross section @xmath74 for soft central diffractive production . \n these measurements will strongly constrain the models used to describe diffractive processes and the effects of soft rescattering . \n the recent predictions can be found in @xcite . \n next , a study of the transverse momentum distributions of both of the tagged protons , and the correlations between their momenta , is able to scan the proton optical density @xcite . \n we thank mike albrow , brian cox , albert de roeck , sasha nikitenko , andy pilkington , and risto orava for encouragement and for valuable advice . \n vak is very grateful to giorgio bellettini , giorgio chiarelli and mario greco for the kind invitation and warm hospitality at la thuile . \n this work was supported by intas grant 05 -

ray are measured for the reconstruction of the compton scattering . \n we did not use the energy of the recoil electron , because the volume of the prototype micro - tpc is so small that the recoil electrons of more than 100 kev escape from the micro - tpc . \n therefore we used the energy of an incident gamma - ray as a known parameter for the reconstruction . \n now we select the events under the following conditions . \n * fiducial volume : we use the events which are in the fiducial volume of the micro - tpc and the scintillator . * @xmath21 : to know the recoil direction , we fit the initial 3 points of the electron track with a straight line . \n therefore we required number of hits ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 . \n * forward - coming gamma - rays : we obtain the gamma - ray images only for the forward - coming gamma - rays , and exclude backward - coming gamma - rays . \n * multiple scattering : the tracks of bad fitting ( rms @xmath24 mm ) are not included in the images . * limit of @xmath3 : we required @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the kinematically minimum of the angle @xmath3 and calculated for a given energy of the incident gamma - ray . * recoil angle : the recoil angle ( @xmath27 in fig . \n [ fig : detector ] ) does not exceed @xmath28 . \n we required @xmath29 . \n * @xmath3 cut ( kinematical background rejection ) : for the kinematical fit , we required @xmath30 as the kinematical constraint .    with these conditions , we obtained images of gamma -

tpc , \n the calculated efficiency is very small , because the area covered by the scintillator is not large enough . \n the calculated efficiency is expected to be very close to the compton scattering probability when we develop a larger scintillator . \n now , for the higher efficiency and better angular resolutions , we are developing a large size micro - tpc with a @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath2-pic and the pixel - type scintillation cameras with larger areas , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : detector ] . \n when we develop a micro - tpc of large size , this camera will have the sensitivity to higher energy gamma -

{"ContextTokens": 3268, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "we are closing in on neutron stars both observationally and theoretically . \n observationally more and better masses and radii are determined by a number of different methods . \n the  large \" masses implied in few cases ( as in the vela x-1 pulsar where a mass of @xmath2 has been suggested ; @xcite ) poses a real challenge to models of neutron stars built using the so - called modern equation of state ( eos ) where the uncertainties are reduced by improved two- and three - body forces , relativistic effects and many - body calculations @xcite . \n even the stiffest eos so far developed seem to be facing difficulty in accounting for the extreme values ( up to @xmath3 ; sect . \n 4 ) . in @xcite , \n hereafter ob , as an alternative , we constructed an eos of dense matter based on the skyrme model for strong interactions which represents baryons as solitons of classic pionic fields . \n the resulting compact objects we named _ skyrmion stars _ ( sss ) @xcite are intrinsically heavier ( due to the stiffness of the skyrmion fluid ; hereafter sf ) than any other type of compact stars computed using modern eos . \n sss can be as massive as @xmath4 leading us to speculate ( given the above mentioned observations ) that these might exist in nature . \n we expect only older sss that have accreted enough mass to reach these extreme masses . ] . \n the paper is presented as follows : sect . \n 2 is devoted to the discussion of the skyrme model and its link to quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n the problem of the _ missing attraction _ in the skyrme model is described . in sect . \n 3 , we discuss the role the dilaton ( the glueball potential in qcd ) could play in curing such a problem by binding skyrmions together to form the sf . \n we end sect . 3 by reminding the reader of the basic properties of the sf and the resulting eos used to construct models of sss . \n the astrophysical implications follow in sect . 4 where we compare sss to stars constructed using modern eos of dense matter . \n we conclude in sect . \n we first give a brief overview of the skyrme model . \n the fundamental principles are discussed at a basic level . \n the interested reader is referred to ref . \n @xcite for a thorough introduction to the topic . \n skyrme constructed a model of pion interactions consisting of a conventional model of weak meson interactions plus an additional ( higher - order ) term thought to take into account indirect effects of heavier mesons like the @xmath5-meson . \n the now well - known skyrme lagrangian density is usually written as @xcite , @xmath6 where , @xmath7 is the skyrme term ( @xmath8 is the chiral field and @xmath9 is interpreted as the pion decay constant ) , and @xmath10 [ u^{+}\\partial^{\\mu}u , u^{+}\\partial^{\\nu}u ] ) \\label{three}\\ ] ] is the quadratic term introduced by skyrme to keep the skyrmion stable against the derrick instability @xcite ( @xmath11 is the skyrme parameter ) . \n skyrme found that his model contained ` topologically nontrivial ' configurations ( extended objects ) of the meson fields , namely topological solitons , which he identified as baryons . for twenty years \n the skyrme model was overshadowed by the tremendous success of qcd and only in the early 1980 s after the establishment of its link to low energy qcd that the model was revived . \n the success of qcd is limited to the high energy regime , while at low energy it remains virtually intractable . \n the reason for this is that qcd has a running coupling constant @xmath12 ; it is a function of momentum transfer , or distance . at short distances of the order of 0.1 fm or less ( high energy and momentum transfer of several gev ) qcd \n is characterized by a small enough @xmath12 that it is treated perturbatively . \n all of the results obtained in this regime are consistent with experimental data . \n this is the phase in which the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons and it is called the asymptotic freedom phase . at large distances of the order of 1 fm or more ( low energy and momentum transfer of 1 gev or less ) @xmath12 is of the order of unity and qcd is a nonperturbative theory . \n this is the confinement phase in which quarks are confined inside hadrons and the hadronic degrees of freedom are more relevant . \n this phase , which is the most practical , is the most mathematically complex . \n it should provide all properties of hadrons such as masses , sizes , magnetic moments , lifetimes , scattering properties and , in principle , all nuclear phenomena . \n the first major step to overcome this problem was taken by @xmath13thooft @xcite . \n he found that in the limit of a large number of colors ( large @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 could be used as an expansion parameter . in this limit \n , qcd simplifies a great deal and @xmath13thooft went on to show that at large @xmath14 , qcd is equivalent to a local field theory of mesons and ` glueballs ' ( bound states of gluons , without quarks ) , with an effective interaction between them of order @xmath15 . \n the second step was taken by witten @xcite . \n assuming confinement , he showed that baryons in large @xmath14 qcd behave much like solitons in a weakly coupled local field theory of mesons . in this limit , \n baryon masses scale as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the strength of the meson coupling , while baryon sizes are of order 1 . \n solitons in weakly coupled theories have masses that scale as @xmath18 and sizes that tend to constants as @xmath17 tends to zero . \n even though the mesons are weakly interacting , the solitons interact strongly as do baryons in qcd . \n the next natural step , it seems , is to derive the effective meson lagrangian from the fundamental qcd lagrangian . \n this task , as it turned out , is immensely difficult . \n its achievement is equivalent to the solution of the intractable original problem of low energy nonperturbative qcd in the confinement phase . \n nevertheless , the form of the resulting effective lagrangian is being narrowed down under reasonable assumptions . \n assuming chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in qcd ( with the physical pions as the resulting goldstone bosons , and taking the low energy limit in which one expects the golstone bosons to dominate the dynamics ) it has been shown that the first term in the resulting low energy effective lagrangian is @xcite : @xmath19 which is astonishingly similar to the skyrme term ( eq .  [ two ] ) ! this picture , which emerged from large-@xmath20 qcd , is precisely what skyrme had in mind long before qcd . \n further work showed that the similarities between the skyrme model and to what is described as the nature of mesons and baryons in large @xmath21 qcd is simply intriguing . \n the skyrme model , however , as it is build was known to predict an isospin independent spin - orbit force with the _ wrong _ sign . \n that is , it predicts a _ repulsive _ interaction . \n the product ansatz for the two - baryon system as suggested in ref . \n @xcite ( eq .  [ two ] ) , beyond its relative simplicity as compared to other two - baryon field configurations which can be found in the literature @xcite , becomes exact for large @xmath22 separation . \n unfortunately , it is not the case for the isoscalar component of the spin - orbit force since the standard skyrme model predicts an isospin independent spin - orbit force with the _ wrong _ sign . \n namely , it predicts a _ repulsive _ interaction while the phenomenological bonn potential @xcite as the paris potential @xcite gives an _ attractive _ one . \n this came to be known as the problem of the _ missing attraction_. extensions of the skyrme model consisted on including higher - order terms in powers of the derivatives of the pion field @xcite . \n expressed in terms of an @xmath23 matrix @xmath8 which , as we have said characterizes the pion field , a six - order term corresponding to @xmath24-meson exchange @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the baryon current , @xmath27 the @xmath24-meson mass and @xmath28 a dimensionless parameter related to the @xmath29 width , might be a good candidate to solve the problem of the @xmath22 isoscalar spin - orbit force . while it was believed that the inclusion of such a term leads to the correct sign ( _ attractive _ interaction ) for the isoscalar spin - orbit potential @xcite , recent calculations ( see ref . \n @xcite for e.g. ) proved that by taking into account the second part of of the sixth - order term the anomaly of the skyrme model ( _ repulsive _ force instead of _ attractive _ ) remains . \n the treatment of the spin - orbit part of the two - pion exchange potential within the skyrme model needed to be improved in order to correct the anomaly of that sign . \n below we explain how and why the dilaton field was suggested as a plausible cure . \n in ref . @xcite and @xcite the authors explored the idea of coupling the skyrmion to the dilaton field . \n this idea to _ account for a scalar field _ \n confines the skyrmion and provides the attractive term missing in the original skyrme formalism ( see ob for more on this ) . \n we start by writing the energy of @xmath30 skyrmions per unit volume ( parameterized by the density , @xmath31 ) at finite temperature . in the mean field approximation \n it is given by ( where we adopt natural units with @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the strength of the coupling of the @xmath35-meson ( of mass @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the mean - field value ) to skyrmions while @xmath38 represents the isospin degrees of freedom ( @xmath39 for neutron matter and @xmath40 for symmetric nuclear matter ) ) , the @xmath5 meson coupling has been omitted which reduces the analysis to symmetric nuclear matter only . as such in ob the isospin degrees of freedom ( @xmath41 ) was taken as a free parameter as to allow for the two regimes  pure neutron matter and symmetric matter  to be explored . ] . \n @xmath42 is the contribution to energy of a single skyrmion while @xmath43 is the skyrmion s momentum . @xmath44 and @xmath45 parameterize the single particle and anti - particle distribution functions . \n the pressure of such an ensemble at @xmath46 is then simply given by @xmath47 . \n one finds that the contribution of the vector meson field ( @xmath35 ) to the pressure grows with density ( @xmath48 ) , and is positive ; the dilaton potential @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the mean - field value ) gives a negative contribution to the pressure , acting to bind the system into a fluid ; the sf . \n once the eos describing such a fluid is derived ( ob ) the corresponding compact objects ( sss ) are then computed @xcite . \n sss in our picture are not boson / soliton stars where the soliton is a global structure over the scale of the star but rather form their constituent baryons as topological solitons using pions fields . \n this is fundamentally different from other \n exotic \" stars which also follow from solutions to an effective non - linear field theory of strong forces ( see also @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . in what follows , we conclude this letter by describing astrophysical cases plausibly supporting the existence of sss in nature . \n in fig .  [ fig.1 ] we compare the @xmath51 relation for skyrmion stars ( ob ) to the theoretical @xmath51 curve obtained using six recent realistic models for the eos ( uu , bbb1 , bbb2 , bpal12 , hyp , and k@xmath52 ) . the solid curves labeled ss1 and ss2 are for strange stars ( the data was kindly provided to us by the authors of ref . \n the triangle depicts the mass - radius constraint from fits to x - ray bursts in 4u 1636 - 53 . inside the triangle \n is the allowed range of @xmath53 and @xmath54 which satisfies the compactness constraints as modeled in ref . \n @xcite ( see their figure 4 ) , and clearly favoring stiffer eoss . \n our modeled stars ( ob ) cross the triangle suggestive of 4u 1636 - 53 as a plausible ss candidate . \n _ qpos _ are neutron stars emitting x - rays at frequencies of the orbiting accreting matter \n . such _ quasi - periodic oscillations _ ( qpo ) have been found in 12 binaries of neutron stars with low mass companions . \n if the qpo originate from the innermost stable orbit @xcite ) of the accreting matter , their observed values imply that the accreting neutron star has a mass of @xmath55 in the case of 4u 1820 - 30 ; this would rule out most modern eoss allowing only the stiffest ones . \n sss is one possibility given that the gravitational mass of the maximum stable non - rotating ss has a value of @xmath4 ( ob ) . for completeness \n , one should note that even by making the modern / recent eos stiffer at high densities in a smooth way , the maximum mass can never exceed @xmath56 due to the causality condition @xcite . \n we gave a brief historical overview of the skyrme model , its predictions of hadronic interactions and its interesting connection to qcd . \n here we showed how the repulsive term in the skyrme model can be removed by coupling the skyrmion to the dilaton field . \n this lead to the concept of the skyrmion fluid and the related hypothetical stars we called skyrmion stars . \n the stiffness of the skyrmion fluid allows for sss to be as massive as @xmath57 . \n the sss show unique features ; for a given mass their radii are in general larger than those of neutron stars constructed using modern eoss . \n we discussed examples in astrophysics where sss might constitute plausible candidates . \n future observations constraining the mass - radius plane of compact stars would most likely prove or rule out the existence of sss in nature . \n * acknowledgements . \n * i am grateful to s. morsink , g. klbermann and r. bhaduri for encouraging help and valuable discussions . \n the research of r.o . is supported by grants from the natural science and engineering council of canada ( nserc ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2325023350620, "RequestID": "1979eef5d562c7790a77cf081e7e1d167f0ab092", "TotalTokens": 3406}

shell @xmath24 production . assuming that electron and positron beam polarizations of 80 and 60% respectively are achieved at a 500 gev linear collider , and that the cross section can be measured with 1% precision \n , we find that , for example , the case @xmath17 can be distinguished from @xmath25 for values of @xmath26 up to 4.6 tev . \n ( if the uncertainty is purely statistical , 1% error on the cross section measurement corresponds to integrated luminosity of about 270 fb@xmath27 . ) \n note , however , that the photon energy distributions for the cases of gravitino emission and @xmath18 add model are extremely close . \n it is not likely that the ambiguity between these two cases can be resolved by this measurement . \n we have also studied whether performing a more restrictive angular cut could help in distinguishing between the cases of gravitino and @xmath18 graviton emission . from fig . \n [ p311diffcs2 ] it appears that the two signals have discernible differences at small values of @xmath15 . \n we have found , however , that with the assumed 1% precision on the cross section measurement , this analysis will not be able to conclusively separate these two cases . \n another way to distinguish between models is by varying the collider center of mass energy @xmath28 . \n the tesla study  @xcite has shown that measuring cross sections at two design center of mass energies , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , allows to determine the number of extra dimensions in the add models for a wide range of parameters . \n for example , if there are two extra dimensions , the @xmath25 case can be excluded at 99% cl for values of @xmath26 up to 6.1 tev . \n the beam polarizations assumed in  @xcite coincide with the values chosen for our analyses here . \n while upgrading the linear collider energy from 500 gev to 800 gev , for example , will take much time , effort and money , the beam energy can be changed by as much as 5% without significantly disrupting the operation of the collider . therefore , it is interesting to study if different models can be distinguished by performing measurements at two center of mass energies separated by 5% . \n we have performed such a study using pandora . \n we have chosen the scales of each model so that their cross sections ( with the same cuts and polarizations as before ) are identical at @xmath31 gev , and evaluated their differences at @xmath32 gev . taking the standard model background into account and assuming that the cross sections at each energy can be measured with 1% precision , we find that the @xmath17 and @xmath25 cases can be distinguished at the 3@xmath33 level for @xmath34 tev . \n the sensitivity of this method is thus somewhat lower than for studying photon energy distributions . \n surprisingly , the scaling of the gravitino pair production cross section with @xmath28 is again identical to the @xmath18 add model . \n changing collider energy does not help in separating these two cases . \n we conclude that while the add models with @xmath35 can be distinguished from the supersymmetric models with light gravitino by carefully studying the photon + missing energy signal alone , this can not be done for the case of 6 extra dimensions . \n ( let us note in passing that the missing energy signal in the @xmath18 add model is also identical to the one due to the emission of scalar states associated with the brane coordinates  @xcite . ) in this case , distinctions between the models will only occur with additional phenomena . \n the next -

{"ContextTokens": 3682, "GeneratedTokens": 157, "SynthesizedBody": "according to several researchers , the puzzling pseudogap ( pg ) phenomenon in high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htsc ) is caused by some sort of hidden order . \n this is supported by the observation of a depression in the density of states at the fermi level , with no order parameter responsible for this depression observed yet @xcite . \n rotating antiferromagnetism ( raf ) has been recently proposed as a possible candidate for this hidden order , and several physical quantities have already been calculated within the raf theory ( raft ) with good agreement with available experimental data @xcite . \n raf is one of several other proposals for the pg ( see ref . \n @xcite for a discussion ) . \n contrary to theories of circulating currents @xcite , raf is based on the concept of an order parameter that has a finite magnitude below a critical temperature but a time - dependent phase @xcite . \n note that all the physical quantities that have so far been calculated within raft do not depend on the phase of the order parameter in raf @xcite . \n the lack of the time dependence profile for this phase limited however the full understanding of the nature of raf . \n the purpose of this work is to calculate this phase as a function of time using a combination of raft and the heisenberg equation . \n we show that it varies linearly with time . as a consequence of this time dependence \n , raf can be interpreted as a @xmath2 unusual spin wave around a zero local magnetization or as a synchronized larmor - like precession of all the spins in the system . because the phase of this order parameter is time dependent , it was not possible to calculate it in raft alone , which is a mean - field approach . \n this paper is organized as follows . \n first in sec . \n [ sec2.1 ] we rederive raft using the spin ladder operators , which are necessary for the phase calculation . in sec . \n [ sec2.2 ] , we review raft . then in sec . \n [ sec2.3 ] we use the heisenberg equation to get the time dependence for the spin ladder operators , which yields the time dependence of the phase of the rotating order parameter . in sec . \n [ sec2.4 ] , the interpretation of raf as an unusual @xmath2 spin wave is explained . \n finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . \n as we are only interested in understanding the nature of the pg phase of htscs in this work , we restrict ourselves to the non superconducting phase . \n consider the @xmath3-@xmath4 hubbard model in two dimensions : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 designate summation over nearest and second - nearest neighboring sites , respectively . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are electron hopping energies to nearest and second - nearest neighbors , respectively . because the phase of raf is related to the spin ladder operators , it is useful to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) using these operators . \n using the spin ladder operator written in second quantization @xmath8 , the onsite coulomb repulsion term @xmath9 can on one hand be cast in the form @xmath10 and on the other hand as @xmath11 . summing and dividing by 2 yields the symmetrized expression @xmath12 . \n the latter can be proved by calculating the action of each side of the equality on the possible states @xmath13 due to pauli exclusion principle , and @xmath14 . for our many - body system , sites are neither full nor empty , but are on average occupied by a density smaller than 1 away from half filling . \n therefore , the terms @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are responsible for onsite spin - flip excitations , will contribute by lowering energy for the sites that are partially occupied by the same density of spin up and down electrons . \n one can decouple this term in mean - field theory using @xmath17 , which leads to a collective behavior for the spin - flips , and the results obtained in this way are the same as in raft @xcite . in this state , a spin flip process at site @xmath18 is simultaneously accompanied by another one at another site @xmath19 ; the occurrence of the spin flips is synchronized . \n thermal motion has obviously an effect on this order as it does on conventional orders ; i.e. , above a critical temperature ( identified with the pg temperature ) the spin - flip processes become uncorrelated , leading to the disappearance of the long - range non conventional order . \n the spin - flip processes , which are purely quantum , continue to exist even above this critical temperature , but in an incoherent disordered manner . \n the occurrence in raft of a second - order phase transition at the pg temperature is consistent with experimental data supporting its existence @xcite . \n we rederive raft , which deals with the static part ( magnitude ) of the order parameter @xmath20 , using the spin ladder operators then for the dynamic ( phase ) part we will use the heisenberg equation to find its time dependence . to the best of our knowledge the combination of mean - field theory and the heisenberg equation of quantum mechanics constitutes a novel approach for the pg in htscs .    the parameter latexmath:[$q_i={\\langle c_{i,\\uparrow}c^{\\dag}_{i,\\downarrow}\\rangle } = -\\langle s_i^-\\rangle \\equiv    of the @xmath3-@xmath4 hubbard model . \n consider the ansatz where @xmath22 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 labeling any two adjacent lattice sites . except for this difference of @xmath23 between the phases of the order parameter on two adjacent sites , the phases @xmath24 are site independent and assume any value in @xmath25 $ ] . \n the normal state hamiltonian in raft @xcite is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of sites , and @xmath28 is the expectation value of the number operator . because of antiferromagnetic correlations the lattice consists of two sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , even though there is no long - range static antiferromagnetic order . \n the summation runs over the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) . \n the nambu spinor is @xmath31 , and the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath32 yielding the energy spectra @xmath33 where @xmath34 \\cr % & & + 4t_5\\cos(2k_x)\\cos(2k_y ) % + 4t_6[\\cos k_x\\cos(3k_y ) + \\cos(3k_x)\\cos k_y ] ; $ ] , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 \\cr % & & -2t_4[\\cos(3k_x ) + \\cos(3k_y ) ] ; $ ] . because the energy spectra @xmath37 do not depend on the phase @xmath38 one should be able to transform @xmath39 to a matrix that does not depend on the phase \n this can indeed be done using the spin - dependent gauge transformation @xmath40 and @xmath41 . \n this transformation is equivalent to performing a rotation by angle @xmath42 about the @xmath43 axis for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 components of the spin operator . \n indeed , upon using this gauge transformation , the spin ladder operators transform according to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which yields : @xmath48 the thermal averages of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by @xmath51 note that @xmath52 for @xmath18 in both sublattices . because the phase @xmath38 assumes any value between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see below ) , rotational symmetry will not look broken for times greater than the period of rotation . \n however if the typical time scale of a probe is much smaller than this period symmetry may appear broken . \n the magnitude @xmath55 , which was calculated using the minimization of the mean - field free energy @xcite , behaves as in a second - order phase transition in agreement with experimental evidence in @xcite . \n next we calculate the phase using the heisenberg equation @xmath56 $ ] . \n we consider the limit where electron hopping is neglected in comparison to @xmath57 . \n the limit considered here is @xmath58-@xmath59 ; this is an intermediate coupling limit where @xmath60 but smaller than the bandwidth @xmath61 when @xmath62 . \n it is justified to use this approximation because spin dynamics is faster than charge dynamics ; i.e. , an onsite spin flip needs a time @xmath63 to be realized , while a charge hopping between adjacent sites takes a longer time @xmath64 , ( @xmath60 ) . in the heisenberg equation \n the undecoupled interaction is used instead of raft s hamiltonian ( [ raft hamiltonian ] ) in order to treat as best as possible quantum fluctuations . to carry on the calculation \n , we keep in mind that any site @xmath19 is on average only partially occupied , and that @xmath65 . for this reason , terms like @xmath66 and @xmath67 \n should be kept until the end ( these terms normally give zero when acting on a spin up state , but a nonzero contribution is expected when applied to a partially occupied state where thermal averages are meaningful and suitable ) . in the commutator of the heisenberg equation @xmath68\\approx -\\frac{u}{2}[s_j^+,(s_j^+s_j^- + s_j^-s_j^+)]$ ] , we need to calculate @xmath69=[s_j^+,s_j^+s_j^- ]   + [ s_j^+,s_j^-s_j^+]=2\\hbar(s_j^+s_j^z + s_j^zs_j^+)$ ] . using the fundamental commutation relation @xmath70=\\hbar s_j^+$ ] , one gets @xmath71 , which leads to @xmath72 again we stress that this equation is obtained in the intermediate coupling limit ( @xmath73 smaller than the bandwidth but higher than hopping energies ) , where spin dynamics is not governed by the heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath74 suitable for the strong coupling limit . \n ( [ heisenberg eq ] ) gives zero when acting on state @xmath75 or @xmath76 . \n however , for a collective state where any site is only partially occupied , one has to take the thermal average of eq . \n ( [ heisenberg eq ] ) . \n one then replaces @xmath77 by its raft s thermal average , which is zero . integrating eq . \n ( [ heisenberg eq ] ) gives for the thermal average @xmath78 which yields @xmath79 modulo @xmath54 when @xmath80 is identified with @xmath81 , ( @xmath82 ) , for sublattice @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 . \n the angular frequency is thus @xmath85 , and period @xmath86 is the time required to perform a spin - flip process , or the time needed for the rotating order parameter @xmath87 to complete a @xmath54 revolution in a classical point of view . \n the magnetic configuration ( [ mag config ] ) takes on the following form @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath90 , @xmath91 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath30 , and @xmath92 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath30 .      to illustrate well rotating magnetic order , consider first the much simpler example of the time evolution of a single spin in a magnetic field @xmath30 along the @xmath43-axis , with the initial state given for a spin pointing in the positive @xmath44-direction by @xmath93 . \n the time - dependent expectation values of the spin components are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 . \n @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the charge and mass of the electron , respectively , and @xmath100 is the speed of light . \n classically speaking , the spin is confined to rotate about the @xmath43-axis in the @xmath101 plane with larmor angular frequency @xmath102 . \n a rotating ferromagnetic state can be realized by placing @xmath27 such states with the same frequency on a lattice made of @xmath27 sites . for a rotating antiferromagetic state , \n opposite initial states ( @xmath103 : spins point in opposite directions on the @xmath44-axis ) are required on each two adjacent sites of the lattice . to relate raf to spin flip processes , we note that @xmath104 in this example . \n note that in this example is model independent , which may indicate that all model parameters will do is changing multiplying physical factors , not the physics itself . in a given model , \n a coupling is necessary for providing the building bloc for raf , which is the precession of a spin ( with no local magnetization ) for each lattice site . \n the raf state constructed in this way shows a hidden order that can be realized even at finite temperature without violating the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . \n the example above allows us to interpret raf as a state where spins precess collectively in a synchronized manner in the spins @xmath101 plane around an effective staggered magnetic field @xmath105 caused by onsite coulomb repulsion . for our many - body system , @xmath106 in @xmath107 \n is replaced by the magnitude of the raf order parameter @xmath55 , which can assume values smaller than @xmath108 due to thermal averaging . this state is strongly doping dependent . \n when doping increases , @xmath55 rapidly decreases then vanishes at a doping identified as the quantum critical point underneath the superconducting dome @xcite . in comparison to ordinary spin waves in an antiferromagnet , \n raf s state could be viewed as a @xmath0 spin wave in an antiferromagnet with zero magnetization . \n note however that for our system ( where @xmath52 ) , spin - wave theory is not applicable because the spin - wave theory is built around a stable nonzero @xmath109 state . \n the rotating antiferromagnetism theory and heisenberg equation are combined in order to calculate the phase of the rotating order parameter . \n this phase behaves linearly in time . \n this allows us to interpret rotating antiferromagnetism in terms of a larmor - like spin precession about an effective magnetic field , which is proportional to onsite coulomb repulsion . \n another way to see rotating antiferromagnetism is as an unusual spin - wave at @xmath0 around a zero magnetization . \n this work was necessary for unveiling the nature of rotating antiferromagnetism , which has been proposed for explaining the pseudogap behavior in high-@xmath1 materials . \n rotating antiferromagnetic order is an example of hidden order , which is a serious candidate for the pg state in htscs . \n this is supported by the good success of the rotating antiferromagnetism theory in the calculation of thermodynamics @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , raman @xcite , and angle -

{"ContextTokens": 3517, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "zirconium alloys are widely used as fuel cladding and structural materials in water cooled nuclear reactors . the principal role of the cladding is to provide a physical barrier between the fuel and the coolant thereby ensuring radionuclides remain contained within the fuel pin , while protecting the nuclear fuel from a strong flow of hot , potentially corrosive water or water / steam mix .    in the past four decades \n a number of compositional and processing changes have been made to improve the mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of zr alloys@xcite . \n concurrently with the increased durability and reliability of the cladding ( and structural elements of the reactor core ) the fuel burnup has also increased , leading to a reduction in energy production costs . \n one of the limiting factors for a further increase in fuel burnup is the hydrogen pick - up of zr alloys . \n the presence of h in the cladding is of concern for a variety of reasons including dimensional changes , reduced ductility of the metal , and the formation of hard , brittle hydrides , which in turn may increase corrosion rates or cause failure by delayed hydride cracking@xcite . \n new nuclear fuel cycle regulations that take into account hydrogen levels in the cladding are also being considered@xcite . \n it is , therefore , essential to develop a deeper understanding of the processes responsible for the h pick - up , in order to deliver improved reactor performance , from both economic and safety standpoints . \n recent work@xcite has been carried out to investigate , from first principles , the structure , stability and mechanical properties of hydrides within the zr metal . \n the current work , instead , focuses on interaction between h and the second phase particles ( spps ) formed within the zr alloys . \n most alloying elements that are typically used in zr alloys have very limited solubility in @xmath0-zr , and therefore tend to precipitate as intermetallic spps@xcite . \n the main exceptions are sn , which exhibits solid solubility in @xmath0-zr at alloying concentrations of interest , and nb , which precipitates out as @xmath2-(zr , nb ) solid solution at operating temperature and below , as well as forming intermetallic spps in the presence of fe . \n further details are provided in section  [ sec : xtal ] . \n the interaction between the spps and h is not yet well understood . \n it remains unclear whether the spps act as traps for h , provide nucleation sites for hydrides , or whether they may act as a preferred transport path through the outer oxide layer for ingress of h into the metal@xcite .    in our previous work@xcite \n we employed atomic scale computer simulations , based on density functional theory ( dft ) , to investigate the solubility of h in zr intermetallics of particular importance for zircaloy-2 and zircaloy-4 alloys . here \n , the study is extended to other binary intermetallics of zr ( containing cu , fe , mo , ni , nb , sn and v ) , which are either directly relevant to fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors , or have been used in model alloys to understand the role spps play in controlling the h pick - up . \n all dft simulations were carried out using castep@xcite . the exchange and correlation functional employed was the generalized gradient approximation , as formulated by the perdew burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite . \n ultra - soft pseudo potentials with a consistent cut - off energy of were used throughout . a high density of * k*-points was employed for the integration of the brillouin zone , following the monkhost - pack sampling scheme@xcite : the distance between sampling points was maintained as close as possible to and never above . in practice \n this means a sampling grid of @xmath3 points for the largest intermetallic supercells . \n the fast fourier transform grid was set to be twice as dense as that of the wavefunctions , with a finer grid for augmentation charges scaled by 2.3 . due to the metallic nature of the system , density mixing and \n methfessel - paxton@xcite cold smearing of bands were employed with a width of . \n testing was carried out to ensure a convergence of was achieved with respect to all of the above parameters . \n no symmetry operations were enforced and all calculations were spin polarised , taking particular care in finding the lowest energy spin state of phases containing magnetic elements . \n the energy convergence criterion for self - consistent calculations was set to . \n similarly robust criteria were imposed for atomic relaxation : energy difference @xmath4  , forces on individual atoms @xmath4   and for constant pressure simulations stress component on cell @xmath4  . \n many different types of spps have been reported in the literature relating to zr alloys , often with little agreement on their chemical composition and crystal structure . in this section \n we report a summary of the possible spps that can form between zr and each of the alloying elements under investigation ( see table  [ tab : supercells ] ) .    . \n [ tab : supercells ] overview of all compounds investigated for the accommodation of h , together with the size of the largest supercell simulated in terms of the number of atoms ( @xmath5 ) and smallest distance between the h defect and its replicas ( @xmath6 ) . for laves phases , \n m = cr , fe , mo , nb , v. [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the zrm@xmath1 phases , little variation in the accommodation of h was observed between the three laves structures @xmath7 , therefore the results from zrm@xmath1 simulations have been condensed into a single value for each element and the statistical error is reported . \n similarly , the three models of the zr@xmath8sn@xmath9 phase were reported as one . \n the exact values of @xmath10(h ) were @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ev for @xmath14 respectively . \n for the case of zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 , the lowest energy site was the only unoccupied @xmath16 wyckoff site . \n it is reasonable to expect a large number of unoccupied sn self - interstitial sites in this phase , therefore the defect energy was calculated as an interstitial defect into a phase with one unoccupied sn self - interstitial site , rather than the substitutional defect h@xmath17 in the fully occupied zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 structure . \n zr@xmath8sn@xmath9 , exhibits two preferred sites : the @xmath18 site between 3 zr atoms , and , directly above and below it , the @xmath16 site between 6 zr atoms . \n the relative preference for h of one site over the other changes as a function of sn content . at a content of three sn atoms per formula unit , the trigonal @xmath18 site is preferred ( against of the octahedral site ) . as the sn content increase to 3.5 , half of the @xmath16 sites \n are occupied by the excess sn . \n the presence of a sn atom in the @xmath16 site , causes a reduction in space in the neighbouring @xmath18 sites , while only marginally affecting the configuration of other ( unoccupied ) @xmath16 sites in the cell . \n this is reflected in the solution of h in the two sites : the @xmath18 site becomes significantly less favourable ( ) , while the @xmath16 provides a similar solution enthalpy as in the previous case ( ) . in the case of zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 all of the @xmath16 sites are occupied , consequently the @xmath18 sites are compressed by two sn atoms , one above and one below , reducing the volume available for accommodation of h even further , and the enthalpy associated with accommodating an h atom in that site becomes positive and large ( ) . \n the current work shows that @xmath2-zr accommodates h more readily than @xmath0-zr ( in agreement with experimental data@xcite ) , and that @xmath2-nb exhibits the same value of @xmath10(h ) as @xmath0-zr . \n this suggests that , if the @xmath2-(nb , zr ) solid solution found in binary zr - nb alloys behaves similarly to its two end members , those alloys do not contain any strong sinks for h. nevertheless , the formation of metastable zrnb@xmath1 phases may affect this , as discussed below .    regarding the zrm@xmath1 laves phases , \n the solution enthalpy of h generally decreases with increasing number of @xmath6 electrons in the transition metal m : from highest to lowest affinity nb , v , cr , mo and fe . \n the same trend has been observed with respect to h solution capacity@xcite . whilst h does not prefer to dissolve in the laves phases containing the latter three elements \n ( i.e. cr , mo , and fe ) compared to @xmath0-zr , the intermetallics formed with either nb or v offer favourable sites for the accommodation of h. this suggests that if these binary spps are present in the cladding , h will likely segregate to them , which may deplete the h content in the zirconium metal . \n the beneficial effect of the h sinks may , however , be limited to the initial stages of the fuel cycle . at higher burnups , \n the intermetallic particles are likely to dissolve@xcite , amorphise or oxidise , thereby releasing any stored h. in addition to zrnb@xmath1 and zrv@xmath1 , all zr - rich phases provided lower @xmath10(h ) values compared to @xmath0-zr . \n furthermore , for each element where more than one stoichiometric phase is present ( cu , fe , ni and sn ) , those with the largest zr / m ratio provided the lowest solution enthalpy for h ( see figure  [ fig : h_sol - m_content ] ) . \n zr is known to exhibit higher affinity for h compared to cu , fe and ni ( see the extremes of figure  [ fig : h_sol - m_content ] ) , therefore a decrease in enthalpy of solution with increasing zr content is expected . however , from a volumetric standpoint , intermetallic phases have a lower packing fraction compared to the pure metals , offering a larger number of interstitial sites with varying amounts of space . \n for this reason intermetallic phases are expected to exhibit lower defect volumes ( and associated strain fields ) when accommodating an h interstice . as a result of the two competing processes \n chemical bonding and volumetric effects  the lowest solution enthalpies are found , as mentioned above , for zr - rich intermetallic phases that provide interstitial sites with 4-fold zr - coordination .    unlike other alloying additions , \n fe forms a wide range of intermetallic compounds , and their relative stability is greatly affected by other alloying elements : zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) spps are commonly observed in the absence of cr additions , while in cr - containing alloys , zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 laves phases become the dominant spps@xcite . in the presence of nb , hexagonal zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 laves phases and cubic ( zr , nb)@xmath1fe phases have been reported@xcite . \n similarly , the few records of sn - zr spps also report some fe solubility into these particles@xcite . \n this suggests that the addition of fe does not influence which intermetallic phases form , rather it will go into solution in all or most of the spps present . assuming that a ternary phase behaves similarly to its binary end members , solution of fe in zrm@xmath1 laves phases and zr@xmath1x phases , is expected to reduce their affinity to h , since zrfe@xmath1 and zr@xmath1fe exhibit less favourable @xmath19 compared to all other phases with the same stoichiometry and structure . \n the opposite can be said for the zr@xmath20fe - type spps . \n owing to the fact that both zrcr@xmath1 and zrfe@xmath1 have unfavourable @xmath19 values , it is predicted that the ternary zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 phase , found predominantly in zircaloy-4 , does not getter h from the surrounding @xmath0-zr . as for the zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) , which is the predominant spp in zircaloy-2 , both of its binary end members offer favourable solution enthalpies for h. nonetheless \n , the difference in affinity to h with respect to @xmath0-zr is rather small ( on the order of ) , and is expected to diminish with increasing fe content . \n such small differences in energy may easily be overcome by thermal and entropic effects , consequently zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) are not expected to be strong sinks for h in solution . whilst it is possible to speculate on the behaviour of ternary phases where both binary end members have either positive or negative @xmath19 values , it is much harder to predict the h affinity of other ternary spps such as zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 found in zirlo alloys . \n it is possible , however , to expect that the behaviour of such spps is strongly correlated to their chemical composition , and more specifically the nb / fe ratio of the intermetallic particle . \n if @xmath21 then the spps may act as h sinks , whilst with a composition of @xmath22 they are not likely to accommodate any h.    under irradiation , fe has been reported to diffuse out of the spps faster than other elements@xcite . in the case of laves phases , and \n especially nb - containing laves phases , the current work suggests that this would increase the affinity of the residual spp for h. however , concomitantly to the dissolution of fe , the spps are reported to undergo amorphisation and at present it is impossible to predict how this will affect the interaction between h and the spp . \n dft simulations have been employed to calculate the enthalpy of solution of h in pure zr , nb and in intermetallic phases of zr . \n pure @xmath2-zr exhibits more favourable solution enthalpy for h relative to @xmath0-zr , however the difference is predicted to diminish in the presence of nb . regarding the laves spps , the presence of nb or v is predicted to increase the affinity with h , whilst the presence of cr , mo and fe will reduce it . \n cu , ni and sn additions may form a number of binary intermetallic phases , but tend to stabilise as zr - rich phases . \n all zr - rich phases , namely zr@xmath20fe , zr@xmath1ni , zr@xmath1cu and zr@xmath20sn , provide lower energy sites for h accommodation , compared to @xmath0-zr , suggesting that their presence in the alloy could provide sinks for h.    with regards to the more commonly observed ternary spps , it is predicted that zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) ( found mainly in zircaloy-2 ) and @xmath2-(zr , nb ) precipitates ( present in all nb containing alloys ) exhibit an affinity to h similar to that of @xmath0-zr , and are therefore not expected to strongly getter h from their surroundings . \n zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 spps found in zircaloy-4 are predicted to have very unfavourable solution enthalpies for h and therefore not to accommodate any h. the affinity to h of the zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 spps , present in zirlo alloys , is expected to vary strongly with nb / fe ratio : high nb content spps are expected to trap h , whilst high fe content spps will reject it . \n we would like to thank the epsrc , ansto and the uk -

{"ContextTokens": 4052, "GeneratedTokens": 96, "SynthesizedBody": "an intriguing point of conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics is the question of unitarity . \n for example , if hawking radiation @xcite is truly thermal , as predicted by semi - classical general relativity , then the complete evaporation of a black - hole would imply the loss of all the information that has passed into it . \n this is clearly a non - unitary evolution . \n in contrast quantum mechanics is globally unitary . \n several possible solutions to this problem have been put forward focusing on the black hole example . \n these can be grouped into two camps : those that argue that a full theory of quantum gravity will enable information to escape from black holes , thus restoring unitarity @xcite and ; those that argue that such a full theory will inevitably be non - unitary @xcite . \n it has recently been shown that there is no `` easy fix '' to the problem in terms of hidden correlations @xcite . in this paper \n we use a toy model to suggest a third alternative : that from the usual point of view the information _ is _ lost , however if we allow exotic measurement techniques it can be recovered , demonstrating that the fundamental evolution is unitary . \n the key physics in our approach is that we consider different space - time histories to be distinguishable and allow them to add coherently . \n perhaps the simplest example of a model combining general relativistic and quantum mechanical evolutions that naturally leads to non - unitarity was introduced by deutsch @xcite and later developed by bacon @xcite . the deutsch - bacon ( d - b ) model assumes that time - like curves can be created , as predicted by the metric introduced by morris et al @xcite . \n time - like curves allow a particle to follow a trajectory into its own past . \n the model considers a broad class of interactions between two - level quantum systems ( qubits ) and time - like curves and shows that , whilst self consistent solutions are always possible , the solutions are in general non - unitary . \n an interesting feature of this model is that , if we assume time - like curves can exist @xcite , then we can solve the resulting evolutions consistently without requiring a full theory of quantum gravity . \n in contrast , the final stages of evaporation of a black hole would appear to intrinsically require a full theory of quantum gravity . \n consider the situation depicted in fig.1(a ) . \n two qubits are involved . \n qubit 1 is free propagating . \n qubit 2 is trapped on a closed time - like curve formed by two mouths of a wormhole . \n the wormhole acts as a time machine @xcite . \n qubit 2 enters the future mouth of the wormhole at time @xmath0 and emerges at an earlier time @xmath1 from the past mouth of the wormhole . \n it then propagates forward in time for @xmath2 till @xmath0 where it completes the causal loop by entering the future mouth of the wormhole . \n qubit 1 is allowed to interact with qubit 2 via an arbitrary unitary interaction @xmath3 . \n no other interactions are allowed with qubit 2 . \n this is indicated on the figure by the dotted box . \n we desire the final state of qubit 1 , after the interaction .    . \n wf is the future mouth of the wormhole and wp is the past mouth of the wormhole.,width=302 ]    d - b propose the following formalism to treat this situation and show that it always leads to a consistent solution : ( i ) determine the state of qubit 2 , given by the density operator @xmath4 , via the consistency equation @xmath5 \\label{sp1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the initial state of qubit 1 and the trace is over the hilbert space of qubit 1 . given a solution for @xmath4 , the output state of qubit 1 , @xmath7 , is given by @xmath8 \\label{sp2}\\ ] ] where the trace is now over the hilbert space of qubit 2 . \n in general the solution for @xmath7 will be non - unitary and a nonlinear function of the input state . \n for example , if we take the unitary to be a controlled - not gate followed by a swap gate , i.e. @xmath9 , and consider a pure input state , @xmath10 , we find , using eq.[sp1 ] and [ sp2 ] , that the density operator of the output state is given by @xmath11 the solution is clearly non - unitary as @xmath7 is diagonal and hence all coherences have been lost . \n the output is also a non - linear function of the input state , a point we will return to at the end of this paper .    to recap , we see that the d - b model predicts a pure input state can be scattered into a mixed output state . even in principle \n , we can not access qubit 2 after we pass the time @xmath0 at which it enters the future mouth of the wormhole , and hence it would seem information about the scattered qubit is truly lost . the non - unitarity is explicitly put into the model via the traces in eqs [ sp1 ] and [ sp2 ] . \n the traces are required in order to guarantee that consistent solutions can always be found , however it would be more significant if a physical mechanism for the non - unitary behaviour could be identified . here \n we introduce a different analysis of the d - b model that reveals such a mechanism . in the appropriate limits we reproduce several examples of the non - unitary evolutions of d - b . \n the calculations are performed in the heisenberg picture and do not involve any explicit traces . \n in fact , it is found that when interactions are chained in the appropriate way the evolution _ is _ in fact reversible . \n thus the non - unitarity is only apparent and the evolutions can be understood as fundamentally unitary processes . \n we speculate that this effect may be more general than this specific model . \n an equivalent formulation of the problem of fig.1(a ) is shown in fig.1(b ) . now an additional swap gate is implicitly included in the arbitrary unitary @xmath12 , i.e. the two circuits ( fig.1(a ) and ( b ) ) are exactly equivalent if @xmath13 . \n the time - like curve is no longer explicitly closed and in some sence there is now only one qubit . \n the region of time in which two qubits are present can be understood as the past and present representations of a single qubit . \n again , the dotted box demarks the region in which interactions with the qubit are forbidden . in the appendix \n we contrive a space - time representation of the circuit of fig.1(b ) that explicitly prevents acausal effects for an external observer . \n we can solve this alternative formulation in the heisenberg picture by considering the evolution of the pauli operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 , representing a complete set of observables for the qubit . \n we take the initial state to be @xmath16 and explicitly include state preparation in the evolution . \n expectation values can be evaluated by evolving the observables back in time through the circuit from the measurement point to the initial state @xcite . \n the evolution is evaluated in the free - fall reference frame of the qubit . in order to do this \n we need to introduce an explicit temporal parameterization of the observables . \n we take @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is an idealized , instantaneous pauli operator acting at time @xmath0 and @xmath20 is a distribution function describing the uncertainty in when the operator acts . \n we assume that the standard deviation , @xmath21 of the distribution function @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath2 , such that on the scale of fig.1(b ) the qubit behaves as a point particle . \n we also assume that the same distribution function describes the final measurement , the collision unitary and the initial state preparation . in the reference frame of the qubit \n two collisions occur , one before entering the wormhole and the other after leaving it . \n these collisions are both _ with itself at different times_. \n the parameter @xmath23 acts as a clock in the reference frame of the qubit and allows us to make mathematical sence of this strange statement . \n we now apply this method to two example @xmath12 s , that illustrate the method and demonstrate its ability to reproduce the results of the original model . in the first example we consider @xmath24 and hence @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unitary transformation corresponding to a controlled sign . for simplicity \n we take the input state in the schrdinger picture to be the pure state @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 real . in the heisenberg picture \n we explicitly create this state using the unitary transformation @xmath30 . \n it is straightforward to generalize the treatment to include mixed states . \n we begin with the d - b model treatment . \n the consistency requirement ( eq.[sp1 ] ) leads to the solution @xcite @xmath31 and hence from eq.[sp2 ] the output @xmath32 as before this solution is unusual in being non - unitary and a non - linear function of the input state . \n we now solve for the same unitary using the heisenberg approach . \n we introduce the following nomenclature : @xmath33 , etc , where @xmath0 is an arbitrary time and , as before , @xmath2 is the time shift produced by the worm - hole . \n the transformation rules for the controlled sign gate are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where the brackets delineate operators acting on the first and second qubit . \n consider the representation of fig.1(b ) . \n we begin with @xmath15 and evolve it back from the output into the wormhole region . at the first encounter with the unitary we set the input to be @xmath40 , i.e. we take the upper mode to be the identity . \n the evolution gives @xmath38 . \n evolving the lower mode further back in time we encounter the wormhole and then arrive at the unitary again , but now in the upper mode and at an earlier time ( in the qubit reference frame ) . \n we now conclude that the input to the unitary should be @xmath41 . \n this gives evolution through the unitary of @xmath42 . \n propagating the lower mode back through the wormhole and to the unitary again produces the same input @xmath41 . \n thus we have consistently solved the evolution through the wormhole and we conclude that the value of the upper mode that should be evolved back to the state preparation unitary , @xmath43 , is @xmath44 . \n now consider @xmath45 . \n evolution back through the unitary the first time gives @xmath34 . \n propagating the lower mode through the wormhole and back through the unitary a second time leads to the evolution @xmath46 . \n a third iteration gives a consistent evolution through the unitary of @xmath47 that has `` converged '' in the sence that further iterations do not change the evolution . \n we conclude that @xmath48 should be evolved back to the state preparation unitary . \n similarly we find that @xmath49 evolves to @xmath50 . \n finally we evolve the operators back through the state preparation unitary , @xmath43 , to obtain the operators , @xmath51 , that act on the initial zero state @xmath52 where @xmath53 these are clearly unusual expressions , containing operators representing three different temporal histories . \n never - the - less we can evaluate expectation values using eq.[jt ] . \n consider the simple example of a component product of @xmath15 operators with different temporal histories @xmath54 if @xmath55 then normalization of the temporal function means we obtain @xmath56 . \n however , for the condition @xmath57 , then @xmath20 and @xmath58 are effectively orthogonal ( have no overlap ) and @xmath59 . \n this technique can be generalized to obtain expectation values for the operators of eq.[hp1 ] . \n the solutions using the d - b model and the heisenberg model are compared via the expectation value relations @xmath60 $ ] . \n both approaches lead to the same solutions , namely : @xmath61 as a second example we consider the case presented earlier in which @xmath9 . hence @xmath62 . \n the transformation rules for the controlled not gate are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath36 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and , @xmath39 , where the first qubit is the control . following the procedure described \n previously we find for @xmath15 , after two iterations , the evolution through the unitary of @xmath67 and we conclude that @xmath68 should be evolved back to the state preparation unitary . \n something different happens when we consider @xmath45 . \n we do not find a closed solution , but rather an infinite product of operators . \n we conclude that the evolution through the unitary is @xmath69 and hence conclude that @xmath70 should be propagated back to the unitary . \n for @xmath49 the evolution is @xmath71 and hence @xmath72 should be propagated back to the unitary . \n thus we find @xmath73 the presence of infinite direct products appears pathological , never - the - less if we ignore the singular point @xmath74 ( which is also a singular point in the d - b model @xcite ) the expectation values converge and we obtain values for the expectation values consistent with eq.[1 ] , namely @xmath75 \n although , as we have shown , the expectation values are equivalent in the two approaches , the physical pictures are quite different . in the d - b model \n the non - unitary evolution emerges as a mysterious requirement for preserving consistency . in the heisenberg model \n the evolution involves only unitary operations . \n the non - unitary behaviour of the expectation values arises from the measurements . \n direct measurement of the qubit observables is unable to recognize the coherences between the various histories that contribute to the results . as a consequence \n those coherences are implicitly traced over in the expectation values . \n we might expect that these coherences will play a role if we chain a pair of wormhole interactions . \n we now consider such a situation and show that the two models give highly divergent results . \n we consider the chained interaction depicted in fig.2 . \n the second wormhole interaction is the same as the first ( with @xmath62 ) . \n we apply a hadamard gate to the output of the first wormhole before injecting it into the second and a further hadamard after the second wormhole . using the d - b model \n we can solve this situation using eq.[sp1 ] and [ sp2 ] , but now with the input state @xmath76 , where @xmath77 . the final output state is the completely depolarized density operator @xmath78 . \n a careful analysis of the heisenberg approach arrives at a very different conclusion . \n the action of the hadamard gate is to produce the evolutions : @xmath79 and @xmath80 . combining these transformations with those of eq . \n [ hp2 ] we find that propagating back from the measurement point through the first wormhole to position @xmath81 in fig.2 gives the transformations : @xmath82 . \n propagating back from @xmath81 through the unitary and wormhole gives the somewhat surprising consistent evolutions : @xmath83 where we have used the pauli identities @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n hence , in stark contrast to the prediction of the d - b model , we find that the heisenberg approach predicts that the second wormhole reverses the evolution of the first wormhole , essentially giving the identity for the entire transformation , i.e. @xmath86 . \n we have analyzed a simple model combining an exotic general relativistic metric with quantum mechanics that appears to inevitably lead to non -

{"ContextTokens": 3748, "GeneratedTokens": 300, "SynthesizedBody": "in spite of julius caesar s view ( shakespeare 1623 , act 3 scene i ) , polaris is in fact one of the more inconstant of stars . \n in addition to not being precisely located at the north celestial pole , it is a variable star , with a pulsation period of nearly 4 days and a current pulsation amplitude of around 30 - 50 mmag in the v band . additionally , polaris is not even constant in its inconstancy , as both the pulsation period and the pulsation amplitude have changed in the past . \n the amplitude in particular has changed substantially and is currently still changing , as we will describe in this paper . \n polaris is an important star for a number of reasons \n it is the nearest cepheid variable and a star where we can see stellar evolution taking place . \n understanding the location of polaris on the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( and particularly the relationship of polaris to the instability strip ; whether it is a star undergoing its first or third or even fifth crossing ) and the nature of the pulsations ( whether fundamental model or an overtone pulsator ) are all important questions in stellar evolution . \n the first evidence suggesting the variable nature of polaris was presented 150 years ago @xcite with strong confirmation , along with the correct period , being supplied by @xcite via radial velocity measurements . \n photometric detection of the pulsations were presented several years afterwards @xcite . \n a large number of observations have have been made in the intervening years , which have helped to build a picture of how the star has been evolving over the last century and a half . despite this \n , there is still a great deal of interest in polaris due to the changes in the period and amplitude of the oscillations , as well as unusual events such as the change from a steady decline in amplitude to a very rapid decline from 0.1 mag to @xmath30.02 mag during the 1960 s . during this time \n , the period also readjusted downwards . \n the rate of period change is an important diagnostic tool for determining which crossing of the instability strip a cepheid is undergoing . \n the recent analysis of the o - c residuals of polaris by @xcite has led to the suggestion that the period of polaris is currently increasing at a rate of 4.5 s yr@xmath1 . \n this rate of period change is unusual for a cepheid with this period and adds to the confusion as to what stage of its evolution polaris is actually at . in the following sections we present new smei photometric observations of polaris , \n discuss the amplitude changes that we observe during the course of the observations and also look at the o - c residuals and interpret these in the light of recent measurements of the period . \n the new photometry we present was obtained using the smei instrument on board the usaf coriolis spacecraft , which was launched in january 2003 into an 840  km sun - synchronous polar orbit with an orbital period of 101 minutes . \n smei consists of 3 cameras , each with a field of view of @xmath4 , which monitors nearly the entire sky over one orbit . \n consequently , we obtain data for polaris on essentially every orbital pass . \n smei has a roughly triangular pass band with a peak quantum efficiency of 47% at 700 nm and falling to 5% at 430 nm and 1025 nm . \n although smei is a small instrument , the fact that it has monitored the entire sky with a cadence of @xmath5 minutes for over 4 years , results in stellar light curves , for bright stars , that are unprecedented . \n an overview of the smei instrument can be found in @xcite , and an overview of stellar variability results being obtained with smei will be presented in @xcite . \n smei results on the variability of the red giant arcturus can be found in @xcite . \n the polaris data spans from april 2003 to october 2007 , with a 70% fill throughout this period of time , giving us an exceptional data sample to investigate the period and amplitude variations of the 3.97 day oscillations exhibited by polaris . \n the full details of the reduction pipeline for generating time - series from the smei data will be presented in @xcite , so we only discuss the data reduction briefly here . \n the raw images obtained by the smei instrument are bias subtracted , have a temperature scaled dark current signal removed , and are flat fielded . \n hot pixels and high energy particle hits are corrected on the images via interpolation , before aperture photometry is performed . \n the resulting light curves are corrected for systematic effects resulting from the variation of the psf as it moves across the ccd and vignetting / optical effects . removing a best fit sine curve from the entirety of the dataset highlighted non - regular systematic variations at the few mmag level which we have largely removed using a smoothed box car average obtained with a window width of @xmath312 days . \n we finally removed a number of spurious data points from the data , which were primarily due to uncorrected cosmic rays , by performing a 3 sigma clip on short 28 day sections of data from which the best fitting sinusoidal relation for each section had been removed . \n the resulting time series can be seen in fig . \n [ timeseries ] along with a closer view of a section of data taken from 13th september 2006 to 29th november 2006 , which highlights the level of precision we are able to attain over a long baseline . \n in order to study the amplitude of the 3.97 day ( 2.914@xmath6hz ) oscillation we have generated fourier spectra of both long ( 8 - 9 months ) and short ( 28 day ) sections of the time series data . \n the resulting trend from computing the mean amplitude in each data chunk is shown in fig . \n [ three_epoch ] and fig . \n [ monthly_fft ] . to create the fourier spectra , we first subtracted a robust mean from the time series and the residuals were then converted to a change in magnitude relative to the mean magnitude . after computing the fourier spectra we ensured that in every case the power corresponding to the 3.97 day oscillation was restricted to a single bin , and padding the data with zeros to artificially enhance the resolution of the fourier spectra had no effect on the computed amplitudes . \n = 5.8 cm    = 5.75 cm    fig . \n [ three_epoch ] shows the 2.914 @xmath6hz peak in the fourier spectra for three @xmath39 month sections of the light curve . \n the peaks for the 2003 and 2004 - 2005 data have been offset by @xmath70.8 and @xmath70.4 @xmath6hz respectively to highlight the increase in the amplitude over time . \n on the assumption that polaris is oscillating in the first overtone mode ( see section 4 ) , we do not detect any significant power at the expected frequency for the fundamental mode , i.e. @xmath8hz . the trend of the increasing amplitude is highlighted more clearly in fig . \n [ monthly_fft ] where we have plotted the mean amplitude calculated in consecutive 28 day chunks of data . \n each 28 day section contained 400 data points after data gaps had been filled with zero values . \n the best fitting linear relation describing the rate of increase for the peak to peak amplitude is @xmath9 mmag yr@xmath1 . \n some of the scatter in the plot is attributed to the varying amplitude of the oscillations , which @xcite also saw in wire observations , and suggested it could be due to the analogue of the blazkho effect in cepheids . in our analysis , however , we do not see any significant periodic variations in the amplitude above a level of @xmath10  mmag appearing consistently throughout the observations . \n this is to our knowledge the first highly confident detection of the amplitude increase over the last few years from photometric measurements , although some hint has been given previously @xcite . \n this completely contradicts the claim that polaris is about to cease its variability and leave the instability strip @xcite , although this was based somewhat on an erroneous result . \n .recent measurements of the period of polaris suggest that it has undergone another recent decline . \n there seems to have been a large decline between 1988 and 1993 , with the rate slowing in the last ten years . in total , the period has reduced by around 200 seconds over the last 20 years.[periods ] [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     the o - c residuals obtained from @xcite , along with the new values calculated from our data are plotted in fig . \n we have used the same time regimes as this paper ( i.e. pre-1963 and post 1965 ) to determine our rate of period change . the best fitting parabolic relation for observations before 1963 , as determined by @xcite , provides an estimate for the rate of period increase over this time of @xmath11 s yr@xmath1 the best fitting parabolic relation for the data since 1963 , with the inclusion of our new measurements suggests the mean rate of increase for the period has increased to @xmath2 s yr@xmath1 this relation is again shown in fig . \n [ oc ] . ignoring the data from 1966 , as in @xcite , insignificantly alters the value to @xmath12 s yr@xmath1 . ignoring the datum from 1965 \n , however , causes a dramatic change to the calculated value , giving instead @xmath13 s yr@xmath14 . \n it is clear therefore that the mean rate of period increase over the last 50 years has been between 4.4 and 5 s yr@xmath1 , consistent with the rate before 1963 . \n if one looks more closely at recent measurements for the period , however , it does appear that it may have recently undergone a rapid decline , similar to that seen in the early 1960 s . \n table  [ periods ] shows the period as measured several times over the last 20 years with the values obtained from @xcite and references therein , together with the period measured from our new results . \n the decline is very evident , and amounts to a decrease of around 200 seconds during the last 20 years , but the rate has been much slower over the last ten years than it was between 1987 and 1997 . additionally , although our results are fairly consistent with a period increase of 4.9  s  yr@xmath1 , they do follow a slightly shallower trend which is likely due to the recent decrease in period . \n we will now discuss these results in the context of stellar evolution and ascertain what implications they have on the evolutionary stage of polaris . \n there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that polaris is a first overtone ( s - cepheid ) oscillator . \n @xcite used the hipparcos parallax ( measured to be @xmath15  mas for polaris ) to fit period - luminosity models to a sample of cepheids and concluded that the best fit for polaris resulted if it was treated as a first overtone pulsator . \n the updated value for the hipparcos parallax of polaris is @xmath16  mas @xcite , therefore this conclusion is still valid . \n @xcite used interferometry to measure the radius of polaris to be @xmath17 , and again this is only consistent with the pulsation period if polaris is a first overtone pulsator . \n the mean rate of change of the period and the small amplitude of the oscillations are also indicators that polaris oscillates in an overtone mode . \n combining this with the fact that polaris exhibits a highly symmetrical light curve , it exhibits all of the features we expect from s - cepheids . \n = 5.8 cm    = 5.65 cm    @xcite suggest that polaris exists at the cool edge of the region of the instability strip occupied by the s - cepheids , but that the positive period change could not be due to evolution as the star would be evolving towards the centre of the instability strip , which would defy the previously declining amplitude . @xcite \n also place polaris on the red edge of the instability strip for putative first crossers , which corresponds to the s - cepheid red edge in this case . \n they do however suggest the possibility of polaris being a fundamental pulsator , which is unlikely given the evidence above . \n @xcite on the other hand believed that polaris was about to evolve out of the instability strip completely , which would require it to be near the edge of the instability strip , which it certainly does not appear to be . \n the behaviour we are now seeing from polaris is consistent with what we expect from a cepheid located in the instability strip where @xcite and @xcite suggest , but the conclusion that the period change is not due to evolution may be incorrect . \n = 7.9 cm    firstly , consider the evidence that the period has once again undergone a rapid decline , which could be a phase of blueward evolution , as @xcite suggests could be the case for the 1963 - 66 period readjustment . \n secondly , the amplitude appeared to cease its decline in the early 1990s , and is now seemingly increasing again . \n one might expect to see such behaviour if polaris was undergoing an evolutionary change in its oscillation mode . \n if we look at the models for s - cepheids produced by @xcite , and specifically look at the location of polaris in the computed instability regimes then , as fig . \n [ ismodel ] shows , polaris lies on the red edge of the overtone instability strip for their non - linear convective model , which is able to generate light and radial velocity curves very similar to those found observationally . if the true red edge of the first overtone instability strip lies close to the one computed in this fbk model , then polaris is in fact undergoing a change from being a first overtone pulsator ( assuming it is evolving to the cooler side of the instability strip ) to becoming either a fundamental pulsator or a double mode pulsator . \n the position of polaris in fig . \n [ ismodel ] suggests that its mass is not quite great enough to enter the fundamental pulsator regime , which occurs for masses greater than around @xmath18 ( the knee in the model track ) , but recent measurements by @xcite for example , do not place enough of a constraint on the mass to make an absolute determination as to which regime polaris will enter . \n if polaris is about to cross into another pulsation regime , then we might expect to see occasional blips in the period as this readjustment phase takes place . \n finally , the crossing mode of polaris is also uncertain . \n @xcite suggest that despite polaris exhibiting a deficiency of carbon and an over - abundance of nitrogen @xcite , this can not be interpreted in any fashion to determine the crossing mode , such as was done by @xcite . \n somewhat controversially , @xcite suggests that polaris has a small over - abundance of carbon , which would certainly place it in a first crossing scenario . \n the rate of period change for cepheids is an indicator of the crossing mode @xcite . \n if we assume polaris to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , and take the rate of period change over the last 150 years to be + 4.5 s yr@xmath1 , then this is a factor of @xmath33 too small for a first crossing cepheid and about the same factor too large for a third crossing cepheid . \n @xcite suggest that the observable characteristics of polaris are most consistent with a first time crosser . \n interestingly , however , if one only considers the trend in the period from the last 20 years , then we see a decline at a rate of @xmath19 s yr@xmath1 . \n this is actually consistent with a first overtone cepheid undergoing its second crossing . \n the possibility that polaris is in its second crossing was also discussed by @xcite . \n we must be cautious , however , as the rate over the last fourteen years , using measurements with much better precision than those presented in @xcite , only suggest a decline of @xmath20 s yr@xmath1 . \n clearly , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the crossing mode at present . \n the new results obtained with smei strongly suggest the amplitude of polaris is once again increasing \n . the star does seem to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , but likely lies close to the red edge of the instability strip for s - cepheids , and is therefore likely to soon evolve into either a fundamental or double - mode pulsation cepheid , assuming the cepheid is undergoing its first or third crossing . \n it is uncertain how quickly polaris will evolve across the boundary between pulsation regimes and what behaviour the cepheid will exhibit as it does so . \n one slight oddity in the results is the lack of evidence for the fundamental mode of oscillation being present , but this may appear in the near future . \n it is therefore crucial that high precision monitoring of this star is continued for the foreseeable future so that the changes can be watched closely . \n we would like to thank the referee , clifton laney , for his extremely useful comments , which have helped improve this paper . \n sas acknowledges support from stfc and the school of physics and astronomy , university of birmingham . \n smei was designed and built by members of ucsd , afrl , and the university of birmingham . \n we particularly thank yvonne elsworth , andrew buffington , chris eyles and james tappin .", "StartTimeOffset": 2375785886082, "RequestID": "3f3f4ffd099d1f9199c98668b7000d5e9eff1e7a", "TotalTokens": 4048}

[ fig1 ] . \n historically , this was the first structure considered theoretically to explain the large enhancement occurring for rough metal surfaces  @xcite . today , we may easily envision realization of groove structures  @xcite closely resembling the geometry considered in panel ( c ) , though state - of - the - art structures may still be somewhat larger in scale . as mentioned above \n , the points of intersection of neighboring cylinders may lead to a singularity in the electric field , and consequently arbitrarily large enhancement factors [ see eq . \n ( [ eq : gamma ] ) below ] . \n in the context of sers it is customary to estimate the surface - enhancement factor @xmath4 from  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position of the molecule . to a first approximation \n the surface - enhancement factor is independent on the intrinsic properties of the molecule . here , \n @xmath2 is the surface bounding the volume @xmath7 occupied by metal , @xmath8 is the incident field , and the total field is @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the scattered component that arises in the presence of the metal surface . \n the surface - averaged enhancement factor applies to the case of a spatially uniform surface - coverage of molecules . \n our theoretical study takes the wave equation for the electrical field as a starting point @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angular frequency and @xmath13 is the vacuum velocity of light . for structures as in fig . \n [ fig1 ] the spatially dependent relative dielectric function is of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dielectric function of the metal . to make our simulations mimic a real material we use the bulk dielectric constant of silver ( thus neglecting spatial dispersion near the metal surface ) , illustrated in fig . \n [ fig2 ] which shows standard handbook data for @xmath15  @xcite along with a numerical fit to the drude expression @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the plasma frequency and @xmath18 the damping rate . \n this simple model accounts very well for the real part , however some deviations are seen in the visible for the imaginary part . \n the spectral position of resonances will thus be accurately predicted by using the drude fit while we shall see that even small deviations in the imaginary part of @xmath19 may influence the enhancement factor , eq . \n ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , by orders of magnitude . \n in the following we use a finite - element approach ( comsol multiphysics ) to solve eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) in a unit cell resembling panel ( c ) in fig \n .  [ fig1 ] . \n we apply periodic boundary conditions in the direction parallel to the surface . \n deep inside the metal and far out in the free space we employ perfectly - matched layers in the perpendicular direction  @xcite , so that the domain has an extension @xmath20 , i.e. significantly exceeding the free - space wavelength . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) is solved for a normal incident electrical field polarized perpendicular to the groove axis , see panel ( b ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , which strongly polarizes the surface by excitation of a surface - plasmon resonance . with the resulting scattered field , and hence @xmath21 \n , we subsequently evaluate eq . \n ( [ eq : gamma ] ) by a boundary integration routine . \n our meshing is chosen to ensure convergence of the enhancement factor ; this requires a particularly fine mesh in the groove region . as an example , resolving the peak in @xmath4 at resonance has typically required a sub - nanometer meshing . on a standard - equipped pc \n the calculation of a single near - resonance frequency point typically takes around 30 seconds . \n figure  [ fig3 ] shows the wavelength dependence of the surface - averaged enhancement factor in the case of @xmath22  nm and @xmath23  nm . \n the solid line shows results based on the drude model , eq . \n ( [ eq : drude ] ) , while the points are obtained from a simulation using the discrete frequencies where handbook data is available , see fig . \n first , we note that these geometrical parameters easily lead to surface - averaged enhancement factors in excess of @xmath24 , i.e. twelve orders of magnitude , in the visible . \n second , when inspecting the peak around @xmath25  nm and comparing the two simulations , it is also clear that the drude model , eq . \n ( [ eq : drude ] ) , overestimates the enhancement by perhaps up to three orders of magnitude . \n this overestimation may be traced back to the imaginary part of @xmath19 shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] where the drude model seriously underestimates the broadening of the surface - plasmon resonance . finally , when approaching the ultra - violet , resonances predicted by the drude model are barely visible when employing the handbook data directly . \n while general trends can be extracted from a drude description , these results emphasize the need for an accurate material - dispersion law for even semi - quantitative predictions of sers . \n in particular , the surface - plasmon damping is crucial in the vicinity of resonances as clearly seen in the dashed traces where we for illustrative purposes have increased the damping rate @xmath18 by a factor of two , five , and ten .    while previous studies  @xcite have reported a spectrally broadened enhancement , our detailed finite - element simulations suggest the existence of highly peaked enhancement factors associated with the formation of a surface - plasmon resonance strongly localized in the groove . \n a related transverse localization has recently been reported experimentally for groove waveguides  @xcite and subsequently confirmed numerically  @xcite . obviously , spatial localization is the route to high enhancement and especially one should minimize the overlap with the lossy metal causing ohmic broadening of resonances . \n the nanoscale cutoff @xmath3 is the geometrical knob that controls the strength of localization and the overlap with the metal . a stronger localization ( @xmath26 ) \n will usually be expected to squeeze up the resonance in frequency space . however , when increasing @xmath3 we actually observe a blue - shift which can be understood within the quasi - static framework of ref . \n @xcite [ see their eq . \n ( 4 ) ] where an increase in metal volume @xmath7 causes modes at @xmath12 to blue - shift to a frequency @xmath27 with a less negative dielectric function , i.e. @xmath28 . in fig . \n [ fig4 ] we illustrate this point for varying values of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath22  nm . for simplicity \n the results are based on the drude model . \n our results show that even for a relatively conservative value of the ratio @xmath29 the enhancement has already dropped to @xmath30 compared to @xmath31 in the case of @xmath32 . \n another geometric factor affecting the field enhancement is the radius of cylinders . in fig . \n [ fig5 ] we illustrate this point for varying values of @xmath33 at fixed @xmath34  nm , again using the drude model . \n our results show a red - shift of the resonance when increasing the radius while the magnitude decreases slightly . \n the red - shift may be understood qualitatively from the scale invariance of eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) in the absence of material dispersion \n [ fig4 ]  and  [ fig5 ] together illustrate how the enhancement is influenced by both length scales @xmath33 and @xmath3 in a nontrivial interplay . \n in conclusion , we have presented finite - element simulations of the sers enhancement factor for an example of a nanostructured surface , which represents the state - of - the - art technology . \n we find that a well - defined structure , with mathematically sharp boundaries [ see eq . \n ( [ eq : eps ] ) ] , may exhibit huge enhancement factors , @xmath35 . \n but any geometric smoothening rapidly decreases the enhancement , and even though a computational optimization may be possible by a painstaking survey of the parameter space ( _ given _ that the dielectric function of the material is known very accurately - no small feat by itself ! ) , it is doubtful whether the extremely high theoretical enhancement factors can be reached in practice and in a reproducible manner . \n we acknowledge stimulating discussions with s.  i. bozhevolnyi . this work is financially supported by the _ danish council for strategic research _ through the _ strategic program for young researchers _ ( grant no : 2117 -

{"ContextTokens": 3076, "GeneratedTokens": 171, "SynthesizedBody": "the cold - electron bolometer is a broadband bolometric detector where the only fundamental limit to the frequency response comes from the spectral transmission of the absorber . in order to tune the detector to respond to a certain frequency band , \n the absorber is coupled to an antenna structure which defines the frequency response.the original , and still most common , cold - electron bolometer design involved a normal - metal absorber with tunnelling contacts to superconducting leads ; see , for example , the work of kuzmin.@xcite this structure has also been used in the so - called _ microrefrigerator _ devices to cool electrons to below the lattice temperature . \n savin et al.@xcite showed that if the normal - metal absorber is replaced by a degenerately doped , electrons can be more efficiently cooled due to the reduced electron - phonon coupling in such a material compared to a metal.@xcite it has been shown that introducing strain into the silicon lattice can further reduce this coupling , allowing microrefrigerator - type devices to achieve lower electron temperatures compared to unstrained silicon.@xcite    based on this lower electron temperature achieved using strained silicon it is expected that the responsivity of cold - electron bolometer based on strained silicon should be higher than a comparable detector utilising unstrained silicon . a common advantage that both strained- and unstrained - silicon cold - electron bolometers share , compared to those using a normal - metal absorber , is that they do not require the fabrication of an insulating layer , since the naturally forming schottky barrier may be used instead . \n here we explore the performance of cold - electron bolometers utilising degenerately - doped silicon as the absorbing element . \n we take two devices : the _ control _ device using doped silicon , and a device where the doped absorber is strained by a layer of . \n we compare these devices by characterising them in a dark environment and also when illuminated . \n for both device the doping concentration was @xmath3 . in order to measure the noise of the devices themselves \n we present a novel concept of cross - correlating the outputs of two matched jfet amplifiers to remove the uncorrelated amplifier noise leaving only the device noise . \n the cold - electron bolometer consists of an absorbing island with tunnelling contacts to superconducting leads either side of the absorber . in the absence of any bias , \n the fermi energy is the same in the absorber and the superconducting contacts and thus carriers can not tunnel between the two . \n however , in the presence of an external bias , applied across the structure , the fermi level in the superconductor can be moved relative to that of the absorber , allowing tunnelling from the absorber to the vacant states above the superconductor s energy gap . \n this structure is described to greater detail by gulobev and kuzmin , and brien.@xcite    the current , @xmath4 , flowing through each of the symmetric junctions is given by : @xmath5\\,\\mathrm{d}e\\ , ,      \\label{eqn : iv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the normal - state resistance , due to tunnelling , of an individual tunnelling barrier , @xmath7 is half the superconducting bandgap , @xmath8 is the voltage across both junctions due to tunnelling ( i.e. it does not include voltages due to the resistance of the absorber or any leakage across the junction ) , and @xmath9 is the fermi distribution of electrons at temperature @xmath10 . this tunnelling current either increases or decreases the average energy of the electrons in the absorber.this change in energy can be expressed as a tunnelling power , @xmath11 , given by : @xmath12\\,\\mathrm{d}e\\ , ,      \\label{eqn : ptun}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the temperature of the electrons in the absorber and @xmath14 is the temperature of the normal - state electrons in the superconductor . \n a negative value of @xmath11 represents a reduction in the energy of the electrons in the absorber and thus corresponds to electron cooling . in a cold - electron bolometer \n it is this tunnelling power which cools the absorber . \n the temperature of the electrons in the absorber is also affected by the weak thermal link to the phonons . \n this thermal power , @xmath15 , is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the area of the absorber , @xmath18 is the phonon temperature , @xmath19 is a material constant that has been measured to be @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the control and strained silicon materials,@xcite and the power @xmath22 have been found@xcite to be @xmath23 . \n the responsivity , when current biased , @xmath24 , of such a detector has been derived by golubev and kuzmin@xcite and is given by : @xmath25    the dark noise - equivalent power is comprised of several terms , corresponding to various thermal and electronic process , and has been derived , for a current - biased device , by golubev and kuzmin@xcite to be : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the noise voltage introduced by the readout , @xmath28 is boltzmann \n s constant , @xmath29 is the heat - flow noise , and @xmath30 is the current - shot noise . in the presence of optical power , \n the noise - equivalent power can be further degraded by noise introduced by the absorption of photons . \n this photon - noise limit to the noise - equivalent power is given by the well - known equation:@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is planck s constant , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the frequency and power of the radiation incident upon the detector , and @xmath35 is the optical bandwidth . \n as is often the case , the internal noise of device under test here was lower than the input referred noise of the amplifier used ( @xmath36 in this case ) . to combat this \n we have used a novel solution of feeding the output of the device to two matched jfet amplifiers . the output of these two amplifiers \n was then fed to a data - acquisition system and cross - correlated in software . \n this treatment has the effect of removing the amplifier , which is uncorrelated , and leaving only noise present in the system prior to the splitting of the signal wiring . \n this approach is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : crosscol_flow ] . \n since the noise of each amplifier is random there is a finite chance of correlations between the two for any particular acquisition , due to this , in order to sufficiently reduce the amplifier noise in the final spectrum it is necessary to average multiple cross - correlations .    in reality there will always be a weak level of correlated amplifier noise in the final measurement due to stray capacitances in the system which provide a route for the amplifier noise to couple to the device . \n this low level of correlated amplifier noise presents itself as a noise floor below which further averaging offers little improvement . \n both the control and strained devices have been made and fabricated to a common design and process . \n for both devices the absorber is a @xmath37 tall mesa formed from etching n^++^-doped silicon ( @xmath38 ) and the contacts are sputtered aluminium . for the strained device \n the doped silicon is strained by a buffer layer between the absorber and the silicon substrate . \n the sputtered aluminium is etched to form a twin - slot antenna , designed to respond to 160-ghz radiation . \n both devices have been tested in two scenarios . \n firstly , dark ( looking at a blank at @xmath18 ) tests were performed to verify the formation of a schottky contact and to baseline device performance . \n the devices were then illuminated by radiation from external black - body sources ( eccosorb ) with temperatures of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . \n radiation was coupled to the detector via a pair of back - to - back horns and a hemispherical silicon lens which focussed the radiation on to the twin - slot antenna . \n the power incident on the detector was limited by both a low - pass filter , with an edge frequency of @xmath41 , and by a @xmath42 limiting aperture . \n the detector was biased via a pair of @xmath43 resistors and readout via cross - correlated jfet amplifiers ( as discussed above ) . \n all optical measurements were performed at a bath temperature ( @xmath44 ) of @xmath45 . \n +    to compare the strained- and unstrained - silicon cold - electron bolometers , both current - voltage ( @xmath4-@xmath8 ) characteristics as well as noise spectra of the devices have been measured , these measurements have been performed dark and in the presence of optical power . \n @xmath4-@xmath8 curves are presented in fig . \n [ fig : iv ] . for both devices \n there is a clear voltage response to increasing the source temperature from @xmath46 ( dashed lines ) to @xmath40 ( dotted lines ) and this can be seen to a greater extent when comparing these curves to the dark data ( solid lines ) . from fig . \n [ fig : rderiv ] it can be also seen that the unstrained device ( blue curves ) exhibits a lower normal - state ( @xmath47 ) resistance along with greater sub - gap leakage . \n this is attributed to lower - quality schottky contacts in this device along with the absorber resistance being lower in this material ( @xmath48 compared to @xmath49 in the strained detector ) . \n +    the electron temperature for these data has been computed by fitting the data to eq . \n [ eqn : iv ] . using the electron temperature at zero bias , along with eq .  [ eqn : pe - ph ] , it is possible to calculate the power absorbed within the silicon in each scenario . for the control device the absorbed power was @xmath50 for the 77-kelvin source and @xmath51 for the 300-kelvin source . for the strained detector \n the absorbed power was @xmath52 for the 77-kelvin source and @xmath53 for the 300-kelvin source . \n the difference between these powers for the two detectors is due to alterations in the optical setup and in both measurements we believe there to be a substantial background power due to the cryostat optics and stray light ; these values for the absorbed power are supported by our noise modelling , an example of which is shown in fig . \n [ fig : noise ] . from the computed electron temperature it is also possible to calculate the responsivity using eq . \n [ eqn : responsivity ] , the results of this are shown in fig .  [ fig : responsivity ] .    fig . \n [ fig : responsivity ] shows that when the incident power is increased there is an overall drop in the responsivity of the detector ( the difference between the dashed and dotted lines ) , this is attributed to an overall increase in the electron temperature for the higher incident power . if the two curves for the 77-kelvin source are examined ( dashed lines in fig . \n [ fig : responsivity ] ) , then the difference in peak responsivity is a factor of @xmath54 . \n this value is very close to the difference in the @xmath19 parameter for the two materials ( @xmath55 ) .    from the responsivity , and by using eq . \n [ eqn : darknep ] and eq . \n [ eqn : photonnep ] , it is possible to calculate the noise - equivalent power for the two detectors . \n this has been found to be @xmath56 for the control device and @xmath57 for the strained device , both of these values are found when observing the 77-kelvin source . in the case of the control device the limiting noise source , across the entire measurement , was the amplifier noise remaining after cross correlation ( increased by the poorer responsivity ) . \n for the strained device the noise - equivalent power was photon - noise limited for biases corresponding to voltages in the range @xmath58 ( as shown , for the 77-kelvin source , in fig . \n [ fig : noise ] ) , outside of this range the noise - equivalent power was limited by a combination of tunnelling and the amplifier noise . \n the introduction of a straining layer to a silicon cold - electron bolometer has increased the detector responsivity by a factor of @xmath59 . \n this increased responsivity can be attributed to the weaker coupling between the electrons and the phonons in the strained material . in terms of sensitivity \n the limiting noise source for the unstrained device was the readout , whereas in the strained detector the sensitivity was photon noise limited , afforded by the improved responsivity lowering the amplifier noise contribution . taking the strained - silicon device we achieve a minimum noise - equivalent power of @xmath2 at optimum bias . \n this work has been financially supported by the stfc through grant st / k000926/1 , the epsrc through grant numbers ep / f040784/1 and ep / j001074/1 , and the academy of finland through grant 252598 . \n + information on how to access all data supporting the results in this article can found at cardiff university data catalogue at doi : http://dx.doi.org/10.17035/d.2016.0008254680[10.17035/d.2016.0008254680 ] . \n 99 l. s. kuzmin , in _ proc . \n sned _ , pp . \n 145 - 154 , ( 2001 ) . \n d. golubev and l. s. kuzmin , _ journal of applied physics _ \n * 89 * , 6464 ( 2001 ) . \n t. l. r. brien et al . , _ applied physics letters _ * 105 * ( 2014 ) . \n a. m. savin , et al . \n , _ applied physics letters _ * 79 * , 1471 ( 2001 ) . \n r. leoni , _ new astronomy reviews _ * 43 * , 317 ( 1999 ) . \n m. j. prest , et al . \n , _ applied physics letters _ * 99 * , 251908 ( 2011 ) . \n j. zmuidzinas , _ applied optics _ * 42 * , 25 ( 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2406109215048, "RequestID": "28147809009dcc43771520e1f725aec2ff0b403d", "TotalTokens": 3247}

{"ContextTokens": 2143, "GeneratedTokens": 311, "SynthesizedBody": "the cdf trigger  @xcite for run ii is a three level system : each stage rejects a sufficient fraction of the events to allow processing at the next stage with acceptable dead time . \n the goal of the calorimeter trigger ( both at level 1 and level 2 ) is to trigger on electrons , photons , jets , total transverse energy ( sumet ) as well as missing transverse energy ( met ) . in the following we use a coordinate system defined by the polar angle @xmath0 , measured from the proton direction , the azimuthal angle @xmath1 , measured from the tevatron plane . \n the pseudo - rapidity is defined as @xmath2 . for cdf run \n ii , all calorimeter tower energy information , including both electromagnetic ( em ) energy and hadronic ( had ) energy , is digitized every @xmath3 ns and the physical towers are summed into trigger towers , weighted by @xmath4 to yield transverse energy . \n a trigger tower covers 15 degree in azimuth @xmath1 and approximately 0.2 in pseudo - rapidity @xmath5 . \n this results in a representation of the entire detector as a @xmath6 map in the @xmath7 plane . \n the trigger tower energy information is then sent to both l1 and l2 calorimeter trigger systems with 10-bit energy resolution , using a least significant count of 125 mev and resulting in a full scale of 128 gev . \n the level 1 calorimeter ( l1cal ) subsystem only uses 8 of the 10 available bits for each trigger tower , with the two least significant bits dropped , giving a least count of @xmath8 mev and a full scale of @xmath9 gev . as an example \n , electron and photon primitives are formed at l1cal by simply applying energy thresholds to the em energy of a single trigger tower while jet primitives are formed using the total em+had of a single trigger tower . for electrons , tracks from the level-1 track trigger ( xft ) \n can be matched to the trigger towers while had energy can be used for rejection . \n l1cal also calculates global sumet and met , using the lower resolution 8-bit em+had energy information . \n the main task of the existing l2cal was to find clusters using the transverse energy ( @xmath10 ) of trigger towers . \n the cluster finding algorithm was based on a simple algorithm used for run i , and was implemented in dedicated hardware . in this simple algorithm , the l2cal hardware forms clusters by simply combining contiguous regions of trigger towers with non - trivial energy . \n each cluster starts with a tower above a `` seed '' threshold ( typically a few gev ) and all towers above a second lower `` shoulder '' threshold that form a contiguous region with the seed tower are added to the cluster . \n the size of each cluster expands until no more shoulder towers adjacent to the cluster are found . because of this , large `` fake clusters '' are likely to be formed as the occupancy of the detector increases because towers which are unrelated to any jet activity have their @xmath10 boosted above clustering thresholds . \n one example of such kind of `` fake cluster '' is when towers above shoulder threshold between true jets link multiple jets together into a single large cluster ( cluster merging ) . \n this would reduce the efficiency , and increase the rate , for triggers requiring multiple jets at level 2 at higher luminosity , such as some important triggers for higgs and top physics . \n one more limitation of the existing hardware - based l2cal system is that it does not re - calculate sumet and met using the full 10-bit resolution energy information available , instead it uses the sumet and met information directly from l1cal , which is based on 8-bit resolution . \n this design feature limits its trigger selection capability , or rejection power , for triggers with global transverse energy requirements . \n the existing l2cal trigger system has worked reasonably well at lower luminosity for run ii , however , as the occupancy in the calorimeter increases with luminosity , the simple hardware - based l2cal system starts to lose its rejection power . \n the main goal of the upgrade is to significantly reduce the growth terms of the existing jet and met related triggers . \n the basic idea of the l2 upgrade is to provide the full @xmath11 bit resolution trigger tower energy information directly to the global level 2 decision cpu where a cluster finding algorithm can reconstruct jets and recalculate met and sumet . \n the upgrade approch is based on the pulsar board @xcite , a general purpose vme board developed at cdf and used for upgrading both the level-2 global decision crate @xcite and the level-2 silicon vertex tracking ( svt ) subsystem @xcite . the full resolution ( 10-bit ) \n calorimeter trigger tower data are received , preprocessed and merged by a set of pulsar boards before being sent to the level 2 decision cpu where more sophisticated algorithms can be implemented . since the actual cluster - finding is done inside the cpu \n , it is more flexible and more robust against increasing luminosity or higher occupancy in the calorimeter . with this approach , \n jet reconstruction using a cone algorithm which is currently being done at level 3 can be moved to level 2 , albeit clustering trigger towers ( instead of physical towers ) and using only a single iteration in order to save processing time . \n the new system is composed by a new hardware path connecting the l1cal directly to the l2 decision cpu ( see figure  [ hardware ] ) . \n the same hardware has been used to transfer the trigger tower information , full 10-bits resolution , to an additional new pulsar boards which calculates , within the l1 timing constraints , the met for the l1 system . \n bits resolution trigger towers to the l2 decision cpu . \n the same full resolution information are sent to an additional dedicated hardware , which re - calculates the met for the level 1.,width=336 ] \n .,width=336 ]     gev as a function of the instantaneous luminosity : upgraded l2cal vs existing l2cal , width=336 ]     met for the new level 2 met trigger with @xmath12 gev threshold ( after l2cal upgrade ) and for the level 1 met trigger with @xmath13 gev threshold ( before the l1met upgrade).,width=336 ]     met for the new level 1 met trigger with @xmath13 gev threshold : before and after the l1met upgrade.,width=336 ]    the pulsar - based l2cal upgrade has improved both jet and met measurements at level 2 . during the design stage of the new system \n , extensive studies have already shown that level 2 jets found using the new algorithm are nearly equivalent to offline jets in terms of @xmath10 , cluster centroid and efficiency , a vast improvement over the current situation . \n in addition , the calculation of met at level 2 with resolution closer to that at level 3 will significantly reduce level 2 rates for triggers requiring met . \n the upgraded l2cal system has performed as expected in real data taking . as an example , figure  [ efficiency ] shows the difference between the level 2 and level 3 in met and jet transverse energy , for the existing system as well as for the upgraded system . \n these improvements allow a significant rate reduction as well as efficiency improvement in jet and met based triggers . as examples , \n figure  [ jet40 ] shows the level 2 jet40 trigger cross section growth with luminosity before and after the upgrade . \n several higgs - dedicated triggers have been developed exploiting the potentialities of the l2cal upgrade . \n in particular the request of a even lower met at level 2 increases the acceptance on the signal . before the l1met upgrade the different resolution at level 1 and level 2 set a bottleneck to the lowest met threshold at level 2 . \n figure  [ prel1met ] shows the met trigger efficiencies for the new l2cal system with a cut of @xmath12 gev ( full resolution ) and the l1met system ( before the l1met upgrade ) with a cut of @xmath13 gev . \n since the turn on of the level 1 is very slow the trigger has low efficiency when instaed the level 2 is fully efficient , causing a loosing of trigger capability . before the l1met upgrade \n the only solution was keeping a higher threshold at level 2 . \n the l1met upgrade makes available at level 1 the same met trigger capability of the level 2 increasing the flexibility of the met - based triggers ( see figure  [ afterl1met ] ) . \n we have presented the design , the hardware and software implementation and the performance of the new calorimeter system for cdf experiment . \n the new l2cal system makes the full resolution calorimeter trigger tower information directly available to the level 2 decision cpu . \n the upgrade system allows more sophisticated algorithms to be implemented in software and both level 2 jets and met are made nearly equivalent to offline quality , thus significantly improving the performance and flexibility of the jet and met related triggers . as a natural expansion of the upgraded level 2 trigger system we pushed the improved met resolution downto the level 1 , and these are big steps forward to have enough flexibility to deal with potential new challenges at the highest luminosities , and to improve cdf new physics reach sensitivities beyond baseline . \n we foresee many opportunities for additional improvements in trigger purity and efficiency , most notably for physics triggers searching for higgs and new physics . \n 1 r. blair et al ( cdf ii collaboration ) , _ the cdf runii detector technical design report _ , fermilab -

{"ContextTokens": 2974, "GeneratedTokens": 322, "SynthesizedBody": "recent high - resolution images of many hii regions taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ spitzer space telescope _ show very complicated structures inside them . \n one of such hii regions is ic 1848 (= w5 ) . \n see , e.g. , figure 4 of koenig et al . \n ( 2008 ) , where we find a wealth of intricate structures inside / on its boundaries . \n some of them are bright -

existing cloud clumps left - over in evolved hii regions , some of them may have resulted from the hydrodynamical instability of the ionization front of the expanding hii region \n . of particular interest is a concentration of thin and long elephant trunk -

and - collapse _ process of the shell accumulated around an expanding hii region and _ radiation - driven implosion _ of brcs .    in order to examine the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) nature of the stars located at the tip of the _ \n etls_s , we carried out @xmath0 photometry of these stars and constructed a @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . \n we also used near - infrared ( nir ) data from the _ two micron all sky survey _ ( 2mass ) to construct a nir color - color diagram as well as mid - infrared ( mir ) data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ to make spectral energy distribution ( sed ) curves . \n brcs are small clouds apparently with both width and length of several arcminutes , corresponding to the physical size of a few _ parsecs _ typically ( see sugitani et al . \n 1991 , sugitani & ogura 1994 ) . in these papers brcs \n are morphologically classified into _ types a , b _ and _ c _ according to their length - to - width ratios with _ type c _ being the most elongated . \n but many of the _ etls_s found in figure 1 are much more elongated and of far smaller widths ( typically one tenth of _ pc _ ) than most of the _ type c _ brcs in sugitani et al . \n ( 1991 ) and sugitani and ogura ( 1994 ) . \n we searched for such peculiar _ etls_s that have a star / stars at their tip on the _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath2 m , 4.5 @xmath2 m , and 8.0 @xmath2 m images . \n table 1 gives the results , listing such stars with running numbers identified in figure 1 , the coordinates and some remarks . \n we refer to these stars as _ etls _ stars . \n some of them are listed in koenig et al . \n ( 2008 , their table 4 ) . \n [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab5 ] \n we paid attention to the numerous , elephant trunk -

{"ContextTokens": 2909, "GeneratedTokens": 204, "SynthesizedBody": "in the merger remnant system ngc  7252 maraston et al . \n ( 2004 ) found the most luminous star cluster known to date , w3 . \n they determined its mass via two independent ways . \n first they used the total luminosity of @xmath8 and a stellar @xmath9 derived from a single stellar population model to estimate its mass to be @xmath10  m@xmath2 . as an independent approach they calculated the dynamical mass by measuring the velocity dispersion , which turned out to be quite high , @xmath11  kms@xmath5 , and the effective radius of w3 @xmath12  pc . \n this translates to a mass of w3 of @xmath13  m@xmath2 assuming dynamical equilibrium of a spherical object with isotropic velocity distribution . \n the age of this object is about @xmath14@xmath15  myr ( maraston et al . \n 2004 and references therein ) , which indicates that it probably formed during the merger event of the host system . \n the projected distance of w3 to the centre of ngc  7252 is about @xmath16  kpc and w3 appears to lie within the optical radius of the galaxy . \n the size and mass of this object leads to the suggestion that it may be one of the recently discovered ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucd ) found in the fornax cluster ( hilker et al . \n 1999 ; phillipps et al . \n 2000 ) , rather than an ordinary globular cluster . \n the ucd galaxies have been suggested to be the cores of stripped nucleated dwarf galaxies ( bekki et al . \n 2003 , mieske et al . \n 2004 ) . \n we propose instead a formation scenario which is closely related to the massive star - bursts caused by the interaction of two gas - rich disc galaxies . in interacting systems like the antennae ( ngc  4038/39 ; whitmore et al .  1999 , \n zhang & fall 1999 ) regions of very intense star - formation arise as a result of the tightly compressed interstellar media . \n dozens and up to hundreds of young massive star clusters are observed to form in star cluster complexes ( or _ super - clusters _ ) spanning up to a few hundred pc in diameter . \n kroupa ( 1998 ) argues that these super - clusters have to be bound objects because their age ( @xmath17  myr ) indicates that they should be already dispersed . simulating super - clusters , by means of stellar dynamical @xmath18-body simulations , fellhauer et al . \n ( 2002 ) found that the star clusters within these super - clusters merge on very short time - scales ( a few dozens to a few hundred myr ) , namely a few crossing - times of the super - cluster . \n the age - estimate of w3 points to the possibility that it may have formed during the merger event of the host - galaxy ( i.e.  out of merging star clusters ) rather than it being the stripped core of a dwarf galaxy , which should be very old . \n in this project we perform stellar dynamical n - body simulations to show that the merging of star clusters in dense star cluster complexes is able to form massive objects like w3 in ngc  7252 . \n the simulations are carried out with the particle - mesh code superbox with high - resolution sub - grids which stay focussed on the simulated objects ( fellhauer et al . \n 2000 ) .    in our models the super - cluster \n is initially represented by a plummer sphere with a plummer radius of @xmath19  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath15  pc . \n the clusters inside this super - cluster have a total mass of @xmath20  m@xmath2 , which leads to a crossing time of the super - cluster of @xmath21  myr . inside the plummer sphere of the super - cluster , \n the particles have positions and velocities according to the plummer distribution function . \n the particles themselves are plummer spheres representing the star clusters with , respectively , plummer radii of @xmath22 or @xmath16  pc , masses of @xmath23 and @xmath24  m@xmath2 and crossing times of @xmath25 and @xmath26  myr , being represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28  particles . altogether the super - cluster is filled with @xmath29 star clusters , from which @xmath30 are light ones and @xmath31 are of the heavy type to mimic a mass spectrum similar to the one found in the young massive star clusters in the antennae ( zhang & fall 1999 ) .    this super - cluster \n is now placed into an analytical galactic potential consisting of a logarithmic potential for the underlying halo , a plummer - kuzmin disc and a hernquist bulge , which add up to an almost flat rotation curve of @xmath32  kms@xmath5 . \n the super - cluster is placed at a distance of @xmath33  kpc initially ( apogalacticon ) on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon of @xmath16  kpc . \n = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm    in contrast to our previous models ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a , b ) where the merger objects were smaller and not that heavy , the merging process here takes more time . after the first clusters have merged and build up a massive and extended object with the remaining clusters within , it is not encounters between clusters and the merger object which govern the merging process ( the clusters are already within the object ) but dynamical friction acting on the remaining clusters . \n nevertheless a massive merger object is present from an early stage on . \n the top row of figure  [ fig : t300 ] shows the contour plot of the merger object ( left at @xmath34 and right at @xmath35  myr comprising the suggested age - range of w3 ) . \n the contours are spaced in magnitude intervals and masses are converted to luminosities taking a mass - to - light ratio of 0.15 . according to a single stellar population model run with starburst99 ( leitherer et al . \n 1999 ) a stellar population of this age has a @xmath36@xmath37 . in our model these two time - slices mark the transition between the time , when still many star clusters are visible as separate entities and the time when most of the star clusters have already merged or are dissolved within the merger object . \n another interesting feature of our model is that the merger object shows a cuspy structure with a dynamically cold core . \n the surface - density profile can be fitted by either two king profiles or two exponentials ( fig .  [ \n fig : t300 ] , middle row ) and the velocity dispersion is rising in the innermost part and reaches its maximum beyond the transition between the core and the envelope ( fig .  [ \n fig : t300 ] , bottom row ) . \n the outer part of the velocity dispersion , reaching from the maximum value to the tidal radius , can be fitted with an exponential profile with an exponential scale length of the order of the tidal radius of the object . beyond the tidal radius the velocity dispersion is rising again due to the large velocities of the extra tidal stars .    in fig . \n [ fig : evol ] we show the evolution of the total mass , of the effective radius and of the velocity dispersion of our model , whose dynamical evolution was followed for @xmath38  gyr . shown in the right panel of the figure \n are the central values of the dynamically cold core as well as the maximum values of the velocity dispersion . \n the boxes show the values measured for w3 . \n the total mass as well as the maximum velocity dispersion of our model is in reasonable agreement with the data of w3 . \n only the effective radius of our model is too small compared with w3 . \n it starts off at a value of about @xmath16  pc and it increases slightly until the majority of the star clusters have merged , deforming the core progressively . \n after the merging process has ceased the core of the merger object stabilises and the effective radius drops to about @xmath38  pc . but note the extremely large value at @xmath39  myr . at exactly that time a late merger event of one of the remaining star clusters happened . \n if our formation scenario is correct then this points to the possibility that we might be observing w3 at the time when a star cluster merges with the core of the object mimicking a large effective radius . \n = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm    the further dynamical evolution is mainly governed by the tidal shaping of the object due to its eccentric orbit . \n it leads to a successive mass loss and an increase in the effective radius as well as a decrease in the maximum velocity dispersion , while the central value increases slightly . \n looking at the merger object after @xmath38  gyr of its dynamical evolution ( fig . \n [ fig : t300 ] ) shows that this object is very stable against tidal disruption . \n also the dynamically cold core is not a transient feature but survives the evolution . \n the total mass of the object is still of the order of @xmath40  m@xmath2 which is an order of magnitude more than the most massive globular cluster ( @xmath41  cen ) of the milky way . \n the relaxation time - scale of this object , adopting the formula from spitzer & hart ( 1971 ) , is @xmath42  gyr . \n this shows that this object might to be thought of as a dwarf galaxy rather than a globular cluster , since @xmath43 is much longer than a hubble time . \n with our numerical model we introduce a formation scenario for the ultra - massive star cluster w3 found in ngc  7252 . we propose that this object may not have formed as one star cluster , but rather as a star cluster complex . \n the star clusters in this complex have merged and formed w3 . \n these star cluster complexes ( super - clusters ) are a common feature in interacting late - type galaxies . \n we predict how w3 should look like if it would be possible to resolve it . \n its age places it at about the transition time between having many remaining star clusters visible inside and the time when all star clusters have already merged . \n one should see the last surviving star clusters in the stage of merging . \n furthermore a merger object as massive as w3 should show a distinct core \n envelope structure . \n the merger object in our calculation had a dense , dynamically cold core and an extended envelope . \n this core \n envelope structure is not a transient feature but a stable configuration . \n we followed the evolution of our merger object for @xmath38  gyr and this structure remained . \n the core is formed out of the merged star clusters . \n the envelope consists out of the stripped stars , lost by the star clusters during the initial violent merger process . in our previous models the merger objects are not massive enough to keep stripped stars bound and they are lost . in the case of the w3 model \n the core object is massive enough to retain the stripped stars bound , forming the envelope structure of our model . \n w3 is said to be one of the newly discovered ultra - compact dwarf ( ucd ) galaxies and also one of the most massive ones ( maraston et al.2004 ) . \n other ucds are found and studied around the central galaxy in the fornax cluster ( ngc  1399 ) by hilker et al . \n ( 1999 ) , phillipps et al . \n ( 2001 ) and mieske et al . \n there these objects are quite old . \n there are two competing formation scenarios for ucds . while bekki et al . \n ( 2003 ) propose that these objects are the remaining cores of stripped nucleated dwarf galaxies , fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002a ) proposed the merging scenario from star cluster complexes as a possible formation process , resulting naturally from the merging of gas - rich galaxies in groups as the groups merge with a galaxy cluster . \n a possible way to distinguish between the two scenarios would be an analysis of the stellar populations in these objects . \n while the merging star cluster scenario implies that the stars of the ucds have more or less the same metallicity and age ( this holds at least for the most prominent population formed in the starburst ) , cores of dwarf galaxies should show a more complex metallicity and age distribution . and \n as dwarf galaxies are believed to be the oldest building blocks in the universe , the cores should show a prominent very old population .    in the case of \n w3 the stripping scenario can be completely ruled out . \n age estimates of this object range from @xmath14 to @xmath15  myr , which is also the age of the interaction ( ngc  7252 is a merger remnant of two gas - rich disc galaxies ) . \n this time is much too short for a nucleus to be stripped of its surrounding dwarf galaxy . \n if this implies that all ucds must have formed in the same way or if both scenarios are possible and are realized by nature can not yet be asserted .", "StartTimeOffset": 2459962722276, "RequestID": "d566fa4c33a4ed8582a0a7e2097bf0127ecfcdfc", "TotalTokens": 3113}

{"ContextTokens": 3444, "GeneratedTokens": 285, "SynthesizedBody": "in the standard big bang model , the primordial abundance of deuterium is a sensitive function of the baryon to photon ratio , ( e.g. walker et al . 1991 ) making it a quantity of great cosmological interest . \n further , since all known astrophysical processes ( apart from the big bang itself , of course ) result in a net destruction of deuterium , the currently observed value of the deuterium abundance is a strict lower limit to its primordial abundance . \n hst observations of the di lyman@xmath5 line in the local solar neighborhood ( linsky et al . \n 1993 ) yield a deuterium abundance of @xmath6 . \n conversion from this local current abundance to the primordial abundance depends on less well understood details of the history of the stellar reprocessing of matter in the local ism . in order to circumvent this problem \n a number of groups have been attempting to measure the deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman - limit systems . \n since these systems are less chemically evolved than the local ism , conversion from the measured to the primordial abundance should be more straightforward . \n however , the results of these observations are conflicting , with different groups ( carswell et al . \n 1994 , songalia et al . \n 1994 , tytler et al . \n 1996 ) measuring abundances which differ by more than an order of magnitude . \n part of the problem is that the di lyman@xmath5 line is separated from the hi lyman@xmath5 line by only 82  km  s@xmath7 , making the chance of contamination of the di line by absorption from a small parcel of hi at a slightly different velocity from that of the main lyman - limit system non - negligible . \n there have also been several attempts to observe the hyperfine transition of di at radio frequencies . \n since the frequency of this line is more than a factor of 4 lower than the frequency of the corresponding transition in hi , the question of hi contamination does not arise . \n two kinds of lines - of - sight have been favored in the past , the first towards bright radio sources ( sgr  a & cas  a ; weinreb 1962 , anantharamiah & radhakrishnan 1979 , heiles et al . \n 1993 ) , where the hydrogen column density is known to be high . \n the disadvantages of these lines of sight are that : ( i )  the bright radio sources contribute significantly to the system temperature , making detection more difficult ; ( ii )  any measurement refers only to the thin pencil beam subtended by the absorber ; and ( iii )  the molecular column density is also high , making it likely that most of the deuterium is in molecular rather than atomic form ( heiles et al . 1993 ) . \n anantharamiah & radhakrishnan ( 1979 ) placed an upper limit of @xmath8 on the di abundance towards sgr  a. heiles et al . \n ( 1993 ) reached similar limits towards sgr  a as well as cas  a.    the other promising direction for a search for the radio emission from di is that towards the galactic anticenter , where one expects the line to be in emission . \n the advantages of this direction are that ( i )  the high optical depth of hi is due to velocity crowding along a long pathlength rather than a high volume density ; ( ii )  the molecular column density and metallicity are low ; and ( iii )  the observations are sensitive to the di abundance within the entire telescope beam , and not just a narrow cone towards the background source as in the case of absorption observations . \n the results of a long integration in the direction @xmath9 using the hat creek telescope were presented by blitz & heiles ( 1987 ) , who found an upper limit ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 for @xmath1 . here \n we report on a long integration towards a partially overlapping line - of - sight , @xmath12 , with the westerbork synthesis array . using the 14 wsrt telescopes as independent single dishes allowed us to significantly increase the effective integration time . \n the observations were conducted at the wsrt during 29 sessions between 9  march and 14  may 1989 , and used a special correlator configuration which provided 28 auto - correlations ( 14  telescopes @xmath13 2  polarizations ) in addition to a number of cross - correlations between the different telescopes . \n the cross - correlation data were not used in the data analysis . \n the observations were done in a frequency switched mode , with the magnitude of the frequency throw equal to the total bandwidth of 0.156 mhz ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath7 ) . \n each spectrum had 256 uniformly tapered channels . \n the on spectrum was centered on @xmath15  km  s@xmath7 . \n either before or after each source observation ( which typically lasted a few hours ) a standard calibrator was observed in the same frequency switched mode for about an hour . \n the data reduction was done in wasp ( chengalur 1996 ) , a package suited to the automated reduction of large quantities of spectral data . for each observation , \n the data for each polarization of each telescope were reduced separately . \n every 60 second on spectrum was baselined using the corresponding off spectrum . \n next the following flagging and baselining operations were done iteratively , until the the rms of the remaining unflagged data converged ( which it typically did within 3 iterations ) . \n the rms over all channels and all time was computed , all points which exceeded 6 sigma were flagged . \n a linear baseline was then fit and subtracted from each spectrum ( excluding these flagged points ) . \n spectra whose rms ( over channel numbers ) exceeded 2.5 times the global rms were flagged , and finally channels whose rms ( over time ) exceeded 3 times the global rms were flagged . for all but the first iteration , the previously fit baseline was first added back to each spectrum . \n these criteria were selected after trial runs on a few sample observations and were tailored for efficient removal of narrow - band emi and of spectra in which the emi was strong enough to cause ringing effects . \n the data from telescopes 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 ( which are the closest to the control building ) showed a large amount of emi , and are almost entirely flagged out . \n finally , all the unflagged data were averaged together to produce one average spectrum per polarization per telescope per observation . \n since low - level intermittent emi sometimes survived this flagging process , this average spectrum was inspected visually and telescopes with broad multi - channel emi or with low - level ringing were flagged . \n all the remaining data were averaged together , separately for each polarization of each telescope . \n these processing steps were carried out separately for the source and the calibrator observations . \n a 4@xmath16 order polynomial baseline was then fit to the _ calibrator _ spectrum and then this _ same _ baseline was removed from the source observations ( after allowing for a small scaling difference between the source and calibrator observation ) . \n the spectra from two telescopes ( both polarizations of rtd and one polarization of rt3 ) showed substantial baseline structure even after this correction and were dropped from further processing . \n the spectra from the remaining telescopes were then averaged together and smoothed with a gaussian smoothing function of 11.2  km  s@xmath7 fwhm . \n a few channels which still showed unresolved peaks , presumably due to emi , were blanked before smoothing . since the smoothing length was @xmath17 channels , this had very little effect on the spectrum . \n the final spectrum ( excluding about 10% of the band on either edge for which the noise level is higher and the calibrator baseline is more poorly determined ) is shown in figure  1 . \n the peak - to - peak variation is about 4  mk , approximately a factor of two smaller than that of the spectrum in blitz & heiles ( 1987 ) . \n it is interesting to note that similar to blitz & heiles , there is a feature of low significance ( @xmath18 peak brightness ) at the velocity @xmath19  km  s@xmath7 . \n we have overlaid a gaussian profile with peak brightness 2.4  mk and the same velocity centroid , @xmath20  km  s@xmath7 and fwhm of 18.7  km  s@xmath7 as the hi emission feature in this direction . excluding this possible feature , the noise level is 0.85  mk over 11.2  km  s@xmath7 , again about a factor of 2 lower than the 1.6  mk quoted in blitz & heiles 1987 ( who also appear to have excluded the putative feature before computing the noise level ) . including this feature in the calculation of the noise \n gives an rms of 1.06  mk , while the expected thermal noise is 0.8  mk . \n the galactic anticenter region , near @xmath21 , is particularly well - suited to a search for the di hyperfine emission feature at @xmath2292-cm . \n the hi emission brightness in this region peaks smoothly into a plateau extending spatially over several degrees with a brightness temperature 135@xmath233  k , as can be seen in burton ( 1985 ) . \n conditions should therefore be reasonably constant over the @xmath24 beam of the wsrt dishes . \n the extended region of line brightening is paired with a line narrowing due to velocity crowding . \n the hi emission - line profile from this region is relatively narrow , with a fwhm of 18.7  km  s@xmath7 . \n the line core is rather flat - topped , strongly suggesting a high line opacity . \n it also displays shallow self - absorption , indicating a modest amount of temperature substructure along the line - of - sight . \n based on the depth of the self - absorption features and assuming a substantial line opacity , the spin temperature of the atomic gas appears to be in the range 125135  k.    direct measurements of the hi opacity along many lines of sight in this region have not yet been carried out . \n the typical sky density of moderately bright extragalactic background sources suitable for such a measurement suggests that a few tens of lines of sight could , in principle , be observed . \n the closest line of sight that has been observed in hi absorption ( dickey et al . \n 1983 ) is at @xmath25 . \n this is near the edge of the plateau in emission brightness , where the line profile is already somewhat broader than in the direction of maximum velocity crowding , with a fwhm of 23.4  km  s@xmath7 . \n the absorption profile extends smoothly over the entire velocity extent in which the emission profile exceeds a brightness of about 510  k , with a uniform high opacity of about 2 across the line core . \n this is consistent with the expectation for a gas distribution in which the column density is dominated by an approximately isothermal gas with kinetic temperature in the range 125135  k. an absorption equivalent width , @xmath26  =  33.68  km  s@xmath7 is found . \n the very smooth nature of the hi emission suggests that it is plausible to expect a comparable equivalent width in the direction @xmath12 .    assuming that the di emission is either mixed with , or lies behind , most of the galactic continuum emission , ( which has the substantial brightness of about 70  k at 92  cm wavelength ) the equation of radiative transfer yields simply :      where @xmath28 is the differential brightness temperature on and off the line , @xmath29 is the spin temperature of the di and @xmath30 is the optical depth of the di . for @xmath31 \n this yields @xmath32 , or @xmath33 for an approximately isothermal gas . \n the line integral of the gaussian overlaid on the possible feature in figure  1 is @xmath34  k  km  s@xmath7 . assuming that the spin temperature of the di is the same as that of hi ( i.e. 130  k ) , this corresponds to @xmath35  =  3.7@xmath3610@xmath37  km  s@xmath7 . \n hence the estimate of the ratio of the optical depths is @xmath38 . \n the relationship between the ratio of the optical depths and the ratio of the column densities of di and hi is ( anantharamiah & radhakrishnan 1979 ) @xmath39 , hence the estimated abundance of di is @xmath2 . \n this is comparable to the inferred pre - solar abundance ( kunde et al . \n 1982 , courtin et al . \n 1984 ) , and about a factor of 2 above the current di abundance in the local solar neighborhood ( linsky et al . 1993 ) . \n as discussed in the introduction , the lack of detection of di towards the inner galaxy suggests that most of the di has been converted into hd within molecular clouds ( heiles et al . 1993 ) . towards the outer galaxy , however , the molecular column density is low along many sight lines . \n in fact , the survey by dame et al . \n ( 1987 ) detected very little co emission in the galactic plane between 180 and 185 degrees longitude except for a small concentration at @xmath40  km  s@xmath7 . \n the high optical depth in hi seems to be due to velocity crowding in diffuse gas along a pathlength of several kpc , and does not appear to arise in a single physical entity like a giant molecular cloud . \n it seems plausible , therefore , that a large fraction of the deuterium in this direction is still in atomic form . \n further , the metallicity gradient in the galaxy suggests that the di abundance in the outer galaxy would be higher than the inner . \n calculations by prantzos ( 1996 ) show that the deuterium abundance gradient is in general steeper than ( and of course opposite in sign to ) the oxygen gradient ( because of the late ejection of metal - poor but deuterium - free gas from low mass stars formed at early times ) . \n while the exact gradient is sensitive to the assumed infall model , the current di abundance within diffuse atomic gas in the inner and outer galaxy could well differ by a factor of two . \n another useful comparison to make is with the range of measured di abundances , @xmath41 , in high redshift lyman limit systems ( carswell et al . \n 1994 , songalia et al . \n 1994 , tytler et al . 1996 ) . \n if a high primordial abundance turns out to be correct , our results indicate that even in regions with reduced star formation , the current deuterium abundance is about a factor of 6 lower than primordial . \n in contrast , recent model calculations of astration of deuterium suggest that the abundance evolution is modest , with current abundance only a factor @xmath42 less than primordial ( galli et al . \n 1995 ) . on the other hand , the low value of d / h measured by tytler et al . \n ( 1996 ) , @xmath43 , is consistent with our own possible detection and the inferred pre - solar value . \n direct imaging of di emission in the outer regions of nearby galaxies may provide a very effective means of addressing this issue comprehensively , once the capability for achieving sub - mk sensitivity on arcmin scales becomes available with the next generation of radio telescopes . \n the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) should already allow a robust detection of di emission from the galaxy within the next few years , while di imaging of nearby external galaxies should become possible with construction of the square kilometer array interferometer ( skai ) early in the mext millenium . \n we would like to thank hans van someren grve and the wsrt staff for carrying out these non - standard observations , and bauke kramer , tony foley and geert kuiper for assistance in retrieving the data from the wsrt archive .", "StartTimeOffset": 2489908430568, "RequestID": "6c8fe88e9efe6eee42270e5297e9aa884bb04684", "TotalTokens": 3729}

wave background spectrum has the form @xmath8 , and there is no clear spectral break down to 2000@xmath3 m . \n the lack of a break to a steeper slope supports the idea that high - redshift galaxies with redshifted seds peaking at about 1000@xmath3 m are still contributing to the background intensity , indicating a high maximum redshift of the population of about 10 . \n if the shape of the sed is assumed not to evolve significantly , then the luminosity density must evolve as @xmath9 @xcite for @xmath10 in order to generate this background spectrum , a result which is independent of cosmology . \n such a gently declining high -

motivated additions of greater complexity can thus be introduced to the models as the observations improve , without invoking parameters too numerous to constrain reliably and uniquely . \n a more physically motivated approach connects the evolving mass function of galaxies to the associated luminosity function using a prescription for both star formation and the fueling of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite ; however , care must be taken to avoid getting lost in the space of free parameters . without an additional population of \n short - lived , very luminous galaxies , standard semi - analytical models , which include star formation in the gas that cools in galaxy disks , fail to account for the observed surface density of scuba and mambo sources @xcite .      the first results derived using this approach @xcite followed rapidly behind the first results of scuba surveys @xcite . a low - redshift 60-@xmath3 m luminosity function was assumed @xcite , an sed was defined by a dust temperature @xmath23 , and a form of low - redshift evolution @xmath24 was included . @xmath23 and @xmath25 were determined by requiring that the form of the 60-@xmath3 m _ iras _ counts and the early results of deep 175-@xmath3 m _ iso _ surveys were reproduced ; @xmath26k and @xmath27 were required @xcite . as discussed above , this temperature is consistent with subsequent scuba measurements of dust temperatures for _ iras _ galaxies @xcite , while @xmath25 matched the value inferred from optical surveys @xcite , rather than the value of @xmath28 that is often assumed to describe the evolution of galaxies in the far - ir waveband . \n note that @xmath29 is derived from 15-@xmath3 m _ iso _ surveys , taking into account the complex restframe sed of a dusty galaxy between 5 and 10@xmath3 m @xcite . \n it is now possible to use the much more extensive data from 90- and 175-@xmath3 m _ iso _ counts @xcite , and a more popular non - zero-@xmath30 cosmology to revisit the results . \n there are no substantial changes ; formally @xmath31k and @xmath32 are the latest results , if a rayleigh  jeans spectral index of 3.5 is assumed . \n the form of evolution at higher redshifts , too distant for _ iso _ observations , is constrained by the background radiation intensity @xcite and the counts of scuba galaxies . from 2002 \n , mid - ir _ sirtf _ observations should make a major impact in this area . \n constraints from the background and scuba data are rather degenerate , although even the first scuba data in 1997 @xcite provided the tighter constraint : see @xcite , in which various models of high - redshift evolution were considered . \n the so - called gaussian model , in which @xmath21 is represented by a gaussian in cosmic epoch , provided the best description of the redshift distribution of scuba galaxies . \n the more accurate 175- and 850-@xmath3 m counts now available provide some additional information , and are useful for updating the results . \n progress has also been made in developing a more appropriate form of @xmath21 , which is fully compatible with models of cosmic chemical evolution , and naturally includes a peak in the evolution function @xcite : @xmath33 \\ , { \\rm cosh}^2c.\\ ] ] at low redshifts @xmath34 . \n using all available observational data , the results @xmath35 and @xmath36 are obtained ; see the solid line in fig.1 . \n these results are similar to those derived earlier @xcite , but take account of revised cosmological parameters and tighter error bars on some of the constraining data . \n the model described above is consistent with all the observed background radiation , counts and redshift distributions of galaxies at wavelengths longer than 60@xmath3 m . \n the dominant source of energy in the universe remains the restframe far - ir radiation of starlight and agn emission reprocessed by dust .      in an alternative investigation \n , we took a simple form of the evolution of the merger rate of dark - matter halos @xcite , which adequately reproduces the results of recent @xmath37-body simulations @xcite . \n we assumed that a certain redshift - dependent fraction @xmath38 of the total mass of dark and baryonic matter involved in mergers is converted into energy by nucleosynthesis in high - mass stars with an efficiency 0.007@xmath39 . \n note that the same formalism is appropriate for describing the evolution of agn fueling events at the epochs of mergers @xcite . \n the form of evolution and normalization of @xmath38 can be determined by a joint comparison with the background radiation intensity and low - redshift _ iras _ counts . using an appropriate form of @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 \n are required in the standard cosmology , assuming the galaxy sed discussed above . \n the resulting history of galaxy evolution is shown by the thick dashed line in fig.1 . \n in addition , the counts of luminous galaxies associated with merger - induced bursts of activity can be determined if a fraction @xmath44 of mergers are assumed to generate luminous bursts of duration @xmath45 . \n the product @xmath46 , which could depend on redshift , is the function that controls the results . using information derived from the counts of both low- and high - redshift galaxies , the form of @xmath47 required to account for the observations \n can be determined . \n if the form @xmath48 is chosen , then values of @xmath49gyr , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are required . \n both the simple and hierarchical models account for all the current observations in these wavebands . \n if the standard form of the far - ir  radio correlation is assumed , with a radio spectral index of @xmath53 , then the 8.4-ghz counts brighter than 10@xmath3jy predicted in the two models are 1.05 and 0.98arcmin@xmath54 , with slopes of @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively , matching the observed count @xmath57 @xcite . \n the faintest 1.4-ghz counts @xcite are also reproduced accurately . \n if the mid - ir sed is described by a power - law @xmath58 with @xmath59 at wavelengths shorter than the peak of the sed , then the normalization and general features of the deep counts of galaxies determined using _ iso _ at 15@xmath3 m @xcite are also reproduced , including the marked change of slope at flux densities between 0.5 and 1mjy . \n the presence or absence of a pah emission feature in the sed has little effect on the results . in the hierarchical model , the slope of the predicted 15-@xmath3 m counts at flux densities between 1 and 10mjy is steeper as compared with that in the simple model , in better agreement with the observations . \n these models , which involve a minimum number of free parameters , provide a reasonable description of all the counts and redshift distributions of dusty galaxies at both high and low redshifts . as additional data , especially more complete redshift distributions and very deep _ sirtf _ mid - ir counts , become available , more details can be incorporated into the models to reveal further information about the properties of evolving distant dusty starbursts / agn . \n the author , raymond and beverly sackler foundation research fellow at the ioa , thanks the foundation for generous financial support , eso for support at the meeting , and vicki barnard and kate quirk for helpful comments on the manuscript . \n these results are updated from scuba lens survey work with ian smail , rob ivison and jean -

{"ContextTokens": 3195, "GeneratedTokens": 90, "SynthesizedBody": "the analysis of several sources of observational data , supernovae type ia , redshift of distant objects , temperature fluctuations of background radiation ( cfr . \n padmanabhan @xcite for a nice review ) has lead to accept that our universe is acceleratedly expanding nowadays . \n this unexpected feature , which can not be explained by means of an standard matter content for the universe , has motivated lots of theoretical work , such as a dark energy component in the energy - momentum tensor or modifications of the theory of gravitation . \n violation of energy conditions due to these new components have given rise to consider new types of singularities , different from the well - known big bang and big crunch . \n beyond the so - called phantom divide , @xmath0 , accelerated expansion ends up at a big rip ( caldwell @xcite ) . \n below the phantom divide , other atypical events may come up , such as sudden singularities ( barrow @xcite ) . \n usually the analysis of these singularities is made by just tracking where the curvature scalars blow up . \n for instance , a classification of singularities is provided ( nojiri and odintsov @xcite ) depending on which scalars are singular or not . however the use of more poweful tools , such as geodesic analysis , has proven quite successful to discover new features of the singularities . \n furthermore , this is the natural framework to talk about singularities ( hawking and ellis @xcite ) . \n we consider homogeneous and isotropic universes endowed with a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath1 where the coordinates have the usual ranges . \n we are mostly interested in spatially - flat models , @xmath2 , since observations point out this kind of universe . \n geodesics in these models are described by simple ordinary equations due to their high symmetry , @xmath3    the dot stands for derivation with respect to proper time @xmath4 , which allows parametrization of geodesics satisfying the unitary condition of the velocity , @xmath5where @xmath6 is one for timelike , zero for lightlike or minus one for spacelike geodesics . \n the constant @xmath7 is the specific linear momentum of the geodesic . \n there are then three families of causal geodesics : lightlike geodesics ( @xmath8 ) , fluid worldlines ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and timelike radial geodesics ( @xmath9 , @xmath11 ) .    in order to perform calculations with a general scale factor \n , we only need that @xmath12 has a power expansion ( catton and visser @xcite ) around the event at @xmath13 , where a singularity is deemed to appear , @xmath14 with real and ordered exponents , @xmath15 , and positive @xmath16 . \n hence , the model behaves close to @xmath13 as a power - law model of exponent @xmath17 . \n accordingly , several types of singular events may arise :    * @xmath18 : the scale factor vanishes at @xmath13 and we have either a big bang or big crunch . \n * @xmath19 : the scale factor is finite at @xmath13 . if @xmath12 is analytical , the event at @xmath13 is regular . otherwise a weak or sudden singularity appears . \n * @xmath20 : the scale factor diverges at @xmath13 and a big rip appears . \n the analysis of causal geodesics is easy to perform in this case and is shown in table 1 ( fernndez - jambrina and lazkoz @xcite ) . \n .singularities in flrw models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this table shows the first of the unusual features of sudden singularities ( fernndez - jambrina and lazkoz @xcite ) : they are weak according to tipler ( tipler @xcite ) and krlak s definitions ( krolak @xcite ) and therefore they do not exert infinite tidal forces that might destroy extended bodies going through them . in this sense \n , they can not be considered the final fate of a universe , since they can be avoided by some observers .    concerning the big rip , another issue unveiled by the survey of causal geodesics in flrw models with an effective equation of state @xmath21 \n , @xmath22 for late times is that lightlike geodesics need infinite proper time before meeting the big rip . \n that is , only massive objects see the big rip . in this sense , since photons do not reach this event , we could say that big rip may be considered quite an intimate experience  with lights turned out ! since dark energy models with @xmath23 just below minus one have been shown to be compatible with observations , this features can not be neglected as mathematical curiosities . \n the issue of singularities located at infinite time coordinate is not as pointless as it may seem at first glance . \n the example of photons close to a big rip shows us that a finite coordinate time lapse can be experienced as an infinite proper time lapse , in this case by massless particles . \n the relation between proper time and coordinate time is far from trivial . \n first , we have to determine when causal geodesics reach infinite coordinate time in finite proper time .    for lightlike geodesics we may integrate the geodesic equation ( [ geods1 ] ) , @xmath24 in order to attain a necessary and sufficient condition for reaching infinite coordinate time in finite proper time : integrability of the scale factor @xmath12 , @xmath25 for sufficiently large @xmath26 . \n the same condition is valid for radial timelike geodesics . on the contrary , fluid worldlines with @xmath10 \n are not to be considered since for them proper time is essentially coordinate time .    for a start \n , we may consider models which behave for large @xmath26 as a power - law model @xmath27 . \n for them the geodesic equation ( [ geods1 ] ) yields @xmath28 and obviously infinite @xmath26 is reached for finite @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 . \n this is not however the interesting case , since it involves models starting with a big rip at @xmath31 . \n but if we consider models starting at @xmath32 and ending up at a big rip at @xmath31 the same reasoning is valid \n . the origin of radial causal geodesics would be at a finite proper time .    at this point , \n two possibilities arise in order to explain the finite origin of causal geodesics in phantom models : there is either a singularity at @xmath32 which explains the abrupt startpoint of these geodesics instead of ranging from and infinite proper time or the flrw coordinate patch does not cover the whole universe and we need to enlarge it . \n this is done , for instance , with de sitter universes in the parametrization which is used for inflation , @xmath2 , @xmath33 , which fulfills condition ( [ conda ] ) and therefore its radial geodesics reach @xmath32 in finite proper time . however , in this case it is possible to extend the spacetime to a larger one , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with another change of coordinates ( hawking and ellis @xcite ) and hence the singularity at @xmath32 is only apparent and due to a bad choice of coordinates . \n this option appears to be the correct for other universes since at @xmath32 all curvature scalars vanish as @xmath36 for power - law models \n .    however if we reckon ricci tensor components along radial lightlike geodesics , unexpected features arise , @xmath37 since the first term diverges at @xmath32 for @xmath30 regardless of the value of @xmath38 . \n the same happens for radial timelike geodesics . \n this unexpected result could only be avoided in models for which the curvature term cancels the first term , @xmath39 . \n but curiously the solutions of this equation are well known universes .    for @xmath2 \n we recover the aforementioned parametrization of de sitter universe , @xmath33 . \n for @xmath34 we find another parametrization of de sitter universe , @xmath40 . and for @xmath41 , also another parametrization of de sitter spacetime arises , @xmath42 but also anti - de sitter spacetime , @xmath43 , but for a choice of time coordinate origin . \n since only the one with @xmath2 decreases at @xmath44 , they do not affect our results . \n therefore we are led to conclude that universes which asymptotically behave as power - law models with @xmath30 , @xmath22 , in spite of having vanishing curvature scalars at @xmath32 , they possess there a sort of directional singularity that affects only radial geodesics , a p.p . curvature singularity ( curvature singularity along a parallelly transported basis ) ( hawking and ellis @xcite ) . \n furthermore , this singularity is strong ( tipler @xcite , krlak @xcite ) and therefore can not be overlooked . \n radial observers would start their trajectories at a singularity at @xmath32 and would end up at a big rip at @xmath31 , though their life span would be finite , as we have shown . \n photons would start their paths at the singularity at @xmath32 but they would never reach the big rip in these models .    summarizing these results and extending the conclusions to non - asymptotically power - law models , \n we have :    * for scale factors growing or decreasing as @xmath45 or slower , radial causal geodesics reach @xmath32 in infinite proper time . * for scale factors decreasing faster than @xmath45 , radial causal geodesics reach @xmath32 in finite proper time , meeting a strong curvature singularity , except for de sitter spacetime .    cases with an ill - defined limit at @xmath32 may be handled directly with condition ( [ conda ] ) . \n the features which have been shown about the past of phantom models might seem useless since dark energy is a relevant component only for the future of the universe from coincidence time on in order to explain accelerated expansion , not for the past . \n nonetheless there are implications for the models . \n for instance , we may use our results to reckon the duration of a universe filled with a power - law phantom field as measured by an observer following a radial geodesic ( [ geods1 ] ) , @xmath46 which is finite again for @xmath30 . \n but most surprising is that this quantity can be made as small as wanted by increasing the total linear momentum @xmath7 of the traveller . \n it may be argued that this calculation is useless since we can not extend the validity of the phantom model towards the past , but this does not invalidates the result . \n we may calculate the time span measured by the observer from coincidence time to the big rip and reach the same conclusion : observers may reduce the life of the universe by increasing their linear momentum . \n we have always known that driving fast could be dangerous , but not to this extent ! since a negative exponent @xmath47 is necessary in ( [ p ] ) for this result , it is clear that this behaviour is exclusive of phantom models with @xmath0 for large times , that is , below the phantom divide . \n so far we have shown that phantom fields produce not only a big rip but a directional singularity in the past , that massless particles do not experience a big rip and that the duration of the universe may be shortened _ ad libitum _ by increasing the linear momentum of the observer . \n there are other exotic features inherent to phantom models ( fernndez - jambrina @xcite ) , especially of those which are closer to the phantom divide , but these should be enough to show the unexpected behaviour that one encounters on trying to model dark energy with phantom fields . \n this work is supported by the spanish ministry of education and science research grant fis-2005 -

'' \n however , deuterium is fragile and is destroyed by stars even before they reach the main sequence . \n thus , local measurements of its abundance , where about 50% of the material has been through stars , do not directly reflect its primeval abundance . \n recently , the situation has changed dramatically , ushering in a new , precision era for bbn @xcite . \n burles and tytler measured the deuterium abundance in high - redshift ( @xmath12 ) hydrogen clouds where almost none of the material has been processed through stars , and they have made a strong case for a primeval deuterium abundance , ( d / h)@xmath13 @xcite .    from this 10% measurement of ( d / h@xmath14 , the baryon density can be inferred to around 10% , @xmath15 , or in terms of baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath16 . with the baryon density in hand \n , one can predict the abundances of the other three light elements . then \n , @xmath5he and @xmath1li can test the consistency of bbn ; d and @xmath0he can probe stellar processing since bbn ; and @xmath1li can test stellar models . \n furthermore , a precise determination of the baryon density can make bbn an even sharper probe of particle physics ( e.g. , the limit to the number of light particle species ) .    to take full advantage of bbn in the precision era \n requires accurate predictions . \n the uncertainty in the deuterium - inferred baryon density comes in almost equal parts from the ( d / h ) measurement and theoretical error in predicting the deuterium abundance . \n the bbn yields depend upon the neutron lifetime and eleven nuclear cross sections ( see table [ table1 ] ) . in 1993 , \n smith , kawano and malaney ( skm ) estimated the theoretical uncertainties by using a conservative approach @xcite . while their work has set the standard for the past five years , it was not without its shortcomings : experiments were not weighted strictly by their precision ; treatment of systematic effects was neither uniform nor explicit ; fits used theoretical rules of thumb . in addition , there have been new measurements@xcite . \n after a careful analysis and updating of the microphysics for small but important effects , the theoretical uncertainty in the predicted @xmath5he abundance has been reduced to that in the neutron lifetime , @xmath17 ( 95% cl ) @xcite . \n motivated by the primeval deuterium measurement , we decided to refine the error estimates for the other light elements , using the nuclear data themselves and monte - carlo realization to make our error estimates . \n this method also allowed us to identify where improvements in the nuclear data would be most useful . \n .for each reaction and nuclide , the energies ( in kev , center - of - mass ) at which the sensitivity functions for d and @xmath1li attain half their maximum value ; these intervals indicate the energies relevant for bbn ( @xmath18 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ] \n the details of our method are described in a longer paper @xcite ; here we outline the salient points . \n the nuclear inputs come in the form of measurements of cross sections , @xmath19 , or equivalently , the astrophysical @xmath20-factor , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the coulomb - barrier tunneling probability . from these , \n the needed thermally - averaged reaction rates per particle follow @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced mass . \n we use monte - carlo realizations of all the experimental data sets to determine thermal reaction rates and final yields . for each realization , we proceed as follows . for every data point from every data set \n we draw a value from a gaussian distribution whose mean is the central value and whose variance is the standard error reported for that point . \n we account for correlated normalization error in a data set by similarly drawing a value for the overall normalization . for each reaction , a smooth representation of @xmath25 \n is obtained by fitting a piecewise spline to the data , with individual points weighted by their standard errors in the usual way . using the spline fits \n , we evolve light - element abundances with a standard bbn code . from 25,000 such realizations , \n we produce distributions of the light - element yields and compute means and 95% cl intervals . our results , as a function of the baryon density , \n are shown in fig . \n [ fig : etaplot ] .    data points and uncertainties were extracted from a comprehensive review of the experimental literature from approximately 1945 onward , beginning with a careful reading of the original sources . \n we excluded a small number of data sets for which insufficient information for our technique was provided . \n as always , there is the sticky problem of systematic error , especially for cross sections represented by only a few measurements . \n a case in point is the reaction @xmath26 , which produces nearly all of the @xmath27 for @xmath28 . \n activation measurements @xcite show an apparent disagreement with prompt - photon measurements ( see fig . \n [ fig : he3ag ] and ref . \n because these measurements are not in the energy range of relevance for bbn , they have little influence on our results . \n ( skm omitted activation measurements from their analysis altogether . ) \n we take them into account by performing a second monte carlo , where the prompt - photon measurements are renormalized by the weighted mean ( and uncertainty ) of the three activation measurements . \n this shifts the @xmath1li / h 95% cl interval upward by 11% ( see fig . \n [ fig : li7 ] ) . \n our method breaks down completely for the process @xmath29 . \n this is because of a near - complete lack of data at the energies relevant for bbn . \n the approach used for this reaction is a constrained theoretical model that is normalized to high - precision thermal neutron capture cross - section measurements . in particular , we use the most recent evaluation , from endf - b / vi @xcite . \n this evaluation was performed around 1970 ( with a minor update in 1989 ) , and it fitted a capture model to data of similar vintage for the neutron - proton system . \n no documentation survives , and the uncertainty is difficult to quantify  especially in light of known systematic problems with the likely input data @xcite . \n ( efforts are underway to construct a new model for this reaction , based upon more modern nuclear models and data @xcite . ) for consistency , we follow skm and assign a 5% @xmath30 uncertainty in the overall normalization ( also consistent with an estimate from the evaluation s \n authors @xcite ) , and we use this value for our monte - carlo calculations .    to investigate the role of each reaction independently , we ran the bbn code using the skm rates for all but one reaction , studying that reaction alone with our monte - carlo method . \n this produced , for each of the eleven key reactions , a best fit to the cross - section data , 95% cl intervals for the cross sections ( fig . \n [ fig : he3ag ] ) , and 95% cl uncertainties for d and @xmath1li yields for each reaction ( see figs .  [ \n fig : deuterium ] and [ fig : li7 ] ) . \n our most important result is apparent : the uncertainty estimate from our method is a factor of two smaller than the skm estimate . \n not only have we reduced the theoretical error estimate , but we have also put it on a firmer footing . \n our `` most probable '' yields also differ slightly ( less than @xmath30 ) from the corresponding results of skm . \n this reflects both differences in weighting the nuclear data , and the inclusion of new data . \n we computed `` sensitivity functions '' for the yields of d and @xmath1li for each reaction . \n these functions measure the fractional changes in yield caused by a delta - function change in cross section at a given reaction energy ( see fig . \n [ fig : he3ag ] and table [ table1 ] ) . \n the sensitivity functions quantify where precise cross section measurements are required . \n we have reduced the theoretical error estimate for bbn deuterium production by a factor of two , so that the deuterium abundance itself dominates the uncertainty in baryon density . \n the deuterium determination of the baryon density is thus sharpened , from 8% to 6% ( at @xmath30 ) , or @xmath4 ( 95% cl ) . in the next five years \n , the precision of the primeval deuterium measurement should improve significantly , because the sloan digital sky survey will increase the number of qsos with measured redshifts by a factor of almost 100 , with a similar increase in the number of deuterium systems expected . \n further improvement in the theoretical prediction is possible ; the key reactions in this regard are : d(p,@xmath31)@xmath0he ; d(d , p)@xmath0h above 100kev ; d(d , n)@xmath0he above 100kev ; and p(n,@xmath31)d at 30130kev ( see fig .  [ \n fig : deuterium ] ) . turning \n the deuterium determination of the baryon density into a few percent measurement will make possible a beautiful consistency test @xcite : comparison with a similarly accurate measurement of the baryon density from cbr anisotropy . \n the deuterium - inferred baryon density leads to a prediction for the big - bang @xmath5he abundance : @xmath32 ( all 95% cl ) . when the primeval @xmath5he abundance is determined to three significant figures \n , this will be a powerful consistency test . at the moment , systematic effects dominate the error budget ; in particular , underlying stellar absorption in the most metal - poor hii regions . izotov and thuan s sample @xcite excludes the tainted or suspected - to - be tainted systems , and they find @xmath33 . \n this is consistent with the deuterium prediction . \n a less homogeneous sample @xcite , which includes some of the tainted systems , indicates a lower value , @xmath34 , which is not consistent with the deuterium prediction . \n additional light particle species present around the time of bbn lead to increased @xmath5he production , and an upper limit to the primeval @xmath5he abundance can be used to constrain their existence @xcite . using @xmath33 , the deuterium - determined baryon density , and the prior @xmath35 \n , we derive the 95% cl limit , @xmath36 . \n one should be mindful that systematic error in @xmath37 could change the limit , and that it will become more secure with better @xmath5he measurements . \n finally , we turn to @xmath1li , the light element for which the uncertainty in the predicted abundance is largest . \n our analysis has reduced the theoretical uncertainty by a factor of two , though a small systematic uncertainty remains . using our full monte carlo with the deuterium observations , we predict ( @xmath1li / h)@xmath38 \\times 10^{-10}$ ] . \n the abundance derived from old , pop ii halo stars is ( @xmath1li / h)@xmath39\\times 10^{-10 } = ( 1.73\\pm 0.3)\\times 10^{-10}$ ] @xcite ( all at 95% cl ) . \n the discrepancy could represent a real inconsistency or merely a depletion of @xmath1li by a factor of around two in these stars ( predicted by some models of stellar evolution @xcite ) . a nuclear solution for the discrepancy is unlikely \n a @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) change in the @xmath42d rate would be required , and the unresolved systematics of @xmath26 can only make the problem worse . \n there is still much room to improve the bbn @xmath1li prediction ; the key reactions are : @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ; and @xmath46 . \n perhaps the most rewarding result of this work is that we have verified what david schramm many times proclaimed , `` the predictions of bbn are very robust because the key cross section are measured at the energies where they are needed . '' \n in particular , if all eleven critical cross sections were set to zero outside the intervals where they are measured , the final light - element abundances would change by less than 10% of their current theoretical uncertainty .                                      g.  m. hale , d. dodder , e. siciliano , and w. wilson , los alamos national laboratory , endf / b - vi evaluation , mat # 125 , rev . \n 2 , oct . 1997 ; retrieved from the endf database at the nndc online data service .", "StartTimeOffset": 2524910296914, "RequestID": "95ff0fc7d4d4e7a32fdfc54cd838a2837ba37ec9", "TotalTokens": 3199}

half systems ) are separated by the isolators ( two spin - half systems ) . \n this architecture is analogous to one considered in ref . \n @xcite for off diagonal interactions between qubits where it was proposed to implement a virtual switch by carrying out the steps of the quantum computation in and out of designed interaction free subspaces . \n in contrast to ref . \n @xcite the architecture considered in the present paper is based on the ising type interaction and it is not required turning on and off couplings between isolators . hence , this scheme allows to compute without switching the couplings and simplifies the operation of qc compared to one dimensional ising spin chain qc @xcite . \n the paper is organized as follows . \n the ising spin quantum computer model is described in sec . \n ii . the realization of the universal gates are considered in sec . \n iii . in sec . \n iv we summarize our results . \n architecture of the quantum computer with the ising spin lattice is shown in fig . \n 1 . it is assumed that information carrying qubits are situated in the middle chain and do not directly interact . \n qubits in the upper and lower chains play the rule of isolators . \n we assume that in the idle mode or at the single bit operations the spins of isolators are oppositely directed . in this case for two neighboring qubits of middle chain , the total ising interaction is vanished for arbitrary states of qubits . \n this can be achieved at the initialization of the system by two ways . \n firstly , if one applies a strong global field in the @xmath2 direction to all qubits , at low temperatures all spins will line up with the field \n . then one should flip the states of the qubits situated at either above or below chains . \n secondly , one can assume that the global fields are inverted for the upper and lower spin chains . \n hence , if larmor frequencies of qubits are much greater than ising interaction constant , then ground state of our model will coincide with the desired initial state of qc . \n then for the initialization of the qc one should just cool the system . \n note , that this architecture is also relevant to a system with the heisenberg interaction . \n as is known , if the frequency difference between the neighboring spins is much greater than the spin - spin interaction , then the heisenberg interaction tends to an effective ising form @xcite . in this case \n the main technical challenge is the creation of a large gradient of the magnetic field and the decoherence caused by the sources of the magnetic field . \n the latest development of the micropattern wires technique provides the magnetic field gradients @xmath3 @xcite and opens new possibilities for realization of ising spin qc . \n the hamiltonian for the ising spin lattice ( fig . \n 1 ) placed in an external nonuniform magnetic field can be represented as@xmath4@xmath5    here @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the operator of the @xmath2 component of @xmath8th spin ( @xmath9 ) with larmor frequency @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the interaction constant between qubits and isolators , and @xmath12 is the interaction constant between isolators . to distinguish the isolators from the information carrying qubits we additionally label these qubits via subscripts @xmath13  ( upper qubits ) and @xmath14  ( lower qubits ) . \n the initial wave function of the qc can be represented as@xmath15with the energy@xmath16 . \n \\label{energy}\\ ] ]    we assume that single bit gates are easy and fast to implement either by individual addressing of single qubits or by selective electromagnetic pulses whose frequencies are close ( resonant transition ) to the larmor frequencies of the desired qubits . for the latter case \n it has been assumed nonuniform magnetic field in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . \n since qubits are not coupled to each other , fully parallel operations are possible . \n in contrast to one dimensional ising chain @xcite in the considering model there is no need of complicated protocols for correcting the phase and probability errors due to permanent interaction between the qubits . as we will see below two qubit universal gate between neighboring qubits \n can be realized simply operating on the isolators . \n in this section we describe the protocols for the two qubit universal gates . for this purpose \n it is sufficient to consider one elementary cell , with two qubits and isolators . \n the hamiltonian of elementary cell in the external _ rf _ field can be represented as@xmath17@xmath18 + s_{a}^{+}\\exp \\left [ i\\omega _ { a}t\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{hceel}\\]]where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the frequency of the pulse , and @xmath21 is the rabi frequency . \n we assume that the initial state is@xmath22@xmath23 is the possible overall phase .    under the condition @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) the pulse effectively affects only above located spin ( resonant transition ) . \n in this case , evolution of the wave function ( [ iwf ] ) is confined within subspace ( 8 dimensional ) of the entire hilbert space of four qubits and can be written in the form ( in the interaction picture)@xmath26@xmath27\\]]@xmath28@xmath29 ,   \\label{wf}\\]]where @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are probability amplitudes of the states with energies:@xmath33@xmath34@xmath35@xmath36@xmath37from the schrdinger equation@xmath38one can obtain the equations for the probability amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath39 . \n system of coupled differential equations for the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 splits into four independent groups . \n each group consists of two equations of the form@xmath40@xmath41the detunings in eq . \n ( [ eqc ] ) are @xmath42@xmath43assuming rectangular _ rf _ pulse , for the initial conditions@xmath44the solution of eq . \n ( [ eqc ] ) is@xmath45@xmath46where @xmath47 is the pulse duration and @xmath48 .    for the realization of controlled phase gate ( [ cphase ] ) we will consider two cases , depending on the magnitude of spin -

( [ eq : hybrid1 ] ) becomes    @xmath43    here @xmath44 is a relative phase after the transformation of the @xmath41 wave - plate . \n we note that the oam `` path '' is marked by polarisation . \n when one path is selected in this way , no interference appears . \n however , just as in the double slit case , a projection of the polarization of photon a onto a complimentary basis state with example for the @xmath45 subspace is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] ( c ) . in this case \n the oam `` path '' information is erased . \n suppose the state of the hybrid entangled system is represented by eq . \n ( [ eq : hybrid2 ] ) . a polarizer orientated at an angle @xmath46 ( with respect to the ) in arm a will project photon a onto the following target state    @xmath47    thus allowing the `` path '' to evolve from marked to unmarked by a judicious choice of @xmath46 . \n next , the visibility of fringes in arm b needs to be detected , which may easily be done with scanning detectors ( or more expensive camera - based systems ) . \n we instead make use of scanning holograms and a fixed detector as our pattern sensitive detector @xcite . \n we create sector states from superpositions of oam with a relative intermodal phase of @xmath48 :    @xmath49    the phase structure of @xmath50 is and allows a measurement of the path ( oam ) interference in arm b , analogous to detecting oam entanglement with bell - like measurements @xcite . thus the fringe pattern ( or lack thereof ) \n can be detected by scanning through @xmath48 . \n the normalized probability of detection given the two projections is    @xmath51    @xmath52 is synonymous to the coincidence counts of the entangled pair . \n when the polarizer is orientated at @xmath53 , which corresponds to the @xmath17 polarization state , the probability distribution with respect to @xmath48 is a constant since the path is marked . \n conversely , for @xmath54 which corresponds to then @xmath55 and hence the oscillation is an indication of an interference pattern emerging from a superposition of the oam paths of photon b. therefore the which - path ( oam ) information has been erased . \n the fringe visibility is given by    @xmath56    the theoretical visibility of the interference fringes with respect to the angle of the polarizer ( @xmath46 ) is @xmath57 . \n in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) , we present the experimental set - up for our quantum eraser with polarization - oam hybrid entangled photons . \n a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) nonlinear crystal , cut for type 1 phase matching , was pumped with a 100 mw coherent cube diode laser with a 450 nm nominal wavelength , producing entangled photon pairs at a wavelength of 810 nm . \n the spin - orbit conversion was achieved by inserting a @xmath31-plate creating polarisation - oam hybrid entanglement in the @xmath58 subspace . in this arrangement , \n the state of the system is given by eq . \n ( [ eq : hybrid1 ] ) . to mark the states , a @xmath41 wave plate    ) in the range 0 to @xmath42 . \n similarly , * ( c ) * measurement results where the oam path is distinguished ( squares ) and erased ( circles ) , and subsequence measurements of the fringe visibility * ( d ) * with the polariser angle . in all panels experimental data is shown as symbols and theoretical calculations as dashed curves . ] \n the results are presented in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) , confirming that no interference fringes were observed . \n the small oscillations are due to imperfections in the polarization filtering of photon a. the calculated visibility of the interference fringes is @xmath59 , in good agreement with the theoretical value of 0 . \n one can interpret this as photon b carrying a well defined amount oam , or equivalently , that the oam path is marked ( distinguished ) and thus visibility is zero . \n the oam path information was erased by performing a complimentary measurement of the polarization of photon a. we set the polarizer angle to . \n the coincidence counts from the azimuthal scanning are presented in fig.[fig : fig3 ] ( a ) , where interference fringes with a visibility of @xmath60 are observed , indicating that the path information has been erased , and equivalently , the oam of the photon . \n the detection probability function is consistent with the theory of eq . \n ( [ eq : prob ] ) . \n next , the polarizer angle was varied in the range @xmath61 through @xmath62 with subsequent measurements of the spatial pattern . \n the visibility of the interference fringes with respect to the polarizer orientation was calculated from the measured data and is presented in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ( b ) . \n the interference fringes are minimal at @xmath53 and maximal when @xmath63 , as expected . \n indeed , the polarizer controls the interference between the two oam paths with a visibility proportional to @xmath64 , as predicted by the theory . \n finally , we performed a variation of the quantum eraser by extending the path length of arm a by 2.3 m , with the experimental results presented in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) and ( d ) . \n the same procedures were used to mark the oam paths and to erased the path information . the visibility with respect to the variation of the polarizer angle was calculated and presented in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ( d ) , showing a range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , in good agreement with theory . \n complementarity between path information and fringe visibility is essential to the quantum eraser . by defining the two distinct paths using the oam dof , we have shown that through polarisation - oam hybrid entanglement \n , it is possible to distinguish ( @xmath67 ) and erase ( @xmath68 ) the oam path information of a photon through the polarisation control of its entangled twin . \n our work is consistent with previous studies using entanglement and linear momentum of light @xcite , as well as with angular fringes observed with weak classical light @xcite , both of which used physical paths rather than abstract paths for the path interference . \n our experiment highlights the extent to which information is made available to an observer through a variation of the quantum eraser , where the analysis of the fringe pattern occurs before the decision to mark the paths ( or not ) is made . \n indeed , we distinguished ( @xmath65 ) and erased ( @xmath66 ) the oam path information , showing that causality does not play a role in the outcome path interference , which is a non - classical property of quantum mechanics . furthermore , mutual exclusivity between the visibility and path information was demonstrated by varying the amount of oam path information present in the system . \n significantly , our scheme shows the important role of hybrid entanglement which has been discussed previously as the main aspect of the quantum eraser @xcite . abstracting the path to oam , with all the versatile tools that come with this choice of path , may provide the possibility of finding new approaches for studies in quantum information and communication . \n while we note that in principle any degree of freedom may be used , oam is an attractive choice due to the possibility to explore the impact of dimensionality in such systems , given that it offers an infinitely large hilbert space in which to operate . \n finally , our scheme contrasts previous reports that rely primarily on traditional path - phase interferometric methods , overcoming the sensitivity and complexity of such experiments .    in conclusion \n , we have shown that the oam of a photon may be treated as an abstract path , reminiscent of a slit . \n using oam - polarization hybrid entanglement , we have shown that , just as in the double slit quantum eraser , the oam information of a photon that is marked with orthogonal polarizations can be erased through the polarization control of a bi - photon twin , both in the conventional scheme and in a type arrangement . in both schemes \n the fringe visibility increases with a reduction in the oam path information . \n the authors express their gratitude to lorenzo marrucci for providing q -

{"ContextTokens": 2387, "GeneratedTokens": 252, "SynthesizedBody": "higher x - ray emissivity arcs , termed ripples , are observed in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the perseus cluster ( fabian et al . \n 2003 , 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) , as well as in a2052 ( blanton et al . 2007 ) . \n the ripples are thought to be sound waves that are excited by the inflation of bubbles near the cluster s center . \n some of the ripples are observed on the outer edge of bubbles ; they are compressed icm that will turn into shock waves , and later to sound waves . \n it is possible that some of the other ripples are compressed by weak jets ( soker & pizzolato 2005 ) , rather than being sound waves detached from their parent bubble . beside being interesting by their own merit \n , the sound waves can heat the icm and partially offset the radiative cooling of the icm ( e.g. , brggen et al . 2005 ; fabian et al . 2005 ; fujita & suzuki 2005 ; graham et al . 2008 ) .    to obtain repeated sound waves previous numerical simulations assumed repeating bubble inflation episodes ( e.g. , ruszkowski et al . \n 2004a , b ; sijacki & springel 2006a , b ) . \n this had to be done because these simulations used _ artificial bubbles _ , \n i.e. , numerically injected spherical bubbles at off - center locations , as is commonly done ( e.g. , brggen 2003 ; brggen & kaiser 2001 ; gardini 2007 ; jones & de young 2005 ; pavlovski et al . 2008 ; reynolds et al . 2005 ; robinson et al . 2004 ; ruszkowski et al . \n 2004a , 2004b , 2007 , 2008 ; scannapieco & brggen 2008 ) . \n this of course is not the way bubbles are formed in clusters . \n bubble are formed by jets [ a different approach of injecting magnetic energy instead of a jet ( nakamura et al . \n 2008 ; xu et al . \n 2008 ) requires further study ] . \n when large , almost spherical bubbles ( termed _ fat bubbles _ ) are inflated by jets , some phenomena appear , that are not revealed when artificial bubbles are used ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) . among these \n are : ( 1 ) more stable bubbles , and ( 2 ) bubble - icm boundary that is stochastically vibrates due to the vortices inside the bubble and the back flowing icm .    in previous works we found that in order for the jets to inflate fat bubbles they should have a large opening angle , or they should rapidly precess ( soker 2004 , 2006 ; sternberg et al . 2007 \n ; sternberg & soker 2008a ) . \n in addition , jets that are relatively slow , @xmath2 , and with a mass loss rate of the order of @xmath3 ( for both jets ) , are more likely to inflate fat bubbles . \n the same results can be seen in the simulations of omma et al . \n ( 2004 ) , alouani bibi et al . \n ( 2007 ) and binney et al . \n ( 2007 ) , who use similar parameters to ours , but instead of conical jets with wide opening angles they use cylindrical jets with large initial radius . \n this is also shown by the simulation of heinz et al . \n ( 2006 ) , who manages to inflate a bubble ( although not a bubble attached to the center ) by launching a jet with a velocity of @xmath4 and a mass loss rate of @xmath5 in one jet . in this paper \n we continue our study of jet - inflated bubbles , and show that such bubbles can excite several consecutive sound waves without the need to invoke periodic jet launching episodes . \n we do not deal with the propagation of sound waves and their properties . \n these seem to require more sophisticated treatment ( graham et al . \n we limit ourself to show that a proper treatment of bubble inflation can better explain the excitation of sound waves in the icm . \n the simulations were performed using the _ virginia hydrodynamics - i _ code ( vh-1 ; blondin et al . 1990 ; stevens et al . 1992 ) , as described in sternberg & soker ( 2008b ) . in this paper \n we mention only the important features of the code . \n the unperturbed icm temperature is set to @xmath6 . \n gravity is included , but radiative cooling is not included . \n we study a three - dimensional axisymmetric flow with a 2d grid ( referred to as 2.5d ) . \n we simulate half of the meridional plane using the two - dimensional version of the code in spherical coordinates . \n the symmetry axis of all plots shown in this paper is along the x ( horizontal ) axis . \n we run two cases . in the wide jets case , \n the two opposite jets were injected at a radius of @xmath7 , with constant mass flux of @xmath8 per one jet , and a constant radial velocity of @xmath9 , inside a half opening angle of @xmath10 . \n the total power of the two jets is @xmath11 . \n the jets were active for a period of @xmath12 , from @xmath13 until @xmath14 . \n for more detail on the numerical code and the properties of the bubbles see sternberg & soker ( 2008b ) .    in the case of the precessing jets \n the two opposite jets were injected at a radius of @xmath7 with @xmath8 per one jet , and a constant radial velocity of @xmath9 ( the same parameters of the wide jets ) , but within a half opening angle of @xmath15 . in our axisymmetric code \n the jets are precessing very rapidly around the symmetry axis ( i.e. , in 3d we actually inject a torus ) . \n we vary the angle between the symmetry axis and the jets axis @xmath16 in a random way . \n namely , the jet axis has the same probability to take any direction within an angle of @xmath17 . \n this is done by changing @xmath16 periodically and taking @xmath18 to be constant . \n the precession period , i.e. , the time the jet returns to the same angle @xmath16 , is @xmath19 . \n the jet s interaction with the icm is similar to that of a wide jet with a half opening angle of @xmath20 . \n the jets were active for a duration of @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath14 . \n gravity was included as was in the wide jets case . \n in fig . [ fig : jeti ] we show the density and velocity map of the wide - jet - inflated bubble at @xmath23myr , and at @xmath14 when the jet is shut off . \n there are some flow structures which characterize the jet - inflated bubble that are not present when artificial bubbles are used ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) . \n most relevant for us are the following : ( 1 ) the bubble and the dense shell around it have radial momentum . \n in particular , the shell s front is relatively dense and has an outward velocity . \n this will form the ripple observed at the front edge of the bubbles in perseus . \n ( 2 ) as the bubbles grow their shapes change . \n this relative motion of the bubble - icm boundary excites sound waves . \n ( 3 ) there is a circular flow , a vortex , around the lowest density region in the bubble . \n this vortex and the back flow of the icm along the boundary of the bubble change the shape of the bubble , a processes leading to excitation of sound waves . \n we also note the back flow of the icm around the bubble , and that at early times the bubble expands supersonically , e.g. , an average mach number of @xmath24 between @xmath23myr and @xmath14 , and the shell is a weak shock . at later times the bubble moves subsonically . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ] \n we followed the response of the icm to the inflation of bubbles by jets . \n the inflation of a bubble by a jet results in vortices inside the bubble and a backflow of the icm around the bubble ( sternberg et al . 2007 ; sternberg & soker 2008a , b ) . \n both processes cause the bubble - icm to change shape with time and to become corrugated . in the case of a precessing jet ( section [ sec : precessing ] ) , the changes in the jet axis cause a more prominent change in the bubble - icm shape . \n this motion of the bubble - icm boundary sends shocks and sound waves into the icm . \n this effect can not be reproduced by artificial bubbles , i.e. , by numerically inserting spherical bubbles at off - center locations . \n our main result is that one episode of a bubble pair inflation can excite several sound waves along each radial direction . \n these form high - density arcs , the ripples . \n the front ripple is actually a weak shock . \n there is no need to introduce periodic ( or semi - periodic ) episodes of bubble inflation . \n nonetheless , multiple episodes will make more ripples , and make the ripple structure more complicated . \n this is the case in perseus , where the main central bubble pair was formed by jets that changed their direction and intensity ( dunn et al . \n 2006 ) . \n we also observe a dense arc at the bubble s front that is apparent part of the time . \n the dense arc is the excitation of a new sound wave at the compression phase . \n part of the time the region at the bubble s front is at the rarefaction phase , the wave trough , and no dense arc is observed there . \n our results can be incorporated into a broader scope . in a previous paper ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) we found \n that to follow the evolution of bubbles in the icm one must inflate them by jets , rather than introduce them artificially . \n the evolution of bubbles and their influence on the icm , e.g. , sound waves , is crucial for the deposition of heat from the central active galactic nuclei to the icm . \n our works show that in order to understand the heating of the icm one must properly inflate bubbles . \n we thank john blondin for his immense help with the numerical code . \n this research was supported by the asher fund for space research at the technion , and by the israeli science foundation ( grant no . \n 89/08 ) . \n blanton , e. l. , douglass , e. m. , sarazin , c. l. , clarke , t. e. , & mcnamara , b. r. 2007 , in heating versus cooling in galaxies and clusters of galaxies , eso astrophysics symposia ( springer - verlag , berlin heidelberg ) , 109", "StartTimeOffset": 2553502782462, "RequestID": "6f01ee89852052b350d456527f765097c85f1870", "TotalTokens": 2639}

{"ContextTokens": 3301, "GeneratedTokens": 124, "SynthesizedBody": "the gravitomagnetic clock effect ( synthetically gclock effect ) is in a sense a phenomenon announced since the early days of relativity@xcite . \n it is due to the fact that the proper time measured by a clock is indeed the four dimensional  length  of the world line of the clock between two given events : different allowed four dimensional paths between the same pair of events correspond to different proper time intervals and produce desynchronization of initially synchronous clocks .    when treating rotating systems ( and clocks ) \n an additional feature one finds is that a global splitting between space and time is no more possible : time on a rotating platform becomes polytropic@xcite in the sense that the space hypersurface of a rotating observer is a helicoid and it intercepts the world line of the observer in an infinite number of events : these are all nominally  simultaneous  though corresponding to different proper times of the observer . \n this fact does not really affect the nature and geometric interpretation of the clock effect . \n the revolving  clocks  used to measure proper times may in fact be various types of particles , such as electrons@xcite , neutrons@xcite , cooper pairs@xcite , calcium atoms@xcite , which have been used to test the sagnac effect for quantum objects . \n of course one can use light as a  clock  finding an asymmetry between pro- and retrograde rotation manifested in a phase difference rather than a difference in proper times , now identically null . \n this is the very sagnac effect , known since 1913 or even before and named after g. sagnac@xcite , who interpreted it with an antirelativistic and  etherial \n ( in the sense of the ether theory ) attitude . \n the sagnac effect is nothing else than a specialization of what we are speaking about since the beginning of this section and earned a whole literature for itself during many decades@xcite ; the simplest and most complete description of it is indeed the geometrical one@xcite@xcite . \n an effect with actual clocks , and in particular the synchrony defect due to the time polytropy , has been evidenced for the first time with satellites in 1985@xcite . \n the introduction of nonspinning or spinning masses in the empty space time does not in principle modify the situation , but for computational complications . the latter case ( spinning sources of gravity ) \n is however the one to which the expression \n gravitomagnetic clock effect  has been reserved . \n the name comes from the fact that , in weak field approximation , the gravitational field may be decomposed into a gravitoelectric ( radial ) field and a gravitomagnetic ( solenoidal ) field in analogy with electromagnetism : the gclock effect is determined by the gravitomagnetic component . \n this description and treatment has been particularly emphasized by mashhoon and others@xcite @xcite , but a general treatment is in principle rather simple and can be given before any approximation@xcite . \n the importance of the gclock effect is in the hope that it can be used to test the influence of the angular momentum of the source on the gravitational field . \n in fact the revolution time of a freely orbiting clock on a circular trajectory around a spinning mass is different according to whether the orbit is prograde or retrograde . \n the difference between the two periods expressed as the times needed to recover a fixed azimuth in the inertial frame of a distant observer is@xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a length given by the ratio between the angular momentum of the source @xmath2 and its mass @xmath3 multiplied by @xmath4 : @xmath5 . \n the result ( [ assoluto ] ) is true for any axisymmetric metric with an @xmath1 value independent from time@xcite . \n the independence of ( [ assoluto ] ) from the radius of the orbit is a remarkable feature ; furthermore the numerical value of @xmath6 for the earth is rather promising being in the order of @xmath7 s.    when adopting the viewpoint of an observer in the vicinity of the central mass the situation worsens ; then one should use proper times of the clocks and refer for instance to specific events , such as the conjunctions of counterorbiting objects . in that case the time difference on the clocks around the earth , @xmath8 , is in the order of @xmath9 s @xcite@xcite . \n besides the actual numbers that should be measured ( which , at least in the case of @xmath6 , are indeed big ) , a real experiment around the earth encounters a series of difficulties not easy to be surmounted@xcite @xcite , one of them is the stability and coincidence between opposite orbits . considering this specific problem \n electromagnetic waves come again on stage as probes more interesting than actual clocks . \n in fact a single ring of orbiting mirrors could be used to reflect at the same instant both prograde and retrograde  light \n beams in a sort of sagnac experiment in space . the influence of gravity on the issue of such an experiment can be worked out as a general relativistic correction of the classical effect@xcite , but the problem can be better solved in principle and in general using the method outlined in ref . \n this is precisely the aim of this paper ; in sect . ii the essence of the method is recalled ; in sect . \n iii the specific case of the sagnac effect is treated ; sect . \n iv contains the approximated results valid for the earth environment ; finally in sect . \n v some conclusions will be drawn . \n the method proposed is based on the fact that in any axially symmetric and stationary space time any constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 world line is drawn on the surface of a cylinder which is indeed flat , no matter what the global curvature is : on that surface simple minkowskian geometry works . in particular when the coordinate angular velocity @xmath12 is fixed the world line on the cylinder s surface is a helix , which becomes a straight line in the development of the cylinder in a plane . \n the situation is most simply described graphically : see fig . \n 1 , which shows the opened cylindrical world tube . \n the world lines of steadily rotating objects are helices which in turn become straight lines when opening the cylinder on a plane . when a line reaches the boundary of the cut at @xmath13 or @xmath14 it bounces back or forth by @xmath15 continuing on the other side . \n considering a pair of objects revolving in opposite directions with the same coordinate speed , their world lines are symmetric with respect to a static observer at the origin ( vertical straight line there ) and cross each other again at the same event for such observer : the revolution times both in the objects proper times and in the observer s time are exactly the same for both . \n if however the observer is in turn steadily rotating his world line is an oblique straight line and the intersecting events with the world lines of the objects do not coincide any more : the revolution times measured by the observer differ from each other and so do the proper times of the two objects . \n the interval between _ a _ and _  b , _ in fig . 1 _ , \n _ is then proportional to the proper time lapse ( for the observer ) between the completions of one revolution started simultaneously by the two probes . \n this description is valid for light beams too : in this case the @xmath16 interval is an actual measure of the sagnac effect . \n when the central body possesses an angular momentum , the equivalent in its vicinity of the static inertial observers of the previous case are the so called locally non rotating observers ( lnro)@xcite , i. e. the observers to whom radially infalling matter appears locally as non rotating . \n the lnro s themselves are indeed rotating as seen by a distant inertial observer ; their coordinate angular speed is : @xmath17 ( the @xmath18 s are elements of the metric and the use of polar coordinates is understood ) . in practice \n the considerations about the flatness of the cylindrical surface containing the world lines of constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 remain unchanged , but now the world lines of co - rotating and counter - rotating light rays have a different inclination to cope with the role of an lnro and his skew world line ; in other words after leaving the lnro at @xmath19 the two beams must cross each other again on the ( oblique ) world line of the lnro , in order it to be equivalent to the static observer of rotation free space times . \n graphically the situation is the one shown in fig . \n the entity of the sagnac effect is measured by the interval between @xmath20 and @xmath21 which is clearly different from the one between @xmath22 and @xmath23 in fig . 1 , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath1 which is hidden in the @xmath24 element of the metric tensor . \n what is visually determined by the simple graphic treatment of the previous section can be put in analytical form by the use of minkowskian geometry in two dimensions . \n let us restrict our study to light rays and the sagnac effect in axisymmetric metrics . \n events @xmath22 and @xmath23 in fig . 1 ( @xmath25 and @xmath21 in fig . \n 2 ) are localized as the intersections of two straight lines : the world line of the observer and the world line of a light beam . when an angular momentum is absent \n the former s equation is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the observer s angular coordinate speed . \n the equation of the world line of a light ray constrained to move along a circular trajectory is in turn @xmath28 for the counter - rotating beam and @xmath29 for the co - rotating one ; the equations reproduce the lines respectively ascending to the left through @xmath1 and ascending to the right through @xmath30 in fig . \n 1 . the coordinate angular speed of light for a circular path in a plane orthogonal to the symmetry axis ( let us say it is the equatorial plane of the system ) \n is @xmath31 ; this comes from a null interval at constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. from @xmath32 , posing @xmath33 . \n the intersections between the straight world lines of the observer and the beams identify points @xmath22 ( counter - rotating beam ) and @xmath23 ( corotating beam ) with their @xmath34 and @xmath35 coordinates : @xmath36 the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) sign corresponds to event @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . the proper time corresponding to the interval @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) in fig . \n 1 is in practice the length ( divided by @xmath4 ) of the hypotenuse of a right - angled triangle in a two dimensional flat minkowski space time , whose other sides are @xmath41 and @xmath42 . \n the explicit result is : @xmath43 and the sagnac delay turns out to be @xmath44 the @xmath45 term has been eliminated thanks to the explicit expression of @xmath46 . \n when @xmath47 the coordinate angular speed of light on a circular path is obtained from @xmath48 . \n there are two solutions : @xmath49 ( @xmath37 is for prograde motion , @xmath38 is for retrograde motion ) . \n now the intersection method leads to : @xmath50    the proper observer s intervals of time are obtained as before , but for the fact that now we have to use the equivalent of carnot s theorem of euclidean geometry rather than the equivalent of pythagora s : @xmath51    finally the sagnac delay is : @xmath52 the parameter @xmath53 has been eliminated using the explicit expression for the coordinate angular speed of an lnro . \n if now we pose @xmath54 , we consistently verify that it is : @xmath55 a truly inertial observer ( @xmath56 ) would find : @xmath57    formula ( [ deltatau ] ) treats @xmath27 and @xmath10 as independent parameters ; the situation changes when the observer is freely orbiting . for a circular geodesic trajectory in the equatorial plane \n there are two solutions for @xmath27 @xcite ( again @xmath37 is pro- and @xmath38 is retrograde motion of the observer ) : @xmath58 commas denote ordinary partial differentiation .. correspondingly ( [ deltatau ] ) becomes : @xmath59 \n considering the situation in the surroundings of our planet the appropriate metric is the one corresponding to a weak axisymmetric field . \n actually this means that : @xmath60    consequently it is : @xmath61    now using ( [ deltatau ] ) we obtain :    @xmath62    for not too high observer s velocities and radii of the order of the size of the earth ( [ detauearth ] ) becomes : @xmath63    one easily recognizes , in the order , the traditional sagnac term , then a purely special relativistic correction , a \n correction and finally an angular momentum correction which is independent from the velocity of the observer . \n when the observer is freely orbiting on a circular trajectory the starting point is formula ( [ completo ] ) ; developing and keeping only the lowest order terms up to the one containing the angular momentum , the result is @xmath64 now summing the time differences for the two rotation directions we obtain @xmath65    the order of magnitude of this quantity is @xmath9 s. \n we have given a general geometric treatment of the problem of the phase shift of electromagnetic waves moving in a closed circular path about a massive spinning body . \n applying the general methodology to the terrestrial environment reproduces approximate results obtainable by various alternative techniques . in terms of time differences accumulated during round trips around the earth \n the numbers remain extremely small and partly smaller than some values typical of the gclock effect . \n the idea of using electromagnetic waves in some orbital sagnac type experiment deserves however some attention because of a few advantages light has .    to begin with , \n if a chain of orbiting mirrors or transponders are considered it is possible to use them simultaneously for prograde and retrograde rays , thus ensuring the coincidence of the two trajectories and the significance of the time of flight difference . \n next we can notice that , even for an  experimental apparatus  as big as the orbit of a satellite , the time of flight of light for a round trip is @xmath66 @xmath67 s. in that time the observer on a spacecraft could move for a few hundred meters at most and an observer on the surface of the earth would move much less than that ; this fact in principle allows for experiments at different values of the equivalent angular velocity @xmath27 , to be maintained for a few seconds at most . \n in fact in the time delay ( [ approssi ] ) three terms depend on @xmath68 and one is independent from it : in principle determining the values for positive or negative @xmath27 close to zero could allow for the detection of the invariant @xmath1 term . \n the scheme one can imagine is an observer on the earth moving westward at variable linear speeds of the order of @xmath69 m / s and sending and receiving signals to and from a ring of orbiting mirrors . \n finally , varying the wavelength of the waves could in principle allow to tune the phase difference originated by the @xmath1 term , making it correspond to a predefined number or fraction of interference fringes and evidencing its presence with respect to the special relativistic or purely gravitational shifts .", "StartTimeOffset": 2588313657720, "RequestID": "353f1242370be2075bb8650b5d31bfbebac5a22b", "TotalTokens": 3425}

only two 15sources lie at the location of pairs of suspected high - z galaxies . \n our counts are not significantly affected by confusion . \n the occasional blending of the sources has not been taken into account , but the surface area occupied by bright sources is subtracted for the computation of the surface density of the fainter ones ( ie . other faint sources could be hidden by brighter ones ) . \n we used the completeness of the detection at 15given in \n this correction is negligible to the 7counts and was not applied .    due to the non - uniform sensitivity of our maps ( because of observation strategy ) and the lensing effect , \n the object density per flux bin was computed using gain - dependant surface areas , and only the central 2@xmath62 area was taken into account for the faintest fluxes . \n a detailed lensing model of a2390 has been produced by kneib et al . , ( 1998 ) . \n the lensing acts in two ways on the background population of galaxies : + _ i ) _ an amplification of the source brightness , typically by a factor of 2 , but up to 10 near the caustic lines . \n + _ ii ) _ a surface dilation effect of the area probed , which itself depends on the redshift ; the space dilation is stronger towards the centre ( core of the cluster ) and increases with source - plane redshift .    to estimate these factors we used : the spectroscopic redshift for 7 objects ( pell et al . , 1991 , bzecourt & soucail 1997 ) , and \n for the rest we use the best redshift estimate obtained with photometric redshift techniques ( pell , private communication ) , and/or lensing inversion techniques ( kneib et al . , 1998 ) . by analysing the case with all background galaxies at a mean redshift @xmath21 \n , we checked the dependence of the results on redshift uncertainties . \n the source counts , corrected for cluster contamination and lensing effects , in both the lw2 and lw3 bands , are presented in figs . 3 and 4 . \n we have used only 5@xmath11 sources ( i.e. @xmath2060 @xmath0jy before lensing amplification correction ) . according to hogg & turner ( 1998 ) , \n this is sufficient to avoid the positive flux - estimate eddington bias which occurs for faint source counts .    at 7 , \n we find that the source density is greater than that of taniguchi et al . , ( 1997 ) by a factor of 2 . \n we suggest that their observations are incomplete below 50@xmath0jy , whereas our 7map is 80% complete down to 30@xmath0jy .    at 15the number counts \n are compatible with the results of aussel et al . \n ( 1998 ) in the hdf . \n however , with the help of gravitational lensing we are able to extend the counts in both bands down to 30@xmath0jy . putting all background sources at @xmath22 \n only slightly decreases the faintest counts , at the faintest end , because a few suspectedly high - z faint sources would be less amplified . \n this shows the small dependency of our derived counts on the models . \n the very small positive magnification bias in the lensing - uncorrected counts is consistent with the measured slope of the source counts , while the general shift of the points towards higher flux follows from the loss of the lensing gain . \n the 15 @xmath0 m counts show a steadily increasing excess ( by more than a factor of 10 ) with respect to the prediction of a no - evolution model ( dotted line , franceschini et al . , \n this confirms the steeper count slope below 1  mjy found on the lockman hole ( elbaz et al . , 1998 ) and is in good agreement with the iso hdf counts ( aussel et al . , 1998 ) . \n the counts are a factor 2 - 3 higher than the boundaries of the counts coming from an early analysis of the background fluctuations in the isocam 15map of the hdf ( oliver et al . , 1997 ) . \n in particular , we do not seem to detect any sign of flattening of the counts at the faintest levels , as expected from evolutionary models ( franceschini et al . \n , 1997 , oliver et al . , 1997 ) . \n the slope stays close to -1.5@xmath29 down to 30 @xmath0jy . \n this source density at faint levels favours extreme evolution models , needed to fit the counts at brighter fluxes , as shown by elbaz et al . \n ( 1998 ) .    integrating the number counts over the whole flux range and extrapolating the counts we find that respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 wm@xmath4sr@xmath8 is emitted at 15and 7 . \n this implies that a larger fraction of the uv / optical background is re - radiated in the mir than in the local universe . \n the absolute astrometry of mir sources is difficult in deep surveys because of the lack of any obvious optical - nir counterparts . in the a2390 field , \n unambiguous cross - identification of more than 90% of the sources was possible thanks to a large density of sources and a good sampling of the psf . \n a number of these sources are well correlated with faint galaxies in the visible , some of them having very red colors in the nir . \n 15isocam deep imaging is a good way to select star - forming galaxies and dusty agns which are not easy to identify in uv / optical surveys . \n a more detailed analysis of the sed of these mir detected galaxies will be necessary to determine the nature of these sources and give an estimate of their sfr . \n our observations confirm that abundant star formation activity occurs in very dusty environments at @xmath32 . \n great caution must therefore be taken to infer global star formation activity based only on uv - continuum or optical luminosities of high - z galaxies . \n the global star formation history can be traced fully only if the effect of dust is taken into account in a consistent way . \n ( _ e.g. _ blain et al . , 1998 ) . \n further , detailed analysis of our selected sample is needed to unveil the nature of these mir galaxies .", "StartTimeOffset": 2604603098100, "RequestID": "6f3e23a3f0c5af9125f26f73b46bf29fcef948e3", "TotalTokens": 3555}

{"ContextTokens": 3413, "GeneratedTokens": 78, "SynthesizedBody": "charles darwin explained the evolution of living organisms on the basis of the observation that only the species best adapted to their surroundings survive in a competitive environment . \n this idea , paraphrased as `` survival of the fittest '' , has since become the cornerstone of evolutionary theories . \n the idea has been refined over the years , and we now understand its genetic underpinnings . \n hereditary transmission of genetic information is not perfect , and occasional errors in dna replication produce mutations of living organisms . \n the mutated organism is in essentially the same environment as the original one , and both have to compete for the available resources . \n the resources are limited , and so the organism that can use them more efficiently obtains an edge over its competitors . \n the net result is that if the mutation improves the ability of the organism to survive , the mutated organism grows in number , otherwise it fades away . in this mechanism , \n the mutations are not conscious adaptations . \n they occur randomly  as a matter of fact most of them fail  but once in a while they modify the organism in the right manner and improve the chances of its survival . if the intermediate steps are glossed over , the outcome looks like a solution to the optimisation problem , with the organisms adapting to the selection pressures exerted by the environment . \n all this is fairly logical , and can be illustrated by many examples ( see for instance @xcite ) . \n my aim here is to quantify this mechanism using a simple evolutionary model . \n more specifically , i consider the situation where a number of species are dependent on a common physical resource , say food . \n ( this leaves out predator - prey conflicts where one species may become another s resource . ) \n when the resource is available in plenty , there is hardly any competition , and all species prosper . \n the rate of growth of a species is then proportional to its population , and so all populations grow exponentially . \n this typically happens in the early stage of evolution of a new species . \n no resource is unlimited , however , even if it is continuously regenerated ( e.g. food availability ultimately depends on sunlight ) . \n a time comes when competition for the resource is inevitable . in the later stage of evolution , therefore , one species can prosper only at the expense of another , and eventually populations stabilise .    such a situation can be described by a set of linear evolution equations . \n ( quad - ratic evolution equations are more appropriate in a predator - prey setting . ) \n let the index @xmath0 label a set of coexisting species in a given environment , and let @xmath1 denote their populations at time @xmath2 . \n then the discrete time evolution of the populations can be written as a matrix equation ( generically @xmath3 is not symmetric ) , @xmath4 the fact that the next generation populations must arise from the present generation ones , even in case of mutations , makes this equation homogeneous . \n the diagonal terms @xmath5 represent the individual rates of growth , while the off - diagonal terms @xmath6 represent interactions between species . as mentioned above , \n when the resource is available in plenty , the populations evolve according to : @xmath7 the interesting situation is the competitive stage , where the populations become interdependent due to mutual interactions and the nature of the interactions ( para - metrised by @xmath6 ) determines how they evolve . \n to analyse the competitive stage , let us choose normalisations such that a unit population of any species consumes the same amount of resource , and the total resource available at any time is one . \n then we have the conservation laws : @xmath8 the constraint on @xmath9 arises because the total population supported by a fixed resource is fixed . when applied to both sides of eq.(1 ) , it yields the constraint on @xmath10 as a consistency condition . \n the continuity of evolution in time implies that @xmath11 the matrix @xmath12 , describing the change in populations , clearly shows that what is gained by some species is lost by some others . \n obviously @xmath6 can take positive as well as negative values . as a matter of fact , \n situations of both positive and negative interactions occur routinely in biological systems ( e.g. catalysis and inhibition , symbiosis and parasitic behaviour , defence mechanisms and cancer , etc . ) . \n situations of this type , where there is no net gain or loss , have been formally called zero sum games . in the conventional form of zero sum games , a multitude of strategies \n are available to the players , and competition amongst the players leads them to choose a stable strategy . \n this stable strategy turns out to be a `` mini - max solution '' , i.e. each player chooses the strategy that maximises his minimum gain @xcite . \n no player can improve his performance by unilaterally departing from this stable strategy , and the explicit solution can be obtained by linear programming methods . \n the model described by eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) is somewhat different . \n first , in the evolutionary context , the strategies are not actively chosen but are created by random mutations . also competition for the resource \n is guaranteed , because mutations produce closely related species in the same environment . \n it is then of importance to study the dynamics of the system to understand how the incorrect strategies are eliminated and the correct ones are selected . \n that requires not just the evaluation of the stable solution but also the manner in which it is approached . \n second , the quantitative gains and losses of various species depend not only on the choice of strategy but also on their current populations . in a sense \n , the more populous species gets more chances to grab the resources , and that alters the final outcome of the competition . \n let us first look at the simpler situation when @xmath13 . \n eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) then describe stochastic evolution of probability distributions , which has been extensively studied ( see for instance @xcite ) . the linear evolution is a markov chain , which in the generic case is ergodic and converges to a unique stationary distribution . \n ( if the matrix @xmath3 has a block - diagonal structure , then each block can be studied independently . ) to see this , consider the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath14 as @xmath15 . at every iteration \n , @xmath16 is the weighted average of @xmath17 @xmath18 with weights @xmath19 . \n the process of repeated averaging converges to the fixed point , @xmath20 with all rows identical , @xmath21 has only one non - vanishing eigenvalue , equal to one . \n it follows that @xmath3 has the leading eigenvalue @xmath22 corresponding to the stationary distribution , and remaining eigenvalues @xmath23 corresponding to transient distributions . \n the left and right eigenvectors for the leading eigenvalue are , @xmath24 the left and right eigenvectors satisfy the orthogonality relation , @xmath25 for @xmath26 . \n all transient distributions are orthogonal to @xmath27 and necessarily contain negative components . \n the next - to - leading eigenvalue @xmath28 provides the rate of convergence towards the stationary distribution , and can be obtained my maximising @xmath29 , with the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 orthogonal to @xmath32 and @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath33 . \n the convergence is monotonic because @xmath34 , @xmath35 . \n all these properties belong to altruistic evolution , since @xmath36 while @xmath37 . in the competitive case \n , some of the @xmath38 , and the consequences need to be analysed . \n the presence of both positive and negative contributions produces cancellations . \n monotonic convergence is no longer automatic ; oscillations and instabilities may occur in stead . \n an important restriction is imposed by the physical requirement that no population can become negative . \n ( note that there is no such requirement on the components of the individual eigenvectors of @xmath3 . ) \n the evolution must be modified whenever it drives some @xmath9 negative . \n the correct procedure is to stop the evolution at the instance @xmath9 becomes zero , eliminate @xmath39 row and column from the matrix @xmath3 , and then continue evolution in the reduced dimensional space . \n obviously , @xmath9 can be driven negative only if some @xmath6 is negative . \n the reduction of dimensionality , therefore , decreases the number of negative @xmath10 and increases the stability of the system . \n the inverse process , increasing dimensionality of the space , occurs when chance mutation creates a new species . \n it is known that even with @xmath13 , eq.(1 ) can not be evolved backward in time _ \n indefinitely_. this is true in spite of the fact that generic stochastic matrices are positive definite and @xmath40 exists . \n if backward evolution is attempted , some @xmath9 is driven negative at some stage , and beyond that point interpretation of @xmath9 as populations ( or probabilities ) is lost . \n evolution further back in time is possible only by modifying @xmath3 . \n this is easy to see because eigenvalues of @xmath40 are the reciprocals of those for @xmath3 , and with @xmath41 , the growing transient distributions drive some @xmath9 out of their physically allowed range @xmath42 $ ] . \n it is useful to compare this evolution problem to quantum algorithms . \n both are constrained by conservation laws . \n while eq.(3 ) preserves the linear norm of the vector , quantum evolution preserves the quadratic norm . \n the most general evolution preserving the quadratic norm is described by orthogonal transformations for real variables , and by unitary transformations for complex variables . \n orthogonal transformations are generated by antisymmetric matrices ( generating matrices parametrise infinitesimal group transformations in the neighbourhood of identity ) , and they inevitably contain negative matrix elements  the negative elements are an automatic consequence of the underlying conservation laws . \n ( only orthogonal transformations without any negative matrix elements are simple permutation matrices . ) \n although complete understanding of quantum evolution requires use of complex numbers , classical language extended to include negative probabilities can explain unusual features of certain simple systems ( e.g. quantum correlations of two spins violating bell s inequalities ) @xcite . \n recent developments in algorithms for quantum computation ( see for instance @xcite ) offer a hint of how evolution may change in presence of negative matrix elements . \n classical algorithms based on boolean logic can be expressed in terms of permutation matrices . \n quantum algorithms exploit two features to beat them , superposition of states ( which is a generic property of waves ) and quantum entanglement ( which is not relevant here ) . \n superposition means letting multiple states be in the same place at the same time , and it can reduce the spatial degrees of freedom required for the algorithm exponentially . cleverly designed destructive interference amongst superposed states can reduce the the time required to execute the algorithm by eliminating unwanted states . \n coexistence of species in biological evolution is not quite the same as superposition ; it allows simultaneous evolution of all species but without reducing the spatial degrees of freedom . but destructive interference is still an option available to reduce the evolution time . \n the known quantum algorithms reduce the execution time compared to their classical counterparts , at least by a constant factor if not polynomially or exponentially . \n it is important to note that biological evolution occurs over long time scales , and even a tiny change in the rate of growth  fraction of a percent  matters because that can translate into exponential changes in populations over a long time . \n the lessons learnt from quantum computation thus suggest that negative values of @xmath10 may create destructive interference and help the species reach their asymptotic populations faster , i.e. competition should beat altruism in picking a winner amongst the contenders . \n let us now explicitly analyse how evolution changes , when the range of @xmath6 is extended to include negative values . \n clearly , extending the range of @xmath10 can not make the evolutionary process any less powerful . \n the stationary eigenvalue of @xmath3 , @xmath43 , which follows just from the averaging properties as described above , remains unaffected . \n but other eigenvalues and eigenvectors change , and modify evolution . \n an example with two interacting species illustrates the possibilities . in this case , the solution of eq.(1 ) in terms of the ( unnormalised ) right eigenvectors of the evolution matrix is : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 are small , @xmath47 . \n the evolutionary behaviour depends on their signs : + ( a ) @xmath48 : the asymptotic population is proportional to @xmath32 . @xmath49 and \n the transient part proportional to @xmath50 fades away . \n the two species coexist , and their population ratio is stable against small perturbations . such a behaviour does not occur in quantum algorithms . \n + ( b ) @xmath51 : both @xmath32 and @xmath50 contain negative components , and so the non - negative population vector has to be a mixture of the two . \n in course of evolution , the population @xmath9 with @xmath38 is monotonically driven to zero . \n thereafter evolution has to continue in the reduced dimensional space . \n + ( c ) @xmath52 : the eigenvalue @xmath53 , and dominance of @xmath50 drives one of the @xmath9 to zero . the relative size of initial populations ( i.e. comparison of @xmath54 vs. @xmath55 ) determines which @xmath9 is driven to zero . \n afterwards evolution has to continue in the reduced dimensional space . \n such a dependence on the initial populations is quite distinct from the `` mini - max analysis '' . \n these results for two interacting species have a topological interpretation . \n the three regimes can be looked upon as minimisation of a function over an interval , when it ( a ) has a single minimum , ( b ) is monotonic , and ( c ) has a single maximum . \n the relation between linear evolution and gradient of a quadratic form is generic , and the features exhibited in the above example can be expected to generalise to more complicated multi - species systems . specifically , whenever some @xmath38 : + ( 1 ) the non - stationary eigenvectors play an important part in evolution . \n + ( 2 ) having any @xmath38 makes the stationary eigenvector unstable , and drives the system towards reduced dimensionality . \n + ( 3 ) evolution one by one eliminates species @xmath9 with some @xmath56 , till the reduced dimensional system no longer has any @xmath56 . \n + ( 4 ) the elimination of species takes place in finite time , which depends on initial populations and @xmath10 , but is roughly @xmath57 . \n this is in contrast to exponentially decaying tails of transient parts in an altruistic evolution . \n + ( 5 ) the surviving population is given not by the stationary eigenvector of the original system , but by the stationary eigenvector of the reduced dimensional system . \n the simple model presented above provides a quantification of features anticipated in darwinian evolution . \n the crucial ingredient has been the limited availability of a resource leading to destructive interference . \n chance mutation may introduce a species that snatches away the resource from another one . \n this always produces an instability , which eliminates the weaker species in a finite time . \n the stronger survivors are stable until the next mutation instability . \n it is worthwhile to observe that the elementary components of biological systems are so simple and cheap that they can be produced in large numbers even with limited resources . as a result , \n biological systems often exhibit wastefulness , e.g. millions of eggs and pollen grains are produced when a few would have sufficed to propagate the species in a secure environment . \n such an overkill actually strengthens the competition and enforces survival of the fittest .    to summarise , \n the analysis presented in this article is straightforward , and points out certain similarities between competitive evolution , zero - sum games and quantum computation . \n the latter two possess a sound mathematical framework , and so even a simple analogy with them can help us understand better the behaviour of highly complex biological systems . \n the analogies are not perfect , however , and the effect of the differences has to be incorporated properly in the results . \n my conclusion is that limited availability of resources leads to competition , which eliminates the weaker species in a finite time . \n the arguments presented here can also be applied to other competitive situations , e.g. economic and social interactions .", "StartTimeOffset": 2631870427752, "RequestID": "9fdcb7889a7a4c3282faff0f9a6d73efeb0fe021", "TotalTokens": 3491}
{"ContextTokens": 3596, "GeneratedTokens": 176, "SynthesizedBody": "energy loss of a high @xmath0 hard parton travelling through low @xmath0 soft matter has long been recognized as a promising tool to study the initial high - density phases of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic ) @xcite . however , if one considers the whole dynamical system created in the collision of two relativistic nuclei and not only the partons emerging from a particular hard scattering vertex , energy is not lost but rather redistributed into the medium . \n measurements of angular correlations of hadrons associated with a given hard trigger allow , as a function of associate hadron momentum , to study how and at what scales this redistribution of energy and momentum takes place . \n such measurements for semi - hard hadrons with 1 gev @xmath1 2.5 gev associated with a trigger 2.5 gev @xmath2 4.0 gev have shown a surprising splitting of the away side peak for all centralities but peripheral collisions , qualitatively very different from a broadened away side peak observed in p - p or d - au collisions @xcite . on the other hand , for a high @xmath0 trigger and associate hadron back to back jet peaks with vacuum width \n albeit reduced strength have been observed @xcite .    as most promising explanation for these findings , \n the assumption that mach shockwaves are excited by the energy lost from the hard parton to the medium has been brought forward @xcite . while we focus on colorless sound here @xcite , we point out that also colored collective modes could contributed in a deconfined phase by a supersonically traveling jet , if the plasma s collective longitudinal mode exhibit a space - like dispersion relation @xcite . for a short overview of those as well as alternative mechanisms , see @xcite and references therein .    in the following , \n we investigate under what conditions signals from such shockwaves remain observable in the dynamical environment of a heavy - ion collision , provided that a realistic description of the evolving medium and the experimental trigger conditions are taken into account , and what properties of the medium are reflected in different momentum regimes . here , we summarize and expand on @xcite and @xcite . \n we perform a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of hard back to back processes in a medium in order to calculate the induced hard hadronic correlation pattern . \n the model is described in detail in @xcite . \n there are four main elements : 1 ) the primary hard pqcd process 2 ) the description of the soft medium and 3 ) the energy loss from hard to soft degrees of freedom and 4 ) the simulation of shockwave propagation and its modification of soft medium decoupling .    for the soft medium we use the parametrized evolution model defined in @xcite which gives a good description of bulk matter transverse momentum spectra and hbt correlation radii . \n the energy loss for a given parton path inside this medium is described in a probabilistic language . in order to determine the probability @xmath3 for a hard parton with energy @xmath4 to lose the energy @xmath5 while traversing the medium on its trajectory , we make use of a scaling law @xcite which allows to relate the dynamical scenario to a static equivalent one for each trajectory @xmath6 by calculating    @xmath7    as a function of the jet production vertex @xmath8 and its angular orientation @xmath9 . \n we set @xmath10 whenever the decoupling temperature of the medium @xmath11 is reached . using the numerical results of @xcite \n , we obtain @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 as a function of jet production vertex and the angle @xmath9 . \n we generate hard pqcd back to back events inside the evolving bulk matter model , using eq . \n ( [ e - omega ] ) to determine @xmath12 for each parton , followed by leading and next to leading fragmentation once the parton emerges from the medium . \n the simulation describes the yield of hard back to back correlations well @xcite . \n selecting events leading to a trigger determines the distribution of vertices and parton energies which we use as a starting point to simulate the away side shockwave . \n first , we determine the direction of the away side parton in the transverse plane and rapidity . in order to take into account intrinsic @xmath15 \n , we calculate a random @xmath15 kick by sampling a gaussian distribution with @xmath16 width . \n we have verified that this distribution , folded with the width of the near side peak reproduces the width of the away side peak in the case of d - au and 60 - 90% peripheral au - au collisions .    since we are not interested in folding the result with a steeply falling spectrum but rather into the energy deposited on average in a given volume element we focus on the average energy loss of the away side parton @xmath17 in the following . \n we assume that a fraction @xmath18 of the energy and momentum lost to the medium excites a shockwave characterized by a dispersion relation @xmath19 while a fraction @xmath20 in essence heats the medium and induces collective drift along the jet axis conserving longitudinal momentum . \n we calculate the speed of sound @xmath21 locally from a quasiparticle description of the equation of state as measured on the lattice as @xmath22 . \n the dispersion relation along with the energy and momentum deposition determines the initial angle of propagation of the shock front with the jet axis ( the mach angle ) as @xmath23 . \n we discretize the time into small intervals @xmath24 , calculate the energy deposited in that time as @xmath25 . \n we then propagate the part of the shockfront remaining in the midrapidity slice ( i.e. in the detector acceptance ) . \n each piece of the front is propagated with the local speed of sound and the angle of propagation is constantly corrected as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is determined by the propagation path . \n once an element of the wavefront reaches the freeze - out condition @xmath11 , a hydrodynamical mode can not propagate further . \n we assume at this point that the energy contained in the shockwave is not used to produce hadrons but rather is converted into kinetic energy . in the local restframe , we then have a matching condition for the dispersion relations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of a volume element at freeze - out temperature . \n once we have calculated the additional boost @xmath30 a volume element receives from the shockwave using the matching conditions , we employ the cooper - frye formula @xmath31\\ ] ] to convert the fluid element into a hadronic distribution . \n the resulting momentum spectrum is thus a thermal two component spectrum resulting from an integration involving volume not part of the shockwave and volume receiving an additional boost from the shockwave . \n the fact that the medium in which shockwaves propagate is nt static has considerable impact on the resulting shape of the medium recoil . \n since the wavefront propagates with @xmath21 relative to the flowing medium , its maximal longitudinal extension has to be determined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the longitudinal flow velocity . \n the effect of this is illustrated in fig . \n [ f-1 ] , left panel . if , for a trigger at midrapidity , the away side parton would always be found at midrapidity and the shockfront would not be modified by longitudinal flow , a peak at a relatively large angle would be observed . \n however , averaging over the pqcd probability @xmath34 to find the away side parton at the ( unobserved ) rapidity @xmath35 shifts the peak inward as one gets contributions from events where the away side parton is outside the acceptance . in those only a slice of the cone \n falls into the acceptance in which the opening angle does nt appear maximal . \n however , an elongation of the cone in longitudinal direction is induced by longitudinal flow which lessens this effect . \n we include longitudinal flow using eq . \n ( [ e - lflow ] ) and determine the corresponding rapidity boost from the fireball evolution model@xcite . \n one can also turn this argument around : scenarios which do not predict a substantial elongation as it emerges in the mach cone framework are strongly disfavored by the data since the correlation signal is easily washed out via rapidity averaging over @xmath34 @xcite . \n another manifestation of flow is visible in fig . \n [ f-1 ] , right panel . \n we point out that this 2-particle correlation signal is the one corresponding to our recent mc simulation of 3-particle correlations ( see below ) . in this specific calculation \n we suppressed a full rapidity averaging , leading to a somewhat larger angle than expected if averaging were performed . \n we show two different longitudinal expansion patterns ( bjorken and non - bjorken evolution ) and two different transverse densities ( box and nuclear profile @xmath36 ) . due to the position of the freeze - out hypersurface at large radii for the box density , the shockwave gets on average longer exposure to transverse flow in this scenario . \n we find the following pattern : the observed angle is consistently larger for longitudinal bjorken expansion . \n this is due to the fact that in this scenario initial cooling is rapid and therefore the average temperature quickly approaches the phase transition temperature @xmath37 where @xmath21 is small ( and hence the mach angle large , cf . \n ( [ e - c_s ] ) ) . \n furthermore , the peak is consistently less pronounced for box density scenarios where there is longer exposure to transverse flow . \n as argued in @xcite , transverse flow can erase a peak for associate momenta above 1 gev if the direction of flow and shockwave propagation are not aligned . \n this has important consequences for 3-particle correlations which are sensitive to the question if only one wing or both wings of the shockwave are seen for each event . \n we calculate 3-particle correlations as factorized two particle correlations , i.e. we calculate a 2-particle correlation as outlined above , subtract the background ( which is obtained by evaluating eq . \n ( [ e - cf ] ) without @xmath30 ) and assume that a second hadron in the same event has the same probability distribution of being found at a given angle with the trigger independent of the position of the first hadron . \n this assumption ignores the possibility of genuine 3-particle correlations . \n however , the only such genuine 3-particle effect which is expected is due to conservation of momentum @xmath38 and @xmath39 which is shared across @xmath40 hadrons @xcite and hence their influence on the signal is very small . \n we then average the generated 3-particle correlation over several hundred events , as large event by event fluctuations in the correlation signal occur due to the probabilistic nature of the collisions ( modeled in our mc approach ) . \n we show the resulting 3-particle correlations for two different density distributions ( not including the region around the trigger ) in fig . \n [ f-3pc ] . \n the result fits nicely into the earlier observation that transverse flow tends to erase one ( or even both wings of the shock cone ) . in this case , only the diagonal region is populated , whereas if both wings of the shock cone projection into the transverse plane survive in an average event , off - diagonal elements appear . \n thus , we can understand that the box density where flow has greater effect shows less strength in the off - diagonal peaks , as in typical events only one wing of the shock cone is observed . \n as a side remark , we note that there is no scenario involving flow in which the strength of off - diagonal peaks equals the strength of the peaks on the diagonal . \n the correlation pattern found in the case of the nuclear profile @xmath36 density resembles very much the pattern measured by star @xcite . \n in addition to the rich correlation structure on the away side , there has also been an observation of a long - range @xmath41 correlation on the near side , the so - called ridge @xcite . \n theoretical explanations suggested for this calculation include e.g. longitudinal broadening of jet cones by turbulent color fields @xcite . \n so far , the ridge correlation has only been observed on the near side whereas the mach cone like correlation has been seen only on the away side . \n while it is clear that a ridge - like correlation can not be observed on the away side due to the unknown rapidity of the away side parton , the intriguing question remains why a cone should not be seen on the near side . \n while in the simulation about 75% of all partons leading to a triggered hadron do not experience energy loss @xcite , there is energy transfer into the medium from the rest which should give rise to a shockwave if the above scenario is correct . \n however , the timescales for development of a cone are rather different on near and away side , as the bulk of trigger partons originates from @xmath42 fm depth from the surface ( thus the average away side parton has a pathlength @xmath43 fm ) . it is thus tempting to identify the ridge with an incompletely formed shockwave and try to explain near and away side phenomenology with the same mechanism . \n clearly , this interpretation can not be verified by exact calculations in our present model . \n however , one can verify that basic scales are correct and that such an interpretation quite naturally fits the general framework . \n using eq . \n ( [ e - lflow ] ) for the typical near side parton vertex , we find that the timescale is sufficient for the longitudinal flow to expand the correlation into the interval @xmath44 . \n furthermore , if the ridge correlation is driven by energy lost from the trigger parton , it should not scale with the trigger energy , but with the expected energy loss given a trigger energy , a quantity which is approximately constant in the kinematic range probed so far . \n finally , if the ridge is akin to the shockwave , its main effect should be an additional boost to hadrons , i.e. an upward shift in apparent temperature with a mass ordering of this shift just like in the case of radial flow , i.e. the shift in apparent temperature should be stronger for nucleons than for pions . \n the most useful measurement to discover more about the relationship between ridge and cone is to trigger on a back to back hadron pair . in this case , the rapidity position of near and away side parton is approximately known , i.e. if there is a ridge on the away side it should become visible . furthermore , the vertex distribution of events can be dialed by chosing appropriate momenta on both sides : if equal momenta back to back are required the situation has to be symmetric and most vertices occur in the center , otherwise the vertex distribution is shifted towards the medium surface on the high - momentum side . \n thus , such a 4-particle correlation measurement could also check if properties of ridge and cone depend crucially on the average in - medium pathlength of the parent parton . \n we have shown that the correlation pattern of associate hadrons back to back with a hard trigger can be understood in terms of shockwaves induced by the energy loss of th away side parton . \n many properties of the observed signal find a natural explanation once this fundamental mechanism is adopted @xcite . \n if so , the resulting correlation pattern shows a sensitivity to several properties of the medium : first , the angular position of the peak is sensitive to the average temperature of the system and hence sensitive to the expansion ( which determines the rate of cooling ) or , if the expansion is assumed to be known , to the eos ( which determines @xmath45 ) . \n flow corrections modify the position somewhat . in particular , longitudinal flow is crucial to spread the correlation signal over a large rapidity interval whereas transverse flow has a strong influence on the structure of the observed 3-particle correlations . within the given framework \n , we could demonstrate that the data favour one density profile assumption over another , however more detailed studies are needed before medium properties can be inferred in a more direct way from the data . \n we would like to stress that a detailed simulation of the background medium , the acceptance and trigger conditions and the energy loss as performed in our calculations is crucial for these features . \n especially we observe strong event by event fluctuations of the 2- and 3-particle correlation signals , and while some events may be similar to the average , the majority is not . \n hence the simulation of a single event can not be considered as a good representative of the ensemble and should not be compared with measured data . \n likewise , the average speed of sound in medium can not reliably be obtained from the measured angle without a simulation including the effects of flow . \n finally , we have outlined a 4-particle correlation measurement which would provide valuable insights into the nature of both ridge and cone correlation . \n we would like to thank j.  cassalderay -

{"ContextTokens": 1504, "GeneratedTokens": 112, "SynthesizedBody": "manganese-12 acetate ( mn@xmath1ac ) is a molecular magnet which has been the subject of much study , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , since it was first fabricated by lis in 1980 @xcite . \n while most of the research into the properties of mn@xmath0-ac has been focused on its interesting magnetic properties , some work has been done more recently exploring the electronic properties , in particular the conductance through mn@xmath0-ac @xcite . \n theoretical predictions have also been made concerning the electronic structure of related mn@xmath0 molecules @xcite . \n this study seeks to shed light on how the presence of these molecular magnets on the surface of a gold film can affect the transport properties of the conduction electrons within that gold film .    in order to explore the interactions between the mn@xmath0-ac and the gold film \n , one must have a theoretical framework for understanding the interactions . \n the theory of weak localization @xcite provides such a framework by quantifying the strengths of the various scattering processes experienced by the conduction electrons . \n conduction electrons within a metal can undergo elastic scattering , such as surface scattering or scattering from lattice defects ; inelastic scattering , such as electron - phonon scattering ; spin scattering , such as scattering from magnetic impurities ; or spin - orbit scattering . \n each of these processes makes specific contributions to the resistance of the film and each changes in a specific way in the presence of a magnetic field . \n weak localization predicts the change in resistance of a metallic film in a perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath2 , due to weak localization effects to have the following dependence @xcite :    @xmath3\\label{eq : magnetoresistance}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the sheet resistance of the film and @xmath5 are characteristic fields given by    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 being characteristic fields corresponding to elastic , spin - orbit , spin , and inelastic scattering , respectively . \n the physical quantity of interest is the scattering time , @xmath13 , associated with each type of scattering process . \n the scattering times are related to the scattering fields by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the electron charge and @xmath16 is the diffusion constant in two dimensions . \n measurement of the magnetoresistance of a metal , then , allows one to determine the scattering times associated with the various scattering processes which the conduction electrons undergo . by simultaneously measuring the magnetoresistance of gold films with and without mn@xmath0-ac on the surface and computing how the characteristic scattering times change , one can determine the types of interactions taking place between the conduction electrons in the gold and the mn@xmath0-ac . \n in order to perform the magnetoresistance measurements , a thin film of au was made by thermal evaporation onto a room temperature silicon substrate with the native oxide layer and a 20@xmath17 ge adhesion layer . \n a shadow mask , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : au_pattern ] , was used to define a pattern consisting of a single current - carrying strip with eight voltage probes , four on each side of the strip . \n this setup allows a four - wire measurement of two different sections of the strip simultaneously and with some redundancy . by placing mn@xmath0-ac on half of the current carrying strip , the magnetoresistance with and without mn@xmath0-ac can be measured simultaneously using the same excitation current and magnetic field . \n theoretical fits are obtained using a least - squares fitting method to obtain the best set of the four fitting parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 . \n schematic of pattern used for au samples . ] \n mn@xmath0-ac was placed on the surface of the au film using a simple drop - and - dry technique , similar to the established dip - and - dry technique@xcite . \n a solution was made by dissolving 10  mg of mn@xmath0-ac powder in 10  ml of isopropyl alcohol . \n five drops of this solution were dropped onto half of the au film with ample drying time between drops . \n it was observed by afm ( see figure 1 , ref . ) that this is sufficient to ensure good coverage of the au with mn@xmath0-ac . \n samples were then mounted in a dilution refrigerator for measurement . \n results shown are from typical samples \n .    figure  [ fig:7.8nm_600mk ] shows the measured magnetoresistance for a 7.8  nm au film , with and without mn@xmath0-ac , at a temperature of 600  mk . in the dilution refrigerator used in these experiments , 600  mk \n was found to be an easy temperature to reach and stabilize , while lower temperature measurements did not seem to provide any substantial advantage . \n the solid curves are fits to the theory of weak localization using equation  [ eq : magnetoresistance ] . \n the fitting parameters , @xmath18 , used for the fits in figure  [ fig:7.8nm_600mk ] are listed in table  [ tab : characteristic - fields-78 ] . \n also listed are the characteristic scattering times calculated using equation  [ eq : h_tau ] . \n the elastic scattering time is increased by approximately a factor of two if mn@xmath0 is present . \n this indicates a decrease in the amount of elastic scattering , consistent with a change in the surface which reduces the amount of surface scattering . \n the inelastic and spin - orbit scattering are essentially unchanged , while the spin scattering time is reduced by around an order of magnitude . \n this indicates a significant increase in the amount of spin scattering taking place . \n the decrease in elastic scattering and increase in spin scattering are consistent with a picture in which electrons which would have scattered from the surface of the au film are instead entering the mn@xmath0-ac molecules and undergoing spin scattering , most likely from the mn atoms within the molecules . \n magnetoresistance of 7.8 nm au film at 600 mk . \n solid curves are fits to theory . ] \n .[tab : characteristic - fields-78]characteristic fields and scattering times for 7.8 nm gold film at 600 mk .

universe in their fundamental relationship and on the basic , still unknown , physical laws of nature ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) . \n virtual institute of astroparticle physics ( via ) @xcite was organized with the aim to play the role of an unifying and coordinating structure for astroparticle physics . \n starting from the january of 2008 the activity of the institute takes place on its website @xcite in a form of regular weekly videoconferences with via lectures , covering all the theoretical and experimental activities in astroparticle physics and related topics . \n the library of records of these lectures , talks and their presentations was accomplished by multi - lingual forum . in 2008 via complex was effectively used for the first time for participation at distance in xi

presented in @xcite . here \n the current state - of - art of via complex , integrated since the end of 2009 in the structure of apc laboratory , is presented in order to clarify the way in which via discussion of open questions beyond the standard model took place in the framework of xv bled workshop . \n the structure of via complex is illustrated on fig . \n [ homevia ] . \n the home page , presented on this figure , contains the information on via activity and menu , linking to directories ( along the upper line from left to right ) : with general information on via ( about via ) , entrance to via virtual rooms ( rooms ) , the library of records and presentations ( previous ) of via lectures ( previous @xmath6 lectures ) , records of online transmissions of conferences(previous

program of future via lectures and events . \n the right column on the via homepage lists the announcements of the regularly up - dated hot news of astroparticle physics .    in 2010 \n special cosmovia tours were undertaken in switzerland ( geneva ) , belgium ( brussels , liege ) and italy ( turin , pisa , bari , lecce ) in order to test stability of via online transmissions from different parts of europe . \n positive results of these tests have proved the stability of via system and stimulated this practice at xiii bled workshop . \n these tours involved special equipment , including , in particular , the use of the sensitive audio system konftel 300w @xcite . \n the records of the videoconferences at the xiii bled workshop are available on via site @xcite .    in 2011 via facility was used for the tasks of the paris center of cosmological physics ( pccp ) , chaired by g. smoot and for the public programme `` the two infinities '' conveyed by j.l.robert . \n it has effectively supported participation at distance at meetings of the double chooz collaboration : the experimentalists , being at shift , took part in the collaboration meeting in such a virtual way . \n the simplicity of via facility for ordinary users was demonstrated at xiv bled workshop . \n videoconferences at this workshop had no special technical support except for wifi internet connection and ordinary laptops with their internal video and audio equipments . \n this test has proved the ability to use via facility at any place with at least decent internet connection . \n of course the quality of records is not as good in this case as with the use of special equipment , but still it is sufficient to support fruitful scientific discussion as can be illustrated by the record of via presentation `` new physics and its experimental probes '' given by john ellis from his office in cern ( see the records in @xcite ) .    in 2012 via facility , regularly used for programs of via lectures and transmission of apc colloquiums , has extended its applications to support m.khlopovs talk at distance at astrophysics seminar in moscow , videoconference in pccp , participation at distance in apc - hamburg - oxford network meeting as well as to provide online transmissions from the lectures at science festival 2012 in university paris7 . via communication \n has effectively resolved the problem of referee s attendance at the defence of phd thesis by mariana vargas in apc . \n the referees made their reports and participated in discussion in the regime of via videoconference . \n the discussion of questions that were put forward in the interactive via events can be continued and extended on via forum . \n the forum is intended to cover the topics : beyond the standard model , astroparticle physics , cosmology , gravitational wave experiments , astrophysics , neutrinos . \n presently activated in english and russian with trivial extension to other languages , the forum represents a first step on the way to multi - lingual character of via complex and its activity . \n one of the interesting forms of forum activity is the educational work . for the last four years \n m.khlopovs course `` introduction to cosmoparticle physics '' is given in the form of via videoconferences and the records of these lectures and their ppt presentations are put in the corresponding directory of the forum @xcite . \n having attended the via course of lectures in order to be admitted to exam students should put on forum a post with their small thesis . \n professor s comments and proposed corrections are put in a post reply so that students should continuously present on forum improved versions of work until it is accepted as satisfactory . \n then they are admitted to pass their exam . \n the record of videoconference with their oral exam is also put in the corresponding directory of forum . \n such procedure provides completely transparent way of estimation of students knowledge . \n first tests of via system , described in @xcite , involved various systems of videoconferencing . \n they included skype , vrvs , evo , webex , marratech and adobe connect . in the result of these tests \n the adobe connect system was chosen and properly acquired . \n its advantages are : relatively easy use for participants , a possibility to make presentation in a video contact between presenter and audience , a possibility to make high quality records and edit them , removing from records occasional and rather rare disturbances of sound or connection , to use a whiteboard facility for discussions , the option to open desktop and to work online with texts in any format . the regular form of via meetings assumes that their time and virtual room are announced in advance . \n since the access to the virtual room is strictly controlled by administration , the invited participants should enter the room as guests , typing their names , and their entrance and successive ability to use video and audio system is authorized by the host of the meeting . \n the format of via lectures and discussions is shown on fig . \n [ ellis ] , illustrating the talk `` opera versus maxwell and einstein '' given by john ellis from cern . \n the complete record of this talk and is available on via website @xcite . \n the sensational character of the exciting news on superluminal propagation of neutrinos acquired the number of participants , exceeding the allowed upper limit . \n for the first time the problem of necessity in extension of this limit was put forward and it was resolved by creation of a virtual `` infinity room '' , which can host any reasonable amount of participants . \n the ppt or pdf file of presentation is uploaded in the system in advance and then demonstrated in the central window . \n video images of presenter and participants appear in the right window , while in the upper left window the list of all the attendees is given . to protect the quality of sound and record \n , the participants are required to switch out their microphones during presentation and to use lower left chat window for immediate comments and urgent questions . \n the chat window can be also used by participants , having no microphone , for questions and comments during discussion . \n the interactive form of via lectures provides oral discussion , comments and questions during the lecture . \n participant should use in this case a `` raise hand '' option , so that presenter gets signal to switch our his microphone and let the participant to speak . in the end of presentation \n the central window can be used for a whiteboard utility as well as the whole structure of windows can be changed , e.g. by making full screen the window with the images of participants of discussion . \n regular activity of via as a part of apc includes online transmissions of all the apc colloquiums and of some topical apc seminars , which may be of interest for a wide audience . \n online transmissions are arranged in the manner , most convenient for presenters , prepared to give their talk in the conference room in a normal way , projecting slides from their laptop on the screen . \n having uploaded in advance these slides in the via system , via operator , sitting in the conference room , changes them following presenter , directing simultaneously webcam on the presenter and the audience . \n via sessions of xv bled workshop have developed from the first experience at xi bled workshop @xcite and their more regular practice at xii , xiii and xiv bled workshops @xcite . \n they became a regular part of the bled workshop s programme . \n in the course of xv bled workshop meeting the list of open questions was stipulated , which was proposed for wide discussion with the use of via facility . the list of these questions was put on via forum ( see @xcite ) and all the participants of via sessions were invited to address them during via discussions . during the xv bled workshop the test of not only minimal necessary equipment , but either of the use of via facility by ordinary users was undertaken . via sessions were supported by personal laptop with wifi internet connection only , as well as for the first time the members of via team were physically absent in bled and all the videoconferences were directed by m.khlopov at distance from paris . \n it proved the possibility to provide effective interactive online via videoconferences even in the absence of any special equipment and qualified personnel at place . only laptop with microphone and webcam together with wifi internet connection \n was shown to be sufficient not only for attendance , but also for via presentations and discussions .    in the framework of \n the program of xv bled workshop , p. belli , staying in his office in rome , gave his talk `` dama / libra results and perspectives '' ( fig . \n [ dm ] ) and took part in the discussion of puzzles of dark matter searches , which provided a brilliant demonstration of the interactivity of via in the way most natural for the non - formal atmosphere of bled workshops ( see @xcite ) . \n in the course of this discussion n.s . \n manko bortnik and g. bregar , being in bled , have considered possible dark matter candidates that follow from the approach , unifying spins and charges , and maxim khlopov presented from paris the state - of - art of composite dark matter scenario , stipulating the open problems of this solution for the puzzles of direct dark matter searches . via sessions \n were finished by the via talk `` the atlas experiment at the lhc : present status and its future '' by a.s romaniouk and discussion of problems of experimental search for new physics at accelerators .    via sessions \n provided participation at distance in bled discussions for m.khlopov ( apc , paris , france ) , p. belli ( rome tor vergata , italy ) , e. soldatov ( cern , switzerland ) , k.belotsky , n.chasnikov and a.mayorov ( mephi , moscow ) , j .- \n cudell and q.wallemacq ( liege , belgium ) , r.weiner ( marburg , germany ) and many others . \n current via activity is integrated in the structure of apc laboratory and includes regular weekly videoconferences with via lectures , online transmissions of apc colloquiums and seminars , a solid library of their records and presentations , together with the work of multi - lingual via internet forum . \n the scientific - educational complex of virtual institute of astroparticle physics can provide regular communications between different groups and scientists , working in different scientific fields and parts of the world , get the first - hand information on the newest scientific results , as well as to support various educational programs at distance . \n this activity would easily allow finding mutual interest and organizing task forces for different scientific topics of astroparticle physics and related topics . \n it can help in the elaboration of strategy of experimental particle , nuclear , astrophysical and cosmological studies as well as in proper analysis of experimental data . \n it can provide young talented people from all over the world to get the highest level education , come in direct interactive contact with the world known scientists and to find their place in the fundamental research . via applications can go far beyond the particular tasks of astroparticle physics and give rise to an interactive system of mass media communications .    via sessions \n became a natural part of a program of bled workshops , opening the room of discussions of physics beyond the standard model for distant participants from all the world . \n the experience of via applications at bled workshops plays important role in the development of via facility as an effective tool of science and education online . \n the initial step of creation of via was supported by aspera . \n i am grateful to p.binetruy , j.ellis and s.katsanevas for permanent stimulating support , to j.c . \n hamilton for support in via integration in the structure of apc

sax observations of galaxy clusters are presented by a few authors . \n kaastra et al . \n ( 1998 ) discuss spatially resolved spectroscopy of a2199 . \n they find evidence of a spectral hardening in the outer parts of this cluster . \n moreover , using pds data they confirm the presence of a hard tail in a2199 . \n colafrancesco et al . \n ( 1998 ) discuss the analysis of 2 intermediate redshift clusters namely a33 and a348 . \n they combine their data with previous asca measurements to place constraints on the @xmath3 relationship at @xmath4 . \n dacri et al . \n discuss an analysis technique which they have developed to correct for the spectral distortions introduced by the energy dependent mecs psf . \n they apply this technique to the core of the virgo cluster finding a temperature decrement towards the inner parts of cluster , in agreement with previous measurements made with rosat and asca . \n the central region of the perseus cluster was observed by the beppo - sax satellite ( boella , butler et al . \n 97 ) between the 20@xmath5 and the 21@xmath6 of september 1996 during the science verification phase ( svp ) . \n the observation was rather long with a total effective exposure of 89 ks for the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) ( boella , chiappetti et al . \n 97 ) , 38 ks for the hpgspc instrument ( manzo et al . 1997 ) and 30 ks for the pds instrument ( frontera et al . \n 1997 ) . \n i have accumulated a mecs spectrum from a region centered on the emission peak using an extraction radius of 6.4 arcmin . \n i have fitted the mecs , hpgspc and pds spectra simultaneously using a thermal emission code ( mekal in xspec version 9.01 ) absorbed by an equivalent hydrogen column density of n@xmath7 @xmath8 the fit to the broad band spectrum ( figure 1 ) shows an excess of the data with respect to the model at energies e 20 kev . \n this excess can not be fitted with a thermal component , unless an unphysical temperature of more than 20 kev is assumed . \n a power - law component fits adequately the high energy excess . \n the intensity of the power - law component is @xmath9 erg @xmath8s@xmath10 in the 20 - 100 kev band . \n comparison of our measurement with previous detections by oso7 ( rothschild et al . 1981 ) , heao1 ( levine et al . 1984 ) and with the osse upper limit ( osako et al . 1994 ) indicate that the power - law component is undergoing a secular decrease in intensity . \n an asca analysis of the central region of perseus ( fabian et al . 94 ) shows that the spectrum below 3 kev is strongly contaminated by a cooling flow . by comparing the surface brightness profile of perseus in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , derived from the analysis of rosat pspc archive data , with a king profile we find that the cooling flow extends out to @xmath0 8 arcmin , corresponding to 240 kpc . \n i have attempted to spatially resolve the cooling flow component with the mecs by analyzing spectra from 4 concentric annuli centered on the emission peak and with bounding radii of 0 - 2 arcmin , 2 - 4 arcmin , 4 - 6 arcmin and 6 - 8 arcmin respectively . \n i have fitted each spectrum in the 3.5 - 10 kev range with a thermal model ( mekal ) allowing the temperature and the abundances to be free . \n i have then reintroduced the data in the 1.5 - 3.5 kev range and plotted the residuals to the fits ( see figure 2 ) . \n as can be clearly seen the relative intensity of the cooling flow component decreases as the radial distance from the peak of the emission increases ( the increase observed when going from panel 1 to panel 2 is due to instrumental effects , more specifically the detector psf , below 3 kev , redistributes a large fraction of photons coming from a circular region with a radius of 2 arcmin over a larger region ) . \n as described in the previous subsection i have fitted spectra accumulated in concentric annuli with a thermal emission model . in figure 3 \n i plot the temperature derived from the fits . in order to avoid contamination from the cooling flow \n the fits were performed in the 3 - 10 kev band . \n our data clearly indicates that the temperature presents a strong gradient in perseus over a region of 8 arcmin ( corresponding to 240 kpc ) in radius . \n i have accumulated a mecs spectrum from a circular region centered on the emission peak using an extraction radius of 6.4 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath0 200 kpc . \n i have modeled the spectrum in the 3 - 10 kev band using a bremsstrahlung for the continuum and two gaussian lines , one for the 6.8 kev iron complex , the other for the 8 kev iron - nickel complex . \n data at energies below 3 kev has been excluded because significantly contaminated by the cooling flow . \n i find a temperature of @xmath11 kev for the continuum component , an energy e@xmath12 kev and a width @xmath13 kev for the lower energy line and an energy e@xmath14 kev and a width @xmath15 kev for the higher energy line , where both e@xmath16 and e@xmath17 are given in the source rest - frame . \n the 8 kev feature is clearly broad and most likely due to a blend of different lines from highly ionized iron ( fe xxv and fe xxvi ) and nickel ( ni xxvii ) . \n fits with thermal emission codes such as meka , mekal or raymond & smith do not reproduce satisfactorily the 8 kev feature , all these models underestimate significantly the intensity of the emission feature , the reason being that all the above codes predict an 8 kev over 6.8 kev line intensity ratio in the range 0.11 - 0.13 against an observed ratio of @xmath18 . \n the most convincing explanation i have found for the observed anomalous ratio involves a process known as resonant scattering ( a detailed discussion of alternative explanations and of other aspects of the line ratio analysis is presented in molendi et al . \n the inter - galactic medium in clusters , while optically thin to the continuum and many lines , may be optically thick in the center of some lines . indeed the process describing the absorption of an fe k@xmath19 line photon by an iron ion followed by the immediate re - emission , which is known as resonant scattering , can be quite effective for typical cluster gas densities and temperatures . \n gilfanov et al . \n ( 86 ) have shown that the cores of rich cluster , such as perseus and virgo , should have optical depths , for the above process , of the order of a few . \n if the gas is optically thick to resonant scattering , the line emission coming from the core of the cluster will be attenuated because of the photons which are scattered out of the line of sight . \n if this is the case then the abundances measured using standard thermal emission codes , which assume optically thin thermal emission , can be significantly underestimated . in figure 4 \n i show the abundance profiles computed under the assumption of optically thin line emission ( open circles ) and of optically thick emission , using 2 different methods ( filled circles and open squares ) . \n i find that the the fe abundance in the innermost circular region , with radius 2 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath0 60 kpc , is @xmath0 0.9 solar and consistent with 1 . \n the obvious implication is that a very large fraction of the gas in the core of perseus has been processed in stars . \n i acknowledge support of various nature from my colleagues in the beppo -

{"ContextTokens": 2813, "GeneratedTokens": 169, "SynthesizedBody": "this paper deals with selective pressure and diversity in cellular genetic algorithms ( cgas ) which are a subclass of genetic algorithms where the population is embedded in a grid . \n these concepts are closely related to the exploration / exploitation trade - off . \n previous studies on cgas selected the size and the shape of neighborhoods @xcite , or the shape of the grid @xcite as basic parameters to tune the search process . \n altering these structural parameters entails a deep change in the way we deal with the problem . \n for instance , there is no built - in mean to swap from a rectangular grid to a square grid without misshaping the neighborhood relation . \n we suggest using _ anisotropic selection _ ( as ) to promote diversity and to control accurately the selective pressure in genetic search . the main advantage of the _ anisotropic selection _ \n scheme is that it allows to control the exploration / exploitation trade - off without affecting neither the grid topology nor the neighborhood shape ; so the cellular genetic algorithm we propose merely works on a square grid and a simple von neumann neighborhood shape . \n + the paper is divided in 6 sections . \n section [ section1 ] gives a brief definition of cgas and an overview of existing techniques used to control the exploration / exploitation tradeoff . \n section [ section2 ] introduces the as scheme . \n section [ section3 ] studies the influence of as on the selective pressure . in section [ section4 ] \n we compare as and rectangular grids topologies influence on the selective pressure . in section [ section5 ] \n we show how as promotes the emergence of niches . in section [ section6 ] \n we use a cga on a quadratic assignment problem to measure the correlation between anisotropy and performance . \n finally we tie together the results of the previous sections and suggest directions for further research . \n this section presents a brief overview on cellular genetic algorithms and a standard technique to measure the selective pressure . \n [ section1 ]      cellular genetic algorithms are a subclass of genetic algorithms ( gas ) in which exploration and population diversity are enhanced thanks to the existence of small overlapped neighborhoods @xcite . such algorithms are specially well suited for complex problems @xcite . \n we assume a two - dimensional toroidal grid as a spatial population structure . \n each grid cell contains one individual of the population . \n the overlapping neighborhoods provide an implicit mechanism for migration of genetic material throughout the grid . \n a genetic algorithm is assumed to be running simultaneously on each grid cell , continuously selecting parents from the neighborhood of that grid cell in order to produce an offspring which replaces the current individual .      a standard technique to study the induced selection pressure without introducing the perturbing effect of variation operators is to let selection be the only active operator , and then monitor the number of best individual copies @xmath0 in the population @xcite . \n the takeover time is the time it takes for the single best individual to conquer the whole population . \n the grid is initialized with one cell having the best fitness and all the other having a null fitness . since no other evolution mechanism but \n selection takes place , we can observe the way the best individual spreads over the grid by counting generation after generation the number of copies of this one . \n a shorter takeover time thus means a higher selective pressure . \n it has been shown that when we move from a panmictic population , as in standard ga , to a spatially structured one of the same size with synchronous updating of the cells , the global selection pressure induced on the entire population is weaker @xcite . \n links have been established between takeover time and neighborhood size and shape or grid topology . \n neighborhood size and shape in a cga are parameters that have some influence on the takeover time \n . a larger overlap of local neighborhoods of the same shape speeds up the best individual s spreading over the grid . \n the influence of the shape is given by sarma and de jong through a measure on the neighborhood which represents the spatial dispersion of a cell pattern @xcite . \n rather than the size of the neighborhood in terms of individuals , the key particularity of a local neighborhood is its radius . \n the takeover time decreases while the radius increases in a spatially structured population . \n [ sec - effectgridtopo ] we measure the relation between grid topology and selective pressure for rectangular grids where the population size is fixed to @xmath1 . \n we use the following grid shapes : @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 individuals . \n the selection strategy is a binary tournament . \n for each cell we randomly choose two individuals in its neighborhood . \n the best one then replaces the individual of the cell on the grid if it is fitter or with probability 0.5 if fitnesses are equal . \n figure [ fig - crois - tournoi ] shows the average of @xmath8 independant runs of growth of @xmath0 against generations ; the takeover time is reached when @xmath0 is equal to the size of the grid ( see table i ) . the average growth rate @xmath9 , that is the number of new best individual copies per time unit , of these curves for four rectangular grid shapes ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4,@xmath5 ) is plotted in figure [ acrois_tournoi ] . \n this figure helps us to understand the growth of @xmath0 . \n the growth rate @xmath9 is the same for all grids for the first generations . \n then , the spreading speeds down to reach a constant speed for rectangular grids . \n this constant is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the probability of selecting the best individual when there is one copy of it in the neighborhood and @xmath12 the shortest side of the grid @xcite . \n more accurately , @xmath9 decreases when @xmath12 is filled by copies of the best individual ( see figure [ display_rec](b ) ) . \n then , the speed becomes constant until the best individual has spread over to the other side ( see figure [ display_rec](c ) ) . \n this explains why the @xmath2 grid curve has no constant period : the two sides are filled at the same time . \n finally , the growth rate falls down to zero as the best individual finishes conquering the grid . \n the results of the experiments we conducted are in agreement with e.alba and j.troya observations that narrow grid shapes induce low selective pressure @xcite . \n we will see in the next sections that this behavior can be observed with the as too . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ display_two ] \n we experiment a cga using anisotropic selection on a quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) : nug30 . \n our aim here is not to obtain better results with respect to other optimization methods , but rather to observe the behavior of a cga with as . in particular , we seek an optimal value for the anisotropy degree . \n the qap is an important problem in both theory and practice . \n it was introduced by koopmans and beckmann in 1957 and is a modal for many practical problems @xcite . \n + the qap can be described as the problem of assigning a set of facilities to a set of locations with given distances between the locations and given flows between the facilities . \n the goal is to place the facilities on locations in such a way that the sum of the products between flows and distances is minimal . \n + given @xmath13 facilities and @xmath13 locations , two @xmath14 matrices @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 is the distance between locations @xmath18 and @xmath12 and @xmath19 the flow between facilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the objective function is : + @xmath22 where @xmath23 gives the location of facility @xmath20 in the current permutation @xmath11 . \n + nugent , vollman and ruml suggested a set of problem instances of different sizes noted for their difficulty @xcite . \n the instances they suggested are known to have multiple local optima , so they are difficult for a genetic algortihm . \n we experiment our algorithm on their 30 variables instance called nug30 . \n we consider a population of 400 individuals placed on a square grid . \n each individual represents a permutation of @xmath24 . \n we need a special crossover that preserves the permutations :    * select two individuals @xmath25 and @xmath26 as genitors . * \n choose a random position @xmath20 . \n * find @xmath21 and @xmath18 so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . * \n swap positions @xmath20 and @xmath21 from @xmath25 and positions @xmath20 and @xmath18 from @xmath26 . \n * repeat @xmath29 times this procedure where @xmath13 is the length of an individual . \n this crossover is an extended version of the upmx crossover proposed in @xcite . \n the mutation operator consists in randomly selecting two positions from the individual and exchanging these positions . \n the crossover rate is 1 and we perform one mutation per individual in average . + we consider 500 runs for each anisotropy degree . \n each run stops after 1500 generations . \n figure [ alpha - perf ] shows the average performance of the algorithm towards @xmath30 : for each value of @xmath30 we average the best solution of each run . \n performances are growing with @xmath30 and then fall down as @xmath30 is getting closer to its limit value . \n this curve shows the influence of the selective pressure on the performances and how important it is to control it accurately . \n the best average performance is observed for @xmath31 , which corresponds to a good exploration / exploitation tradeoff . in the neighborhood of this optimal value \n the algorithm favors propagation of good solutions in the vertical direction with few interactions on the left or right sides . \n this kind of dynamics is well adapted to multi - modal problems as we can reach local optima on each columns of the grid and then migrate them horizontally to find new solutions . \n performances would probably improve if the selective pressure did not remain static during the search process . \n as in @xcite , we can define some criteria to self - adjust the anisotropy degree along generations . \n furthermore , we can assign a different anisotropy degree to each cell of the grid , so that we can determinate criteria to self - adjust selective pressure locally upon measures on neighborhoods . \n this paper presents a new selection scheme in cellular genetic algorithms . \n the main objective is to control the exploration / exploitation tradeoff in a flexible way . \n we propose to exploit the cellular ga characteristics to promote diversity during a genetic search process . \n previous studies on cgas selected structural parameters , as neighborhood or grid shape , to tune the selective pressure . \n the main drawback of these techniques is that altering a structural parameter entails a deep change in the way we deal with the problem . \n the new selection scheme we suggest is based on _ fuzzy neighborhood _ where a cell is chosen according to different probabilities . in order to favor one direction rather than the other one , _ \n anisotropic selection _ chooses individuals in fuzzy neighborhood . \n experiments performed in order to establish relation between the takeover time and the degree of anisotropy are consistent with our expectation that selection pressure decreases with the degree of anisotropy . \n analysis of the growth curves allows to distinguish three different phases in the diffusion process . \n experimental results establish linear correlation in takeover between as and cga using rectangular grid . \n then we point out capabilities of as to promote the emergence of niches . finally , using a cga with as on a qap \n we have shown the existence of an anisotropic optimal value of @xmath30 such that the best average performance is observed . \n this paper is a preliminary investigation and a more extensive analysis must be made to confirm that equilibrium between exploration and exploitation makes as a good technique for complex problems in static or dynamic environments . \n future work should address the following issues : comparison between as and changes in the neighborhood shape and size , measuring as effects with cga using mutation and crossover , change the balance of directions dynamically . \n the latter point is an important feature : by tuning the control parameter @xmath30 , it would be possible to make the algorithm to self - adjust the selective pressure , depending on global or local measures . \n this adaptive ability has two important advantages : first , parameter @xmath30 may vary in a continuous way , second , variations of this parameter have affect neither on the grid topology nor on the neighborhood shape . \n such self - adaptive algorithms have been studied in previous works , but they need to change the grid topology to control the selective pressure @xcite , which means it is uniform in the grid . as allows different propagation speeds on each area of the grid , promoting diversification and intensification ( exploitation ) at the same time on different spots . in general , we have to continue investigation of _ anisotropic selection _ to assess its validity and generality . \n m.  giacobini , a.  tettamanzi , and m.  tomassini . \n modelling selection intensity for linear cellular evolutionary algorithms . in p. \n l. et  al . , \n editor , _ artificial evolution , sixth international conference , evolution artificielle , ea  2003 _ , lecture notes in computer science , pages 345356 , marseille , france , october 2003 . springer .", "StartTimeOffset": 2673088077090, "RequestID": "821c0464404a4a1b91771c5a8096f33a7e03797f", "TotalTokens": 2982}
{"ContextTokens": 2742, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "multifibre technology now allows us to measure redshifts of millions of galaxies . the anglo - australian 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) measured redshifts for 230,000 galaxies selected from the apm catalogue . \n the survey is now complete and publically available . \n the median redshift of the 2dfgrs is @xmath1 , down to an extinction corrected magnitude limit of @xmath2 ( colless et al . \n a sample of this size allows large - scale structure statistics to be measured with very small random errors . in this review \n we summarize some recent results from the 2dfgrs on clustering and galaxy biasing . \n comprehensive recent reviews are given by colless ( 2003 ) and peacock ( 2003 ) . \n an initial estimate of the convolved , redshift - space power spectrum of the 2dfgrs has been determined ( percival et al . 2001 ) for a sample of 160,000 redshifts . on scales \n @xmath3 , the data are robust and the shape of the power spectrum is not affected by redshift - space or non - linear effects , though the amplitude is increased by redshift - space distortions . \n percival et al . \n ( 2001 ) , efstathiou et al . \n ( 2002 ) and lahav et al . \n ( 2002 ) compared the 2dfgrs and cmb power spectra , and concluded that they are consistent with each other . \n a key assumption in deriving cosmological parameters from redshift surveys is that the biasing parameter , defined as the ratio of of galaxy to matter power spectra , is constant , i.e. scale independent . on scales of @xmath4 \n the fluctuations are close to the linear regime , and there are theoretical reasons ( e.g. fry 1996 ; benson et al . \n 2000 ) to expect that on large scales the biasing parameter should tend to a constant and close to unity at the present epoch . \n this is supported by the derived biasing close to unity by combining 2dfgrs with the cmb ( lahav et al . \n 2002 ) and by the study of the bi - spectrum of the 2dfgrs alone ( verde et al . \n 2002 ) . \n the 2dfgrs power spectrum ( figure 1 ) was fitted in percival et al . \n ( 2001 ) over the above range in @xmath5 , assuming scale - invariant primordial fluctuations and a @xmath6-cdm cosmology , for four free parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the redshift space @xmath10 . \n the amplitudes of the linear - theory rms fluctuations are traditionally labeled @xmath11 in mass @xmath12 in galaxies , defined on @xmath13 spheres . assuming a gaussian prior on the hubble constant @xmath14 ( based on freedman et al . \n 2001 ) the shape of the recovered spectrum within the above @xmath5-range was used to yield 68 per cent confidence limits on the shape parameter @xmath15 , and the baryon fraction @xmath16 , in accordance with the popular ` concordance ' model ( e.g. bahcall et al . 1999 ) . for \n fixed ` concordance model ' parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and a hubble constant @xmath19 , the amplitude of 2dfgrs galaxies in redshift space is @xmath20 ( at the survey s effective luminosity and redshift ) . \n recently the sdss team presented their results for the power spectrum ( tegmark et al . \n 2003a , b ; pope et al . 2004 ) , and they found good agreement with the 2dfgrs gross shape of the power spectrum . \n pope et al . \n ( 2004 ) emphasize that sdss alone can not break the degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath8 because the baryon oscillations are not resolved given window function of the survey . \n solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino experiments have confirmed neutrino oscillations , implying that neutrinos have non - zero mass , but without pinning down their absolute masses . \n while it is established that the effect of neutrinos on the evolution of cosmic structure is small , the upper limits derived from large - scale structure could help significantly to constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino masses . \n elgary et al . \n ( 2002 ) used the 2dfgrs power spectrum ( figure 1 ) to provide an upper limit @xmath21 , i.e. approximately 0.7 ev for each of the three neutrino flavours , or phrased in terms of their contribution to the matter density , @xmath22 . \n the wmap team ( spergel et al . 2003 ) reported an improved limit of @xmath23 ( 95% cl ) . \n however , we point out that neutrinos with ev masses are basically indistinguishable from cold dark matter at the epoch of last scattering , and therefore they have little effect on the cmb fluctuations . \n the main neutrino signature comes from the 2dfgrs and the lyman @xmath24 forest which were combined with the wmap data . \n the contribution of wmap is that it constrains better the other parameters involved , e.g. @xmath25 ( see also hannestad 2003 and tegmark et al . \n 2003b for similar results from sdss+wmap ) . despite the uncertainties involved , \n it is remarkable that the results from redshift surveys give upper limits which are lower than those deduced from laboratory experiments , e.g. tritium decay . \n as the suppression of the power spectrum depends on the ratio @xmath26 , elgary & lahav ( 2003 ) found that the out - of - fashion mixed dark matter ( mdm ) model , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and no cosmological constant , fits the 2dfgrs power spectrum well , but only for a hubble constant @xmath29 . \n blanchard et al . ( 2003 ) reached a similar conclusion , and they also found that the cmb power spectrum could be fit well by the same mdm model if one allows features in the primordial power spectrum . \n it is intriguing ( and perhaps disappointing ) that the cmb and redshift surveys can not on their own ( i.e. without a strong prior on the hubble constant ) ` prove ' the existence a non - zero cosmological constant . \n another consequence of this is that excluding low values of the hubble constant , e.g. with the hst key project , is important in order to get a strong upper limit on the neutrino masses . \n madgwick et al . ( 2002 ) have utilized the method of principal component analysis ( pca ) to compress each galaxy spectrum into one quantity , @xmath30 . \n it turns out that @xmath31 is a useful indicator of the star formation rate in a galaxy ( madgwick et al . \n this allows us to divide the 2dfgrs into @xmath31-types , and to study e.g. luminosity functions and clustering per type . \n figures 2 and 3 show the bimodality in this spectral parameter and in the colour distribution ( peacock 2003 ) , respectively . \n bimodality is also seen clearly in the sdss photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data ( blanton et al . 2003 , kauffmann et al . 2004 ) . \n while the concept of two major galaxy populations in the universe was recognized long time ago by hubble and others , 2dfgrs and sdss provide quantitative measures of the frequency distribution using objective physical measures like spectral features and colours . \n the details of these distribution functions pose challenges to models of galaxy formation , in particular regarding the role of feedback mechanisms and the ` nature ' versus ` nurture ' question . \n although galaxy biasing was commonly neglected until the early 1980s , it has become evident that on scales @xmath32 different galaxy populations exhibit different clustering amplitudes , the so - called morphology - density relation ( e.g. dresser 1980 ; hermit et al . \n biasing on small scales is also predicted in the simulations of hierarchical clustering from cdm initial conditions ( e.g. benson et al . \n it is important therefore to pay attention to the scale on which biasing operates . \n norberg et al . \n ( 2002 ) found that for @xmath33 galaxies , the real space correlation function amplitude of @xmath31 early - type galaxies is @xmath34 higher than that of late - type galaxies . \n peacock et al . ( 2001 ) , hawkins et al . \n ( 2003 ) and madgwick et al . \n ( 2003b ) analysed the redshift space correlation function @xmath35 in terms of the line - of - sight and perpendicular to the line - of - sight separation for the entire galaxy populations , we well as for the most passively ( ` red ' ) and actively ( ` blue ' ) star - forming galaxies separately . \n the clustering properties of the two samples are quite distinct on scales @xmath36 . \n the ` red ' galaxies display a prominent ` finger - of - god ' effect and also have a higher overall normalization than the ` blue ' galaxies . \n figure 4 shows the real space correlation functions for the red and blue galaxies . while both are power laws , the slope is different , in accord with results for populations divided by colour in the sdss ( zehavi et al . \n understanding the difference in slope is another challenge for galaxy formation models . \n biasing could be non - linear and ` stochastic ' , in the sense that the number of galaxies predicted in a volume is not only a function of the mass fluctuation in that cell , but is possibly affected by other ` hidden variables ' ( dekel & lahav 1999 ) . \n wild et al . ( \n 2004 ) found recently evidence for a small amount stochasticity when considered a joint counts in cells of two galaxy populations defined by either colour or spectral type . \n the small amount of observed stochasticity supports the use of redshift surveys for measuring matter density fluctuations on large scales . \n however , the comparison with theory calls for better understanding of the ` hidden variables ' in models of galaxy formation ( e.g. blanton et al . 2000 ; somerville et al . \n the results presented above illustrate the power of redshift surveys to address fundamental issues in galaxy formation and cosmology . \n these are only a few examples of the results from the 2dfgrs . \n other results and papers are listed on the 2dfgrs website . \n overall , the results from 2dfgrs fit well into the ` concordance ' model which has emerged from various cosmological data sets . the @xmath6-cdm model with comparable amounts of dark matter and dark energy is rather esoteric , but it is remarkable that different measurements converge to the ` concordance model ' with parameters . \n perhaps the least accurate estimates on that list are for @xmath25 and @xmath11 ( e.g. bridle et al . \n 2003 , lahav & liddle 2003 ) . \n it is intriguing that an einstein - de sitter mixed dark matter model ( cold+hot dark matter ) without a cosmological constant can also fit the data , but it requires a low hubble constant and admittedly is at odds with the sn ia , cluster baryon fraction and other cosmic measurements . \n it is however an illustration that other yet unknown models may fit the data equally well \n .    it may well be that in the future the cosmological parameters will be fixed by the cmb , sn ia etc . \n then , for fixed cosmological parameters , one can use redshift surveys primarily to study galaxy biasing and evolution with cosmic epoch . \n i d like to thank joss bland - hawthorn and the ` tully 60 ' conference organisers for the hospitality in sydney . \n many of us are grateful to brent tully for his numerous original and inspiring contributions to the exploration of the local universe . \n i thank sarah bridle , ystein elgary , pirin erdogdu , darren madgwick , vivienne wild and members of the 2dfgrs and leverhulme quantitative cosmology teams for their contribution to the work summarized here . \n the 2df galaxy redshift survey was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff of the anglo - australian observatory . \n i also acknowledge a pparc senior research fellowship . \n peacock j.a . , 2003 , to appear in the proceedings of the 13th annual october astrophysics conference in maryland , ` the emergence of cosmic structure ' , eds . \n s. holt and c. reynolds ( aip ) , astro - ph/0301042", "StartTimeOffset": 2681605971960, "RequestID": "bacd02ad38d595dd98e111e3b27202a460f36549", "TotalTokens": 2927}

ion reactions once a certain system size is attained . \n strangeness production is enhanced in s+s reactions compared to p+p , but seems to saturate for even larger nuclei@xcite . \n recent results from the wa98 experiment@xcite show significant change of the shape of the @xmath2 @xmath1 spectrum in peripheral pb+pb collisions compared to p+p data . however , from semi - central pb+pb reactions with about 50 participating nucleons up to the most central reactions the shape remains unchanged . in the present analysis \n the centrality has been selected with the transverse energy @xmath3 measured in the calorimeter mirac . \n [ scaling ] shows the scaling behaviour of the charged particle multiplicity @xmath4 with the number of participants @xmath5 . \n it can be seen that @xmath4 follows a power law with the number of participants . \n the extracted exponent from the data is @xmath6 . on the bottom part of fig . \n [ scaling ] the same analysis performed with venus 4.12 @xcite is displayed . while the simulation result also obeys roughly a power law scaling , the agreement is not as good , and the scaling exponent appears to be significantly larger than that obtained from the experimental data . \n the neutral meson spectra are mainly influenced by thermal and chemical freeze - out in the final state . in the analysis of central reactions of pb+pb at 158 @xmath0gev \n it is seen that both predictions of perturbative qcd @xcite and hydrodynamical parameterizations @xcite can describe the measured neutral pion spectra very well . \n it is particularly astonishing to observe that on the one hand the pqcd calculation gives a good description also at relatively low momenta while on the other hand the hydrodynamical parameterization would yield a sizable contribution even at very high momenta . \n [ hydro]a shows a comparison of the neutral pion spectra to a fit of a hydrodynamical parameterization including transverse flow and resonance decays @xcite . using the default gaussian profile the best fit \n is obtained with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n [ hydro]b shows the best fit parameters as a filled circle  the corresponding @xmath9 contour is also shown . \n the figure also contains the @xmath10 allowed region from the @xmath11 dependence of the transverse radii extracted by negative pion interferometry with the wa98 negative tracking arm @xcite . \n the interferometry constraints are very similar to those given in @xcite  they favour relatively large transverse flow velocities \n . such large velocities are only compatible with the neutral pion spectra , if one assumes a very different spatial profile \n . however , this would result in rather low temperatures , thus these parameters are very sensitive to the used profile@xcite . \n if the initial state of the evolution is azimuthally asymmetric , as in semi - central heavy - ion collisions , this property will be reflected in the azimuthal asymmetry of the final state particle distributions . \n the strength of the collective flow will yield information on the nuclear equation of state during the expansion . \n collective flow development follows the time evolution of pressure gradients in the hot , dense matter . \n thus , collective flow can serve as a probe to provide information on the initial state and to which extent the reaction zone might me thermalized . in particular , the formation of a quark gluon plasma during the early stages of the collision is expected to result in reduced pressure gradients due to a softer nuclear equation of state which results in a reduced collective motion@xcite .      fig . \n [ flowcent ] shows the centrality dependence of the directed flow in terms of the average transverse momentum @xmath12 . for protons the maximum directed flow \n is observed in reactions with intermediate centrality . \n the corresponding impact parameter of @xmath13@xcite results twice as large as observed for ags energies@xcite . \n since the observed @xmath14 of pions is positive it indicates that the pions are preferentially emitted away from the target spectators , this is called anti - flow@xcite . \n the rapidity dependence of directed flow is given in fig . \n [ flowy ] . \n in addition , pion data measured with the tracking arm in the wa98 experiment@xcite at midrapidity and data near midrapidity measured by the na49 collaboration@xcite are shown . \n the maximum flow is observed in the fragmentation regions , while it rapidly decreases near midrapidity . \n the data follow a gaussian distribution .    hence for a complete description of the rapidity distribution of the collective flow the formerly used slope at midrapidity ( e.g. @xmath15 ) is not sufficient . \n it is more reasonable to use the three parameters of the gaussian distribution to describe the data . \n the peak position reflects the beam momentum , the peak height gives the strength of the flow and the width of the distribution provides information on how much the participants and the spectators are involved in the collectivity . \n 99 j.  sollfrank et al . , nucl . \n * a638 * ( 1997 ) 147c m.  m.  aggarwal et al . , phys . \n * 81 * ( 1998 ) 4087 k.  werner , phys \n .  rep . \n * 232 * ( 1993 ) 87 x.  n.  wang , phys . \n * 81 * ( 1998 ) 2655 m.  m.  aggarwal et al . \n * 83 * ( 1999 ) 926 u.  a.  wiedemann and u.  heinz , phys . \n * c56 * ( 1997 ) 3265 s.  vrs , to be published in proceedings of quark matter 99 h.  appelshuser et al . , eur . \n .  j.  * c2 * ( 1998 ) 661 t.  peitzmann , to be published in proceedings of quark matter 99 \n d.  h.  rischke , nucl . \n * a610 * ( 1996 ) 88c h.  schlagheck , to be published in proceedings of quark matter 99 j.  barrette et al . , phys . \n 73 * ( 1994 ) 2532 a.  jahns et al . \n * 72 * ( 1994 ) 3464 s. nishimura , these proceedings . \n appelshuser et al . , phys . \n * 80 * ( 1998 ) 4136", "StartTimeOffset": 2686481808420, "RequestID": "37022ba392030ce23391dca4b72924185368db0b", "TotalTokens": 1724}
{"ContextTokens": 2040, "GeneratedTokens": 57, "SynthesizedBody": "with the advent of the lhc era it was decided to completely rewrite the general purpose event generator herwig @xcite in c++ under the name , based on the package @xcite . \n the goal is not only to provide a simple replacement of herwig but to incorporate physics improvements as well @xcite . from 2001 until now \n has been continuously developed and extended@xcite . \n the current version is 2.2.1 , cf . \n the physics simulation of the current version is more sophisticated than the one of fortran herwig in many respects . in this report \n we will briefly summarize the status of the different aspects of the simulation . \n these are the hard matrix elements available , initial and final state parton showers , the hadronization , hadronic decays and the underlying event . \n we conclude with an outlook to planned future improvements . \n the event generation begins with the hard scattering of incoming particles or partons in the case of hadronic collisions . \n we have included a relatively small number of hard matrix elements . \n these include @xmath0 annihilation to @xmath1 pairs or simply to @xmath2 bosons and deep inelastic scattering . \n in addition there is the higgsstrahlung process @xmath3 . for hadron \n hadron collisions we have the qcd @xmath4 processes including heavy quark production . for colourless \n final states we have the following matrix elements , @xmath5 we also provide matrix elements for processes with additional jets in the final state , like @xmath6 in addition , there are matrix elements for perturbative decays of the top quark , which will be simulated including spin correlations ( see below ) \n . there will be some more matrix elements added in future versions , e.g.  for @xmath7 . despite the rather small number of matrix elements \n , there is no real limitation to the processes that may be simulated with . in practice \n , one may use any matrix element generator to generate a standard event file @xcite which in turn can be read and processed by .    for processes with many legs in the final state \n we follow a different strategy . when the number of legs becomes large \n typically larger than 68 particles in the final state  it will be increasingly difficult to achieve an efficient event generation of the full matrix element . for these situations \n we have a generic framework to build up matrix elements for production and decays of particles in order to approximate any tree level matrix element as a simple production process with subsequent two or three body decays . \n this is a good approximation whenever the widths of the intermediate particles are small . \n the spin correlations among these particles can be restored with the algorithm described in @xcite . also finite width effects are taken into account @xcite . \n the full simulation of several processes of many models for physics beyond the standard model ( mssm , ued , randall  sunrum model ) is thus possible in @xcite . here \n , all necessary matrix elements for production and decay processes are constructed automatically from a model file . \n after the hard process has been generated , typically at a large scale @xmath8gev1tev , the coloured particles in the process radiate a large number of additional partons , predominantly gluons . as long as these are resolved by a hard scale of @xmath9gev \n this is simulated with a coherent branching algorithm , as outlined in @xcite which generalizes the original algorithm @xcite used in herwig . \n the main improvements with respect to the old algorithm are boost invariance along the jet axis , due to a covariant formulation , and the improved treatment of radiation off heavy quarks . \n we are using mass \n dependent splitting functions and a description of the kinematics that allows us to dynamically generate the dead  cone effect . \n in addition to initial and final state parton showers there are also parton showers in the decay of heavy particles , the top quark in our case .    when extrapolating to hard , wide \n angle emissions , the parton shower description is not sufficiently accurate in situations where observables depend on large transverse momenta in the process . in these cases we supply \n so  called hard matrix element corrections that describe the hardest parton emission , usually a hard gluon , with the full matrix element for the process that includes that extra parton . in order to consistently describe \n the whole phase space one has to apply soft matrix element corrections . \n matrix element corrections are available for drell  yan type processes , higgs production in @xmath10 fusion and @xmath0 annihilation to @xmath1pairs . \n in addition , we apply a matrix element correction in top \n quark decays @xcite .    from the point of view of perturbation \n theory , the hard matrix element correction is only one part of the next  to  leading order ( nlo ) correction to the born matrix element . \n the full nlo calculation also includes the virtual part with the same final state as the born approximation . \n when trying to match nlo calculations and parton shower algorithms systematically , we have to avoid double counting of the real emission contributions . \n two systematic approaches are being successfully discussed and applied in event generators : mc@nlo @xcite and the powheg approach @xcite . in \n we have included working examples of matching in both approaches . \n the mc@nlo method , adopted to is described in @xcite . whereas the powheg method has already been applied for several processes in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite and also for drell  yan production @xcite . \n parts of these implementations will become available in future releases . \n another viable possibility to improve the description of qcd radiation in the event generation is the matching to multiple tree \n level matrix elements , that describe the radiation of @xmath11 additional jets with respect to the born level . \n theoretically most consistent is the ckkw approach @xcite which has been studied in the context of an angular ordered parton shower in @xcite . \n the hadronization model in is the cluster hadronization model which has not been changed much from its predecessor in herwig . \n after the parton shower , all gluons are split nonperturbatively into @xmath1 pairs . \n then , following the colour history of the parton cascade , all colour triplet  antitriplet pairs are paired up in colourless clusters which still carry all flavour and momentum information of the original partons . while these are heavier than some threshold mass they will fission into lighter clusters until all clusters are sufficiently light . \n these light clusters will then decay into pairs of hadrons . \n the hadrons thus obtained are often heavy resonances that will eventually decay on timescales that are still irrelevant for the experiment . \n these hadronic decays have been largely rewritten and are modeled in much greater detail in . while in herwig they were often simply decayed according to the available phase space only , we now take into account more experimental information , like form factors , that allow for a realistic modeling of decay matrix elements @xcite . in a major effort , a large fraction of the decay channels described in the particle data book @xcite \n have been included into . \n the underlying event model of is a model for multiple hard partonic interactions , based on an eikonal model , similar to jimmy @xcite . \n in addition to the signal process there are a number of additional qcd scatters , including full parton showers , that contribute to the overall hadronic activity in the final state and eventually also give rise to a ( relatively soft ) jet substructure in the underlying event . \n the model has two important parameters , one parameter @xmath12 , describing the spatial density of partonic matter in the colliding protons . \n secondly , there is one cut off parameter @xmath13 that gives a lower bound on the differential cross section for qcd @xmath4 jet production . \n the model has been carefully tuned to tevatron data @xcite . \n further possible bounds on the model parameters have been studied in @xcite . \n an alternative modeling of the underlying event on the basis of the ua5 model @xcite is also available for historic reasons . \n currently , the multiple partonic interaction model is limited to hard scattering while a soft component is simply not present . for a realistic simulation of minimum bias events \n a soft component is , however , very important . \n an extension into the soft region , allowing us the simulation of minimum bias events is currently being studied and is likely to be included in the next release of . \n the latest version of is always available from hepforge :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

{"ContextTokens": 4059, "GeneratedTokens": 232, "SynthesizedBody": "nearly every work on image tagging to date has treated the tags that accompany an image as a bag - of - words with no inherent ordering , most especially works which use the nearest neighbor approach for tagging . some recent work @xcite , has shown that this bag - of - words assumption is actually not the reality . \n they show that if a user is asked to tag an image with a fixed set of tags multiple times , the order of the tags they choose tends to stay the same rather than random . \n more so , a recent design change on flickr  @xcite that reversed the users tag input ordering created a backlash from the community that caused flickr to revert back to the original design with the following apology : `` we thought it would be more intuitive for newest tags to appear at the top , so that when you add a tag and refresh , it s in the place you expect it . \n however , thanks to your points about meticulous tag ordering , we ve decided we should leave it as is . \n you should now see your tags in the correct order '' @xcite . \n these insights lead us to believe that tag ordering is inherently personal , and should be incorportated into tagging systems . hence \n , we propose a new model that seeks to exploit the history of a user s tag order to improve personalized image tagging . \n we also compare the same model which instead treats tag order as a global phenomenon , and show that indeed such a model underperforms the personalized ordering model significantly . \n there has been a lot of work in the area of automatic image tagging @xcite , much of which has treated tagging as more of a labelling problem , thereby implicitly imposing that tagging is a global task rather than a user - specific task . \n most notably the work by li et al . \n @xcite has tried to treat the tagging problem from the point of view of personalization by using a cross - entropy method to decide how to weight different image tagging functions for each user . \n there has been work seeking to tag based on object importance , but there the focus has been an explicitly categorical approach to importance by measuring properties of objects in the image ( eg , size , salience ) to estimate their relative importances @xcite . these object - property based approaches to importance typically ignore particular user preferences , and treat importance as a global phenomenon @xcite . \n nearest neighbor approaches are usually more common than their explicit classification counterparts in tagging because one does not have to learn how to recognize or detect specific objects in the image , which is not scalable , nor are all concepts one would like to describe an image visual @xcite . in many cases , an initial set of tags for a given query image is provided and the aim is to refine or propagate these tags through some , similarity measure ( image , user , or tag co - similarity ) @xcite . whereas their goal is to create global tags from other tags , our goal is to find the words most suitable to describe an image for specific individuals . \n there has also been some work that looks at the recommendation perspective @xcite , with  @xcite having an explicit goal of personalized tagging .    in this work \n , we employ the nearest neighbor approach to tagging because we would like to use a relatively large tagging vocabulary , which introduces scalability issues with the explicit / classification approaches , and we also do not want to restrict our vocabulary to words that describe concrete visual concepts . \n instead we would like to have more abstract tags because we are primarily interested in personalized tagging . finally , we also do not want to consider tag importances solely on a global scale , but per user preference . \n in this section we discuss our model for the tagging behavior of users and derive an objective function based on the model of tagging behavior . \n we then discuss a practical representation of this model and how it relates to other known problems . \n the main assumption , following the claims from  @xcite , is that given an image , the order that users present tags to an online tagging system , say flickr @xcite , implies an underlying preference order for those tags . for example , if a user presents the tags @xmath0 in that order , it would imply that for that image , the user found it more preferable ( or important ) to mention @xmath1 before @xmath2 , @xmath1 before @xmath3 , and @xmath2 before @xmath3 . \n our main idea is that with enough observed instances of pairs of tags mentioned together by a particular user , we can estimate these implicit biases , and in turn improve the task of automatic image tagging for new images on a personal level . \n our main tagging goal is to output a list of tags for an image in order of preference for the target user . to that end , \n given a set of pairwise tag - preferences ( as probabilities ) for a given user and a query image , we want to find the ordering of candidate tags ( generated by some baseline tag generator ) , for that query image , that is maximal . \n details are provided in the supplementary appendix .      for the objective described above , \n we represent the tag - preferences as probabilities . \n that is , @xmath4 is the strength of preference for tag @xmath5 over tag @xmath6 . \n we estimate this quantity as the number of times @xmath5 occurs before @xmath6 , divided by the number of times they occur together , regardless of order . \n this allows for anti - symmetry : @xmath7 . in this representation \n , @xmath8 implies there is no preference . \n also note the we only need to keep track of the strongest preference ( either @xmath4 , or @xmath9 , but not both ) .      to maximize our tagging objective \n , we came up with a modified version of the topological sort algorithm . \n since we can represent the preferences as directed edges with weighs as the probabilities , we can use topological sort  @xcite to produce an ordering that is faithful to these preferences .    to deal with cycles , which are assumed not to exist for the topological sort algorithm to work , \n when we find a cycle , we delete the edge of least strength . under certain mild conditions , \n this is guaranteed to still be optimal . \n also , since there could be multiple correct topological sort orderings , in order to break ties , we use a baseline ordering of the candidate tags ( gotten from the baseline tag generator as mentioned in section [ model : objective ] ) , as we run the modified topological sort algorithm , whenever there is an ambiguous ordering . \n details and proofs of claims made here are provided in the appendix . \n in this section , we will discuss how we go about verifying our model , from the choice of the dataset , choice of baseline and choice of evaluation metric .      for this work we chose to work with the nus - wide dataset @xcite . \n the nus - wide dataset is a subset of 269,648 images from flickr . for each image in the dataset , we know , via the flickr api , the corresponding user that uploaded that image , and the sequence of tags that user chose to annotate the image with . since we are particularly concerned about personalization , we only select images from this database which satisfy the following criteria : the users who uploaded the image must have at least 6 images in this dataset , similar to the setting in @xcite . \n this results in about 91,400 images from 5000 users . \n we split this dataset into a training and test partition , by randomly assigning half of each users images to the training , and half to the test set . for each image \n we only retain the tags that occurred frequently enough across the dataset , in order to make some sort of meaningful inference on the tags . in this work \n , we made the design choice of working with tags that occurred at least 50 times in the dataset . \n this results in a vocabulary of @xmath10 unique tags .      as we mentioned in section \n [ sec : related ] , we go the nearest neighbor route for the task of image tagging . to that end our image features are a 500-d bag of words based on sift descriptors @xcite , and we use the euclidean distance between feature vectors to encode the notion of closeness or similarity .      we take as our baseline the work of li et al . \n @xcite , which we considered the reproducable state of the art for _ personalized _ image tagging and evaluated their claims on the nus - wide dataset as well . \n their main idea is that for a given tag , each user has 2 weighting variables , one weighting how much to rank that tag according to its frequency independent of visual content , and the other how much to rank the frequency of the tag according to its frequency in visually similar images . \n we re - implemented their method using the two tagging functions described in their paper ( _ personalpreference _ \n @xcite function and _ _ \n visual__@xcite function ) . for the visual features , \n we also use the 500-d bag of words based on sift descriptors for consistency .    for a given image query @xmath11 , we define the ordered set of tags returned by the baseline method as @xmath12 . \n since our assumption is that the order that a user tags an image important for automatic tagging , our metric should take the groundtruth user order into account . \n more concretely , given an ordered set of tags,@xmath13 , we define the relevance of each tag according to it s reciprocal rank in the ordered set : @xmath14 tags not in the groundtruth ordered set have zero relevance . \n more common metrics , such as precision , recall , and average precision , assume that all tags are equally relevant , so we do not utilize these metrics in this paper . \n instead we use the more appropriate _ normalized discounted cumulative gain _ ( ndcg ) , a common metric used in evaluating search engine results . for an ordered set @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 , we define the dcg with respect to the ground - truth as :    @xmath17    this metric is called _ discounted _ because the later we include a tag in our ranking , the less gain we get from it ( i.e. its relevance is discounted by the inverse of the log of its position in the ranking , not the groundtruth ) . \n note that this metric is maximal when the most relevant items are listed first . \n we also define for a given ranked list , @xmath18 , its ideal ranking @xmath19 , such that for @xmath20 , if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 in the groundtruth ( i.e. , the ideal ranking is ranked from most relevant to least ) . \n then the normalized dcg is defined as : @xmath23    note that the ndcg is maximal ( equal to 1 ) when @xmath24 . \n we can also parameterize the dcg , and ndcg to calculate the @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n that is , calculate the metrics evaluated only for the first @xmath27 entries of the ranked lists . \n let @xmath28 $ ] be the first k entries of @xmath18 , then : @xmath29)}{dcg(\\bar{\\sigma}(t)[:k])}\\ ] ] \n given a query image @xmath11 from the test set , we find the @xmath30 nearest neighbors ( visual similarity ) from the training set , and given some initial rank @xmath31 on the set of tags used to describe these @xmath30 visually similar images , we find optimal ranking , @xmath32 , as described in section  [ model : objective ] , using the preference probabilities derived from the training set according to section  [ model : parameter_estimation ] . \n we set the baseline order of candidate tags as @xmath33 , which is the result of our baseline ( and the current state - of - art for personalization ) given the query @xmath11 , from section [ exp : baseline ] .      in evaluating our approach \n , we made a few design decisions which are parameters in our model . \n the first is the minimum number of times tags @xmath5 and @xmath6 occur together , which we denote as @xmath3 . \n if any pair of tags do nt co - occur at least @xmath3 times , we do not have a high confidence in the order bias that we estimate from the occurrences because of noise and overfitting . the second which we denote as @xmath34 is the minimum strength factor between a pair of tags . \n that is , we ensure that , @xmath35 , for @xmath4 to be an edge to be considered by the prioritizedtoposort . \n the purpose of these parameters is to control for noise and overfitting to insufficient data .      in this section , \n we describe the tests with which we evaluate our method . for the evaluation metrics discussed in section [ exp : \n metrics ] , we run evaluations under the following settings :    * number of visually similar neighbors : @xmath36 * minimum co - occurrence , c : @xmath37 * minimum strength factor , r : @xmath37    we compare our performance ( personalized pairwise preference ) , to the state - of - art  @xcite , and also to global pairwise preferences . \n global pairwise preferences is similar to what we have proposed so far in this paper with the exception of ignoring the users , so the images are treated as though they all come from the `` average user '' . \n we provide evaluation for our metrics on entire ranks , and also the top @xmath27 tags in the rank for @xmath38 . \n we show the mean performance averaged both over each image ( included in the appendix ) , and also average across its mean performance per user since we are interested in personalization . \n we also calculate the number of times our approach produces better rankings ( in terms of ndcg ) , than the baseline , and the number of times a user prefers our approach on average over the baseline . \n we report these numbers in table [ tab : duels ] . \n .average ndcg percentage improvement over the baseline using pairwise personal preferences [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from  [ fig : usr_ndcg_all ] and [ fig : ndcg_k_usr ] , we notice that our algorithm which personalizes via pairwise tag preferences ( red bar / line ) always outperforms the state - of - the - art baseline @xcite ( blue bar / line ) . \n [ fig : usr_ndcg_all ] shows this increase in performance for all parameters @xmath34 ( the minimum strength factor described in section [ res : design_dec ] ) , and @xmath3 ( the minimum number of co - occurrences ) , that we considered . \n we notice that holding @xmath3 constant as the parameter @xmath34 increases , the performance of our personalization method decreases . \n this is likely due to a lack of enough data per user so that very few tag pairs can meet our relatively aggressive over - fitting criteria . \n the same trend is noticed when we hold @xmath34 constant and increase @xmath3 . \n we also evaluate the performance of the global ( or `` average user '' , yellow bar / line ) , pairwise preferences , and we see that enforcing pairwise orders based on a global / average notion of preference actually degrades the performance . except for @xmath39 , the @xmath40 metric for the global preferences is worse than the baseline . \n this might be because , users tend to use more global / popular tags in the beginning of their ranked lists , so that we are actually able to learn with enough data , certain global biases among the popular tags . \n beyond that , because users tag differently , enforcing a global preference is actually counterproductive . \n we also observe the reverse trend as we fix @xmath3 and vary @xmath34 ( and vice - versa ) to that of the personal preferences . \n this is because to estimate global preferences we need to observe a lot more data than for a single user , and so estimating for pairs without a lot of co - occurrences will invariably lead to over - fitting . \n [ fig : ndcg_k_usr ] , shows the @xmath40 as @xmath41 varies under the best choices of parameters @xmath34 and @xmath3 , for both the global and personal preferences . \n the best choices for the global were , @xmath42 , and for the personal , @xmath43 . \n we see , averaging over both users and images(included in the appendix ) , that the baseline outperforms the global ( except at @xmath39 ) , and the personal outperforms the baseline . \n these observations imply that picking lower parameters is usually better for the personal preferences , while higher values of @xmath34 and @xmath3 are necessary for the global preferences to be useful . \n table [ tab : avg_stats ] shows that our method on average is @xmath44 better than the baseline method , and this improvement goes up to about @xmath45 , for @xmath46 , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : ndcg_k_usr ] . \n the above observations are true for both the average across all the images in our test set , and across all the users mean @xmath47 . \n this shows that the gains we get are relatively consistent for each user . \n this combined with the fact that the global pairwise preferences under - perform , imply that true personal pairwise preferences indeed exist , can be estimated , and can be used to improve the performance of automatic image tagging . \n we include more detailed plots in the supplemntary appendix . \n in this work we proposed a new measurement of tag preferences , and demonstrated that there is indeed a tag - order bias , that is , when a user mentions tag @xmath5 before tag @xmath6 , in a list of tags for a given image , the user is implying that he prefers , or considers @xmath5 to be of greater importance than @xmath6 . \n we showed that this bias can be learned from historical data using the maximum likelihood estimate based on a pair s co - occurrence , and subsequently showed that such information can be exploited to improve the performance of current state - of - art automated image tagging systems . \n we also defined a new tagging objective function that assumes the inherent pairwise bias between tags , and provided an algorithm which optimizes the new objective ( under some mild conditions ) , and helped verify our claims and assumptions . \n this leads us to conclude that although there are many visual factors that may affect what tags a user will provide for an image , it is useful to characterize instead ( or rather in conjunction ) the users tagging habits to learn what tags are of more importance to the users , whether they are visually motivated or not , and automatic tagging systems should employ this technique to improve their overall performance . \n we believe that there are several ways that this work could be extended or extend other works . \n one direction we see is working on algorithms that provide tight guarantees for solving our tagging objective , or even solves it optimally , even in the presence of dependent cycles . \n another direction comes from the observation that most tag pairs never occur , but it may be possible to learn a function that maps a pair of tags to a real number indicating the direction and strength of the preference \n . it would also be interesting to see how the assumptions made in this paper can be used to extend the works on learning for personalized ranking @xcite . \n we think it would also be interesting to explore the cognitive dimensions that drive tag ordering , and how these cognitive dimensions contribute to the tagging choices both independently and collectively .", "StartTimeOffset": 2695478452428, "RequestID": "fcf60fb404318d47381daed49fab3f9512c55c96", "TotalTokens": 4291}

[ line ] . \n this line can be considered as a set of single cells , each one composed of a varactor diode ( nte 618 ) and an inductor @xmath2  @xmath3h , coupled through inductors @xmath4  @xmath3h . each unit cell or node \n is driven via a resistor , @xmath5  k@xmath6 , by a sinusoidal voltage source @xmath7 with amplitude @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . in experiments a set of 32 elements have been used , with a periodic ring structure ( the last element is connected to the first one ) , and measurements of voltages @xmath10 have been recorded . \n related to the voltage source , we have considered amplitudes from @xmath11  v to @xmath12  v and frequencies from @xmath13  khz to @xmath14  khz .        ) and numerical approximation thereof ( continuous line ) corresponding to @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( linear and semi  log plots ) for the nonlinear varactor . ]    in order to propose a set of equations to characterize the electrical line , we have used circuit theory and kirchhoff s rules ; the main challenge has been to describe appropriately each element . in general , resistance and inductors \n are inherently imperfect impedance components , i.e. , they have series and parallel , reactive , capacitive and resistive elements . moreover , due to the commercial nature of the elements , manufactured components are subject to tolerance intervals , and the resultant small spatial inhomogeneity introduces some additional uncertainty . \n we have quantified the spatial inhomogeneity by separately measuring all lattice components . \n the diode capacitance was found to vary by 0.3 percent ( standard deviation ) , whereas the inductors both exhibited a 0.5 percent variation . \n additional factors that may contribute slightly to inhomogeneities are wire inductances as well as load and contact resistances . \n the varactors ( diodes ) we use are typically intended for am receiver electronics and tuning applications . as described later \n , we characterize this lattice element in more detail , since it is the source of the nonlinearity in the lattice .    as a guiding principle \n , we are aiming to construct a model which is as simple as possible , with a limited number of parameters whose values are experimentally supported , but one which is still able to reproduce the main phenomenon , namely nonlinear localization and the formation of discrete breathers . with this balance in mind , we proceed as follows .    in the range of frequencies \n studied it is a good approximation to describe the load resistance as a simple resistor , neglecting any capacitive or inductive contribution . \n also , we have performed experimental measures of the varactor characteristics . \n this experimental data shows that it can be modeled as a nonlinear resistance in parallel with a nonlinear capacitance , where the nonlinear current @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18  v@xmath19 and @xmath20 a ( we consider negative voltage when the varactor is in direct polarization ) , and its capacitance as @xmath21    c_0 e^{-\\alpha v } & \\mbox{if } \\quad v > v_{c } , \\end{matrix } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23  pf , @xmath24  v@xmath19 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( the capacitance and its first derivative are continuous in @xmath27 ) , @xmath28  nf and @xmath29  v. in fig .

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     more detailed experimental results are shown in fig . \n [ profiles ] where we depict peak profiles at two different driver voltages . \n the profiles were taken at the times of largest peak voltage amplitude and lowest peak voltage amplitude . for @xmath43v ( \n left column of panels ) we see that , as the frequency is raised from below , we cross from the 1-peak region through the 2-peak region and into the 3-peak region . for the @xmath44  v case ( right column of panels ) \n the same sequence can be observed when scanning in one frequency direction . in order to illustrate both the hysteresis and the overlap between @xmath0-peak regions , we depict in the figure ( panels ( e ) and ( f ) ) a situation where the 2-peak solution occurs at a higher frequency than the 3-peaked one . \n the reason is that in fig . \n [ profiles](f ) , the 3-peak solution was obtained at higher frequencies and then adiabatically extended to lower ones , whereas in fig . \n [ profiles](e ) the 2-peak solution was obtained starting from the 1-peak region . \n we show the eventual location of peaks in the breather pattern ( i.e. after the driver has been on for a long time ) . however , it is important to mention that the exact location where the peaks eventually settle is sensitive to slight impurities in the lattice . \n we have noticed that when we turn on the voltage source , at first we can observe a more sinusoidal pattern ( corresponding to the most modulationally unstable @xmath45-value ) , but as the pattern reaches higher energy and becomes more nonlinear , the peaks may shift and adjust themselves in the lattice . \n as it can be observed , peaks are not perfectly equispaced in the lattice . \n this is obviously due to the inhomogeneities and noise present in the experiment .    for the numerical results depicted in fig . \n [ profiles ] we used a set of initials conditions based on the experimental data and determined the stationary state by letting the numerical profiles to settle to a steady state . for the cases corresponding to @xmath43 \n v and @xmath44  v , adding a small frequency offset @xmath46  khz , we observe , in general , a good agreement between numerics and experimental data . \n the mismatch between experiments and theory , in particular the intersite distance peaks , can be attributed to the above mentioned factors . \n furthermore , to reproduce precisely the experimental peak voltage is extremely difficult because it corresponds to the voltage at resonance and , therefore , even very small parameter changes can create large differences in the maximum amplitudes . \n nevertheless , the quantitative agreement appears fairly good , especially for the @xmath44  v case . \n in this paper we have formulated a prototypical model that is able to describe the formation of nonlinear intrinsic localized modes ( or discrete breathers ) in an experimental electric line . \n this has been derived based on a combination of the fairly accurate characterization of a single element within the lattice ( including its nonlinear resonance curves and hysteretic behavior ) and fundamental circuit theory in order to properly couple the elements . \n comparison between theory and experiments shows very good qualitative and even good quantitative agreement between the two . \n we characterized the regions of existence and stability of @xmath0-peaked breathers for @xmath1 and illustrated how transitions of the coherent waveforms of one kind to those of another kind take place , rationalizing them on the basis of stability properties and their corresponding floquet spectra . \n we also showed that the precise number of peaks and their location in the lattice is fairly sensitive to initial conditions , a feature also generally observed in the experiments where the potential for states with different numbers of peaks similarly manifests . \n naturally , many directions of potential future research stem from the fundamental modeling and computation basis explored in the present manuscript . on the one hand , it would be very interesting to attempt to understand the stability properties of the different breather states from a more mathematical perspective , although this may admittedly prove a fairly difficult task . \n on the other hand , from the modeling and computation perspective in conjunction with experimental progress , the present work paves the way for potentially augmenting these systems into higher dimensional setups and attempting to realize discrete soliton as well as more complex discrete vortex states therein  @xcite . \n such studies will be deferred to future publications . \n f.p . and j.c . \n acknowledges sponsorship by the spanish micinn under grant no . \n fis2008 -

{"ContextTokens": 1888, "GeneratedTokens": 104, "SynthesizedBody": "the concept of an optical light shining through the wall ( lsw ) experiment has been adapted to microwaves as described in @xcite . a block diagram of the setup at cern as it has been used to search for axion like particles ( alps ) with microwaves is shown in fig . \n [ fig : ovrblock ] , it consists of two identical microwave cavities with a loaded quality factor of @xmath0 and a spacing between them of less than 20  mm . \n one serves as alp emitter and is excited by 50  w of rf power on its resonant frequency @xmath1  ghz . \n it develops a strong electromagnetic ( em ) field , corresponding to a large number of microwave photons @xmath2 . \n these can convert to alps by the primakoff effect @xcite . \n alps do not interact with matter and propagate towards the detection cavity , which is connected to a very sensitive microwave receiver . \n the reciprocal conversion process transforms alps back to microwave photons , which can be observed as an excitation of the seemingly empty and well shielded detection cavity . \n since there is no energy loss associated with the alp conversion process , the signal from the detection cavity would be observable at exactly the frequency @xmath3 , making a narrowband receiving concept feasible . \n in this section , we give an overview of the critical engineering challenges , which were encountered during the realization of the microwave based lsw experiment :    electromagnetic shielding : :    shielding is required around the detecting cavity and the microwave    receiver to eliminate ambient electromagnetic interference ( emi ) and    to mitigate coupling to the emitting cavity by electromagnetic    leakage . \n this would generate false positive results , as a signal    originating from leakage can not be discriminated against an alp    signal . within 2 cm , the field strength must be reduced by at least a    factor of @xmath4 to obtain    meaningful results and avoid degradation of alp sensitivity . \n most    microwave components used in the setup like sma connectors or    semi - rigid coaxial cables provide less than 120 db of shielding ,    making an external shielding enclosure and strategic use of optical    fibres for signal transmission necessary . with the current setup , over    300 \n db shielding effectiveness has been achieved @xcite . \n detection of weak signals : :    the smallest detectable signal power during the alps run in june 2013    is    @xmath5  dbm  @xmath6 \n w  @xmath7  photons / s .    as the experiment is carried out at room temperature , the thermal    noise * density * is @xmath8  dbm / hz . a very    narrow band filter can be implemented to detect the sinusoidal signal    within the background noise . \n it is realized by a discrete fourier    transformation over the entire recorded time trace of length    @xmath9  h. each resulting spectral bin will respond to    signals within its resolution bandwidth , given by    @xmath10 . as noise power scales    linearly with resolution bandwidth and \n signal power stays constant , we    achieve a signal to noise ratio improvement proportional to    measurement time . to keep the filter on the right center frequency \n , a    global 10  mhz reference clock is used to phase lock all oscillators    involved in the downmixing chain . \n this detection method has been    successfully demonstrated with resolution bandwidths down to    10  @xmath11hz in @xcite . keeping the cavities on tune \n : :    for an exclusion result , it is necessary to prove that the detector is    working and that a potential alp signal could not have been concealed . \n detection sensitivity will be limited if the resonant frequency of any    of the cavities does not equal the system frequency    @xmath12 within its 3  db bandwidth . \n the resonant    frequency of the cavities can drift due to thermal expansion . for the    emitting cavity , \n the reflected rf power was monitored to ensure it is    on resonance during the whole measurement run . for the detecting    cavity , \n its thermal noise density was measured before and after the    recording of experimental data , indicating its resonant frequency . \n compatibility with magnetic fields : :    as the shielding enclosure and the cavities have to be placed in a    strong magnetic field for alp measurements , they need to be    constructed from non - ferromagnetic materials like aluminium or brass . \n this is to prevent field distortion and to avoid strong attractive    forces during insertion of the setup into the magnet . \n some electronic    components like the low noise amplifier and the analog optical    transmitter need to be placed as close as possible to the detection    cavity . \n therefore special precautions had to be taken to ensure they    operate reliably within the magnetic field . \n for example , ferrite or    iron cored inductors or transformers had to be avoided as the material    saturates and changes its magnetic properties in strong magnetic    fields . \n r0.5 [ fig : exclsignal ]        the most sensitive measurement run for alps has been carried out in june 2013 in cooperation with the brain & behaviour laboratory of geneva university . \n we were able to operate the setup within the bore of a superconducting magnet , which is part of an mri scanner . \n it provides a solenoid - like field of @xmath13  t. over the course of one weekend , 2  x  10  h of experimental data were recorded . as no alps were detected , the corresponding exclusion limits in comparison to other experiments are shown in fig .  2 . \n for diagnostic purposes , a sinusoidal signal of known frequency is emitted within the shielding enclosure . \n this `` test tone '' of relatively low and constant power ( @xmath14  dbm ) couples from a @xmath15 antenna to the detection cavity and to the components of the receiver frontend . by identifying the signal in the recorded spectrum , \n we demonstrate that the entire signal processing chain was operational during the measurement . \n this also allows to evaluate unwanted frequency offsets , frequency drifts , or phase noise by comparing shape and position of the measured signal peak to the expected one . \n furthermore , as long as the test tone signal is observed with constant power during the measurement run , it qualifies that the em shielding performance has not degraded . \n figure  3 shows the resulting power spectrum from the measurement run . \n the test tone signal is visible as a single peak , clearly above the noise floor , spanning only one single bin . \n a frequency window ( shaded green ) has been defined with a width of @xmath16 , around the frequency where an alp signal would be expected . \n the peaks within this window do not exceed the detection threshold of @xmath17  w , allowing us to set an exclusion limit for alps .    in order to define the detection threshold , the histogram of @xmath18 frequency bins  containing exclusively spectral background noise \n was evaluated . \n @xmath19 was set such , that only in 1% of all measurement runs , a single peak signal above the detection threshold would appear within the wisp window , resulting in a false positive outcome of the experiment . \n [ fig : resultspect ]    , no alp signal is visible above the detection threshold.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] \n profiting from the high mobility and ruggedness of a microwave based lsw experiment ( compared to optical setups ) , we were able to successfully deploy and operate the apparatus within a 3  t mri magnet . \n over the course of one weekend sufficient experimental data was recorded to achieve comparable sensitivity to first generation optical lsw experiments ( e.g. , alps-1 at desy ) . \n sensitivity could be further enhanced with a stronger magnet . \n there is a recent trend towards 7  t mri systems in medical research , which might provide us an opportunity for a follow up alps measurement . \n furthermore , sensitivity can be enhanced with larger and thus lower frequency cavities . \n one might think of a lsw setup consisting of 200  mhz sps standing wave cavities @xcite within the 3  t m1 magnet @xcite at cern . + \n special thanks to s.  w.  rieger and the brain & behaviour laboratory of geneva university , for making the mri magnet accessible to us on weekends . \n the authors would like to thank r.  jones , e.  jensen and the be department management for encouragement and support . \n thanks to the organizers of the patras workshop for a very enjoyable and inspiring conference . supported by the wolfgang -

{"ContextTokens": 3347, "GeneratedTokens": 86, "SynthesizedBody": "the wigner function @xcite , which was introduced in 1932 , is up to now the most commonly used phase space quasi - distribution representation of physical systems in momentum and position representations . \n this function fully characterizes the quantum state and gives basic physical intuition about the investigated state \n . moreover , there are some simple physical properties that make this function unique @xcite . \n nevertheless , over the years many others quasi - distributions have been introduced and studied . especially well - known are functions from the glauber and cahill s - parameterized class of distributions @xcite containing the wigner function , the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-representation @xcite , and the husimi or the @xmath1-representation @xcite .    for many systems the wigner function is well known and has been carefully studied , but there are some elementary quantum mechanical states , for which this phase space representation is not known . \n an example of such system is the hydrogen atom . \n no exact analytical formula of the wigner function is known even for the 1s state . in the literature \n one can find a limited number of papers devoted to this subject @xcite , and all the published results have been achieved using methods of approximation . \n it is the purpose of this short communication to present an analytical phase space representation of the hydrogen atom using a lesser - known kirkwood  rihaczek ( k - r ) distribution function @xcite . \n its form allows us to obtain analytical results , and as we have shown in @xcite this distribution , like the wigner function , fully characterizes a quantum state . \n in general , the problem of defining a joint probability function in phase space lies in the operator ordering . \n because different orderings of position @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 operators are not equivalent , the association of the quantum operator with classical functions has no unique solution . \n the association of classical phase space functions @xmath4 with quantum operators is shown by : @xmath5 the fourier decomposition of the dirac delta functions makes it possible to rewrite the above equation in the form @xmath6 for every operator ordering there exists a corresponding probability quasi - distribution in phase space . \n the wigner distribution function is obtained by taking a quantum average of the above formula with the respect to the wigner - weyl ordering : @xmath7 in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 operators are put in the same exponent .    the k \n r distribution function corresponds to an ordering called the anti - standard ordering , that is obtained by putting all @xmath10 operators on the left of all @xmath11 operators : @xmath12 the complex conjugation of the k \n r function corresponds to the standard ordering ( all operators @xmath11 are on the left followed by @xmath9 operators ) , and the real part of the k \n r distribution function is obtained by a symmetric superposition of the anti - standard and the standard ordering : @xmath13 . \n obviously , the wigner - weyl ordering and the anti - standard ordering are not equivalent , so they lead to different quasi - distributions . but both of these orderings are intuitive and simple ones , and appropriate phase space distribution functions have the same marginal properties . \n the definition of the famous wigner quasi - distribution function was firstly presented as : @xmath14 although for most one dimensional systems formula ( [ zwig ] ) allows to evaluate the wigner function relatively easily , in three dimensions this problem is more complicated . \n integrals become quite cumbersome and sometimes impossible to handle analytically . as we have mentioned before , an analytical formula for the wigner function \n is not known even for 1s state of hydrogen atom . \n that is why , in order to investigate the hydrogen atom in phase space we shall use the k \n r distribution . \n this function was introduced by kirkwood @xcite just one year after wigner introduced his function . \n then , in 1968 , the same function was rediscovered by rihaczek @xcite in the context of signal time - frequency distributions and is known by his name in signal transmitting theory . \n the definition of the k \n r function in terms of anti - standard ordering has a simple form : @xmath15 elsewhere @xcite we have presented an extensive analysis of the k  r distribution and its comparison with the wigner distribution function . here \n we will only mention the main properties of the k  r function . \n similar to the wigner function , the k - r distribution has the correct marginal properties : @xmath16 hydrogen atom in phase space ----------------------------    the definition of the k - r distribution ( [ zrih ] ) allows one to evaluate analytical formulas of this distribution for many complicated quantum mechanical states , for which the analytical expression of the wigner function is not accessible .    in the following \n we will present analytical results obtained for states of the hydrogen atom . \n the wave functions of a non - relativistic hydrogen atom are well known , both in position and momentum representation . \n the schrdinger equation with coulomb potential can be separated in the spherical polar coordinates ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . \n the solutions of angular part of the equation are given by the spherical harmonics @xmath17 , and of the radial part can be expressed in terms of laguerre functions @xmath18 ( in the position representation ) : @xmath19^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left(\\frac{2 z}{n}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\ , e^{-\\frac{z r}{n } } \\left(\\frac{2 z r}{n}\\right)^l l^{2l+1}_{n+l}\\left(\\frac{2 \n z r}{n}\\right ) , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] or gegenbauer functions @xmath20 ( in the momentum representation ) : @xmath21^{\\frac{1}{2 } } n^2\\ , 2^{2(l+1)}\\ , l!\\ , \\frac{n^l p^l}{(n^2 p^2 + 1)^{l+2}}\\ , c^{l+1}_{n - l-1 } \\left(\\frac{n^2 p^2 - 1}{n^2 p^2 + 1 } \\right ) . \\label{geg}\\ ] ] as usual , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 denote principal , orbital , and magnetic quantum numbers , respectively .    substituting the expressions ( [ lag ] , [ geg ] ) into the definition of the k - r distribution eq . \n ( [ zrih ] ) , and inserting the angular relation , we obtain the general formulas for k - r functions of the hydrogen atom states . in the next section \n we shall present graphical results obtained for selected hydrogen quantum numbers . \n it is worth noting that the absolute square of the k - r function : @xmath25 ) . \n thus , one can treat it as the cornerstone of the phase space analysis of physical systems . \n figures 1 to 5 present phase space k - r representation of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 states of the hydrogen atom . \n let us note that for a 3-dimensional systems the k \n r distribution is a function of 6 variables @xmath31 , so a graphical phase space representation can only present selected cross - sections . \n we have decided to use the following method to represent the hydrogen atom in phase space : all the figures labelled by ( a ) , ( b ) ( later called fig . \n x.a , x.b ) are auxiliary ones \n they present hydrogen atom wave functions in position and momentum representation and the arrows depicted on those figures show the directions chosen for the cross - sections . \n the corresponding cross - sections of the k - r phase space functions are plotted in figures labelled by ( c ) and ( d ) ( fig . \n x.c , x.d ) . \n all the figures are organized as follows : fig x.a shows cross - section @xmath32 of the absolute square of hydrogen atom wave function in the position representation , i.e. @xmath33 which is the probability density of finding an electron at point @xmath34 ( and which does not depend on the value of @xmath35 ) . \n x.b shows cross - section @xmath36 of the absolute square of the same wave function in the momentum representation , i.e. @xmath37 which is the probability density of finding an electron with momentum @xmath38 ( and here again , a cross - section does not depend on the value of @xmath39 ) . \n the arrows depicted on the fig . \n x.a , x.b show the directions chosen for the cross - sections of the corresponding k - r phase space functions that are presented in fig . \n x.c , where the real part of the k  r distribution and appropriate contour plot are shown , and in fig x.d , where the absolute value of this k  r distribution and its contour plot are plotted . \n let us first study the k - r function of the @xmath40 state . \n well - known solutions of the radial part of the schrdinger equation are given by , in atomic unit : @xmath41 fig . \n 1.a shows spatial probability density @xmath42 of finding an electron at certain point , and fig . \n 1.b shows momentum probability density @xmath43 of finding an electron with definite momentum . \n note , that those are not radial distributions and they have nonzero values at @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the wave functions were not multiplied by @xmath46 or @xmath47 factors . \n the k - r distribution of @xmath26 state is given by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 fig . \n 1.c shows the real part of eq . \n ( [ s1 ] ) , @xmath53 , multiplied by @xmath54 : @xmath55.\\ ] ] the cross - section is chosen in the directions depicted by arrows in fig . \n 1.a , 1.b . \n next we have displayed its contour plot . \n the absolute value of eq . \n ( [ s1 ] ) multiplied by @xmath54 is : @xmath56\\ ] ] and its contour plot is presented in fig 1.d . in this case , \n @xmath57 and @xmath58 look quite similar mainly because the wave function both in position and momentum representation decreases rapidly with the increase of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , and the oscillating @xmath59-like structure characteristic for the real part of k - r distribution is not clearly seen on the scale used to make these figures . \n these oscillations are merely marked in the contour plot of @xmath53 by dashed lines which correspond to @xmath60 . \n next we shall examine the k \n r distribution of 2s and 2p states . \n solutions of the radial part of the schrdinger equation in momentum representation are given by : @xmath61 thus , the corresponding k \n r distribution are of the form : @xmath62 where @xmath49 is defined by eq . \n ( [ q ] ) . \n the real part of eq . \n ( [ s2 ] ) and appropriate contour plot are shown in fig . 2.c and the real part of eq . \n ( [ p2 ] ) in fig . \n 3.c . the absolute value of eqs . \n ( [ s2],[p2 ] ) and their contour plots are presented in fig . \n 2.d and fig . \n 3.d , respectively . the plot presented in fig . \n 3.d has one maximum at @xmath63 the location of which does not depend on variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath39 chosen for the cross section . \n this result is in perfect agreement with what we expect for the state which has quantum numbers @xmath22 , @xmath23 satisfying the condition @xmath67 . in fig . \n 3.c , where the real part of the k \n r distribution is presented , we see the additional minimum . it is due to @xmath59-like oscillations of the real part of the k  r distribution . \n actually , there is an infinite number of alternate maxima and minima but their amplitude decreases rapidly and only two are seen on this scale . \n dashed lines depicted on this ( and every other contour - plot ) denote @xmath68 . according to the results of fig . \n 2.d the absolute value of the k \n r distribution for the @xmath27 state also has quite a simple form : we notice one global and three local maxima on this cross section . fig . \n 2.c , where the real part of the same function is presented , is much more complicated when we look at it close up ( see contour plot ) : extrema are localized on lines where @xmath59 achieves its extremal value , but on this regular structure is another one  the wave function dependence on @xmath50 and @xmath51 that is responsible for the appearance of additional zeros and sign  changes of the plotted figure . \n finally we shall present an instructive example of a rydberg state . \n figure [ f4 ] shows the k - r distribution for a state with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . \n the real part of the k \n r distribution is shown in fig . \n [ f4].c , and the absolute value is shown in fig . \n [ f4].d . just as one would expect \n there is one peak in the absolute value plot and similar , but modified by @xmath59 , structure in the real part of the plot . comparing the figures with that shown in fig . \n [ f3].c - d we notice similarities in their structure . \n obviously , peaks are located at different values of @xmath71 but there is the property that for states with @xmath67 we observe one maximum in the absolute value plot . \n its location changes with the increase of @xmath22 ( it moves towards larger @xmath50 and smaller @xmath51 ) and the maximum value gets much smaller , but it is apparent this class of states has much in common . \n figure [ f5 ] shows the k \n r distribution for state @xmath69 , @xmath72 . \n analysis similar to that made above holds true when we compare fig . \n [ f5 ] and [ f2 ] . without counting that all the scales have changed we find 4 extrema ( @xmath73 ) in the absolute value plots and similar oscillating structures in the real part plots . \n it is a general and well known result that @xmath74 is equal to the number of extrema of hydrogen atom wave functions both in position and momentum representation . \n we only stress that the k - r distribution renders very well this property : its absolute value has @xmath73 extrema . \n we have presented a phase space representation of the hydrogen atom using the k - r distribution . \n an advantage of such a representation is that the system can be treated analytically . \n it is an attractive feature of the k - r distribution that as long as one knows the wave function of the system there is no need to perform any integrals to obtain this distribution value in every point of phase space . \n we have described in detail the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 states of the hydrogen atom . \n plots corresponding to the k \n r functions of these states were presented and compared with the plots of probability densities in position and momentum representations . \n we thank s. daffer for comments about the final draft . this work was partially supported by a kbn grant 2p03 b 02123 , and the european commission through the research training network quest .", "StartTimeOffset": 2713964399088, "RequestID": "4579242f27561da14c74264e08a886e18de61e48", "TotalTokens": 3433}
