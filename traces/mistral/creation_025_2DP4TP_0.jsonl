As Ernst puts it to the Age, \"the more HCK activity a macrophage has, the more it nurtures cancer cell growth and survival.\" Ernst believed, however, that inhibiting the HCK protein would prevent cancer cells from taking over. When researchers used a drug-like molecule to inhibit the protein in animal tests, existing colon and stomach cancers stopped growing. The appearance of new cancers was also reduced, reports News.com.au. \"Our discovery could potentially offer a new and complementary approach to chemotherapy and immunotherapy as options for treating gastrointestinal cancers,\" which is especially important as colon cancers are usually resistant to most immunotherapy treatments, Ernst says.

Their formula-filled study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, kicks off with this sentence: \"Popcorn is the funniest corn to cook, because it jumps and makes a 'pop' sound in our pans.\" But Emmanuel Virot and Alexandre Ponomarenko get far more scientific from there, noting that while previous studies have examined the conditions needed to properly pop corn, the physical origin of a kernel bursting open, jumping, and making that sound remain \"elusive in the literature.\" Using elementary tools of thermodynamics and fracture mechanics (along with an oven, a microphone, and some cameras), they set out to solve the mystery. Through a series of tests, they determined that at 356 degrees Fahrenheit, 96% of corn kernels are popped. But before that, at 180 degrees, some of the kernel's internal moisture (the Guardian reports kernels are 14% water) begins to turn to steam. At the 356-degree point, pressure has multiplied to roughly 10 bars; that's 10 times the atmosphere at sea level, explains Phys.org, and it causes the hull to fracture. A camera taking 2,900 frames per second captured what happens next: At 6.9 milliseconds, the starch expands; at 13.8ms, \"we observe the formation of a 'leg' which is compressed on the plate.\" Some 7ms later, \"this leg bounces and the popcorn jumps.\" As for the pop, they determined that it's not caused by the kernel cracking or the popcorn jumping (as in a pan)\u2014it's triggered by the pressurized vapor being released. \"More precisely, the pressure drop excites cavities inside the popcorn as if it were an acoustic resonator.\" (Scientists have also finally figured out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.)", "StartTimeOffset": 309286103154, "RequestID": "bc360ac9a2af438eaa351fb3fd04621d", "TotalTokens": 1730}

And that doesn't just apply to cravings for chocolate. Researchers say it works on hankerings for sex, sleep, cigarettes, and more. Over one week, psychologists prompted 31 participants, ages 18 to 27, to report cravings for food and drink, drugs (think coffee, alcohol, and cigarettes), and activities, including how strong those cravings were, seven times a day via text message. Of those, 15 participants were told to play 3 minutes of Tetris in between and report back. The result: \"Playing Tetris decreased craving strength ... from 70% to 56%,\" researcher Jackie Andrade says in a press release. What sort of power might Tetris hold? A relatively simple one, it turns out. \"Craving involves imagining the experience of consuming a particular substance or indulging in a particular activity,\" says Andrade. It's \"hard to imagine something vividly and play Tetris at the same time.\" And the effect didn't wear off: Those who played averaged 40 sessions during the week, but the impact remained consistent. Researchers were so impressed that they hope to test the theory on people with drug addictions.

The enormous grouping of the mammals near the Inupiat Eskimo village of Point Lay, about 700 miles northwest of Anchorage, is the result of disappearing sea ice, explains a walrus expert with the US Geological Survey. The area's summer sea ice vanished by mid-September, leaving the walruses with nowhere in the Chukchi Sea to rest between their dives to the seafloor for food, Chadwick Jay tells the Alaska Dispatch News. He says that six of the last eight years have seen this occur.

The journal is so small it's basically illegible save the occasional word or phrase, but still, Haley says, it's \"one of the best things\" he's seen on the program \"by a fairly good stretch.\" In the segment, Loveday explains just why it's so significant: If it is indeed a 17th-century hand, that means it was written \"in the same century as Shakespeare. Anything from the same century as him is of huge influence.\" The Telegraph reports the author of the notebook was likely either attending Shakespeare's plays and taking notes or reading one of the limited printed editions of Shakespeare available at the time. \"It's an extraordinary little object,\" says Haley.

At 6.4 ounces, the diamond is the largest ever found in Leostho, a small country surrounded by South Africa. The gemstone that held that honor until today, called the Lesotho Promise, weighed 603 carats and sold for $12.4 million at auction more than a decade ago. In a statement released today, Gem Diamonds Chief Executive Clifford Elphick said the newly discovered gemstone is an \"exceptional top quality diamond\" with the highest possible color rating, ABC News reports. The largest diamond ever found, the Cullinan Diamond or the Star of Africa I, was pulled from a mine in South Africa in 1905. That diamond was cut and found a place in the British crown jewels.", "StartTimeOffset": 1255458770785, "RequestID": "c69b0a38b42548f88f36d36a7506d920", "TotalTokens": 865}

The Wall Street Journal reports on a somewhat whimsical sounding potential treatment for anxiety and insomnia: \"night milk.\" That would be milk taken from cows at night; it's been found to be naturally higher in sleep-promoting compounds. South Korean researchers recently put the theory to the test in a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food. In this case, the subjects were lab mice that were fed milk in powdered form that had been collected either during the day or at night. The latter contained notably higher levels of tryptophan (24% more) and melatonin (almost 10 times more), and the researchers found night-milk \"shortened the sleep onset and prolonged the sleep duration\" of drug-induced sleep. On the anxiety front, the Journal reports that those mice who received night milk were more likely to explore open spaces, \"an indication of reduced anxiety\"; further, their behavior was similar to that of mice who had been administered the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. The big \"but\" in this study is that the subjects were, again, mice, not humans. But that doesn't mean humans haven't tried night milk.

Special interest groups all but sank Vermont\u2019s bid to enact a single-payer system, he said, and would make such a proposal difficult to pass. \"Taking on the insurance companies and the drug companies, taking on Wall Street, taking on a lot of very powerful forces that make billions of dollars a year from the current health care system is not going to be easy,\u201d he said, \u201cand it's not going to take place until millions of people get involved in this struggle.\u201d Per the Hill, a spokesperson for Sanders called a single-payer amendment attached to the ObamaCare repeal Wednesday a \u201csham.\u201d President Trump tweeted support for repeal Sunday morning, writing, \u201cDon't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more.\u201d But Sanders isn\u2019t taking the bait: \"If people don't like the private insurance that they're getting, they should have a Medicare-type public option available in every state in this country.\u201d", "StartTimeOffset": 1467653800290, "RequestID": "46117e4a4dbe4824a705b09c31120b7f", "TotalTokens": 1245}

But the court noted that no state or federal laws were breached because the package labels accurately indicate just how much balm is in each tube.

The Denver Post reports that Officer Joseph Teeter has been docked a vacation day after he tied the horse up in a stall without food or water, then forgot about him for 16 hours. MC Hammer developed colic after the Sept. 26 incident and had to be euthanized. \"Though not intentional on his part, Officer Teeter's forgetfulness exposed a live animal to cruel and extreme conditions,\" a disciplinary letter sent to the officer reads, noting Teeter had violated a department rule regarding careless restraint of the horse. Teeter had brought MC Hammer back to the Mounted Patrol barn after a day of work in warm downtown Denver. The disciplinary letter notes Teeter tied the horse in a stall, leaving 2 to 3 feet of slack in the rope, but then got \"distracted doing paperwork\" and forgot about the horse, per KDVR. MC Hammer was discovered early the next day by someone else, and after being given food and water initially seemed to be \"bright, alert, and responsive.\" But he soon started feeling pain, and when vets examined him, they discovered he had colic, from which he wouldn't recover, and put him down. It wasn't conclusive, however, that being without food and water for 16 hours caused the colic.

The Survivor producer's Mexican trial for Monica Burgos' murder has finally wrapped up after stretching on for nearly three years. Prosecutors argued Beresford-Redman killed his wife in their room at Cancun's Moon Palace resort on the morning of April 5, 2010, then hid her body in the room until evening, when he deposited it in a cistern, about 75 yards away. The judge's verdict is expected sometime next spring, and Beresford-Redman could face 30 years in prison if convicted. But as the Hollywood Reporter explains, the case is hardly cut and dried. Coroner's tale: Evidence gathered from Burgos' body doesn't support the prosecution's argument. As her body showed no evidence of lividity\u2014the bluish marks left by exposure to a hard surface, like in a hotel room\u2014a coroner said Burgos likely died at the cistern itself. The coroner also determined Burgos died at around 11pm on April 5, not that morning. Missing evidence: Police didn't complete a rape kit on Burgos and didn't test under her fingernails, though the state claimed scratches on Beresford-Redman's neck indicated a fight. The prosecution later said much of its evidence was \"lost\" or damaged by mold and water. It also turned out that blood samples prosecutors said were taken from the hotel room and a railing outside didn't belong to Burgos or Beresford-Redman. Witnesses recant: Hotel employees who said they'd seen the couple fighting later said Beresford-Redman wasn't the man they'd seen. A worker testified that a British family had complained\u2014in a handwritten note\u2014of a woman's screams coming from the couple's hotel room, but no official statement was ever taken from the family. Expert opinion: A forensic scientist and criminologist hired by Beresford-Redman's Mexican defense attorney said Burgos was likely killed by two people familiar with the layout of the hotel.

The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: The Post, for example, says Kelly constantly has an entourage of young women (sometimes minors), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: They hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with Kelly, whom they must call \"Daddy.\" They aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the Post's sources, and must ask permission from Kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups.

He instead wants the border to be drawn at the sea, with customs checks moved to ports, per the Telegraph. An official from Northern Ireland calls that \"absurd\" because it would put a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

They then made super-attractive hybrids by pairing the most attractive in both buckets.

Officials say the man was found in the 100-foot-deep gap Thursday after he succeeded in making an emergency call from his cellphone following numerous failed attempts because of poor reception, the AP reports. The man had been reported missing by his father Saturday on the rugged Dachstein range southeast of the city of Salzburg. State broadcaster ORF cites an alpine rescue official as saying the man is only \"relatively lightly hurt\" considering the drop, with shoulder and foot injuries. Deutsche Welle, which notes the poor weather and risk of avalanches made rescuers' efforts more difficult, documents how police first found the man's car near a lake at the foot of the mountain Wednesday night. He'd been trying to make calls from his phone, and finally one call went through, though only for a few seconds. A quick-thinking member of the rescue team switched communications over to texting, at which point the man was able to relay to them where he was. \"We would not have found him otherwise,\" another rescuer says. The man was flown by helicopter to a nearby hospital after the early morning rescue. He's not being identified due to Austrian privacy laws.", "StartTimeOffset": 2798052132064, "RequestID": "2ce2a144226d4d8798669a05d6eb838f", "TotalTokens": 841}
