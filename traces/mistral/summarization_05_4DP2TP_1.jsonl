10 @xmath1@xcite . to achieve this required spatial resolution \n , the measurement precision of absolute distance changes of tracker elements in one dimension should be on the order of 1 @xmath1 . \n simultaneous measurements from hundreds of interferometers will be used to determine the 3-dimensional positions of the tracker elements . \n the university of michigan group constructed two demonstration frequency scanned interferometer ( fsi ) systems with laser beams transported by air or single - mode optical fiber in the laboratory for initial feasibility studies . \n absolute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency@xcite . \n the main goal of the demonstration systems was to determine the potential accuracy of absolute distance measurements that could be achieved under controlled conditions . \n secondary goals included estimating the effects of vibrations and studying error sources crucial to the absolute distance accuracy . \n the main contents of this proceedings article come from our published paper@xcite . \n however , new material in this paper includes a description of a dual - laser system and a possible optical alignment for a silicon tracker detector . \n the intensity @xmath2 of any two - beam interferometer can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the intensities of the two combined beams , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the phases . assuming the optical path lengths of the two beams are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the phase difference in eq . \n ( 1 ) is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical frequency of the laser beam , and c is the speed of light .    for a fixed path interferometer , as the frequency of the laser \n is continuously scanned , the optical beams will constructively and destructively interfere , causing `` fringes '' . \n the number of fringes @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the optical path difference between the two beams , and @xmath15 is the scanned frequency range . \n the optical path difference ( opd for absolute distance between beamsplitter and retroreflector ) can be determined by counting interference fringes while scanning the laser frequency . \n a schematic of the fsi system with a pair of optical fibers is shown in fig.1 . \n the light source is a new focus velocity 6308 tunable laser ( 665.1 nm @xmath16 675.2 nm ) . a high - finesse ( @xmath17 ) thorlabs sa200 f \n - p is used to measure the frequency range scanned by the laser . the free spectral range ( fsr ) of two adjacent f - p peaks \n is 1.5 ghz , which corresponds to 0.002 nm . \n a faraday isolator was used to reject light reflected back into the lasing cavity . \n the laser beam was coupled into a single - mode optical fiber with a fiber coupler . \n data acquisition is based on a national instruments daq card capable of simultaneously sampling 4 channels at a rate of 5 ms / s / ch with a precision of 12-bits . \n omega thermistors with a tolerance of 0.02 k and a precision of 0.01 @xmath18 are used to monitor temperature . \n the apparatus is supported on a damped newport optical table .    in order to reduce air flow and temperature fluctuations , \n a transparent plastic box was constructed on top of the optical table . \n pvc pipes were installed to shield the volume of air surrounding the laser beam . inside the pvc pipes , \n the typical standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about @xmath19 . \n temperature fluctuations were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic box and pvc pipes . \n detectors for hep experiments must usually be operated remotely for safety reasons because of intensive radiation , high voltage or strong magnetic fields . \n in addition , precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other detector components , making access difficult . for practical hep application of fsi , optical fibers for light delivery and return \n are therefore necessary . \n the beam intensity coupled into the return optical fiber is very weak , requiring ultra - sensitive photodetectors for detection . \n considering the limited laser beam intensity and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of interferometers , it is vital to increase the geometrical efficiency . to this end , a collimator is built by placing an optical fiber in a ferrule ( 1 mm diameter ) and gluing one end of the optical fiber to a grin lens . \n the grin lens is a 0.25 pitch lens with 0.46 numerical aperture , 1 mm diameter and 2.58 mm length which is optimized for a wavelength of 630 nm . \n the density of the outgoing beam from the optical fiber is increased by a factor of approximately 1000 by using a grin lens . \n the return beams are received by another optical fiber and amplified by a si femtowatt photoreceiver with a gain of @xmath20 . \n for a fsi system , drifts and vibrations occurring along the optical path during the scan will be magnified by a factor of @xmath21 , where @xmath11 is the average optical frequency of the laser beam and @xmath22 is the scanned frequency range . for the full scan of our laser , @xmath23 . \n small vibrations and drift errors that have negligible effects for many optical applications may have a significant impact on a fsi system . a single - frequency vibration may be expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the amplitude , frequency and phase of the vibration , respectively . if @xmath28 is the start time of the scan , eq . \n ( 2 ) can be re - written as @xmath29/c \\end{array } \\eqno{(3)}\\ ] ] if we approximate @xmath30 , the measured optical path difference @xmath31 may be expressed as @xmath32 \\times \\\\ \\sin[\\pi f_{vib}(t+t_0)+\\phi_{vib } ] \\end{array } \\eqno{(4)}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the true optical path difference in the absence of vibrations . \n if the path - averaged refractive index of ambient air @xmath34 is known , the measured distance is @xmath35 . \n if the measurement window size @xmath36 is fixed and the window used to measure a set of @xmath37 is sequentially shifted , the effects of the vibration will be evident . \n we use a set of distance measurements in one scan by successively shifting the fixed - length measurement window one f - p peak forward each time . \n the arithmetic average of all measured @xmath37 values in one scan is taken to be the measured distance of the scan ( although more sophisticated fitting methods can be used to extract the central value ) . for a large number of distance measurements @xmath38 \n , the vibration effects can be greatly suppressed . \n of course , statistical uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination , dominant in our current system , can also be reduced with multiple scans . \n averaging multiple measurements in one scan , however , provides similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from independent scans , and is faster , more efficient , and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift . in this way \n , we can improve the distance accuracy dramatically if there are no significant drift errors during one scan , caused , for example , by temperature variation . \n this multiple - distance - measurement technique is called slip measurement window with fixed size , shown in fig.2 . \n however , there is a trade off in that the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of @xmath38 because of the larger magnification factor @xmath39 for a smaller measurement window size .    in order to extract the amplitude and frequency of the vibration , another multiple - distance - measurement technique called slip measurement window with fixed start point \n is used , as shown in fig.2 . in eq . \n ( 3 ) , if @xmath28 is fixed , the measurement window size is enlarged one f - p peak for each shift , an oscillation of a set of measured @xmath37 values indicates the amplitude and frequency of vibration . \n this technique is not suitable for distance measurement because there always exists an initial bias term , from @xmath28 , which can not be determined accurately in our current system . \n the typical measurement residual versus the distance measurement number in one scan using the above technique is shown in fig.3(a ) , where the scanning rate was 0.5 nm / s and the sampling rate was 125 ks / s . \n measured distances minus their average value for 10 sequential scans are plotted versus number of measurements ( @xmath38 ) per scan in fig.3(b ) . the standard deviations ( rms ) of distance measurements for 10 sequential scans \n are plotted versus number of measurements ( @xmath38 ) per scan in fig.3(c ) . \n it can be seen that the distance errors decrease with an increase of @xmath38 . \n the rms of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is 1.6 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan ( @xmath40 ) . \n if @xmath41 and the average value of 1200 distance measurements in each scan is considered as the final measured distance of the scan , the rms of the final measured distances for 10 scans is 41 nm for the distance of 449828.965 @xmath1 , the relative distance measurement precision is 91 ppb .    the standard deviation ( rms ) of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is approximately 1.5 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan for closed box data . by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique , the distance measurement precisions for various closed box data with distances ranging from 10 cm to 70 cm collected in the past year are improved significantly ; precisions of approximately 50 nanometers are demonstrated under laboratory conditions , as shown in table 1 . \n all measured precisions listed in table 1 . \n are the rms s of measured distances for 10 sequential scans . \n two fsi demonstration systems , air fsi and optical fiber fsi , are constructed for extensive tests of multiple - distance - measurement technique , air fsi means fsi with the laser beam transported entirely in the ambient atmosphere , optical fiber fsi represents fsi with the laser beam delivered to the interferometer and received back by single - mode optical fibers . \n .distance measurement precisions for various setups using the multiple - distance - measurement technique . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     based on our studies , the slow fluctuations are reduced to a negligible level by using the plastic box and pvc pipes to suppress temperature fluctuations . \n the dominant error comes from the uncertainties of the interference fringes number determination ; the fringes uncertainties are uncorrelated for multiple distance measurements . in this case \n , averaging multiple distance measurements in one scan provides a similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from multiple independent scans . \n but , for open box data , the slow fluctuations are dominant , on the order of few microns in our laboratory . \n the measurement precisions for single and multiple distance open - box measurements are comparable , which indicates that the slow fluctuations can not be adequately suppressed by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique . \n a dual - laser fsi system@xcite intended to cancel the drift error is currently under study in our laboratory .    in order to test the vibration measurement technique , \n a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) was employed to produce vibrations of the retroreflector . \n for instance , the frequency of the controlled vibration source was set to @xmath42 hz with amplitude @xmath43 nanometers . \n the magnification factors , distance measurement residuals and corrected measurement residuals for 2000 measurements in one scan are shown in fig.3(d ) , fig.3(e ) and fig.3(f ) , respectively . \n the extracted vibration frequencies and amplitudes using this technique , @xmath44  hz , @xmath45 nanometers , agree well with the expectation values . \n in addition , vibration frequencies at 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 hz with controlled vibration amplitudes ranging from 9.5 nanometers to 400 nanometers were studied extensively using our current fsi system . \n the measured vibrations and expected vibrations all agree well within the 10 - 15% level for amplitudes , 1 - 2% for frequencies , where we are limited by uncertainties in the expectations . \n vibration frequencies far below 0.1 hz can be regarded as slow fluctuations , which can not be suppressed by the above analysis techniques . \n detailed information about estimation of major error sources for the absolute distance measurement and limitation of our current fsi system is provided elsewhere@xcite . \n a dual - laser fsi system has been built in order to reduce drift error and slow fluctuations occuring during the laser scan . \n two lasers are operating simultaneously , the two laser beams are coupled into one optical fiber but isolated by using two choppers . \n the principle of the dual - laser technique is shown in the following . \n for the first laser , the measured distance @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is drift error during the laser scanning . for the second laser , the measured distance @xmath48 . \n since the two laser beams travel the same optical path during the same period , the drift errors @xmath49 and @xmath50 should be very comparable . under this assumption \n , the true distance can be extracted using the formula @xmath51 , where , @xmath52 , the ratio of magnification factors from two lasers . \n the laser beams are isolated by choppers periodically , so only half the fringes are recorded for each laser , degrading the distance measurement precision . missing fringes during chopped intervals for each laser must be recovered through robust interpolation algorithms . \n the chopper edge transitions make this interpolation difficult . \n several techniques are under study . \n one possible silicon tracker alignment system is shown in fig.4 . \n the left plot shows lines of sight for alignment in r - z plane of the tracker barrel , the middle plot for alignment in x - y plane of the tracker barrel , the right plot for alignment in the tracker forward region . \n red lines / dots show the point - to - point distances need to be measured using fsis . \n there are 752 point - to - point distance measurements in total for the alignment system . \n more studies are needed to optimize the distance measurments grid . \n fox -

{"ContextTokens": 1527, "GeneratedTokens": 98, "SynthesizedBody": "the relationship between seyfert galaxies and radio - loud galaxies has not been explored in detail . \n however , a complete sample of flat - spectrum radio - loud agn contains a significant fraction of seyfert - like sources , including one which would be classified as a narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) .    to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for producing the different characteristics of agn \n , a multiwavelength approach is needed . \n correlations between properties at different wavelengths can be used to reject and refine physical models of the central regions of agn . \n the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs ) @xcite is interesting in this context because it is a radio - selected sample . \n the selection criteria are as follows :    * radio - loud : 2.7ghz flux @xmath0 0.5 jy . * \n flat - spectrum : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 * galactic latitude : @xmath3b@xmath4 * @xmath5 dec(b1950 ) \n @xmath6    this sample contains 323 sources with a wide range of properties which can be quite different to agn selected by optical colours . \n the phfs agn have a large range in optical luminosities , with more than 50 objects having absolute magnitudes in the seyfert luminosity range ( m@xmath7 - 23 ) . \n another interesting characteristic is the large dispersion in optical colours of this sample compared with optically selected samples such as the large bright quasar survey @xcite . \n the mechanism responsible for producing the large dispersion in optical colours , especially the significant number of red sources in the sample , is not at all well established . \n there have been suggestions of dust reddening @xcite , reddening due to the underlying galaxy spectrum @xcite and synchrotron reddening @xcite . \n we consider two questions :    1 . \n are the reddened continuum colours associated with changes in the emission lines of the agn ? 2 . \n can we identify the reddening mechanisms contributing to each agn ? \n we have low resolution optical spectra of an unbiased subsample of the phfs . \n this subsample was divided into three equal colour bins based on the b - k colours of the objects : blue ( b - k @xmath8 3 ) , intermediate ( 3 @xmath8 b - k @xmath8 4.4 ) and red ( b - k @xmath0 4.4 ) . \n a composite spectrum of the objects in each bin was made ( see @xcite for a description of the technique used ) . \n the results are plotted in figure 1 . \n it should be noted that the continuum has been normalised to the same slope for each bin to compare the emission line properties over the range of colours . \n the lbqs composite spectrum is also shown as a comparison with an optically selected sample @xcite . \n there are clear differences between the different composites . \n the width of h@xmath9 line decreases as redness increases and o(3727 ) is only seen in the red composite . \n the mg(2800 ) line is also quite broad in the blue and intermediate composites , and much narrower in the red composite . \n further analysis of the spectra in the red bin shows there are two different types of spectra in this bin : ( 1 ) low redshift galaxy - type spectra , and ( 2 ) higher redshift quasar spectra . \n several very red objects in the parkes sample seem to appear red owing to a large contribution from a galactic component . \n the 4000  break in the spectrum of the galactic light reduces the amount of light in the blue filter giving a b - k colour which is quite red . \n these objects are at low redshifts and are generally resolved . \n masci @xcite has fitted an evolved elliptical galaxy sed to the phfs spectra , showing that these objects have a high proportion of galactic light in their spectra . \n these objects also have the steepest radio spectrum with values of @xmath10 . \n the composite spectrum of these resolved sources is fairly typical of a galaxy with no h@xmath9 emission . \n the second group of red objects in the sample are higher redshift quasar / seyfert - type objects . \n they show the strong emission lines characteristic of quasars and have flatter radio spectral indices . whiting et al . \n @xcite have modelled the reddening by synchrotron emission using broad band seds . \n they show that these objects tend to have a strong component of synchrotron emission which is responsible for their red continuum . \n these quasars would be missed in a traditional blue - selected quasar sample . \n the composite of these unresolved sources has a completely different shape , with narrow permitted emission lines at civ(1549 ) , ciii](1909 ) and mgii(2798 ) superimposed on a fairly smooth continuum . \n thus it appears that the red agn have relatively narrow emission lines . \n a fuller description of these results will appear in oshlack et al . \n in examining the spectra from the parkes sample we have identified a nls1 candidate , pks 2004 - 447 ( figure 2 ) . \n one model for nls1s suggests they are agn oriented towards us , so that the doppler broadening of a disk - like broad line region would naturally produce narrower emission lines @xcite . \n an extremely radio - loud nls1 could provide an independent test of such physical models of nls1s , and agn unification in general . \n a low resolution spectrum of this source shows an h@xmath9 width of @xmath112000 km  s@xmath12 . \n there is some indication of fe emission on the blueward side of h@xmath9 and the source has been detected at x - ray energies @xcite . \n this object is extremely radio - loud with a radio to optical flux ratio ( r ) exceeding 7000 . \n the colour of pks 2004 - 447 is very red , in contrast with the previously discovered radio - loud nls1 , rgb j0044 + 193 which was quite blue @xcite . \n the radio spectrum of pks 2004 - 447 is also quite steep , with recent measurements of the ( contemporaneous ) radio spectral index giving @xmath13 , consistent with radio indices of radio - quiet nls1s ( moran , these proceedings ) . a higher resolution spectrum of pks 2004 - 447 will be obtained , to confirm its identity .", "StartTimeOffset": 21943757289, "RequestID": "4608e32d021943dbb2f846f34467a869", "TotalTokens": 1625}

{"ContextTokens": 4034, "GeneratedTokens": 146, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years , smart grid has attracted significant interest in both communities of communications and power systems @xcite . in a smart grid , \n modern communication technologies are used to convey information like system parameters ( voltage , frequency , harmonics , etc ) and power consumption information in order to improve the robustness , agility and efficiency of power grid . \n for example , as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : illu ] , phasor measurement units ( pmus ) send report to the power plant which takes actions to stabilize the power grid . \n however , the communication infrastructure also brings vulnerability to the smart grid . \n an attacker can attack the communication links using various approaches such as jamming in the physical layer and byzantine attack in the upper layers . \n the attack could result in delay or drop of report packets . \n the attacker may revise the report such that the received report is wrong , thus possibly incurring system instability and even large area blackout which brings the loss of millions of dollars . \n therefore , a secure design of smart grid is in a pressing need .    in this paper \n , we study the trustiness framework based secure control in smart grid . \n we assume that each report could be substituted by a false report from an attacker . instead of studying the security protocols in the communication networks , which has been intensively studied for data networks like internet , we focus on the controller side , i.e. , the power plant , which is aware of possible attacks . \n the controller can predict the future system state and then evaluate the trustiness of reports from different pmus . \n based on these trustiness , the controller takes a corresponding control strategy , e.g. , dropping untrusted packets . \n the trustiness will also be fed back to the pmus such that the pmus can adjust their security setups ( e.g. , the keys or the cryptography protocols ) . \n the system is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : illu ] . for example \n , the reports from pmu a is attacked by the attacker . \n then , the trustiness of the reports from pmu a is reduced , which may make the controller drop the corresponding reports . \n meanwhile , pmu a may change its key or use a more secure protocol when it finds out that its trustiness has been significantly decreased . \n note that the reliability issues for control systems have been considered in supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) standard @xcite . however , scada is mostly focused on the reliability subject to random failures , instead of malicious attacks . \n there are some studies on the control systems subject to malicious attacks @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n @xcite and @xcite introduce general problems and approaches for secure control without exploring the details . \n @xcite is focused on the control system subject to denial - of

system dynamics of the control system can be exploited to build the corresponding effective trustiness . in this paper , we apply kalman filtering @xcite to predict the system state using different combinations of pmu reports , thus realizing a cross - check of the report trustiness .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . the system model of the controller and communication

extend to the general case in which the sensor reports have overlaps . \n each pmu sends its observations to the controller via a communication channel since they are not located at the same place as the controller . \n we use the following assumptions throughout the paper :    * each report can be successfully received by the controller if there is no attack . \n this is reasonable for communication channels with good qualities . \n for the practical case of occasional packet drop , the control strategy can be obtained by considering the corresponding element in the observation matrix @xmath8 as zero . * each report could be replaced with a false report by an intervening attacker . \n the attacker could intercept the report and insert its own one . \n however , we assume that not all reports are replaced . * for simplicity \n , we assume that there is at most one attacker . \n the principle of the trustiness system can be extended to the case of multiple attackers at the cost of more computational cost .      when there is no attacker , we assume that the controller adopts the lqr control @xcite with an infinite time horizon with the cost function given by

estimator which will be explained later , and @xmath19 and the matrix @xmath1 satisfies the algebraic riccati equation , which is given by @xmath20 \n in this section , we propose a mechanism for evaluating the trustiness of each sensor . \n the essential reason that the controller can evaluate the trustiness of each sensor is that the controller can predict the future state with some uncertainty . \n if the report from a sensor is significantly deviated from the prediction , then the controller can consider this sensor as unreliable and ignores its reports . \n the basic principle is to evaluate the trustiness of each pmu by comparing its report with the prediction obtained from the reports of other @xmath21 pmus . \n the procedure is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : kalman ] .          in each time slot \n , the controller can predict the system state in the next time slot , i.e. , @xmath22 , according to its own action @xmath16 and the current system state @xmath23 . since it is possible \n that there is one attacker , the controller computes @xmath2 predictions by excluding one sensor in each prediction . \n the kalman filtering can be applied for the system state estimation . according to @xcite , the system state @xmath22 is gaussian distributed . \n when the observation @xmath24 from pmu @xmath25 is excluded , the expectation of the system state is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 where @xmath28 is obtained by removing the @xmath25-th row from the observation matrix @xmath8 , and @xmath29 and covariance matrix given by @xmath30 where @xmath31      using the prediction obtained from the reports of pmus except pmu @xmath25 , the _ a posteriori _ probability of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 ( here @xmath34 means the observations excluding that of pmu @xmath25 ) , is gaussian distributed with the expectation given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath25-th row in matrix @xmath8 , and variance @xmath37    we denote by @xmath38 the type of pmu @xmath25 . @xmath39 if pmu @xmath25 is an attacker ; otherwise @xmath40 . \n then , we define the suspicious level of pmu @xmath25 as the following conditional probability , which is given by @xmath41 the trustiness can be defined as @xmath42 . \n the challenges for computing the suspicious level is the unknown attacking strategy . \n we first assume that there must be an attacker . using the bayesian rule \n , we have @xmath43 where the last approximation is obtained by decomposing the joint distribution into the product of the probabilities in each time slot . \n note that this approximation is not rigorous . \n however , it simplifies the computation and the validity will be demonstrated in the numerical simulations . \n we do the following further simplification : @xmath44 by assuming the independence among the pmus . \n although this assumption does not hold , it simplifies the analysis . \n we further assume that @xmath45 is a constant since we have no knowledge about the attacker s strategy . substituting the approximation in ( [ eq : approx ] ) into ( [ eq : trust ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 we then approximate the probability @xmath47 by @xmath48 . \n when it is possible that there is no attacker , it is easy to repeat the above procedure and obtain the following approximation for the suspicious level of pmu @xmath25 , which is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the _ a priori _ likelihood that there is no attacker , which is given by @xmath51 obviously , the large @xmath50 is , the less sensitive the controller is to possible attackers . \n one approach to handle the attacker is to omit its reports once determining that it is an attacker . \n alternatively , we propose a heuristic approach for the control based on the trustiness values , called _ \n weighted prediction_. suppose that we still use the lqr control . \n then , the control action taken at time @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where the system state estimation is a function dependent on the suspicious levels of different pmus . \n we set @xmath54 where the estimation is the weighted sum of the system state estimations of different excluded pmus . \n when the suspicious level of pmu @xmath25 is high , the corresponding system state estimation @xmath55 , which excludes the reports from pmu @xmath25 , will dominate ( recall that @xmath56 is obtained by excluding the reports from pmu @xmath25 ) . \n the proposed algorithms are summarized in procedure [ alg : trustiness ] . \n in this section , we use numerical simulations to demonstrate the proposed trustiness system in smart grid . \n we adopt the linear model analyzed in example 6.2 of @xcite , in which the system is described using the following continuous - time linear dynamics : @xmath57 where the matrix @xmath58 is given by    @xmath59    and the matrix @xmath60 is given in ( [ eq : mat_k ] ) ( at the top of the next page ) . \n the details of the model can be found in @xcite .    since we discuss the discrete - time model in this paper , we approximate the continuous - time model by setting a small time step @xmath61 , which is given by @xmath62 therefore , we assume the following discrete - time model : @xmath63 where we ignore the step @xmath61 in the index . \n we assume that the pmus can observe the system state directly , i.e. , @xmath64 , each pmu for one dimension . \n we further assume that pmu 1 is malicious while all other pmus are honest . \n @xmath65      in figures [ fig : attack ] and [ fig : attack2 ] , the evolution of the suspicious level is shown for the attacker and two honest pmus . in fig . \n [ fig : attack ] , we assume that the report of the attacker is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance 0.1 . the attacker decides to attack or not to attack with probability 0.2 ( called _ attack frequency _ ) . \n we observe that there is some fluctuation at the beginning . \n then , at the times when the attacker launches attacks , the suspicious level of the attacker increases significantly . \n after around 80 time slots , the attacker can be well distinguished from the two honest pmus . in fig . \n [ fig : attack2 ] , we assume that the attacker attaches a gaussian noise with zero expectation and variance 0.1 to the observation . the attack frequency is increased to 0.5 . \n we observe that the suspicious level increases more smoothly .              in fig . \n [ fig : cdf ] , we plot the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) curves of the time when the controller claims that an attacker is detected . \n we assume that the controller claims the attacker when the suspicious level is larger than 0.7 . \n the cases of false alarms are excluded ( note that a false alarm is defined as the event that a honest pmu is claimed to be an attacker ) . \n we change the attack frequencies from 0.1 to 0.3 . \n the linear system runs for 200 time slots . \n we observe that , when the attack frequency is 0.1 , the attacker is not detected within the 200 time slots in around 40% cases . \n when the attack frequency is increased , the attacker will be detected faster .        in fig . \n [ fig : roc ] , we plot the receiver operation characteristic ( roc ) curves , which show the average delay of detection ( excluding the false alarms ) and false alarm rate . \n the attack frequencies are 0.2 and 0.4 , respectively . \n again , we use the threshold of 0.7 for the suspicious level . \n obviously , the detection delay increases when the attack frequency becomes larger with a fixed false alarm rate .          in figures [ fig : cost1 ] and [ fig : \n cost2 ] , the cost averaged over 2000 time slots and 100 realizations is shown . \n we assume that @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( [ eq : lqg ] ) , i.e. , we pay much more attention to the norm of the system state . \n we compare the costs using the weighted system state estimation in section [ sec : evaluation ] and the system without any counter measure for the attacker ( i.e. , full trust to each pmu ) .    in our test \n , we found that a small amplitude attack ( e.g. , the attacker uses the same attack as in fig . \n [ fig : cdf ] ) causes very small impact on the system . \n this is because that the kalman filter has certain inherent robustness since the attack can be partially mitigated by observations from other pmus . \n therefore , we assume that the report of pmu1 is the sum of the original report and a strong noise with a large variance , which is called _ attack amplitude_. in fig . \n [ fig : cost1 ] , we assume that the attack amplitude is 100 and change the attack probabilities . \n we observe that , as the attack probabilities increases , the average cost of the full trust case is significantly increased . \n meanwhile , the total cost is decreased as the attack frequency increases . \n a possible reason is that a higher attack frequency may cause a more rapid degradation of the trustiness of the attacker . \n the total cost is also shown for different attack amplitudes in fig . \n [ fig : cost2 ] . \n again , the total cost increases as the attack amplitude is increased in the full trust case . in a contrast to fig . [ \n fig : cost1 ] , the average cost of the weighted system state case is not a monotonic function of the attack amplitude . \n the reason could be : when the attack amplitude is small , the attacker causes little damage to the system ; when the amplitude is large , the controller can detect the attacker early and avoid the cost in later time slots . \n in this paper , we have analyzed the possible spoof attack on the smart grid system , in which the attacker can intercept and true report and send its faked report to the controller , which can cause severe damage to the power grid . \n we have proposed a trustiness system for the controller , in which multiple kalman filtering processes , with each pmu excluded , are used to cross check the suspiciousness of each pmu . \n the suspicious levels are then used as weights for the system state estimation for the lqr control . \n numerical simulations have shown that the attacker can be effectively detected and the weighted system prediction approach significantly outperforms the system unaware of possible attacks .                              c. w. taylor , d. c. erickson , k. e. martin , r. e. wilson and v. venkatasubramanian , `` wacs - wide - are stability and voltage control system : r&d and online demonstration , '' _ proceedings of the ieee _ , pp.892906 , may 2005 .", "StartTimeOffset": 33203755631, "RequestID": "241fbadaba1e4fc29553a01c21b3dab4", "TotalTokens": 4180}

irradiation analysis indicates that there is no other significant degradation and the decreases in the vcsel driver current is now understood \n . figure  [ iv ] shows the iv curves of a pmos transistor fabricated in the thick oxide technology before and after irradiation . \n the iv characteristic before the irradiation is well reproduced by the simulation . \n a shift is observed after the irradiation and is well reproduced by the simulation after including a 175 mv threshold shift . \n the threshold shift is significantly smaller in the nmos transistors . \n the present current mirror in the driver circuit uses both type of transistors and thus is sensitive to the different threshold shifts . \n the plan is to use pmos transistors only in the future design . \n the pin receiver / decoder contains a trans - impedance amplifier , limiting amplifier , bi - phase mark ( bpm ) decoder with clock recovery , and lvds drivers to send the decoded data and recovered clock off the asic . \n all transistors are fabricated with thin oxide , allowing the asic to run with a 1.5 v power supply . \n the clock and data recovery is accomplished using a delay locked loop that contains networks of switchable capacitors in the delay stages allow for the three operating frequencies , 40 , 160 , and 320 mb / s . however , due to insufficient time to optimize the design , the asics operate at somewhat lower speed and require higher threshold currents to achieve a low bit error rate ( ber ) . \n other than these two limitations , the performance of the asics is satisfactory , including clock jitter , duty cycle , rise / fall time , and high / low levels of the lvds drivers .    for the irradiation , \n the asics were tested in two different setups of four asics each . \n the first setup was purely electrical while the second setup involved a pin diode so that we could decouple the electrical and optical degradations . in both setups , \n the decoded data were transmitted to the control room using 20 m of coax . in the first setup , \n 40 mb / s bpm signals were transmitted over 20 m of coax to the asics . \n the long cable precluded testing at higher speed . in the second setup , we sent 40 mb / s bpm signal via a fiber to a pin diode coupled to an asic . \n for both setups , we observed single event upset during the spill but observed no degradation in the threshold for @xmath11 error / s as a function of dosage . \n we also monitored the ber vs. pin current during the irradiation . \n the ber decreased with larger pin current and was higher for an asic coupled to a pin diode as expected ( fig . \n [ ber ] ) . \n the current consumption was constant during the irradiation . \n detailed post - irradiation analysis reveals no significant degradation in the overall performance . \n the clock multiplier circuits consist of charge pump / ring oscillator phase locked loops ( pll ) with dividers in the feedback loop . \n one circuit performs a frequency multiplication of 16 and the other a multiplication by 4 , both yielding a 640 mhz clock . \n the multipliers are designed using thin oxide transistors and are powered by a single 1.5 v supply . \n the multiplier circuits share a common 50  @xmath0 driver and lvds receiver enabling testing of only one multiplier at a time . \n an additional switching network allows the recovered clock from the pin receiver prototype to be routed to either multiplier to allow for testing of how the received signal jitter is coupled to the multiplied clock . \n four multipliers were packaged for the irradiation . \n all asics functioned well with clock jitter of @xmath2 8 ps ( 0.5% ) . during the irradiation \n , we observed that the clocks of two asics lost lock and power cycling was needed to resume operation at 640 mhz . \n this problem is not yet understood . \n detailed post - irradiation analysis also reveals no significant degradation in the overall performance . \n we have designed prototype asics using the 130 nm process to enhance the radiation - hardness . \n the submission has been mostly successful . \n we irradiated the asics to a dose of 70 mrad and observed no significant degradation except in the vcsel driver . \n post -

wide sharing of said data  @xcite . in the context of the sensorcloud project  @xcite \n , we consider a scenario in which operators of sensor networks ( i.e. , private users , companies , or public institutions ) connect their sensor networks to the cloud  @xcite , where collected sensor data is processed by cloud services selected by the sensor network operator  @xcite . besides the remarkable advantages of cloud computing , it is important to note that sensor data often contains sensitive information . \n hence , when transferring this sensitive data to entities outside of trusted sensor networks , it might , e.g. , be unintentionally forwarded to third parties or used for non - authorized purposes  @xcite . \n furthermore , data stored and processed in the cloud might be subject to access by the cloud provider or governmental agencies  @xcite . \n thus , one major challenge when interconnecting sensor networks with the cloud is to account for the aforementioned security and privacy concerns .    as part of the efforts of the sensorcloud project \n , we developed a trust point - based security architecture for outsourcing sensor data to the cloud and the sensorcloud security library  @xcite . \n one important challenge in securely outsourcing sensor data to the cloud lies in the representation of sensor data and the corresponding security measures taken to protect the sensor data . in this paper \n , we report on the sensorcloud protocol , which has jointly been developed within the sensorcloud project to represent sensor data and actuator commands using json and subsequently secure this data using object security mechanisms . to this end \n , we rely on mechanisms that have been or currently are in the process of being standardized at the ietf and provide a best practice on how to utilize and combine them in an actual system .    the remainder of this document is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : scenario ] , we present the sensorcloud scenario in more detail and provide references to more detailed descriptions of the overall security architecture . section  [ sec : json - representation ] defines the json - based representation of sensor data and actuator commands in sensorcloud . in section  [ sec : security - extensions ] , we describe the security extensions to this representation to realize the secure outsourcing of sensor data to the cloud . \n we conclude this paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n in sensorcloud , we consider a scenario where each sensor network ( with an arbitrary number of sensor nodes ) is connected to the cloud via a dedicated gateway as depicted in figure  [ fig : scenario ] . \n our goal is to store data securely in the cloud such that it can only be processed by authorized cloud services . to this end , the gateway encrypts sensitive sensor readings using a symmetric cipher before uploading it to the cloud . \n the encryption process is influenced by a user - configurable access control list containing services that are authorized to ( partially ) obtain and process the user s sensor data . \n now , only entities in possession of the symmetric key used for encrypting a piece of sensor data ( referred to as a data item ) have access to this specific data item . \n hence , to grant a cloud service access to a given data item the gateway has to provide this cloud service with the corresponding key . \n to this end , the gateway asymmetrically encrypts the corresponding symmetric key with the public key of the cloud service that should gain access to the sensor data and forwards the resulting encrypted key to the respective cloud service . \n more details , especially with respect to the design and implementation of the underlying security architecture as well as our choice of cryptographic primitives , can be found in the corresponding publications  @xcite . \n notably , sensor data originating from a single ( possibly virtual ) sensor node can contain multiple sensor readings from different sensors . \n for example , one data item measured by a meteorological sensor might consist of multiple single sensor readings such as humidity and temperature . \n hence , sensorcloud supports the transmission of multiple sensor readings of one sensor node in a single message  @xcite . as a cloud service \n might only be granted access to parts of the sensor readings , sensorcloud supports the encryption of individual parts of sensor data , thus realizing fine - grained access control . \n the processing of sensor data by a cloud service requires the verification of the integrity of received data , the decryption of the symmetric key , and finally the decryption of the actual sensor data . \n these operations have been implemented in the sensorcloud security library , which allows the transparent decryption of sensor data and the verification of its integrity by a cloud service  @xcite . \n it is available as open source software under the mit license . \n the remainder of this document defines the json - based messages used by the sensorcloud protocol to encode data items as well as additional configuration messages . \n more precisely , the json - based message layout defined by this document is used for both internal communication within the gateway and cloud , respectively , and for communication between those entities . \n the field ` ver ` contains the version number of the protocol , which defines the structure of the remainder of the message . \n hence , whenever the message structure or encapsulated payloads are subject to changes , the version number must be increased . \n the receiving peer must support the indicated version number . otherwise , it should notify the sending peer that the message was dropped . \n the version number is a positive integer and is currently defined as ` 1 ` . \n the sequence number ` seq ` is currently unused and must therefore be set to ` 0 ` . \n however , it enables end - to - end acknowledgments at the application layer . \n the corresponding retransmission mechanism will need to be developed in the future . \n if used , ` seq ` is a positive integer that must be increased by one for each json message header sent . a potential wrap - around of \n the sequence number is to be expected and implementations must interpret this case as an incrementation of the sequence number . \n the messages to be transmitted using one header are stored within an array in the field ` pl ` . \n section  [ sec : payload - types ] defines a list of message types supported by sensorcloud . \n additional message types can be defined as necessary . \n messages must contain the field ` typ ` to indicate their message type for message processing purposes . \n moreover , they must include the ` gw ` field to indicate the gateway device that participates in the communication . among other aspects , \n this information is required for applying object security measures . \n note that multiple messages of different types can be batched using one message header in order to reduce the overall communication overhead . \n each message indicates its message type via the field ` typ ` , which must be included in any message . \n the message type is a positive integer value and can currently take one of the values described in table  [ tab : msg -

{"ContextTokens": 3247, "GeneratedTokens": 211, "SynthesizedBody": "our aim here is to study the results of competition of two types of contact processes ( cp ) @xcite in the watts - strogatz network . \n the idea is as follows . \n the network nodes are assumed to be in one of two states , say s and d. one of cp is the voter dynamics @xcite , where a randomly selected s node changes the state of one of his neighbor from d to s. the other cp is the unifying step of the sznajd dynamics @xcite , where a randomly selected pair of neighboring nodes , once both d , change the state of all their neighbors from s to d. + in a recent text @xcite , a similar competition has been investigated on the watts - strogatz ( ws ) and the erds - rnyi ( er ) networks . also there , one process of activating nodes has been ruled by the voter dynamics , and the other was triggered by a pair of mutually connected nodes . \n the difference between that approach and the present work is that in paper @xcite a node was activated by a pair of d nodes only if it was a nearest neighbor of both nodes of the pair . on the contrary , in the sznajd dynamics used here all neighbors of each member of the d pair \n are activated @xcite . \n we note that the third model of this family is the bootstrap percolation , where nodes of the activating pair are not necessary neighbors of each other @xcite ; the latter model is not investigated here . \n + our motivation is as follows . in @xcite , \n the clustering coefficient @xmath0 was used as a control parameter . in ws , @xmath0 \n was controlled by rewiring , while in er , it was controlled by adding new links , along the method proposed by holme and kim @xcite . \n the results of @xcite indicate , that in ws , tuning of @xmath0 can lead to switching the d process off and on . \n namely , the d process is blocked if the clustering coefficient is below some critical value . \n this effect is a consequence of the model assumption , that both nodes of the activating pair must be neighbors of the activated node . \n the density of triangles is controlled by @xmath0 . \n if the triangles in the network are rare , the d process is stopped . to check this conclusion \n , we are going to investigate the same process with the sznajd dynamics , where triangles are not necessary . \n consequently , the clustering coefficient @xmath0 should be less important . + it is worth to add that the competing cp s enables a more precise measurement of intensity of the investigated process by its comparison with the voter dynamics . in a finite network , in particular a small - world network , \n the process can reach the whole lattice in a few steps . to switch another process on allows to find their mutual intensity when both processes balance each other . in @xcite , \n the voter process was more intense and therefore it was applied with probability @xmath1 , while the d process was applied with probability 1 . here \n the situation is opposite ; the sznajd dynamics is applied with the probability @xmath1 , and the voter dynamics with the probability 1 . \n we look for the values of @xmath2 where the stationary percentage of both kinds of nodes is 50 - 50 . \n fifty ws networks of @xmath3=1000 nodes and degree @xmath4 are prepared by gradual rewiring of randomly selected links , and they are stored when their clustering coefficient @xmath0 is in the range @xmath5 . \n the demanded @xmath6 are from 0.5 down to 0.1 . \n next we select randomly a given percentage of nodes and assign them to be in the state s ; other nodes are in the state d. + the simulation is performed as follows . \n a node is selected randomly ; if it is in the state s , we check all its neighbors . \n if there is a node d , it is converted to be s. if the randomly selected node is in the state d , we continue with the probability @xmath1 : namely , we check all his neighbors . if there is a node d , all its neighbors and all the neighbors of the initially selected node ( which appeared to be d ) are converted to be d. having done this , we select another node and continue . the change is done immediately . \n + in each time step , @xmath3 nodes are selected . \n there is 2500 time steps . \n the results are averaged over 50 networks , except in the case @xmath7 , when there is only one network and the simulation is run 50 times . \n the influence of the clustering coefficient @xmath0 on the population of s nodes is most apparent in the range of small initial population of these nodes , then the results to be shown here are obtained in this range . also , their dependence on the initial state is visible there . \n + in figs . 1 and 2 we show the time dependence of the population of s nodes for two values of the clustering coefficient @xmath0 , 0.1 and 0.5 . \n we observe that for @xmath0=0.1 ( fig.1 ) the time of simulation is long enough to get the stationary state . \n although we have not obtained this state for @xmath0=0.5 ( fig . \n 2 ) , the results clearly show that in the latter case the relatively large probability @xmath1 of the d process is not enough to reduce the population of s nodes as strongly , as it is found for @xmath0=0.1 . \n namely , while @xmath1=0.27 is enough to eliminate s nodes for @xmath0=0.1 , we find that for @xmath0=0.5 s nodes still prevail for @xmath1=0.38 . \n + the results on the population of s nodes after 2500 time steps are shown in figs . 3 and 4 for different values of @xmath0 and two different values of the initial population of s nodes , 0.1 and 0.25 . \n the results show how the fall of the observed population of s nodes with the probability @xmath1 depend on the clustering coefficient @xmath0 . \n clearly , the larger @xmath0 , the stronger is the process s , as larger values of @xmath1 are necessary to damp the population of s nodes . \n + from these results , we can evaluate the probability @xmath2 when the calculated population of s nodes is 0.5 after 2500 time steps . as shown in fig . \n 5 , the initial population of s nodes does not change these results qualitatively . in both cases , \n the observed probability @xmath2 increases with @xmath0 from about 0.26 to about 0.4 in the investigated range of @xmath0 . \n +    = 0.1 . \n the probability @xmath1 is from 0.2 to 0.27 with step 0.01 , in ascending order from the top to the bottom of the graph.,width=472 ]    = 0.5 . \n the probability @xmath1 is from 0.20 to 0.38 with step 0.02 , in ascending order from the top to the bottom of the graph.,width=472 ]     for the ws network ( 10 percent of all 1000 nodes are initially s - nodes ) for different clustering coefficient @xmath0= 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 ( curves from left to right , respectively),width=472 ]     for the ws network ( 25 percent of all 1000 nodes are initially s - nodes ) for different clustering coefficient @xmath0= 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 ( curves from left to right , respectively),width=472 ]     against the clustering coefficient @xmath0 for the ws network for different initial s - nodes participations equal to 10 percent ( bottom curve ) and 25 percent ( top curve).,width=472 ] \n the results indicate , that the s process is relatively more active for ws networks with large clustering coefficient @xmath0 . in particular , for the case \n when the initial amount of s nodes is 0.1 , the critical value @xmath2 is about 0.38 for @xmath7 , but only 0.25 for @xmath8 . when the initial amount of nodes is 0.25 , the same numbers for @xmath2 are 0.40 and 0.28 . \n this means , that in clusterized networks , a larger probability of the d process is necessary to balance the s process , than for the case when the clustering is small . + \n this result is opposite to the one obtained in our previous calculations @xcite , where the activation of d nodes was possible only if a node was simultaneously a nearest neighbor of both nodes of the activating pair of d nodes . \n this detail appears to be the cause of the observed different role of the clustering coefficient . \n while it seems natural that in our case the variation of @xmath0 is simply not relevant , the reversed influence of the clustering calls for an interpretation . \n + to accomplish this , let us compare two limit cases : the ws network without rewiring , where the clustering coefficient is maximal , and the bethe lattice . for the mean degree @xmath9=4 , as assumed here , the respective values of @xmath0 are 0.5 and 0.0 . \n although in our case the ws network with large amount of rewiring is not equivalent to the bethe lattice , it is anyway close to an erds - rnyi network , which could be approximated by a regular tree . for the purpose of our explanation , it is important only that in both cases the clustering coefficient is small . \n let us consider the simplified case of the velocity of spread of the d phase from a pair of neighbours , with the s process switched off and all nodes are simultaneously updated . in the ws network \n , this velocity is constant : for @xmath10=4 , two nodes are switched from s to d at each step . on the contrary , in the bethe lattice with the same degree the number of nodes switched from s to d along one tree branch is multiplied by @xmath11 at each time step . \n we should add that for the process investigated in @xcite , the above multiplication does not occur ; in trees the d process considered there does not work at all . \n + the list of applications of the sznajd model in politics and economy can be found in @xcite . \n here we add that the comparison of the results presented here and of those in @xcite reveals that a subtle modification of the mechanism seriously alters the intensity of the sznajd dynamics in clusterized networks . in the literature on the sznajd model , \n often we find a reference to the threshold effect introduced to sociology by granovetter @xcite . in this effect , people are inclined to imitate the others behaviour if more than a given number of persons behave in a given way . \n this means , that the imitators see all the imitated persons , and not only one . \n accordingly , this sociological effect is described more accurately by the model described in @xcite or even by the bootstrap percolation , than by the sznajd dynamics . \n the calculations were performed in the ack cyfronet , cracow , grants no . \n mnisw/ ibm_bc_hs21/agh/070/2010 and mnisw / sgi3700/ agh/070/2010 . \n this work was partially supported from the agh ust project no . \n 10.10.220.01 . \n 99 j. marro and r. dickman , _ nonequilibrium phase transitions in lattice models _ , cambridge up , cambridge 2002 . \n t. m. liggett , _ interacting particle systems _ , springer -

{"ContextTokens": 3203, "GeneratedTokens": 139, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last ten years , thanks to high precision radial velocity ( rv ) measurements , more than 100 extrasolar planets have been found . \n the most important observational campaigns up to now have focused on old solar type stars because such stars present all the characteristics ( small @xmath5 , high number of spectral lines , low activity ) to exploit the best potentialities of the rv technique . \n the orbits of the extra - solar planets are strikingly different from those of our solar system : some of them have massive planets of extremely short orbital periods ( so called `` hot jupiters '' or `` pegasides '' ) , while others exhibit very high eccentricities . \n these results have given a new strong impulse to the theoretical efforts to explain the formation and evolution of planetary systems . \n however , even the most fundamental questions are still open . \n how common are planetary systems ? \n how do planets form ? by core accretion or by gravitational instability in the disk . where do they form ? \n close - in jupiter mass planets can form in situ , or do they have to form at a certain distance and then migrate inward ? \n new insights should come from the determination of the orbital parameters for planets in early evolutionary phases . according to some scenarios the frequency of planets \n was initially much higher than is observed in old stars , as a substantial fraction of the planets might have been either ejected from the system , or have been engulfed in the host stars . since capture of planets is highly unlikely , the frequency of planets of young stars ought to be higher than that of old stars . \n the aim of this survey is to find out by how much . \n another issue we could address concerns the evolution of the orbital parameters . in particular it would be important to know whether close - in planets have round orbits when they form or eccentric orbits , which then get circularised by tidal interaction with the host star .    there is an additional reasons for searching for planets of young stars . as pointed out by sudarsky , burrows , & hubeny ( 2003 ) even old exo - planets orbiting a solar - like star at 0.1 au would have a temperature of up to 900  k , because they are heated by the star . a massive , isolated planet with an age between @xmath6 to @xmath7 \n yrs would also have a temperature of more than 800  k but this time because it is still contracting . for close - in young planets both effects would add up resulting in objects of spectral type early l or even late m , which would be only 5 to 7 mag fainter than the host star . \n the direct detection of these objects , especially in the infrared light , would be possible by means of interferometric observations as well as tracking down spectral signatures , giving access to fundamental parameters like temperature , radius and true masses . \n the presence of spots and/or plages in the photosphere of active stars changes the profile of spectral lines causing fictitious variations in the rv measurements ( the so - called jitter ) . \n not only this source of noise can mask the periodical variations which are the characteristic signature of the presence of a planet , but what makes it even worse is the fact that the presence of spots combined with the stellar rotation can itself introduce spurious periodicities in the radial velocity signal.this explains why young stars , which are supposed to be active , have so far been excluded from the major rv surveys for planets detection . \n however paulson et al . ( 2002 ) monitored 82 stars in the hyades ( age @xmath8 700 myr ) finding a significant correlation between simultaneous rv and @xmath9 for only 5 stars . indeed exactly \n to what extent the stellar activity can hinder the detection of exoplanets in rv measurement has not yet clearly assessed . \n weighing pros and cons we finally decided to undertake a rv survey of young stars . \n observations began in 2001 . \n we monitored a sample of 46 young , nearby dwarf stars of late spectral type and took 1500 spectra of these up to now . \n the observations have been carried out at the state observatory of turingia ( tls ) using the 2 m `` alfred jensch '' telescope which is equipped with a coud echelle spectrograph . \n we used the visual grism which cover the spectral region from 4660 to 7410 @xmath10 in 44 orders . with a slit width of 1.2 arcsec a resolution of @xmath11 \n is achieved . an iodine cell placed in front of the slit generates a very dense system of absorption lines superimposed onto the stellar spectrum , which provides a highly precise wavelength scale and at same time allows to measure the psf in situ over the spectrum . \n radial velocities ( rv s ) are measured by means of a software package called radial developed at the university of texas and mcdonald observatory , based on the methods described in marcy & butler(1992 ) and valenti , butler & marcy(1995 ) . \n the identification of bona - fide young post - t - tauri stars near the sun still is an open astrophysical issue ( jensen 2001 ) . \n recently many nearby associations of young stars have been recognised : twa , @xmath12 pic , tucana - horologium , @xmath13 cha , ab dor ( zuckermann & song 2004 ) . for such coeval stellar groups statistics considerations help to achieve reliable estimations of the common age . \n unfortunately all those associations are located in the southern hemisphere.thus in selecting the sample of stars to survey we did the hobson s choice and looked out for young field stars . \n one of the best indicators of young age , especially for g and k stars , is the presence of the lithium lii@xmath146708 absorption line . \n the convective envelope of these stars brings the lithium in contact with the stellar core where the temperature is high enough to cause its burning . as a consequence the lithium in the stellar atmospheres is progressively depleted . \n the lithium abundances can thus be used as an age estimator . \n fig.1 shows the lii@xmath146708 equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of the @xmath15 for the stars in our sample and , as a comparison , for the pleiades ( age @xmath16 myr ) . as can be seen for the stars of pleiades , the lii@xmath146708 ew scatters significantly for the same @xmath15 . \n thus it is not possible determine the age for every single star in our sample precisely . \n rather , in a schematic way , we can subdivide our sample in two groups , one having ages comparable to the pleiades and the other consisting of older stars . \n in fact , many stars in the latter group have been recognised as members of the ursa major association which is 300 myr old ( soderblom & major 1993 ) ( 500 myr according to king & schuler 2005 ) .    based on the hipparcos \n parallaxes all our stars are at a distance of less than 50 pc from the sun , and 36 of them are closer than 30 pc . \n accordingly , they are relatively bright , ranging from the fifth to the ninth visual magnitude . \n fig.2 ( left panel ) shows the average internal errors @xmath17 in the rv s as a function of the projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath5 . \n as expected for rapidly rotating stars , the spectral lines broadening makes it difficult to achieve high precision rv values . \n however , up to a @xmath18 km / s , we routinely get internal errors of 10 to 15 m / s . \n apart from the fact that the rv s for rapidly rotating stars are more difficult to determine , these stars are also more active . in order to demonstrate this , we consider the @xmath19 which is defined as the square - root of the difference between the standard deviation of the observed rv s ( @xmath20 ) and the @xmath17 squared . \n @xmath19 thus is a measure of the rv - variations presumably due to stellar activity . \n 2 ( right ) shows @xmath19 against @xmath5 . \n it can clearly be seen that stars of larger @xmath5 also show larger @xmath19-values . on the other hand the majority of stars in our sample which \n have @xmath18 km / s show a @xmath19 lower than 35 m / s . \n such a level of ` noise ' in the rv - measurements , even if larger than typical values for old dwarf stars of the same spectral type ( santos et al . \n 2000 ) , still allows the detection of a rv - signal of most of the known exo - planets . \n for instance , a planet with @xmath0 = 1 @xmath2 in a circular orbit around a 1 @xmath21 star with a period @xmath22 days induces a stellar wobble with a rv semi - amplitude of @xmath23 m / s which is larger than the scatter caused by activity for a star with a @xmath18 km / s .      in order to derive upper limits for the detection of planets in our sample \n , we carried out simulations . \n for each point on a grid of values of the orbital period @xmath3 and the planetary mass @xmath24 , assuming for the star a mass on the basis of its spectral type , we generate a sinusoidal rv curve . \n the curve is then sampled in the same way as the real data for that star , obtaining a set of simulated rv values.in the next step , we add noise of normal distribution to the data . \n the noise is scaled so that the @xmath25 of the simulated data is equal to the observed @xmath20 . the whole procedure is repeated 5000 times , varying the phases randomly . for \n each of the 5000 simulated data - sets we then derive the value of the periodogram ( @xmath26 ) for that period @xmath3 ( scargle 1982 ) and thus obtain for a given @xmath3 and @xmath0 a distribution of @xmath26 , which is compared to a similar distribution for @xmath27 . \n if the two distributions do not overlap , we conclude that a planet of that @xmath3 and @xmath0 can be excluded . \n similarly , from the overlap of the two distributions , we can calculate the probability for excluding such planet . \n the results of our simulations for two opposite cases are shown in fig.3 . \n quite remarkably in the best conditions ( panel @xmath28 ) we easily would have been able to detect a planet with @xmath29 for a period as large as 300 days . besides , even in the worst case ( panel @xmath30 ) \n thanks to the high number of data points ( @xmath31 ) we are still sensible to very hot jupiter - mass planets .      in the whole sample \n we have found only three objects which show a long period rv trend compatible with the presence of a stellar companion and one young planet candidate . \n the rv data set for all these stars has been analysed in the same way : we calculated the scargle periodogram and in correspondence to the periods with higher peaks we estimate the weighted least squares best - fit orbital solution . \n the phase - folded rv curve for our candidate planet is shown in fig.4 together with the best - fit orbital parameters . as we know that rv variations can also be induced by stellar activity , we analysed the hipparcos photometry and found a p=1.6477 days periodicity . \n it is hence possible that the rv as well as the photometric variations originate from a @xmath8 1.5 days stellar rotational period . \n however the star does not present enhanced x - ray luminosity and strong emission in the cores of the caii h and k lines , which are typical of fast rotators , and the @xmath32km / s would imply that we are observing the star almost pole - on . \n further simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations will possibly confirm or discard the planet hypothesis . \n jensen e.l.n . \n 2001 , in asp conf . \n 244 , young stars near earth : progress and prospects , ed . \n r. jayawardhana & t.p . \n greene ( san francisco : asp ) , 3 king j.r . & schuler s.c . \n 2005 , , 117 , 911 marcy g.w . & \n butler r.p . \n 1992 , , 104 , 270 paulson d.b . , saar s.h . \n , cochran w.d . & hatzes a.p . \n 2002 124 , 572 santos n.c . , \n mayor m. , naef d. , pepe f. , queloz d. , udry s. & blecha a. 2000 , 361 , 265 scargle , j.d . \n 1982 , , 263 , 835 soderblom d.r . & major m. 1993 , , 402 , 5 sudarsky d. , burrows a. , & hubeny i. 2003 , , 588 , 1121 valenti j.a . , butler r.p . & marcy g.w . \n 1995 , , 107 , 966 zuckermann b. & song i. 2004 , , 42 , 685", "StartTimeOffset": 68466921496, "RequestID": "ffdac356271848e3a0f0e1d1c11faf7a", "TotalTokens": 3342}

taylor fingers that led him to new fingering solutions keeping the same asymptotic behavior as time @xmath0 . \n recently , hele - shaw flows and saffman - taylor fingering phenomenon have been studied intensively in wedges ( see , e.g. , @xcite nad the references therein ) . in particular , kadanoff @xcite suggested a self - similar interface evolution between two walls in a hele - shaw cell expressed explicitly by a rather simple parametric function with a logarithmic singularity at one of the walls . by this note \n we perturb kadanoff s solution and give new explicit solutions with similar asymptotics . \n we suppose that the viscous fluid occupies a simply connected domain @xmath1 in the phase @xmath2-plane whose boundary @xmath3 consists of two walls @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the corner and a free interface @xmath6 between them at a moment @xmath7 . \n the inviscid fluid ( or air ) fills the complement to @xmath1 . \n the simplifying assumption of constant pressure at the interface between the fluids means that we omit the effect of surface tension . \n the velocity must be bounded close to the contact point that yields the contact angle between the walls of the wedge and the moving interface to be @xmath8 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . \n a limiting case corresponds to one finite contact point and the other tends to infinity . by a shift \n we can place the point of the intersection of the wall extensions at the origin . to simplify matter , we set the corner of angle @xmath9 between the walls so that the positive real axis @xmath10 contains one of the walls and fix this angle as @xmath11 $ ] .    in the zero -

{"ContextTokens": 3455, "GeneratedTokens": 354, "SynthesizedBody": "we have witnessed in the last decade the detection of free - floating substellar objects with increasingly lower masses and cooler temperatures that reach the canonical planetary regime of a few jupiter masses and a few hundred kelvin . \n examples are free - floating planetary mass objects in star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ultracool y dwarfs in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n one of the main open questions in the theory of star formation is : how do these free - floating planetary - like objects - and brown dwarfs in general - form ? \n a high - density phase is necessary for the gravitational fragmentation to create very small jeans - unstable cores . \n proposed scenarios to prevent a substellar core in a dense environment from accreting to stellar mass are ejection of the core through dynamical interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) or photo - evaporation of the gas envelope through radiation of a nearby hot star ( e.g. , ) . also suggested was the formation of brown dwarfs by disk instabilities in the outer regions of massive circumstellar disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n alternatively , brown dwarfs could form in a more isolated mode by direct collapse . \n for example , filament collapse ( e.g. , inutsuka & miyama 1992 ) might form low - mass cores that experience high self - erosion in outflows and become brown dwarfs ( machida et al . \n a key to understanding star and brown dwarf formation is to observationally define the minimum mass that the canonical star - like mode of formation can produce by detecting and exploring the main features characteristic of this process , such as disks , accretion , outflows , and orbiting planets , for the lowest - mass objects . \n the first indications for the existence of free - floating planetary mass objects came from observations in the very young @xmath2 orionis cluster @xcite . while it is difficult to establish the membership to @xmath2 ori and , therefore , the age and mass , some very promising candidates were detected . \n an example is sori60 , for which mid - ir excess indicates a young age @xcite . \n other candidates , however , turned out not to be members of the cluster , such as sori70 ( @xcite ; pea ramirez , this volume ) . \n the coolest known free - floating objects are y dwarfs , of which 17 are spectroscopically confirmed to date @xcite . while we can expect many planetary mass objects among y dwarfs , the age and mass of these nearby field objects are in most cases unknown . the first confirmed y dwarf , wise1828 + 2650 @xcite , was suggested to have a temperature and mass of only about 300k and 3 - 6@xmath3 , respectively , although there are indications that the temperature might be significantly larger @xcite . very recently \n a remarkably cold and low - mass object was detected in the very near vicinity of our sun : wise0855 - 0714 at a distance of 2.2pc has a proposed temperature and mass of 250k and 3 - 10@xmath3 , respectively @xcite . \n nearby objects that do allow constraints on their age and , therefore , mass are members of young moving groups ( see also faherty , this volume ) . \n one of them , psoj318.5 - 22 , was recently detected to be a planetary - mass member of @xmath1 pic . \n depending on the assumed age for @xmath1 pic its mass is estimated to 6.5@xmath3 ( age : 12myr ) and 8.4@xmath3 ( 21myr ) , respectively ( @xcite ; allers , this volume ) .    to address the question how free - floating planets form , we observed ots44 , the lowest mass known member of the chamaeleon  i star - forming region ( chai , @xmath02myr , 160pc ) . \n ots44 was first identified as a brown dwarf candidate in a deep near -

ir j - band spectra ( 1.1 - 1.4 @xmath10 m ) of ots44 with sinfoni at the vlt at a medium spectral resolution ( r=@xmath11/@xmath12 , ) . \n we discovered a strong , broad , and variable paschen@xmath1 ( pa@xmath1 ) emission line of ots44 in these spectra , as shown in fig.[fig : pabeta ] ( left , middle ) . \n furthermore , a prominent h@xmath13 emission line is visible in the optical spectrum of @xcite as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : pabeta ] \n . both of these hydrogen emission lines exhibit a broad profile with velocities of @xmath14200kms@xmath15 or more . \n we determined the equivalent width ( ew ) of both lines . \n the h@xmath13 line has a symmetrically shaped profile with an ew of -141 , demonstrating that ots44 is actively accreting . \n the profile of the pa@xmath1 line is significantly variable between the two observing epochs separated by a few days ( ew of -7 and -4 ) . \n we determined the mass accretion rate of ots44 based on the h@xmath13 line by assuming that the h@xmath13 emission is entirely formed by accretion processes . \n we derived an h@xmath13 line luminosity log@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) of -6.16 for ots44 and applied the empirical relation between the h@xmath13 line and accretion luminosity of fang et al . \n ( 2009 ) , which is based on log@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) ranging between -1 and -6 . \n we estimate an mass accretion rate of ots44 of 7.6@xmath18@xmath19 . \n pa@xmath1 emission of ots44 in vlt / sinfoni spectra ( left , middle ) and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum ( right ) . \n the dashed lines are gaussian fits to the profiles . from . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]   pa@xmath1 emission of ots44 in vlt / sinfoni spectra ( left , middle ) and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum ( right ) . \n the dashed lines are gaussian fits to the profiles . from . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]   pa@xmath1 emission of ots44 in vlt / sinfoni spectra ( left , middle ) and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum ( right ) . \n the dashed lines are gaussian fits to the profiles . from . \n , title=\"fig : \" ] \n we have discovered strong , broad , and variable pa@xmath1 emission of the young very low - mass substellar object ots44 ( m9.5 ) in vlt / sinfoni spectra , which is evidence for active accretion of a planetary mass object . \n we determined the properties of the disk that surrounds ots44 through ` mc3d ` radiative transfer modeling of flux measurements from the optical to the far - ir including herschel data . \n we found that ots44 has a highly flared disk ( @xmath61.3 ) with a mass of 3.25@xmath7 , i.e. about @xmath8 . \n we also investigated the h@xmath13 line of ots44 in a magellani / imacs spectrum spectrum and found strong h@xmath13 emission with an ew of -141 indicative of active accretion . \n ots44 will become a y dwarf in @xmath20 years . \n for this illustration of the evolution of the effective temperature of a very low - mass substellar object we used a plot of @xcite . note that the model temperatures are hotter than the observationally determined temperatures , which are 1700k for ots44 , 1200k for psoj318.5 - 22 , and 250k for wise0855 - 0714 . ] \n both the pa@xmath1 and h@xmath13 emission lines of ots44 have broad profiles with the wings extending to velocities of about @xmath14200kms@xmath15 . \n the pa@xmath1 emission is significantly variable on timescales of a few days , indicating variability in accretion - related processes of ots44 . \n we estimated the mass accretion rate of ots44 to 7.6@xmath18@xmath21 by using the h@xmath13 line . \n a mass accretion rate based on the pa@xmath1 line gives a significantly higher value , and we speculate that part of the pa@xmath1 emission might come from other processes related to accretion , such as outflows . \n furthermore , in the course of studying ots44 , we fitted a photospheric bt - settl model to its optical and near - ir sed and derived a lower effective temperature and higher extinction than was previously found @xcite . \n we have presented the first detection of pa@xmath1 emission for a free - floating object below the deuterium - burning limit . \n our analysis of pa@xmath1 and h@xmath13 emission of ots44 demonstrates that free - floating objects of a few jupiter masses can be active accretors . \n ots44 can be seen as free - floating analog of recently detected accreting planetary mass companions that orbit stars ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and it plays a key role in the study of disk evolution and accretion physics in an extremely low - gravity and -temperature environment . furthermore , ots44 ( m9.5 ) is the lowest - mass object to date for which the disk mass is determined based on far - ir data . \n also interesting in this context is the mm - detection of an m9 dwarf @xcite . our detections therefore extend the exploration of disks and accretion during the t  tauri phase down to the planetary mass regime . plotting the relative disk masses of stars and brown dwarfs including ots44 ( fig.[fig : mdisk ] ) \n shows that the ratio of the disk - to - central - mass of about 10@xmath22 found for objects between 0.03@xmath23 and 14@xmath23 is also valid for ots44 at a mass of about 0.01@xmath23 . \n furthermore , the mass accretion rate of ots44 is consistent with a decreasing trend from stars of several solar masses to substellar objects down to 0.01@xmath23 ( fig.[fig : macc ] ) . \n it is also obvious from this figure that ots44 has a relatively high mass accretion rate considering its small mass . \n these observations show that the processes that accompany canonical star formation , disks and accretion , are present down to a central mass of a few jupiter masses . \n this suggests that ots44 is formed like a star and that the increasing number of young free - floating planets and ultra - cool t and y field dwarfs are the low - mass extension of the stellar population . \n figure[fig : teffevol ] illustrates how a very young free - floating planetary mass object of about 10 jupiter masses , such as ots44 , cools down while aging and becomes an l dwarf at about 10myr , similar to psoj318.5 - 22 , and a y dwarf at @xmath241gyr , similar to wise0855 - 0714 . \n this illustration uses a plot of the evolution of the effective temperature by @xcite . \n while this might not be the most sophisticated evolutionary model to date and discrepancies with observations can be seen in the temperature ( see caption of fig.[fig : teffevol ] ) , it nevertheless shows very nicely the general picture of a substellar object shifting through spectral classes during its evolution .", "StartTimeOffset": 77981763680, "RequestID": "dd892930e28946279cd0faecfd66b7d3", "TotalTokens": 3809}

dense system - the `` disappearance '' of one of the two jets in back - to - back jet production in central collisions , together with the associated suppression of high-@xmath1 jet events . \n further exploration of this phenomenon , as well as systematic investigations of these collisions , will be possible at the lhc . with a planned ultimate energy of 5.5 tev / nucleon for pb - pb collisions , the anticipated program benefits from a factor of 30 increase in @xmath2 as well as from highly hermetic detector systems with essentially complete coverage in precision calorimetry . \n the complementary heavy ion studies planned for the atlas , cms , and alice experiments at lhc together cover the full spectrum in @xmath1 and pseudorapidity @xmath3 needed to understand the complex and potentially surprising collision events that are anticipated . in the following \n is a brief discussion of the planned program for the atlas experiment , with an overview of the detector and the heavy ion program followed by the prospects for advances in jet quenching studies . \n atlas and cms are the two broad - focus experiments at lhc , with complementary designs that provide excellent resolution and highly hermetic coverage in calorimetry , tracking , and muon systems . \n the atlas calorimetry is a particular strong point for jet quenching studies , with an angular coverage down to @xmath4 5 ( 0.001@xmath5 ) and fine - grained segmentation . \n atlas is comprised of three major detector component types : the inner tracking systems , the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and the muon systems . each is made up of several subsystems ; for an in - depth discussion of these as well as of the superconducting magnets , trigger , readout , data acquisition , controls and other system components , see @xcite . \n the inner tracking systems , which operate in a 2 t solenoidal magnetic field , consist of three subsystems with a total of more than 86 million electronic channels . \n the calorimeters , which represent nearly 190,000 channels , are configured in four subsystems , three of which are based on liquid argon technology . \n the muon systems , which have in total one million channels , make use of toroidal magnetic fields of up to 2.5 and 3.5 t in the barrel and endcap region , respectively . \n an average of 99% of the channels in each of these subsystems were operational well in advance of the 2009 data taking . \n a complex , three - level trigger and data acquisition system selects and transports the data to disk ; calibration , reconstruction , and simulation software are exercised on the worldwide computing grid of lhc , a network of @xmath6 computers located in more than 50 countries around the world . \n the expectations for the heavy ion data are based on extrapolations from rhic energies and from the first p - p data acquired at lhc in 2009 and 2010 . \n because the energy available in the collisions is so much greater than for previous measurements , the first order of business is to check the validity of these extrapolations @xcite . \n of particular interest are the energy density and degree of collectivity of the response , as expressed by global observables such as the charged particle multiplicity and the elliptic flow @xcite . these observables are critical for validating the physical picture extrapolated from rhic measurements , and they can begin to be determined with a relatively small integrated luminosity from the first few days of heavy ion collision data . \n subsequent topics that can be addressed with a one - month run at the planned luminosity of @xmath7 include studies of quarkonia production and of hard probes such as jets and high-@xmath8 hadrons . \n in addition to light quark jets , heavy quark jets and heavy mesons can be accessed . \n the expected sensitivity of atlas to heavy ion events has been fully explored using the hijing @xcite event generator and the full simulation and reconstruction chain of atlas . \n some highlights of these studies are mentioned here , and the results are more fully documented elsewhere @xcite . the first variable to be determined from the data is the event centrality , on which most other observables depend . \n the event centrality can be estimated from the response of the calorimeters ; according to the simulations , the number of collisions within the event , the number of collision participants , and the impact parameter are all monotonically related to the total energy deposits in the forward calorimeter , the electromagnetic calorimeters , and the hadronic calorimeters . \n the estimation of the event centrality using such a primitive measure from several calibrated detector systems will facilitate consistency checks over a wide range in pseudorapidity @xmath3 . \n r0.5     a fundamental observable depending on the event centrality is the charged particle multiplicity @xmath9 . \n it has been shown that @xmath9 can be independently estimated by counting the number of pixel hits in the first , second , and third layers of the atlas pixel detector @xcite . \n the method requires application of a simple correction function that is determined primarily from geometry . \n other methods have also been explored , such as the `` tracklet '' method [ 8 ] that combines an event vertex with hits in the first two pixel layers . \n the determination of @xmath9 will allow a first estimate of the energy density and will eliminate significant uncertainties in extrapolations of this quantity from lower energy collisions . \n the distribution of the transverse energy with angle @xmath10 has been shown to be accurately determined in atlas using a simple energy sum over the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter cells . according to simulations , \n this method reproduces the event - by - event distribution in @xmath11 to the few percent level over the wide angular range @xmath12 . \n elliptic flow @xmath13 is a parameter characterizing the azimuthal angular distribution of particles emitted with respect to the reaction plane defined by the impact parameter vector and the beam axis . \n it is defined through the fourier expansion of this angular distribution    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the angle of the reaction plane within atlas and @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle of an individual particle . \n measurement of elliptic flow in atlas has been explored using three different methods , the reaction plane method , the two - particle correlation method , and the lee - yang zeros method @xcite . \n hijing events have been simulated for impact parameters b=2.3 , 7.0 , and 10.7 fm , and the three methods give results that are consistent within approximately 5% for the most central collisions and somewhat better for the most peripheral collisions as seen in fig . \n the resolution for determination of the reaction plane is particularly good for atlas since this can be performed independently in several different detectors systems , all of which have complete coverage in azimuthal angle @xmath16 . in the simulation studies , the resolution correction averaged over seven subsystems for central events was 0.86 , very close to unity , demonstrating the excellent event plane resolution available in atlas . \n the capability for heavy quarkonium reconstruction has been studied in the dimuon channel . as an example , the mass resolution found for the @xmath17 1s state was found to be approximately 120 mev , easily adequate for separation of the 1s and 2s @xmath17 states @xcite . \n this capability will significantly extend the reach of the color screening studies with quarkonia that have been performed previously at rhic and cern . \n additional studies in the dimuon channel have been performed to determine the atlas performance for identification of @xmath18 and @xmath19 bosons in the heavy ion environment . in these studies , \n a mass resolution for @xmath19 bosons of approximately 2.2 gev was found , comparable to that found in the p - p environment , with a background level of less than 10% for central collisions . \n .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] \n jet suppression is an important component of the atlas heavy ion physics program , and an area where the excellent calorimetry and hermetic coverage of the calorimeters is very beneficial . \n simulations have been performed for light quark jets and photon - tagged jets as well as for heavy quark signatures . \n the background from the low - energy qcd interactions is significant , thus , methods have been developed for identifying light quark jets using a background subtraction procedure , and to identify photons with good efficiency while rejecting signals from other neutral particles @xcite .    in the heavy ion environment , \n jets in atlas after background subtraction are reconstructed with essentially full efficiency above 70 - 80 gev , with no additional corrections required @xcite as seen in fig . \n 2 ( left panel ) . further , according to simulations , there is essentially no distortion of the extracted light quark jet fragmentation function above @xmath20 , and the distortions due to the heavy ion background for @xmath21 can be corrected reliably @xcite . \n extensive studies of direct photons and photon - jet correlations have been performed with hijing simulated data . in order to reject background , isolation cuts and shower shape cuts \n have been developed which can be optimized to preserve good reconstruction efficiency while rejecting hits from neutral hadrons . \n these studies show that excellent direct photon statistics will be obtained as seen in fig . \n 2 ( right panel ) . further , photon - jet correlations are clearly accessible as seen in fig . 3 ( left panel ) @xcite . \n heavy quark jets have been studied in the dimuon channel , using the semileptonic decay of b and c quarks . according to these simulations , \n the purity of the dimuon sample above 50 gev is substantial as can be seen in fig . \n 3 ( right panel ) . heavy quark suppression at rhic remains an unsolved puzzle @xcite , although it can be explained in alternative pictures @xcite , and thus it is of high scientific interest to address it at the lhc . \n further studies relevant to heavy quark jet suppression in atlas are planned , e.g. , in the semileptonic decay to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and in reconstruction of heavy mesons using detached vertex tagging .", "StartTimeOffset": 80506935912, "RequestID": "51415c0d0c1c4d3a896640382c45812f", "TotalTokens": 2722}
{"ContextTokens": 3280, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "bag - of - words ( bow ) was originally proposed for document retrieval . in recent years , the method has been successfully applied to image retrieval tasks in computer vision community @xcite . \n the method is attractive because of its efficient image representation and retrieval . \n bow represents an image as a sparse vector of visual words , and thus images can be searched efficiently using an inverted index file system . \n other major application areas of the bow method are appearance - based mobile robot localization and slam problems . \n the fundamental issue involved with the appearance - based approach to both visual slam and global localization is the place recognition . \n robot should be able to recognize the places it has visited before to localise itself or refine the map of the environment . \n this task is performed by matching the current view of the robot to the existing map that contains the images of the previously visited locations . in this paper \n we consider the problem of appearance - based localization in which the map is known _ a priori_.    in large - scale environments maps contain too many images to match . \n the image search in such a large map is still a challenging and open problem . \n matching images by comparing the local features of each image directly to the local features of all other images in the map is not practical . \n bag - of - words proposes a more efficient approach ; first , rather than matching with a pool of million visual features extracted from many thousands of images , the local features are mapped to a smaller number of vocabulary words that are built in an offline phase . this process is called vector - quantization . \n once the visual words are identified in the query image , they are used as indices into the image database , to directly retrieve the images that share the same words . \n when the vocabulary is large , the vector - quantization process can be a computationally expensive task in real - time localization . \n considerable research has been done to speed up the search ; some papers @xcite do approximate nearest - neighbor search using structures like vocabulary trees @xcite ; some methods reduce the number of local image features by selecting only a fraction of features that are highly discriminative @xcite ; another group makes use of more compact feature descriptors like @xcite . in this paper , we first show that some image retrieval tasks are _ easier _ for bow method . \n the hardness criteria , defined later , concerns how distinctive the image query is among all images in the dataset . given this criteria , \n we show that the bow search can be terminated earlier for easier queries . \n this means , in such queries , mapping only a portion of features can be sufficient to yield a relatively good result . \n the stopping rule saves considerable amount of computational resources . \n the intuition behind this is that when there are many similar images to the query image , in terms of the number of common words they share , the search becomes more difficult as more processing is required to find the closest match candidate . \n whereas when the query image has only a few match candidates , i.e. , it shares its visual words with only a few images , the search becomes easy as vector - quantizing only a small number of features is sufficient to find the closest match to the query . by exploiting this fact \n , we can stop the vector - quantization when the search is easy and the nearest neighbor to the query is easy to find . \n our method acts as an approximate image search algorithm . \n our experimental results show that the accuracy decreases only slightly while the computational cost decreases dramatically \n .    our approach can be best compared with the approach of cummins and newman @xcite who use concentration inequalities ( bennett s inequality in their case ) for early bail - out in multi - hypothesis testing that excludes unlikely location hypotheses from further evaluation . \n however , we use a different bail - out strategy for the process of vector - quantization . in the next section , \n we briefly review the image representation and the inverted - index search algorithm used in bow framework . \n this is followed by a review of the localization algorithms that employ bow for the image search . \n our proposed method to improve the efficiency of bow is described in section  [ sec : method ] . \n section  [ sec : results ] presents the experimental results and the evaluation criteria , and the result of our comparisons . \n finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclud ] . \n bag - of - words is a popular model that has been used in image classification , objection recognition , and appearance - based navigation . because of its simplicity and search efficiency \n it has been used as a successful method in web search engines for large - scale image and document retrieval @xcite . \n bag - of - words model represents an image by a sparse vector of visual words . \n image features , e.g. , sifts @xcite , are sampled and clustered ( e.g. , using k - means ) in order to quantize the space into a discrete set of visual words . \n the centroids of clusters are then considered as visual words which form the visual vocabulary . \n once a new image arrives , its local features are extracted and vector - quantized into the visual words . \n each word might be weighed by some score which is either the word frequency in the image ( i.e. , _ tf _ ) or the `` term frequency - inverse document frequency '' or _ \n tf - idf _ @xcite . \n a histogram of weighted visual words , which is typically sparse , is then built and used to represent the image . \n an inverted index file , used in the bow framework , is an efficient image search tool in which the visual words are mapped to the database images . \n each visual word serves as a table index and points to the indices of the database images in which the word occurs . \n since not every image contains every word and also each word does not occur in every image , the retrieval through inverted - index file is fast . \n bag - of - words model has been extensively used as the basis of the image search in appearance - based localization or slam algorithms @xcite . \n cummins and newman @xcite propose a probabilistic framework over the bag - of - words representation of locations , for the appearance - based place recognition . along with the visual vocabulary they also learn the chow liu tree to capture the co - occurrences of visual words . \n similarly , angeli _ et al . _ \n @xcite develop a probabilistic approach for place recognition in slam . \n they build two visual vocabularies incrementally and use two bow representations as an input of a bayesian filtering framework to estimate the likelihood of loop closures .    assuming each image has hundreds of sift features , mapping the features to the visual words , using a linear search method , is computationally expensive and not practical for real - time localization . \n researchers have tackled this problem with different approaches that speeds up the search but at the expense of accuracy . \n a number of papers have employed compact feature descriptors that speeds up the search . \n glvez - lpez and tards in @xcite propose to use fast @xcite and breif @xcite binary features and introduce a bow model that descritizes a binary space . \n similarly , @xcite use surf @xcite to have a more compact feature descriptor . \n another approach is to use approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms , like hierarchical k - means @xcite , kd - trees @xcite or graph - based search methods @xcite and @xcite , to speed up the quantization process . \n achar _ et al . \n _ @xcite and zhang @xcite propose reducing the number of features in each image , thereby reducing ( removing ) the vector - quantization process . \n they keep track of the features that are repeatable over time . however , these approaches are more specific to the navigation problems where the data is sequential and there exists considerable overlaps between consecutive images . \n our approach is more similar to this group as we also reduce the amount of feature mapping . \n however rather than only selecting a small set of features , we use all features but we stop the mapping process when necessary . our approach is also more general as it does not depend on the sequential property of the data . \n vector - quantization ( vq ) is an expensive process when the bow - based image retrieval is performed in large - scale environments , in which hundreds of features extracted from an image need to be matched against hundreds of thousands of visual words . \n the question is if we really need to vector - quantize all features ? \n depending on the difficulty level of the search , the number of features to be converted to visual words may vary . \n we call a search difficult when there are many similar images to the query and thus finding the nearest neighbor among all those candidates requires more computations \n . whereas in an easy search , the query image is similar to only a few images in the database and it can find its true match after processing only a small percentage of features . \n figure  [ diff_search ] and figure  [ easy_search ] show examples of easy and difficult searches . \n the histograms show the similarity of each database image to the query based on the _ tf - idf _ score . \n the difficult search needs to process at least @xmath0 of features to find the closest match to the query ( indicated by the peak of the histogram ) , however the easy search can stop the search after processing only @xmath1 of features as the peak does not change until the end of the search . comparing the distance between the peak and average of the histograms , it can be seen that in difficult search this distance is smaller than that in easy search , which is expected . \n initially each image starts with no vote . in original bow \n , image features are converted to visual words one by one and the histogram ( of images scores ) is built incrementally . \n each bin of the histogram corresponds to one of the database images and indicates the score of that image . \n each visual word will cast a distance - weighted vote for multiple images , i.e. , histogram bins . \n this process continues until all words cast their votes and then the peak of the histogram ( the bin with the highest score ) determines the nearest neighbor to the query .    [ \n cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the experimental results shown in tables [ exp1:city1 ] to [ exp1:newcol2 ] have been performed by rule 1 . \n figures  [ fig : rules ] and [ fig : rules2 ] show the result of applying different rules to the bow search on the new college ( right - side sequence ) and city center ( right - side sequence ) datasets , respectively . \n the graphs have been generated by varying the stopping thresholds . as can be seen , \n stopping rules # 1 and # 3 generate better results . by reducing the number of processed features to half the accuracy only decreases slightly .    figure  [ fig : feat_im ] shows another experiment that validates our proposed stopping method . \n figure shows the relation between the number of images and the percentage of features they need to process to obtain the same result as that of the original bow . \n the experiment has been done on city center dataset ( left - side sequence ) with the stopping rule # 1 used . \n we set the threshold to @xmath2 to get exactly the same accuracy of original bow . \n as can be seen , only @xmath3 images need to process @xmath4@xmath5 of their features , another @xmath6 only need to vector - quantize smaller percentages of features . \n we observed that the computational requirements of the bow method can be significantly reduced by allocating less computations to easier search queries . \n deciding when to terminate the search is treated as a stopping problem . \n we proposed several stopping rules and showed their effectiveness on an appearance - based localization problem . \n a. angeli , d. filliat , s. doncieux , and j .- a . \n meyer , `` a fast and incremental method for loop - closure detection using bags of visual words '' , _ ieee transactions on robotics , special issue on visual slam _ , pp . \n 1027 - 1037 , 2008 . \n k. hajebi , y. abbasi - yadkori , h. shahbazi , and h. zhang , `` fast approximate nearest - neighbor search with k - nearest neighbor graph '' , in _ proc . \n of the twenty - second international joint conference on artificial intelligence ( ijcai ) _ , vol . \n 2 , pp . 1312 - 1317 , 2011 . \n r. i. hartley and a. zisserman , _ multiple view geometry in computer vision . \n _ , cambridge university press , second edition , 2004 \n . w. hoeffding , `` probability inequalities for sums of bounded random variables '' , _ journal of the american statistical association _ , vol . \n 13 - 30 , 1963 . \n f. li and j. kosecka , `` probabilistic location recognition using reduced feature set '' , in _ proc . of the ieee international conference on robotics and automation ( icra ) _ , 2006 . \n o. maron and a. w. moore , `` hoeffding races : accelerating model selection search for classification and function approximation '' , in _ advances in neural information processing systems ( nips ) _ , vol . \n 59 - 66 , 1993 . \n d. nister and h. stewenius , `` scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree '' , in _ proc . of the ieee international conference on computer vision and pattern recognition ( cvpr ) \n 2 , pp . 2161 - 2168 , 2006 . \n j. philbin , o. chum , m. isard , j. sivic , and a. zisserman , `` object retrieval with large vocabularies and fast spatial matching '' , in _ proc . of the ieee international conference on computer vision and pattern recognition ( cvpr ) _ , pp . 1 - 8 , 2007 . \n h. shahbazi and h. zhang , `` application of locality sensitive hashing to real - time loop closure detection '' , in _ proc . of the ieee / rsj international conference on intelligent robots and systems ( iros ) _ , 2011 . \n j. sivic and a. zisserman , `` video google : efficient visual search of videos : toward category - level object recognition '' , in _ proc . of the ieee international conference on computer vision and pattern recognition ( iccv ) \n _ , pp . 1470 - 1477 , 2003 .", "StartTimeOffset": 85646211020, "RequestID": "76fcb80015924e81ac4b35527bfbbf26", "TotalTokens": 3421}

{"ContextTokens": 4026, "GeneratedTokens": 314, "SynthesizedBody": "the recent observation on the cosmic microwave background by _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) has revealed that the dark age in the universe ended quite early by the reionization at @xmath3 @xcite . \n but , the origin of ionizing radiation in such an early epoch and the subsequent ionization history after the early reionization are not elucidated very well . \n the first possibility for the ionizing source is pop iii stars @xcite , and the other possibilities are mini quasars @xcite or bh accretion @xcite . \n the early reionization by pop iii stars is recently under debate . \n @xcite argue that the reionization by pop iii stars is marginally compatible with the thomson optical depth measured by the _ wmap _ , @xmath4 , even if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from early formed objects is unity . \n in addition , @xcite explore the feedback effect by supernova ( sn ) energy input in pop iii objects , and find that the suppression of pop iii star formation by sne is so intensive that pop iii stars can not contribute significantly to the cosmic reionization . the strong suppression of pop iii star formation or the early shift to pop ii or pop i star formation may bring the vanishment of ionizing radiation , resulting in the re - neutralization of intergalactic medium ( igm ) . \n this may lead to the so - called double reionization @xcite . \n also , pop iii sne can be the origin of igm heavy elements @xcite . \n the detailed analysis on quasar metal absorption lines have shown that the igm is enriched by heavy elements from a level of @xmath5 10@xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath5 10@xmath8 at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the solar abundance @xcite . \n it is quite perplexing that heavy elements are observed commonly and uniformly in the low density space where no bright galaxies are found . \n although the outflow from small proto - galaxies could be responsible for the enrichment of igm @xcite , the much earlier enrichment by pop iii objects may provide a potential solution for the uniformly distributed metagalactic heavy elements . hence , pop iii star formation history in high redshifts could be a key for the early enrichment . \n we can not observe directly pop iii stars at @xmath11 , but grbs at high redshifts can be a potential tool to probe the formation history of pop iii stars . since the discovery of x -

heavy initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , a portion of grbs at high redshifts possibly result from pop iii hypernovae . \n actually , @xcite estimated the fraction of pop iii grbs using the imf by nakamura & umemura , and found that several percent of pop iii stars result in grbs .    in this letter \n , we derive the star formation rate ( sfr ) of pop iii stars observationally for the first time out to @xmath13 by use of the absolute grb event rate . \n then , using the pop iii sfr , we assess the uv photon emission rate at @xmath2 , in which redshift range no observational constraint has been hitherto placed on ionizing radiation intensity . \n also , we analyze the early metal enrichment of igm by the derived pop iii sfr . here \n , we assume a @xmath14cdm universe with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite . \n @xcite published the relative value of the grb event rate up to @xmath13 , based on the spectral peak energy - to - peak luminosity relation . in this letter , we need to estimate an absolute value of grb event rate ( @xmath18 ) in the early universe . in order to do that \n , it is necessary to make corrections for jet - collimation , because the grb emission is collimated in the order of 0.1 radian @xcite . \n if the reported evolution in luminosity @xcite can be attributed to the evolution of jet - collimation , we can correct the collimation using the observed evolution in luminosity with the index @xmath19 defined as ( 1+z)@xmath20 , where 2.6 represents the observed evolution in luminosity @xcite . \n after the correction against jet - collimation , the absolute event rate @xmath18 in a comoving volume is obtained . \n it is not quite certain whether the observed evolution in luminosity is fully due to the collimation or partially due to intrinsic evolution in luminosity . \n so , we use the intermediate case of @xmath19=0.5 for simplicity in this paper . the resultant rate in units of gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 is shown in fig . \n 1 together with the observed data with the systematic and statistical errors . \n the typical rate at @xmath23 is roughly 10@xmath24 gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 for the case of @xmath19=0.5 . \n the absolute grb rate allows us to estimate the sfr of pop iii stars with the assistance of the pop iii imf . because of the lack of heavy elements , the imf for pop iii stars is likely to be top heavy with massive stars of @xmath25 , in contrast to the present - day stars @xcite . \n the possible formation of even lower mass pop iii stars with 1 to 50 m@xmath26 is also pointed out @xcite . \n but these stars might be a quite small contribution to the uv emission rate or grb event rate , and therefore omitted in the present analysis . \n the theory on the stellar evolution of extremely metal poor ( @xmath27 ) stars @xcite shows that the stars with about 8 to 40 m@xmath26 will evolve and explode as type - ii sne , leaving a neutron star or a black hole and supplying heavy elements into space . \n the stars with 40 to 140 @xmath28 will produce uv photons during their evolutionary pass , but will not supply any heavy element into space , because they will collapse completely , forming a black hole . \n the stars with 140 to 260 m@xmath26 will explode as a pair - instability sne , forming a black - hole and supplying heavy elements into space . among these stars , \n the key interest is the stars with 100 to 140 @xmath28 , which can result in grbs as progenitors . \n this mass range is sometimes called an energetic sn ( hypernova ) . hence , in metal poor environments , grb events occur only in the narrow mass range in the pop iii imf .    here , we employ the pop iii imf by @xcite , which is in the form of a double - peaked function with sharp cutoffs with power - law shape : @xmath29 and cutoffs : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively ( see nakamura & umemura 2001 for details ) . \n as stated above , we consider only a high - mass part of the imf . \n the normalization factor can be determined by the grb event rate , @xmath18 , which corresponds to a mass range of @xmath32 . \n then , if the pop iii fraction @xmath33 in the observed grb rate is given , we can derive the pop iii sfr in terms of @xmath34 after an integration over the imf . actually , @xmath35 is a function of time . \n @xcite show that the grb range quickly expands for @xmath36 ( pop i / ii ) , but simultaneously the imf is likely to become the present - day type ( salpeter ) imf for the enriched gas @xcite . as a result , the mass fraction of grbs originating from pop i / ii stars is roughly twice as high as that of pop iii grbs . \n hence , if @xmath37 is the fraction of pop iii stars , the @xmath35 is given by @xmath38 it is expected that @xmath37 is near unity in an early epoch , and then decreases with the metal enrichment . @xcite \n have derived the @xmath37 as a function of redshift . \n theyhave analyzed the dependence of @xmath37 upon the total energy input into outflows from pop iii ejecta per unit gas mass , @xmath39 in units of @xmath40  ergs @xmath41@xmath42 . \n the model with @xmath43 is roughly corresponding to @xmath44 , while the model with @xmath45 is to @xmath46 . \n hence , combining ( [ fgrb ] ) with ( [ sfr ] ) , it is concluded that the observed grb event rate implies the continuous formation of pop iii stars at @xmath1 . \n the massive stars with more than 50 @xmath28 radiate photons in the black body of @xmath47 k , which are energetic enough to ionize neutral hydrogen . \n their luminosities should be near the eddington luminosity @xcite , so @xmath48 uv photons are emitted during their lifetime of @xmath49 yrs . \n for the pop iii sfr assessed above , we can evaluate the total uv photon emission rate per unit cosmological comoving volume as @xmath50 for stars heavier than 50 @xmath28 , where @xmath51 is given in units of @xmath52 . \n the resultant uv emissivity by pop iii stars is shown in fig . \n 2 . on the other hand , \n the uv photon emission rate required to keep ionizing hydrogen in the universe is estimated as @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 is the clumping factor of igm and @xmath55 is the recombination time , @xmath56 . \n several authors have argued the effect of clumpiness on the reionization @xcite . \n since the clumpiness shortens the recombination time in hii regions , then the clumping factor should be estimated by @xmath57 . \n when all the matter is totally ionized , @xmath54 becomes equal to the clumping factor of baryons , @xmath58 . \n but , if the igm is partially ionized where density peaks are self - shielded , @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath59 \n . therefore , @xmath60 corresponds to the minimum level requisite for the igm ionization , while @xmath58 does to the maximum level . in fig . \n 2 , the uv emission rate for reionization is shown for @xmath60 and @xmath58 which is taken from @xcite . \n the most recent results of wmap suggest much higher clumping factor than their value but we should wait for the second wmap results for more accurate disccusion . as seen in fig . \n 2 , the uv photon emission rate inferred from the grb events exceeds the maximum level for the igm ionization at all epochs of @xmath2 , for the @xmath61 model or for the pop iii grb fraction larger than several 10% . \n however , if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is much smaller than 10% , the photon emission rate can fall below the maximum rate . \n especially , when larger systems form at lower redshifts in a cdm universe , the escape fraction may be reduced significantly @xcite . \n then , the igm may be neutralized at some redshift , at lower redshifts , pop i / ii stars would make more contributions to ionizing photon budget , which may reionize the igm again . \n next , we consider the enrichment by heavy elements synthesized in pop iii objects . \n since the amount of mass ejection from energetic sne ( hypernovae ) and from pair instability sne into space is very roughly @xmath5 0.1 and @xmath5 0.5 of the initial mass for @xmath32 and @xmath62 respectively @xcite , we can estimate the heavy element production rate into the igm as @xmath63 @xmath28 gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 . using the pop iii sfr , \n the metallicity of the igm enriched by pop iii stars is estimated to be @xmath64 for @xmath45 and @xmath65 for @xmath43 . \n the model with @xmath43 appears to overproduce the igm metals , if compared to @xmath5 10@xmath8 at @xmath9 @xcite . \n however , it should be noted that all synthesized metals can not be spread out from pop iii objects @xcite . \n then , even the model with @xmath43 may not provide sufficient metals for the igm metallicity . \n in this paper , we have estimated the absolute grb event rate out to @xmath6612 observationally with the correction for collimation . \n there have been also several efforts to estimate a grb event rate in the early universe , using the independent method @xcite . \n all the results are broadly consistent with each other and show that there is no break in the grb event rate as a function of redshift .    based on the grb event rate \n , we have found that pop iii stars could form continuously at @xmath1 . \n this implies that pop iii star formation is not likely to be strongly suppressed in early epochs . \n this is qualitatively consistent with the recent study on the star formation history in dwarf spheroidals in the local group , which shows the continuous star formation even after the reionization @xcite . \n also in recent theoretical studies , it is shown that dwarf galaxies can form owing to the self - shielding even during the reionization @xcite , and the star formation can be induced by sn - driven shock @xcite . \n as for the reionization , it has been found that the uv emission from pop iii stars can make a noticeable contribution to the early reionization . \n if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is large enough , then the uv emission from pop iii stars can keep ionizing the igm at @xmath2 . \n but , if it is smaller , it can lead to the re - neutralization of igm at some redshift , which may result in the double reionization @xcite . regarding the enrichment , \n a high pop iii fraction in high-@xmath67 grbs may lead to the overproduction of igm metals if all synthesized metals are spread out into the intergalactic space . \n but , if they are confined around pop iii objects , it may be difficult to account for igm metals solely by pop iii stars . \n finally , it is noted that there still remain a few less robust factors in this type of analysis . \n the most unknown factor is the validity of the spectral peak energy - to - luminosity relation for grbs out to @xmath68 12 . although yonetoku et al . \n ( 2004 ) derived a firm relation out to about @xmath68 5 based on the observed redshifts , this relation to higher redshifts is not confirmed . \n the second key is the correction for collimation of grbs . \n grbs are really collimated , but we do not know a degree of collimation in luminosities for grbs at @xmath69 . \n these should be confirmed by detecting grbs out to @xmath70 10 in the mission like the _ swift _ grb satellite . \n also , we should check the consistency of the obtained pop iii sfr with the infrared background . \n we thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments . \n this work is supported in part by a grant -

{"ContextTokens": 3295, "GeneratedTokens": 191, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the outstanding questions in solar physics concerns the magnetic topology responsible for major eruptive activity such as coronal mass ejections ( cme ) and large two - ribbon flares accompanied by a filament / prominence eruption . \n this question is critical both for understanding the physics of solar eruptions and for predicting them . \n it has long been known empirically that two features are required for strong solar activity : magnetic shear and magnetic complexity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by shear we mean that the field near the photospheric neutral line is observed to be almost parallel to the neutral line , rather than perpendicular to it , as would be the case for a potential field . by complexity \n we mean that that the active region is not simply bipolar , consisting of a leading sunspot and a well - separated trailing polarity region , but contains instead an intermingling of polarities as in a delta sunspot in which two opposite polarity umbrae share a common penumbra ( @xcite ) . \n delta sunspots , in particular , are well known to be prolific flare producers . \n ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the physical reason for the observed requirement of shear is straightforward to understand . \n the field must contain free energy in order to power the eruptive event ; somewhere , there must be a large deviation of the field from its potential state . \n furthermore , since the free energy is most easily generated in the deep photosphere , it should appear in the field that has most recently emerged and , therefore , is nearest the neutral line . \n the second feature , magnetic complexity , is more difficult to understand . \n cmes , filament eruptions , and two - ribbon flares usually appear to occur along only a single neutral line , i.e. in a bipolar region . \n the post - eruption x - ray emission is observed to straddle only one neutral line . \n in fact , the standard picture for flare / filament eruptions , the so - called tether cutting model ( e.g. @xcite ) involves only a single sheared magnetic arcade . \n although magnetic complexity plays no role in this model , the observations show that it is essential for the event to occur in the first place . \n also , recent observations indicate that multiple neutral lines may be a common feature of cmes ( @xcite ) . in this paper \n , we clarify why the magnetic complexity of a delta sunspot , or worse , is necessary for violent eruptions . \n recently , we developed a new model for solar mass ejections ( @xcite ) which shares with the standard picture , the features that the eruption and the bulk of the energy release occur in a sheared arcade . \n as usual , the shear is concentrated near the neutral line , so that the stressed core field near the neutral line provides the free energy and the upward push , whereas the unsheared overlying field provides the downward pull that restrains expansion of the core field . \n the key new feature proposed in our model is that additional flux systems are present , which make it possible for reconnection to take place between the unsheared overlying flux and the flux in those neighboring systems . \n this reconnection transfers unsheared flux to the neighboring flux systems , thereby removing the overlying field and the restraining pull . \n hence , reconnection allows the innermost core field to `` break out '' to infinity without opening the overlying field , and violating the aly - sturrock open - field energy limit ( @xcite ) . \n a 2d model for this `` breakout '' process has been presented ( @xcite ) . \n the model postulated a global magnetic field topology for the sun consisting of a four - flux system in which reconnection between the upper and lower systems transfers flux to the two side systems . \n the question we address in this paper is the following : _ what is the minimum complexity needed in the magnetic field of an active region so that a similar process can occur in a fully 3d geometry ? \n _    in order to answer this question , let us first determine the topology of a bipolar active region . \n for this case , the relevant magnetic field corresponds to a large - scale background solar bipole in which an active region bipole has emerged . \n since we are interested only in the basic topology , it is sufficient to consider a potential , unsheared field ; a typical example is shown in figure 1 . \n the yellow surface in the figure corresponds to the photosphere chosen to be at @xmath0 , and the view is oriented so that the @xmath1 direction is vertical , @xmath2 is to the right , and @xmath3 is out of the page . \n the background field is that due to a magnetic dipole pointing in the @xmath4 direction , with relative magnitude @xmath5 , and located at position @xmath6 . \n the active region is due to another dipole , in the @xmath2 direction , with magnitude @xmath7 , and located at @xmath8 . \n the active region `` sunspots '' are indicated in the figure by the black and white spots , which contain all the contours of @xmath9 on the photosphere that are greater than half - maximum . note that @xmath9 is smooth everywhere ; the contours simply indicate where there is concentration of field , and can be thought of as indicating the umbra of the spots . \n a true sunspot would have much higher field concentration than our example here , but the topology would be the same . \n there are three polarity regions on the photosphere : a semi - infinite negative region due to the background dipole , a semi - infinite positive region consisting of the positive background plus the positive , leading - polarity active region sunspot , and a finite negative region due to the trailing polarity sunspot . \n the two neutral lines defining the three polarity regions are indicated by the black lines on the yellow photospheric plane . \n the closed neutral line surrounding the finite negative polarity region would correspond to the edge of the trailing spot s penumbra . \n it is evident from figure 1 that the topology of a bipolar active region is simply that of an embedded dipole ( @xcite ) . \n it consists of only two flux systems , the flux connecting the positive polarity region to the background field ( red field lines ) and the flux connecting the positive polarity to the negative spot ( green lines ) . \n the separatrix surface can be visualized by examining those field line sections where the four pairs of red and green lines are indistinguishably close together in the figure . \n these red - green sections outline a hemispherical separatrix surface that encloses the green flux , and across which the magnetic connectivity is discontinuous . \n the connectivity is also discontinuous at a singular line originating at a point inside the negative sunspot region ( where the four green field lines appear to come together in the figure ) , and continuing into the background region ( the four red field lines that are close together ) . \n a magnetic null occurs in the corona where this singular line passes through the separatrix surface ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n the intersection of the separatrix surface with the plane of the photosphere forms a closed curve that encircles the negative sunspot and defines the photospheric boundary between the green and red field lines . \n the photospheric connectivity is discontinuous at this curve and at the two points where the singular line intersects the photosphere . \n we now imagine that the field near the photospheric neutral line of the negative spot is strongly sheared , and ask what happens to the overlying green flux . \n the key point is that , in this case , the amount of overlying unsheared flux can not decrease . \n the green flux inside the photospheric separatrix curve must always be exactly equal to the amount of flux in the trailing negative - polarity sunspot . \n note , however , that reconnection and energy release can still occur . \n for example , if the `` sunspots '' in figure 1 move , then red and green flux can reconnect at the null ( @xcite ) , exchanging positions and causing the separatrix curve to move to its most energetically favorable position . but \n the amount of green flux inside the separatrix never changes . \n therefore , in order for the sheared core field to open , a fixed amount of unsheared overlying flux would have to open as well , which is energetically unfavorable ( @xcite ) . \n this is the fundamental reason why bipolar active regions do not exhibit violent eruptive activity even if strongly sheared  their topology is too restrictive to allow a decrease in the overlying unsheared flux . \n now , let us consider a delta sunspot . to the system of figure 1 \n , we add a dipole that is pointing in the @xmath1 direction , with magnitude @xmath10 , and located inside the negative spot region at @xmath11 . \n the resulting topology is shown in figure 2 , which focuses on the region around the negative spot for clarity . due to the presence of the additional dipole , a positive polarity umbra and \n a neutral line have appeared inside the the negative spot , giving it a delta appearance . in order to make the topology easier to visualize \n , we chose the dipole parameters so that the parasitic polarity is located centrally within the parent spot , but the results described below remain valid for the usual case where the parasitic spot is off to one side .    now \n four distinct flux systems are present . \n in addition to the original red and green systems , there is a blue flux system comprised of field lines that connect the negative spot to the parasitic positive polarity . \n we expect this system to appear with the addition of the parasitic polarity , but surprisingly , another flux system ( gray field lines ) appears inside the parasitic spot and connects some of the innermost positive flux to the distant , negative - polarity background region . \n the separatrix surfaces now consist of a horizontal and a vertical torus , both cut by the photosphere plane . \n the horizontal torus can be visualized by joining the fieldline sections where the red and green lines are indistinguishably close to the sections where the blue and gray lines are close . \n similarily the vertical torus is formed by joining the blue - green sections to the red - gray sections , ( only a small base section of this torus can be seen in the figure ) . in the corona , the curve of intersection of the two torii defines a separator line along which all four flux systems come in contact . for the particular delta spot of figure 2 , which has a high degree of symmetry , there are four magnetic nulls located on this separator line , but there can be as few as two . the intersection of the two separatrix surfaces with the plane of the photosphere forms three concentric closed curves across which the photospheric connectivity is discontinuous . \n as before , an approximately circular curve outside the negative spot marks the photospheric boundary between red and green flux , a closed curve lying inside the negative spot but outside the positive spot denotes the boundary between green and blue , and a closed curve lying inside the positive parasitic spot bounds the blue from the gray . \n this four - flux topology is precisely what is needed for eruption to occur , and is the direct 3d analog of our 2d model ( @xcite ) . \n assume , as before , that the neutral line around the negative spot is strongly sheared . \n the green flux overlying the core neutral line field can now be decreased by reconnection between the green and gray systems at the coronal separator line . \n this will convert green and gray flux into red and blue . note that , unlike the dipolar active - region case above , the actual amount of green flux decreases , which allows the sheared core field to erupt outward . on the photosphere , \n the outer separatrix curve shrinks inward while the middle separatrix curve expands outward . \n an identical behavior can be obtained by shearing the inner neutral line . \n reconnection between blue and red field lines at the separator line converts them into green and gray . \n of course , a real active region on the sun can have much more complexity than this very simplest of delta - configurations ; even so , we expect that the topology of four flux systems meeting along a coronal separator line is the basic topology underlying eruptive activity . \n it is unlikely that more than four systems would share a common boundary . \n we conclude , therefore , that a delta sunspot has sufficient complexity for the breakout model to operate , and propose that this is why delta spots are so active . \n note that , if eruption does occur , it will take place on only one neutral line at a time , because a decrease in the field overlying one neutral line requires an increase in the field overlying the adjacent neutral line . \n this explains why solar eruptions typically appear to involve only one sheared arcade . \n the eruption , itself , is exactly the same in our model as in the standard picture , except that now even the lowest - lying sheared field can open ( @xcite ) . \n the sheared field at one neutral line blows open , ejecting a filament if present , and then reconnects with itself to close back down and form the observed hot x - ray loops . \n it should be emphasized that this post - eruption reconnection , which can release a great deal of energy , is completely different than the reconnection proposed in our model , which acts only as a trigger for the eruption . \n our model has interesting implications for observations . \n a crucial feature of the topology in figure 2 is the presence of the gray flux connecting the parasitic spot to the distant background region . \n this feature is the main difference between the delta and the bipolar field of figure 1 , in which all the flux of the negative sunspot connects locally . \n even though the parasitic - polarity flux in our example is significantly smaller than the flux of the parent spot , this nonlocal connection is the minimum - energy , current - free state of the magnetic field . \n of course , if the parasitic spot is sufficiently small , then all its flux will close locally into the parent spot , so that the topology becomes that of an embedded dipole within an embedded dipole . \n these considerations imply that , as flux emerges through the photosphere , one should see an abrupt jump in the structure of coronal loops after it becomes energetically favorable for the parasitic spot to form distant connections . such dramatic jumps in coronal connections , correlated with magnetic emergence , \n should be directly observable with the magnetogaph on soho and the high - cadence xuv telescopes on trace .", "StartTimeOffset": 105218149046, "RequestID": "16ba2ceb3eb8419f87762ee6e722d607", "TotalTokens": 3486}

mass and bd binaries were detected by direct imaging in the field and in young clusters and associations ( see bouy , this proceeding @xcite ) . based on these observations , it was found that very low - mass stars ( vlmss ) and bds pair less frequently in binary systems than solar - like stars . \n however , these surveys can not resolve the inner @xmath53 to 10au ( depending on distance ) around the objects . \n companions orbiting at such close separations may have originated based on a substantially different companion formation mechanism than the one found so far by direct imaging . \n they can be detected indirectly by spectroscopic doppler surveys . \n precise monitoring of the radial velocities ( rvs ) of bds became possible in the last years with the generation of 810 m class telescopes . \n shortly after the high - resolution echelle spectrograph uves at the vlt saw its first light in october 1999 , two programs were started with this instrument in spring 2000 and 2001 in order to systematically search for close companions to bds and vlmss in the very young chai star - forming region ( joergens & guenther 2001 @xcite ; joergens 2005 @xcite ) and in the field ( guenther & wuchterl 2003 @xcite ) . in this article , we present and discuss the current results of the survey in chai . \n in order to probe bd multiplicity at very young ages an rv survey of bds / vlmss in the chai star - forming region ( @xmath52myr ) was started by joergens & guenther ( 2001 @xcite ) . among a subsample of ten bds / vlmss ( m@xmath60.12m@xmath7 , m5m8 ) \n , nine do not show signs of companions down to masses of giant planets . \n the sampled orbital periods for them are @xmath0 40 day corresponding to separations @xmath00.1au ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n monte - carlo simulations show that the data set provides a fair chance ( @xmath8 10% ) to detect companions even out to 0.4au ( maxted & jeffries 2005 @xcite ) . for the bd candidate chah@xmath18 ( m6.5 ) , \n rv data were recorded with a time base of a few years and they indicate the existence of a spectroscopic companion of planetary or bd mass with an orbital period of at least several months or even years ( fig.[joe : fig2 ] ) . \n thus , among ten bds / vlmss , none shows signs of bd companions with periods less than 40 days and one with a period @xmath8 100 days . \n furthermore , the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.5 ) also exhibit long - term rv variations ( fig.[joe : fig3 ] ) that are attributed to an orbiting companion with at least 19 jupiter masses . \n the rv survey in chai revealed that very young bds / vlmss exhibit no rv noise due to surface activity down to the precision required to detect jupiter mass planets ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n they are , therefore , suitable targets when using the rv technique to search for planets . in the upper panel of fig.[joe : fig1 ] , the distribution of rv differences recorded for very young bds and vlmss ( m@xmath60.12m@xmath7 , m5m8 ) is compared to the rv signal caused by a planet of 1 - 10 m@xmath4 . \n it shows that the rv signal of a giant planet is detectable well above the rv noise level for a bd primary . \n the lower panel of fig.[joe : fig1 ] displays as comparison rv data for t  tauri stars recorded by guenther et al . \n ( 2001 @xcite ) . the rv amplitude of a planet \n is completely swallowed by the large systematic rv errors of up to 7km / s for them making planet detections by the rv technique around very young stars quasi impossible . \n distribution of rv differences for very young bds / vlmss ( upper panel , joergens 2005 @xcite ) and for t  tauri stars ( lower panel , guenther et al \n . 2001 @xcite ) . \n the plot shows that systematic errors caused by activity at very young ages are sufficiently small in the substellar mass regime to allow for detections of giant planets by the rv technique , which is not the case for t  tauri stars . \n rv differences / amplitudes in the plot are peak - to - peak values . inserted ranges of rv planet signals \n were calculated based on circular orbits , a semi major axis of 0.1au and a primary mass of 0.06m@xmath7 for bds , and 1au and 1m@xmath7 for t  tauri stars , resp . ] \n if bds form in the same way as stars , we should observe an equivalent companion mass distribution for both . \n then , the bd desert observed for solar - like stars could exist as a scaled - down equivalent also around bd primaries , this would be a _ giant planet desert _ , as illustrated in fig.[joe : fig4 ] ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n the here presented rv survey started to test its existence for bds in chai . for higher than solar - mass primaries , there are indeed hints that the bd desert might be a scalable phenomenon : while rv surveys of k giants detected a much higher rate of close bd companions compared to solar - like stars ( e.g. hatzes et al . \n 2005 @xcite , mitchell et al . 2005 @xcite ) , with only one exception they all do not lie in the bd desert when scaled up for the higher primary masses \n .     schematic illustration of the bd desert as observed for solar - like stars , and of a scaled version of it for lower primary masses ( bds / vlmss ) , and for higher primary masses ( giants ) . ] \n radial velocity data for the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.5 ) recorded with uves / vlt : significant variability occurring on time scales of months to years hint at a companion at @xmath9au and a mass msin@xmath3 of at least 19 m@xmath4 ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . ]    the study of the multiplicity properties of bds for separations of less than @xmath5310au has been recognized as one of the main observational efforts that are necessary in order to constrain the formation of bds . \n this can be done by means of high - resolution spectroscopic surveys . \n we have presented here the current results of the first rv survey of very young bds ( joergens 2005 @xcite ) . \n it exploits the high resolving power and stability of the uves spectrograph and the large photon collecting area of the vlt . \n a remarkable feature of this survey is that it is sensitive to planetary mass companions . \n this is due to a precise rv determination and to the fact that systematic rv errors caused by activity are sufficiently small for the targets to allow for the detection of jupiter mass planets around them , as shown for the first time by this survey . \n thus , very young bds , at least in chai , are suitable targets for the search for close extrasolar planets in contrast to very young stars . \n none of the bds and vlmss monitored shows signs of bd or planetary companions for separations smaller than 0.1au . \n this hints at a small binary fraction and a low frequency of giant planets in this separation range ( zero of ten ) . within the limited statistics , this result is consistent with the binary frequency found for field bds / vlmss ( 12@xmath107% , guenther & wuchterl 2003 @xcite ) and with the frequency of stellar g dwarf binaries ( 7% , @xcite ) in the same separation range . \n for some of the chai targets also larger separations were probed leading to the detection of two candidates for spectroscopic systems : both the bd candidate chah@xmath18 ( m6.5 ) and the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.5 ) exhibit long - term rv variations that were attributed to orbiting companions with several jupiter masses at minimum . \n orbit solutions have to await follow - up observations , however , the data suggest orbital periods of at least several months , i.e. separations of @xmath8 0.2au and 0.4au , resp . \n direct imaging surveys found a significantly lower frequency of bd binaries with separations @xmath11310au compared to solar - like stars @xcite . \n this might be ( partly ) caused by a shift to smaller separations for lower mass primaries . \n the first surveys that probe the inner few au around bds by spectroscopic means are the one presented here ( joergens & guenther 2001 @xcite , joergens 2005 @xcite , fair detection efficiency for @xmath120.4au @xcite , sensitive to m@xmath13 planets ) , and the following ones by other groups : basri & martn ( 1999 @xcite , detection of first spectroscopic bd binary ) , reid et al . \n ( 2002 @xcite , single epoch spectra , sensitive to double -

{"ContextTokens": 1960, "GeneratedTokens": 163, "SynthesizedBody": "the dsphs in the local group offer a unique opportunity for testing our understanding of galaxy evolution . \n new cmds obtained for dsphs show that most have undergone complex evolution . \n they formed stars over _ many gyr _ rather than on a dynamical timescale ( few @xmath2 yr ) despite the fact that they are now devoid of gas and their low total masses ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) make them highly susceptible to supernova - driven galactic winds . \n ( for a recent review , see smecker - hane 1997 . ) \n we have undertaken as series of studies involving photometry and spectroscopy of stars in the carina and fornax dsphs to determine their star - formation and chemical evolution histories . \n here we report on our spectroscopy of carina dsphs stars and their derived metallicities . \n we used our photometric survey of bright stars centered on the carina dsph ( smecker - hane , et al . \n 1994 ) to identify red giants that were probable members of the galaxy . at a galactic latitude of @xmath5 , \n the carina fields are contaminated with a significant number of galactic foreground stars . \n although members can not be positively identified by their location in the cmd , they are easily identified by their large radial velocities ( 223 km / sec ) . for our spectroscopic sample , we randomly chose stars from the cmd that had magnitudes within 1.5 mag of the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , ( b - i ) colors within @xmath6 of the mean color of the rgb , and distances @xmath7 arcmin ( 1 core radius ) from the center of the galaxy . \n we obtained spectra of these stars with the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 4.0-meter telescope and the argus multi - fiber system in november , 1997 . \n the argus system allows simultaneous observation of 24 stars and 24 sky positions . \n total exposure times were 3.5 to 5 hours . \n images were reduced using the standard ccd reduction package in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) , and the spectra were extracted and calibrated with the argus package . \n the most difficult part of the data reduction was the sky subtraction because the ca ii lines fall among bright night sky emission lines . \n the fluxes in the sky lines were typically 5 times higher than the stellar continuum fluxes in the region of the the ca ii lines . \n the final stellar spectra have a dispersion of 0.83  / pix , and a typical signal - to - noise ratio of 17 per pixel . \n examples are shown in figure  1 . \n we derived metallicities , [ fe / h ] , from the reduced equivalent width , @xmath8 , of the ca ii infrared triplet lines in each spectrum . \n this technique has been empirically calibrated by rutledge , et al . \n ( 1997 ) using observations of numerous galactic globular cluster stars , and interested readers are referred to it for details . in brief , the sum of the equivalent widths of the two strongest lines of the ca ii triplet at 8542 and 8662  , @xmath9 , shows a linear dependence with [ fe / h ] when the effect of effective temperature and gravity are removed to first order . \n the later is effectively done by forming the reduced equivalent width for each star , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the star and @xmath12 is the magnitude of the horizontal branch . the equivalent width for each ca \n ii line was determined by fitting a linear continuum plus gaussian - shaped absorption feature in the standard wavelength regions defined by armandroff & da costa ( 1991 ) . the adopted calibration equation , [ fe / h ] @xmath13 , from rutledge , et al . \n ( 1997 ) gives metallicities based on the scale defined by the high - dispersion spectroscopic work of carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) . \n figure 2 shows a histogram of the derived metallicities for 52 radial velocity members of carina and a gaussian fit to the histogram . \n the average metallicity is [ fe / h ] @xmath14 ( including the calibration zeropoint error in the uncertainty ) and the observed dispersion is @xmath15 dex . \n the error in each derived metallicity is set primarily by the sky flux and random fiber - star positioning errors . \n thus the [ fe / h ] measurement errors are , to first order , independent of the magnitude and metallicity of the stars in the limited magnitude range over which we are observing . \n subtracting in quadrature the average measurement error of 0.15 dex and 0.02 dex uncertainty in the slope of the calibration from the observed dispersion reveals an intrinsic metallicity dispersion of @xmath16 dex ( 1.0 dex full width ) for the carina dsph . \n two notable calibration issues deserve discussion . \n first , the @xmath8[fe / h ] calibration is strictly valid for old stars although armandroff & da costa ( 1991 ) note no strong age dependence . \n second , the calibrating galactic globular clusters exhibit a relatively well - defined relationship in [ ca / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] that reflects the history of enrichment from type  ia and type  ii supernovae in the galaxy . \n however dwarf galaxies may have entirely different star - formation histories and may not share the same [ ca / fe]-[fe / h ] relationship ( see smecker - hane & mcwilliam in these proceedings for a discussion of abundance ratios in the sagittarius dsph ) . \n therefore , we are embarking on a series of observations to calibrate @xmath8 to yield [ ca / h ] and to explore its sensitivity to age . \n the derived mean metallicity and intrinsic metallicity dispersion roughly agree with our initial analysis of the carina cmd ( smecker - hane 1997 ) although the metallicity dispersion derived from spectroscopy is larger . \n a full analysis of the cmd is underway to determine carina s star - formation history . \n carina s rgb is very narrow in color because of the degeneracy of age and metallicity . \n a wide range in age ( @xmath17 2 to 14 gyr ) counteracts a 1.0 dex spread in metallicity in such a way that the younger rgb stars are more metal rich and hence have approximately the same colors as the older , more metal - poor , rgb stars . \n thus a galaxy with a narrow rgb may indeed have a complex stellar population . \n an interesting contrast to the carina dsph is the leo i dsph . from analysis of its cmd , \n gallart , et al . \n ( 1999 ) conclude that its wide rgb may be a result of its wide range in age ( @xmath17 1 to 10  15 gyr ) and its internal metallicity dispersion may be very small . in conclusion , \n the dsphs exhibit a very wide variety of star - formation and chemical evolution histories , and we can learn much about the physical mechanisms that control their evolution by studying them in detail . \n armandroff , t. e. & da costa , g. s. 1991 , aj , 101 , 1329 carretta , e. & gratton , r. g. 1997 , a&as , 121 , 95 gallart , c. , et al . 1999 , \n apj , 514 , 665 rutledge , g. a. , hesser , j. e. , stetson , p. b. 1997,pasp , 109 , 907 smecker , t. a. 1997 , in _ star formation near and far . \n seventh astrophysics conference at college park maryland _ , ed . \n s. s. holt and l. g. mundy ( aip press : new york ) , 571 smecker -

called fusion hindrance phenomena @xcite . \n we thus need to describe the shape evolution from the touching configuration of fusing two nuclei to a more compact spherical - like compound nucleus by overcoming a potential barrier near the conditional saddle point . \n a diffusion model has been applied to describing this process , especially to describing the formation of superheavy elements @xcite . in these studies , so far the standard fluctuation -

dissipation relation in order to apply to the diffusion process at low temperatures which are relevant to the synthesis of superheavy elements . \n since superheavy elements are stabilized by shell correction energies , one has to synthesize them at reasonably low excitation energies , that is , at low temperatures as low as 1 mev or below . on the other hand , \n the barrier curvature around the conditional saddle point is also of the order of 1 mev . \n it is thus likely that quantum effects play an important role in the compound nucleus formation process , especially in the synthesis of superheavy elements . \n one can find a diffusion theory with quantum effects in some literatures . \n however , most of them handle the quantum diffusion process in a potential well . to the contrary , \n our problem is the quantum diffusion along a potential barrier . in order to adapt to this situation , i.e. , to the diffusion process along a potential barrier , especially at low temperatures , \n we have developed a quantum diffusion theory that takes the quantum fluctuation due to the finite curvature of the potential barrier into account @xcite . \n our theory incorporates also a memory effect . in ref . \n @xcite , using a simplified model for the potential barrier , mass and friction parameters , we reported that the quantum effects , especially memory effects , enhance the probability of overcoming the barrier to form a compound nucleus compared with that calculated by assuming the standard fluctuation - dissipation theorem at low temperatures and for the potential curvature relevant to the synthesis of superheavy elements . in ref . \n @xcite , we developed a langevin equation version of the quantum diffusion theory . also , we reformulated so as to introduce the dissipation effect in a way more suitable to nuclear processes than the caldeira -

{"ContextTokens": 3519, "GeneratedTokens": 320, "SynthesizedBody": "in disk - dominated cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , mass accretion onto a white dwarf ( wd ) from a relatively normal secondary star is mediated by a disk that extends close to the surface of the wd . \n all cvs vary , but \n the character of the variability probably reflects the time - averaged accretion rate from the secondary ( see , e. g. * ? ? ? \n systems with low accretion rate show semi - periodic outburst of 3 - 5 magnitudes ( in @xmath0 ) and are known as dwarf novae ( dne ) . \n these outbursts are due to a thermal instability that converts the disk from a low temperature , mostly unionized , optically thin ( in the continuum ) state to a high temperature , ionized , optically thick state . during the outburst , the mass transfer rate @xmath1 in the inner disk rises from @xmath2 to , and , in terms of the simplest picture of the system , the dominant source of fuv emission changes from being the wd to the disk . \n by contrast , systems with high mass - transfer rates remain in the high state most of the time , and are known as nova - like variables . \n finally there are `` z cam '' objects , which undergo normal dn outbursts as well as outbursts that stall during the transition to quiescence for weeks to months at an intermediate magnitude ( typically 0.5 - 1 magnitudes below peak ) . \n these are thought to be systems with intermediate rates of mass transfer from the secondary star .    in this review , \n i would like to highlight recent progress toward understanding these systems as a result of observations with , , and the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) . \n as first shown using , the fuv spectra of disk - dominated cvs in outburst show `` blue '' continua that can be reasonably approximated in terms of a weighted set of stellar atmospheres , where the weighting is determined by the temperature and gravity of a steady state accretion disk and where each spectrum is broadened to mimic that of a rotating disk annulus . a modern example using data from  and is shown in fig.[v3885sgr_disk ] . \n when , as in this case , the distance and inclination are known , the fit depends almost entirely on the observed flux . in these cases , the fact that the model qualitatively reproduces many of the features in the spectrum suggests that the derived @xmath1 is close to the correct value . on the other hand , models based on stellar atmospheres \n have generally been shown to fail to reproduce the spectrum over large wavelength ranges , particular if the range spans the balmer limit . \n stellar atmospheres have a pronounced balmer jump in contrast to what is observed in high state disk systems . \n this is surely due to differences between disk and stellar atmospheres . \n ad hoc solutions , such as including a transition region above the surface of the disk , are capable of addressing the problem but do not discriminate between likely mechanisms , which include viscous energy dissipation in or illumination of the disk atmosphere . to date there have been very few published attempts to create more physically correct model disk spectra and perform detailed comparisons to high quality spectra . \n however , this is likely to happen soon . \n the machinery does exist @xcite and model grids are beginning to be created ( see , e. g. * ? ? ? * ) . \n the disk model fits will not provide a complete solution , however , because fuv spectra of high state spectra show clear evidence of winds . \n p cygni like profiles in n v , si iv and ( most commonly ) c iv are observed in some systems , and the centroids of these lines are blue - shifted in others . \n blue edge velocities of 2000 - 5000 @xmath3 are observed . \n recently , a number of systems have been observed in the 900 - 1185   range with . \n these show surprising diversity . in particular , although some systems do show high - velocity wind emission from s vi and o vi , it is common to see relatively narrow lines with small ( 100 @xmath3 ) blue - shifts from intermediate ionization states @xcite . \n the velocity widths of these lines are too narrow for either the disk or the high - velocity outflow represented by c iv in the  range . \n shortly after winds were first discovered in cvs , observations of eclipsing systems showed changes in profiles shapes that indicate substantial rotation , suggesting a disk origin for the outflow @xcite . \n consequently , our basic picture of the high - velocity winds is of a bi - conical flow emanating from the inner disk . \n @xcite were the first to attempt to model the profile shapes of wind lines as observed in high state cvs in terms of a kinematic prescription for a bi - conical wind . \n they found that the -derived ( r=200 ) c  iv profiles of three systems  rw sex , rw tri , and v sge \n could be reproduced with moderately collimated winds with mass - loss rates ( @xmath4 ) of order 10% of the disk accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) and terminal velocities of 1 - 3 times the escape velocity at the footpoint of each streamline . \n subsequently , @xcite succeeded , using a different parametrization for a bi - conical flow , in reproducing the c  iv profile of ux uma though an eclipse as observed at r=2000 with /ghrs . \n this analysis was the first attempt to model changes in the profile through eclipse , and suggested , at least in ux uma , the existence of a relatively dense , high - column - density , slowly outflowing transition region between the disk photosphere and the fast moving wind . \n recently , my collaborators and i have developed a new monte carlo radiative transfer code that invokes a sobolev approximation with escape probabilities to follow photons through an axially symmetric wind . \n `` python '' is designed to produce a complete spectrum of disk dominated cvs @xcite . \n emission sources include the disk , the wd , a boundary layer and the wind itself . \n the flow geometry is defined either in terms of the parametrization of @xcite or @xcite . \n the code consists of two separate monte carlo radiative transfer calculations . in the first \n , the ionization structure of the wind is calculated using a modified on - the - spot approximation . in the second , \n a detailed spectrum is calculate for a specific wavelength range of interest . \n a fair summary of progress to date is as follows : mc methods , such as python , can be used to obtain spectral verisimilitude to individual lines fairly easily . \n an example of this is shown in fig . \n [ ixvel_hut ] . \n systematic searches are now needed to determine whether one can actually model all the lines with a single wind geometry , and to determine how well one can do on average . \n several of us are beginning this effort . \n if this effort is successful , we will be able to determine the basic parameters , such as the mass - loss rate , degree of collimation , and ionization state , of the winds of high state cvs . until this is done , it is difficult to address many of the physical questions that need to be answered , including whether the wind is radiatively - driven , as is usually assumed . \n the observational and theoretical evidence for this is murky . \n if the wind is radiatively driven , one would expect that the wind lines would be strongest when systems are brightest . but @xcite found no correlation between the strength of wind features and continuum brightness in /stis observations of two nova - like variables , ix vel and v3885 sgr . and @xcite and @xcite have argued that the luminosities of cv disks are at best marginally sufficient to accelerate a high - velocity wind . \n hydrodynamical simulations of radiatively - driven cv winds have recently been carried out , but comparisons of the theoretical predictions to observations have produced mixed results ( see e.g. * ? ? ? \n thus , alternative wind - driving mechanisms must be ( re)considered instead of , or in addition to , radiation pressure . \n these include viscous heating of the upper disk atmosphere @xcite , and irradiation of the disk @xcite as well as magneto - centrifugal forces leading to constant angular velocity rotation out to the alfvn surface @xcite . \n knowledge of the kinematic structure of the wind would be a strong discriminant between them . \n the appearance of quiescent systems is quite different from those in outburst , and fairly varied . at one extreme are systems , such as u gem , with  spectra ( fig . \n [ ugem_sscyg ] ) characterized by broad lyman absorption lines and narrower metal absorption features . \n these systems can be modelled , sometimes in great detail , with synthetic spectra of metal enriched wd - photospheres . \n the metal enrichment is understood to be a result of on - going accretion . at the other extreme \n are systems dominated by broad , fairly symmetric emission features . \n spectra of ss cyg , also shown in fig . \n [ ugem_sscyg ] , provide a good examples of this type a system . \n the dominant continuum emission in these systems is not well - understood , although the lines almost surely arise from the disk ( see , e. g. * ? ? ? \n since in quiescence the bulk of the disk is cold and unionized , explanations typically involve surface layers of the disk or a chromosphere , heated via x - ray illumination or magnetic flares in the disk . \n the emission region is unlikely to be optically thick in the continuum since that would limit the physical size of the emitting region to that of the wd . \n most systems , e.g. vw hyi @xcite , lie between the two extremes , with contributions from the wd and from the `` second component '' . \n the basic questions one would like to answer about quiescent systems depends on the nature of the emission . for the wd systems , one would first of all like to establish the fundamental parameters  temperature , radius , abundances , rotation rate , gravitational redshift  of the wd . \n in addition , one would like to explore the effects of accretion onto the wd . \n for the other systems , one would like to understand the real nature of the `` second component '' and what it implies about the structure of the disk ( and the nature of the wd ) .     of about 40,000k to 30,000k . \n [ ugem_sscyg],title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] of about 40,000k to 30,000k . \n [ ugem_sscyg],title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=240 ]    as an example , i would like to describe the analysis of multiple fuv spectra that were obtained of wz sge following its outburst in july 2001 @xcite . \n wz sge , at 42 pc , is the closest known cv , and possibly the closest accretion disk system . among cvs , \n wz sge has one of the shortest binary periods ( 88 m ) , and one of the longest interoutburst periods ( 20 - 30 yrs ) . \n and  observations during the outburst showed a high excitation spectrum dominated by broad o vi , nv , and c iv features , consistent with the high ( 75@xmath5 ) system inclination @xcite . following the outburst , \n the spectrum acquired the characteristics of a wd - dominated system ( fig . \n [ wzsge ] ) . from 2001 \n september to 2003 march , the spectra show a steady decline in the flux , a steady decrease in the color temperature , and a gradual increase in the width of , all of which are consistent with a long term cooling of a wd . \n a detailed analysis shows that @xmath6 declined from 24,300 in 2002 october to 15,900 k in march 2003 . \n the flux level in 2003 was still well above that of the pre - outburst system , indicating that the wd was still cooling . assuming a normal wd mass - radius relationship and a distance of 42 pc \n , it was possible to show that all of the post - outburst spectra are consistent with a wd mass of 0.9 , as had been inferred previously by more indirect means . \n this result is interesting in part , because in some other systems ( e.g u gem ) , simple 1-t models do not produce constant radius with time , which has lead to suggestions of non - uniform surface temperatures of the wd or a declining `` second component '' .      following the 2001 outburst @xcite . [ wzsge],title=\"fig : \" ]    one of the puzzles in the case of wz sge \n is why the post - outburst energy release has been so large ; the post - outburst excess energy release is roughly 15% of the outburst energy . \n there are two basic possibilities . \n first , there could be on - going accretion . \n this is consistent with the fact that we continue to see metal lines in wz sge . \n the time scale for metals to settle in a wd are of order a few days . \n therefore , if the metal lines in wz sge arise from the photosphere , then there must be ongoing accretion . \n secondly , the wz sge outburst both heated and left the wd with extra mass on its surface , leaving the wd out of equilibrium . \n the interior of the star has to respond to these facts , through a process known as compression heating . \n @xcite argued that the cooling that is observed in wz sge could be modelled either as a 1.2 wd which accreted at during the outburst with no accretion afterward , or with a 1 wd accreting at during the outburst and following the outburst . \n the latter possibility is most consistent with other known facts about wz sge . \n the spectra obtained with , , and hut represent qualitative improvements over those that could be obtained with . for the high state spectra , \n the surprise in the spectra is the plethora of lower ionization state narrower lines , especially in higher inclination systems . \n these lines most likely arise from a transition region between the disk and the high velocity wind , another indication that this zone can not be ignored . with it was clear that wds emission dominated the emission from some low state spectra . with  and , it is possible to model not only the temperature evolution of wds , but to determine abundances in the photosphere and to begin to characterize the second component in the emission . \n the existing spectra demonstrate the importance of multiple observations of individual systems . sadly , unless a servicing mission provides  with a revived uv spectroscopic capability or the operations staff \n are able to restore  to operational status , the prospects for obtaining new spectra are modest . \n acknowledgement : this work was supported by nasa through grants associated with analyses of  and  spectra of cvs , specifically go-9357 and go-9791 from the space telescope science institute , and nag5 - 13706 and nag5 - 13717 directly from nasa .", "StartTimeOffset": 136807479804, "RequestID": "1e381da0214944228909de0c22b4249c", "TotalTokens": 3839}

? ? \n * ) . however , since we are now interested in astrophysical variations on @xmath36 hours timescales , this practice risks accidentally cleaning the light curves of outbursts . a more sophisticated approach \n to mitigating the effects of differential extinction should be employed for this reason . \n an effort to carefully reanalyze archival observations of davs for evidence of outbursts is currently underway .    _ \n k2 _ continues to visit new fields every @xmath080 days , increasing the number of objects that we have such extensive data for . \n since outbursts seem to be a fairly common phenomenon in davs , we expect to continue to find new outbursters in upcoming data releases .    in the long term \n , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) promises to observe thousands of outbursting davs , each with at least @xmath01000 visits across six photometric filters . \n we anticipate that this survey will capture a fairly complete picture of outburst statistics and that the color information will reveal the temperature evolution of these events . \n real - time transient alerts from lsst will enable rapid photometric and spectroscopic follow - up of outbursts in progress . \n , m.h.m . , and d.e.w . \n acknowledge support from nsf grant ast-1312983 , the kepler cycle 4 go proposal 11-kepler11 - 0050 , and nasa grant nnx13ac23 g . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through hubble fellowship grant # hst - hf2 - 51357.001-a , awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 . \n this work includes data collected by the _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ missions . \n funding for the _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ missions is provided by the nasa science mission directorate . \n bell , k.  j. , hermes , j.  j. , bischoff - kim , a. , et al . \n 2015 , , 809 , 14 bell , k.  j. , hermes , j.  j. , montgomery , m.  h. , et al . \n 2016 , , 829 , 82 hermes , j.  j. , montgomery , m.  h. , bell , k.  j. , et al . \n 2015 , , 810 , l5 hermes , j.  j. , mullally , f. , stensen , r.  h. , et al .  2011 , , 741 , l16 howell , s.  b. , sobeck , c. , haas , m. , et al . \n 2014 , , 126 , 398 nather , r.  e. , winget , d.  e. , clemens , j.  c. , hansen , c.  j. , & hine , b.  p.  1990 \n , , 361 , 309 van grootel , v. , dupret , m .- a . , fontaine , g. , et al . \n 2012 , , 539 , a87 wu , y. , & goldreich , p.  2001 \n , , 546 , 469", "StartTimeOffset": 149703989694, "RequestID": "b9c12118481d44ab8148c4f1a0692034", "TotalTokens": 3713}
{"ContextTokens": 3684, "GeneratedTokens": 324, "SynthesizedBody": "in early 2001 , the hubble space telescope obtained the deepest data set ever observed for a globular cluster , an exposure of 123 orbits centered on a field 5@xmath1 from the center of the globular cluster m4 . \n we reported analysis of the lower main sequence of m4 ( richer et al . \n 2002 ) and a determination of the white dwarf cooling age of m4 ( hansen et al . \n the latter is derived from a @xmath2 fit of models to the entire white dwarf luminosity function . \n the derived age of 12.7@xmath3 ( @xmath4 statistical error only ) is consistent with other age determinations for old star clusters , and with the _ wmap _ concordance cosmology age ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .    in a recent contribution \n , de marchi , paresce , straniero and moroni ( 2003 ) performed a reanalysis of the long exposure data from our hst project go-8679 ( richer et al . \n 2002 , hansen et al . 2002 ) and were unable to reproduce results similar to ours . \n in particular their photometry failed to reach as faint as ours by almost a full magnitude . \n this can be seen quite dramatically in figure 1 where we plot our cmd in the white dwarf region from this data set and that of de marchi et al . \n taken from their paper . \n continuing , the authors claim that the only possible age constraint for m4 is that the lower limit for the white dwarf cooling age is 9 gyr , whereas we ( hansen et al . \n 2002 ) derive a cooling age of 12.7 gyr . \n the analysis of de marchi et al . raises distressing questions about our competence both in data analysis and in interpretation . as they have already been cited by others in the literature ( e.g. , moehler et al . \n 2003 ) we believe that it becomes crucial for us to respond . \n the conflict raises two questions . \n first , why do two independent teams approaching the same data set get such different results ? \n second , what is the correct approach to fitting a measured white dwarf luminosity function ? \n we answer the first question in this contribution and the second in detail in hansen et al . \n ( 2004 , in preparation ) and illustrate how the de marchi et al . \n analysis fails on both counts . \n the reason de marchi et al . \n are unable to reproduce the depth and quality of our cmd is purely one of data treatment . \n the hst data set under consideration , go-8679 , contains 98 f606w and 148 f814w images each of exposure 1300 sec . \n a first - epoch set of images taken in f555w and f814w ( go-5461 ) were obtained by us in 1995 ( richer et al . \n 1995 , 1997 ) and were not nearly as deep . \n some care is required in getting the most out of this large and impressive data set .    in our case , after accounting for dithers , those frames corresponding to a particular epoch and filter were averaged together with pixel rejection \n the @xmath5 highest pixels being rejected to eliminate cosmic ray contamination . from the hst wfpc2 manual the mean number of pixels on a given chip affected by a cosmic ray hit in an 1800 sec exposure is about 20,000 . \n hence in a stack of @xmath6 sec exposures we expect @xmath7 pixels at a given position to have suffered a hit . \n taking the dispersion to be @xmath8 and using @xmath9 rejection we find that in combining the 98 f606w images the highest 7 pixels should be rejected while for the 148 f814w images we should eliminate the highest 9 . \n our procedure thus used 93% of the available pixels in constructing the mean . \n by contrast , de marchi et al . \n used image - association stacks produced by the pipeline software developed by the canadian astronomy data centre and the eso space - telescope coordinating facility ( micol & durand 2002 ) . \n this pipeline software essentially takes the median of the available pixel values , and is therefore less efficient in a statistical sense than the scheme we employed as described above . according to zwillinger & kokoska ( 2000 ) the efficiency of the median ranges from 1.000 for @xmath10 , 0.743 for @xmath11 , ... 0.681 for @xmath12 , to 0.637 for @xmath13 . \n hence de marchi et al . effectively used less than 2/3 of the information available in the images . \n we requested from the canadian astronomy data centre the image association stacks that were used by de marchi et al . and compared them to the combined images resulting from our analysis . after allowing for the change in image scale ( we expanded our images by a factor of three in each dimension ) \n , the main difference is that images of faint stellar objects appear perceptibly more diffuse in the pipeline generated associations . \n this has the effect of making the faintest stars difficult to detect in the images de marchi et al \n . used , exactly what is seen in figure 1 . \n we illustrate this by employing the same 2 stars de marchi et al . used to claim that objects fainter than f814w = 27.0 could not be measured on our first - epoch frames \n recall that all we seek from the first - epoch images is a position so that proper motions can be measured . \n all the photometry is carried out on the longer - exposure frames . \n for this reason most of our positional matching comes from the f606w @xmath14 f555w pair as the first - epoch exposures in f555w are actually quite long31.5 ksec . \n figure 2 displays these two images as we produced them with the stars discussed by de marchi et al . \n clearly the lower of the two is easily visible in both frames while the upper of the two is not seen in the shorter exposure first epoch . \n there is , however , a simple reason for this - it is in fact not a star at all , as our deep images clearly show it to be extended . \n this faint galaxy is thus lost in the noisier first - epoch image . some specific numbers for these two objects \n are that each is detected at a @xmath15 of about 8 on the long exposure f606w image , the upper one is not detected on the shorter f555w frame while the lower is detected at @xmath15 of about 5 . \n the lower star has a proper motion completely consistent with cluster membership and its measured magnitudes are f606w = 28.48 , f814w = 27.25 . \n it is a cluster white dwarf and as can be seen in figure 1 we are able to measure stars almost 0.5 magnitudes fainter than this one . \n one crucial point is that our experiment matches long exposures in f606w ( 127.4 ksec ) and f814w ( 192.4 ksec ) with much shorter exposures in f555w ( 31.5 ksec ) and f814w ( 7.2 ksec ) . \n the question thus arises as to how we could measure positions in the earlier epoch data for the faintest stars where the @xmath15 is obviously poor . for a star at f606w = 29.0 the expected @xmath15 ( from the hst etc ) in our deep f606w frames \n is 6.7 while a star at this magnitude on the shorter exposure f555w frames has @xmath15 = 2.5 . \n this is just about what we measured on our frames . \n the reason we can successfully measure positions of such faint objects in the first epoch are twofold .    first , we applied the finding list from the deep frames to the shallower frames . \n if the background noise in an image is gaussian , then a @xmath16 positive deviation will occur in about 6 pixels out of every 1000 . \n if , in a @xmath17 image ( neglecting the vignetted areas at the low - x and low - y sides of the wfpc2 ccds ) , we were to mark all of the @xmath16 peaks as detected astronomical objects , we would expect more than 3,000 false detections . \n however , if we consider only the area within 0.5 pixels radius of an object confidently detected in the long second - epoch exposure , we expect a probability @xmath18 of finding a positive 2.5@xmath19 deviation which is purely the result of random noise in the first - epoch image . that is to say , \n we expect of order 5 false cross - identifications for every 1000 correct re - detections . \n even at @xmath20 , presumed re - identifications will be correct 19 times out of 20 . for this reason , \n the knowledge that an actual astronomical object is present somewhere nearby based upon the long - exposure second - epoch images allows us to be confident that most of the claimed re - detections on the short - exposure first epoch images correspond to true re - detections . \n the first - epoch astrometric positions , then , while poorer than those of the second epoch , are nevertheless good enough to distinguish stars that are moving with the cluster from stars and galaxies that are not . by contrast , \n de marchi et al . made no use of this technique and hence the shorter first - epoch frames effectively set their limiting magnitude . \n we checked the above by rerunning the photometry programs on the wf3 chip using a finding list with star positions generated randomly . \n this list contained the same number of stars as the original finding list . \n we then selected the objects whose photometry had converged on all frames . the resulting proper motion displacement diagram and cmd \n is shown in figure 3 and compared with the one when the true finding list is used in figure 4 . \n there are numerous spurious faint matches in figure 3 , but almost all disappear when the match radius of 0.5 pixels is invoked . \n those objects that lie outside 0.5 pixels are likely random noise spikes which have no correlated positions between frames . \n figures 3 and 4 taken together show that false detections of noise spikes are not a serious source of contamination in our cmds and that the suggestion to the contrary by de marchi et al . \n is incorrect . \n secondly , the proper motions of the m4 stars are actually quite large ( about 1 hst pixel with respect to an extragalactic background over the 6 year time baseline ( kalirai et al . 2003 ) ) . \n while the lower @xmath15 image would not produce good enough photometry , the @xmath15 is sufficient to give the centroid , which is crucial for astrometry . in figure 5 \n we illustrate the quality of the proper motion separation between cluster and field from the long and short images . \n some of the brightest stars do not exhibit clean separation due to their near saturation . \n however , what is clear from this diagram is that most of the field objects can be easily eliminated down to very faint magnitudes ( f606w = 29.0 ) by making the generous proper motion cut within a total value of 0.5 pixel ( @xmath21 mas / yr ) of that of the mean cluster motion over the 6 year baseline of the observations . a disturbing aspect of the de marchi et al . \n paper is that nowhere do they illustrate their displacement measurements .    the analysis techniques of de marchi et al . \n compounded the effect of their somewhat lower quality images . \n their approach uses aperture photometry to measure the stellar magnitudes . \n we employ point spread function fitting , which clearly has the advantage of just using the pixels with the largest signal  thus reducing the sky contribution  a critical issue when attempting to measure faint stars . \n the effect of this is obvious even along the brighter portion of the white dwarf cooling sequence where the de marchi et al . \n diagram exhibits significantly larger scatter ( see figure 1 ) . \n further , as we mentioned above , we use the positional information from the deepest frames in carrying out the photometry on the shorter exposure frames . \n by contrast de marchi et al . made no use of this information . \n _ this has the effect of allowing the depth of the first - epoch images alone to set their limiting magnitude . _ \n in a paper currently in press ( hansen et al . 2004 ) we consider in some detail the host of systematic effects in the white dwarf cooling age determination . in that contribution we will comment in detail on some of the points raised by de marchi et al . such as distance modulus , reddening and mass function . here \n we have only considered reduction and analysis of the data . with regards to this data \n we offer our stacked images and finding lists to anyone wanting to use them and in richer et al . \n 2004 we have published the complete photometry lists .    on one point we agree with de marchi et al . \n the pursuit of globular cluster white dwarfs is an important and interesting scientific goal . \n however , it is also an extremely expensive project in terms of telescope time , and we have a responsibility to take the time to give the analysis significant thought and effort to come up with the best possible analysis \n . we would be delighted if we could detect the truncation of the white dwarf luminosity function , and hope to do so in future work , but until such time we reiterate the point that there is abundant age information in the white dwarf luminosity function and it can be modelled . \n the authors would like to thank i. king and j. anderson for reading an early version of this paper and making useful comments . \n the research of hbr is supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada . \n hbr extends his appreciation to the killam foundation and the canada council for the award of a canada council killam fellowship . \n rmr and ms acknowledge support from proposal go-8679 and bh from a hubble fellowship hf-01120.01 both of which were provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute which is operated by aura under nasa contract nas5 -

{"ContextTokens": 3980, "GeneratedTokens": 282, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of the dynamic behavior of elastic media in the presence of different static potentials has been center of attention in the recent years . \n superconducting vortices are almost ideal systems for the study of the phenomenology of these systems because relevant properties such as density , interactions and external force can be easily controlled . \n much work has been done on the problem of moving vortex systems . \n depending on the velocity and type of static potential it is expected to arise different dynamical phases . in the elastic regime , \n giarmarchi and le doussal@xcite have predicted the existence of a moving - bragg - glass phase for high driving currents and a weak disordered static potential . this is a phase free of dislocations , with a power law decay of the positional correlations which are anisotropic with respect to flow direction . on another hand , balents , marchetti and radzihovsky@xcite \n have argued for the existence of a smectic phase . in this phase , vortices move along well defined static channels , holding correlation perpendicular to the channels , but uncorrelated along them . on increasing disorder plastic motion \n is expected close to the depinning force showing a mixture of moving and fixed vortices@xcite . in the later case \n the vortex motion is also through meandered static flow patterns . \n a common expected feature of all these dynamical states is the anisotropic response of the moving structure to perturbations parallel or perpendicular to the vortex motion . \n a number of experimental works have been done investigating these phenomena . \n transport measurements report changes in the dynamical properties of the vortex matter close to the peak effect @xcite that were attributed to a crossover from plastic to ordered motion . \n more recently kokubo and coworkers@xcite have proven this dynamical ordering from mode locking experiments . \n snapshots of moving vortex structures have been obtained in decoration experiments@xcite that have shown evidence for these smectic and moving glass phases of vortices . \n however one of the most striking properties of these quasi - ordered driven phases is the existence of barriers to a small force transverse to the direction of motion . \n these barriers would originate an effective transverse critical current@xcite or a change in the hall noise spectrum@xcite . \n although the numerical results present a clear evidence of these effects the experimental confirmation is evasive . \n recently lefebvre , hilke and altounian@xcite have shown transport measurements in superconducting metallic amorphous tapes that reveal the existence of a transverse critical current although these results show big quantitative discrepancies with numerical simulations . \n mutual inductance techniques have proven to be a valuable tool for measuring superconducting characteristics of two dimensional systems@xcite . in previous works \n it was shown that a variation of this technique based in special shaped coils is capable of detecting the anisotropic character of dynamical phases@xcite . in this work \n we extend these susceptibility measurements to mo@xmath2ge@xmath1 amorphous films that reveal the anisotropic characteristic of dynamical vortex phases . \n this technique allows the measurement of susceptibility and transport at the same time obtaining susceptibility information with applied current to the sample . \n mutual inductance measurements were performed using planar serpentine coils of geometry similar to those described in a previous paper@xcite . \n it was showed that the implementation of rectangular coils with high aspect ratio allow the direct measurement of the anisotropy . \n shielding currents are induced in the sample by the primary coils and therefore they are predominantly parallel to the long side of the coil , as it is shown in figure  1d . as a consequence \n the voltage generated in the reception coil is originated by the sample currents flowing in that direction . \n for the experiments reported in this work the coils were batch fabricated on silicon substrates and later the superconducting film was deposited on top of them . \n coils with different geometries have been build using 0.5 micron thick aluminum as conducting material and sio@xmath3 as insulator . \n the fabrication process started from a 8 \" silicon wafer covered with 650 nm of low stress silicon nitrate . \n aluminum wiring of the primary coil was defined by optical lithography and lift - off . \n deposition of sio@xmath3 by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) with a nominal thickness of @xmath4 m was used as a first isolation layer . a second lithography step , with the same mask used previously but rotated 180 degrees defined the secondary coil . \n a final sio@xmath3 @xmath4 m layer was deposited to provide a second isolation layer between the coils and the superconducting film . \n a planarization with a chemical mechanical polishing ( cpm ) was performed afterward . \n finally vias in the sio@xmath3 were defined by lithography and hf etching to allow direct bonding of au wires to each coil . in figure  1a \n we show a photograph of one of the microfabricated coils . \n all the results presented in this work correspond to coils with al wires of @xmath5 m in width separated by @xmath6 m and with 30 turns .    on top of the coils the superconducting mo@xmath2ge@xmath1 500 \n nm amorphous films were deposited by rf \n sputtering at room temperature by water cooling of the sample holder . \n a cross shaped geometry was defined in the superconducting film by lithography and lift - off which allow the dc current injection in the film parallel and perpendicular to the coil direction . in figure  1b we show photograph of the sample and a scheme of the electrical contacts . \n figure  1c presents a sketch of the experimental configuration . \n the critical temperature of the films determined as the onset of resistance at zero magnetic field was @xmath7 . \n the field and temperature dependence of the susceptibility were acquired for different applied currents to the sample for both directions : current parallel ( @xmath8 direction ) and perpendicular ( @xmath9 direction ) to the long strips of the coils . the voltage drop in the film \n was simultaneously measured using a nanovoltmeter that allows the detection of the vortex motion induced by the external current . \n the protocol utilized was the following : for a fixed external applied field the temperature of the sample was varied and regulated at fixed setpoints . \n for each of these temperature steps the current in the sample was swept in magnitude and orientation while the susceptibility and voltage drop in the sample were acquired . \n all measurements presented here were performed in the linear regime of the susceptibility and for a driving frequency and amplitude of @xmath10 khz and @xmath11 ma , respectively . \n the principal result of this paper is represented in figure  2 where the susceptibility of the sample is plotted as a function of temperature , on measuring it with an electrical current through the sample for the two current orientations and an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the film . in the following \n we define @xmath12 as the susceptibility data taken where the bias current is parallel to the long side of the coils ( * @xmath13 * , @xmath8 direction ) , and @xmath14 where the bias current on the sample is perpendicular to them ( * @xmath15 * , @xmath9 direction).the data indicate that once the vortex motion is induced by the external current the response obtained for currents parallel and perpendicular to the coils are notably different . at currents lower than \n 0.1 ma the magnetic response is the same to both currents orientation . \n thus , this magnetic response can be taken as the reference response , @xmath16 . at currents greater than 0.1 ma \n the shielding capability , @xmath17 , is lower in the case where the external current is parallel to the long side of the coils respect to the perpendicular configuration . a lower value of the @xmath17 data is an indication of an increase in the vortex mobility . \n taking into account that the shielding currents induced in the sample basically mimic the geometry of the primary coil @xcite , the parallel configuration corresponds to the case that these shielding and external currents are collinear . \n this means that when the bias current is parallel to the long side of the coils the _ dc _ force and the alternate testing force generated by the currents induced in the sample by the primary coil are almost collinear . as a consequence \n , the results of these experiments are evidencing that the vortex mobility is greater along the vortex motion direction than perpendicular to it . \n an isotropic response is recovered at high temperatures where the data for both current orientations merge together and with that taken at zero current on the sample . \n the observed anisotropy occurs in a region where the susceptibility of reference @xmath16 indicates an increase in the shielding capability . in figure 2 \n we can see this increment from t@xmath187.73k , which is an evidence of the peak effect@xcite where the vortex ensemble softens to accommodate to the weak pinning potential increasing the critical current . \n and @xmath14 fits to the reference @xmath19 fit ( green and purple line respectively ) showing the first three phases found . ]    in figure 3 we plot the susceptibility data for fixed temperature and magnetic field as a function of applied external current in the sample for both current orientations . \n the temperature , @xmath20 was chosen as that where the susceptibility of reference ( @xmath21 ) is minimum ( peak of the peak effect ) , see figure 2 . \n it is clear that the anisotropic response persists in the whole range of currents investigated . at this temperature and field the longitudinal response ( or parallel configuration ) reaches a steady state for current values around 3.5 ma . \n we were nt able to detect this saturation in the perpendicular configuration up to 5 ma , the maximum current up to which we were able to measure without overheating the sample . \n this effect ( difference between parallel and perpendicular directions ) could be in principle explained by an intrinsic anisotropy of the sample . \n however this can be discarded after observing that i \n v characteristics coincide for both current directions .    , indicated with an arrow in figure  2 . ] \n more insight of the anisotropic behavior can be extracted from the analysis of the data through a subtraction of the susceptibility at a given current to a reference measurement at zero current for both current orientations , see top panel of figure  2 . based on this figure ( and equivalent for other biasing currents ) \n , we were able to construct the i \n t phase diagram shown in figure  4 . at low temperatures the susceptibility for both current directions coincides with the measurement at zero applied current . \n this region i corresponds to the response of a fully pinned vortex lattice . at certain value of the external current we observe that the susceptibility measured when the current direction is along the coils long direction starts to deviate from the zero current behavior but not for the measurement in the perpendicular configuration . \n this result indicates that the sample is in a regime ( region ii ) that the vortex ensemble started to move and is locked to move in the perpendicular direction proving the existence of a finite transverse critical current . \n rising temperature the perpendicular susceptibility becomes different from the zero current measurement but with greater shielding capability than in the parallel measurement ( region iii ) . \n these results imply that this is a region of the phase diagram where the dynamical vortex structure has an anisotropic mobility . at even higher temperatures and currents an isotropic response \n is recovered where all susceptibilities coincide ( region iv ) before reaching the normal state region ( v ) . \n region iv could be assigned as a moving vortex liquid phase where pinning becomes negligible on the vortex dynamics .    , @xmath22 . \n region ii : transversally pinned state , @xmath23 . \n region iii : anisotropic dynamical state , @xmath24 . \n region iv : isotropic moving phase : @xmath25 , @xmath26 . \n region v : normal state . \n the phase diagram is relevant only for currents above @xmath27 ma , the minimum applied current for which anisotropy is detected . ] \n our results clearly indicate that the response of the moving vortex lattice in @xmath28-moge have an anisotropic characteristic in the region close to the depinning transition . \n our results show the existence of two different regimes of anisotropic behavior . at lower temperatures \n there is a finite response in the @xmath8 direction and the response in the perpendicular direction is current independent . \n this is a region where there is a transverse critical current . \n rising temperature and/or the magnitude of the current , the perpendicular component _ becomes depinned _ but the response is still anisotropic . \n this anisotropic behavior coincides in the phase diagram where the peak effect in the critical current is observed . \n we are very grateful to m. hesselberth and p. h. kes for helping us with the deposition of the moge films on the planar coils . \n this project was

their energies are marked on the right margin.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    although exactly the same method has been used for the computation of the purely two - dimensional system and for the films , the results are quite different . \n we have obtained for the film calculation an effective layer density by integrating the three - dimensional densities shown in fig . \n [ fig : profiles ] to the first minimum . \n this is evidently not very well defined for the weakly bound systems , but it is not legitimate either for the case of strong binding where the first layer is well defined . \n in fact , the integrated density for the strongest substrate is 0.08  @xmath6 , which is well beyond the solidification density of the purely two  dimensional system . \n evidently , the zero  point motion in @xmath34 direction can effectively suppress the phase transition . \n we make therefore three conclusions : ( i ) the position of the layer roton minimum is indeed a sensitive measure for the strength of the substrate potential , ( ii ) purely two  dimensional models are manifestly inadequate for their understanding , and , hence , ( iii ) purely two  dimensional models are also questionable for interpreting thermodynamic data of adsorbed films . \n with one exception @xcite , the bulk roton energy in porous media have been reported to be practically identical to that in the bulk liquid , ref . reports a slight increase of the roton energy in aerogel at partial filling . \n a roton energy above the one of the bulk liquid can be explained by assuming that the density of the helium liquid in the medium is below that of the bulk liquid . \n this can , in turn , be qualitatively explained by the cost in energy to form a surface .    to be quantitative , \n we have performed calculations of the energetics and structure of 4 in a gap between attractive silica walls @xcite and obtained the energy of the bulk roton ( c.f . \n [ fig : skwplot ] ) as a function of filling . fig . \n [ fig:3d - roton ] shows , as a typical example , the roton energetics in in a gap of 25    width . \n the independent parameter is the areal density @xmath35 , the corresponding three \n dimensional density was obtained by averaging the density profile over the full volume . \n it is seen that the equilibrium density is well below the bulk value . in other words , \n the roton energy in a confined liquid should correspond to the one of a liquid that would , without confinement , have a negative pressure . \n the energy increase of the roton minimum found in this model is about 0.5 k , which is consistent with the experiments of ref . . \n to verify this interpretation of the data , it would be very useful to have comparable measurements for porous media with a more uniform distribution of pore sizes . \n in particular , comparably small pores should allow to densities that are even below the bulk spinodal density @xcite , thus facilitating experiments on 4 in density areas that were up to now inaccessible .", "StartTimeOffset": 178033462585, "RequestID": "71c6352b4e9a4c5a9808fdab4c15788e", "TotalTokens": 3047}

gluon plasma is expected to form . \n thus , fast partons produced in hard scatterings interact with the extended medium that is subsequently produced in a heavy ion reaction . \n the interaction of partons with hot and dense nuclear matter leads to an energy loss of the partons . \n this parton energy loss is considered as a potential signature of a quark - gluon plasma formation since the energy loss in a medium of deconfined quarks and gluons is expected to be higher than in hadronic matter @xcite . \n an observable consequence of parton energy loss is the suppression of hadron production at large transverse momenta relative to a baseline expectation in the absence of energy loss . \n the construction of this baseline necessarily relies on model assumption . for the description of \n hard scattering processes the nucleons of the two colliding nuclei can be approximated as incoherent superpositions of partons . in this picture the particle yields in a heavy ion reaction are expected to scale with the number @xmath4 of inelastic nucleon -

{"ContextTokens": 2697, "GeneratedTokens": 188, "SynthesizedBody": "electrons are bound to the surface of superfluid helium by a weak image potential in addition to potentials from underlying electrostatic gates which control the position of these electrons on helium [ 1 - 4 ] . \n electrons typically float in vacuum about 10 nm above the surface , forming a clean two dimensional electron system ( 2des ) . \n it is a well studied system which has shown the highest mobility of any 2des [ 5 ] , and exhibited the first 2d wigner crystal [ 6 ] . \n electron spins have been studied as possible quantum bits ( qubits ) , since they are natural two level quantum systems , but their coherence is rapidly degraded during transport in semiconductors . unlike other electron spins in heterostructure 2des systems , spins on the surface of helium reside in vacuum and are expected to suffer much less decoherence , especially from spin - orbit interactions [ 7 ] . \n hence , the possibility of mobile qubits in a condensed matter system arises . using existing fabrication technology \n we have shown that manipulating a large number of spins with a small number of gates is possible [ 8 ] . \n devices with electrons confined in channels have been studied previously [ 9 - 13 ] . \n similar to those , a standard complementary metal - oxide - silicon ( cmos ) process at sandia national laboratory was used to fabricate 2@xmath1 m deep , 3@xmath1 m wide channels [ 14 ] . \n the upper metal interconnect layers are used to fabricate the channels and gates . \n the topmost metal layer defines the channel width , and acts as a mask for etching the surrounding dielectric layers ( sio@xmath2 ) down to the underlying gate electrodes , running under 120 parallel channels ( see fig.1 ) . \n electrons are photoemitted onto the sample from a zinc film placed a few millimeters above the device . by keeping the underlying gates positively biased with respect to the zinc film , \n electrons are attracted to the channels [ 15 ] . \n the large gate labeled  right reservoir \" is where the electrons are initially collected . \n electrons collected over the reservoir are blocked from moving above the small gates by keeping the  door \" gate dc - voltage negative ( repulsive ) with respect to the reservoir . \n lowering the door gate potential allows a packet of electrons to moves from the reservoir to the electron detection gates ,  twiddle \" and  sense \" . \n these electrons are detected through their capacitive coupling to the sense gate , which is connected to the gate of a nearby high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) . \n an ac - voltage is applied to the twiddle gate to push the electrons over the sense gate and pull them away . \n the sense gate sees a periodic charge induced voltage , which is buffered by the hemt and detected using a lockin amplifier . \n the small gates in the horizontal channels have a 3@xmath1 m period including a 0.5@xmath1 m gap . \n these underlying gates to the left of detection gates are connected as a 3-phase ccd , with every third gate connected by on - chip vias to its clock rail in a lower metal layer . \n each set of three gates ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ; makes up one pixel for electron control . \n a 2.5 @xmath1 m vertical channel connecting 120 horizontal channels has two extra gate electrodes , vccd@xmath2 and vccd@xmath6 . \n these two gates and @xmath72 from the horizontal channel comprise a 3-phase ccd to bring electrons from one channel to the others . the device is wired and mounted in a cell that is cooled to 1.6k . \n the cell is filled with superfluid helium up to about 1 cm below the device . \n helium fills the channels by capillary action with the depth in the channel being determined by the device structure . \n seven of the 120 parallel horizontal channels are seen , with a schematic cross - section to the right of the image . \n the darker regions of the image are the channels with underlying gates , and the lighter areas are the metal layer between the channels . \n electrons are confined above the helium in the channels by a positive dc bias ( 3v ) on the gates with respect to the top metal plane . \n the 3-phase ccd connection is drawn schematically below the micrographs . \n a cartoon above the channel image is a cut - away along the middle of a channel giving a scale view of the loading and detection gates . \n the horizontal channels are interposed by two memory cells for electron storage and an interconnecting vertical ccd channel . \n all gates used in these experiments run under and control electrons in all 120 channels in parallel . ] \n unprecedented electron transfer efficiency has been demonstrated by clocking a packet of electrons back and forth along the horizontal channels for more than one billion pixels [ 8 ] . \n when loading electrons from the reservoir onto the small gates , we initially clear out the ccd pixels and make sure that electrons in the right reservoir are blocked with the door gate closed ( negative ) . \n electrons are loaded from the reservoir onto the twiddle and sense gates by opening and then closing the door . to achieve a desired pixel occupancy , the potential of the door gate \n is lowered temporarily to bleed off excess electrons back to the reservoir . \n after the initial charge measurement , a packet of electrons is moved into one pixel of the ccds and clocked along the channels using an appropriate voltage sequence , similar to the 3-phase ccd sequence first described by boyle and smith[16 ] . \n the reliability of 2d transport in the channel array has also been tested using a vertical ccd channel . \n a packet of electrons in lower half of the channels ( 60 channels ) are moved in a \n c \" pattern : one pixel left , 60 pixels up , one pixel right , and then the sequence is reversed to return the electron packets to their starting point . \n no measurable failure has been seen after a billion pixel cycles . \n the sense gate runs under all 120 horizontal channels and thus measures the sum of the electrons in all of them . \n the signal calibration in units of electrons per channel assumes perfect uniformity over 120 parallel channels . \n when we see a signal corresponding to 120 electrons , we can not know whether there is one electron per channel or several electrons in some of the channels and none in the others . \n the vertical channel can be utilized in a measurement of the distribution of electrons amongst the horizontal channels . \n there are no reservoirs at the top or bottom of the array ( note that up and down are defined here by the orientation of fig . \n 1 ) . by progressively shifting the electrons up or down , \n electrons are ejected . when the remaining electrons are moved across to the sense gate , the signal is reduced . \n as long as the devices are not overcharged during the initial photoemission , bringing the underlying gates to the potential of the metal top plane serves to kick electrons out of the channels , probably out onto the thin van der waals helium film covering the top metal plane . \n it is likely that these ejected electrons are immobilized by the roughness of the metal in this area , though for the analysis of these data it is sufficient to know , experimentally , that the ejected electrons do not return to the channels . \n figure 2(a ) plots the results of two vertical clocking experiments where electrons are clocked up or down 120 pixels . \n one pixel cycle using @xmath72 , vccd@xmath2 , and vccd@xmath6 brings a packet of electrons up or down one channel . in the experiment , an electron packet in each channel \n is loaded from the reservoir , measured over the detection gates , and then clocked in the horizontal channels to the vertical ccd , over @xmath72 . \n this packet of electrons is clocked 12 pixels up or down and then brought back horizontally to the detection gates for a new measurement . \n this cycle continues until electrons from all 120 horizontal channels have been ejected at the top or bottom of the device . \n the data shows that all the groups of 12 channels , except the topmost 12 , have approximately equal populations . \n the experiments were done after a specific loading ( by photoemission ) of the right reservoir . by repeating such an experiment for many reservoir loading levels , we find that the population of all 120 channels are equalized when the right reservoir has been well - filled by photoemission . \n ( a ) measurement of the electron population of the horizontal channels for a typical initial loading of electrons . the circle ( blue ) and triangle ( red ) data points represent electron signals as the vertical channel is clocked upwards and downwards , respectively . \n the electron signal is normalized to the initial loading ; about 1600 electrons , or approximately 13.5 electrons per channel . \n the dashed black lines show a linear depopulation which would correspond to perfctly uniform channel occupation . \n ( b ) total number of electrons in all the channels after the c - pattern experiment . \n the electron signal is measured after each time the electrons were clocked up 10 pixels . a constant signal through the first 60 pixel cycles and \n then a linear decay confirm a uniform occupancy of the lower 60 channels . ]    after the c - pattern transport efficiency experiment described above , electrons occupying the lower 60 channels were brought to the vertical channel to measure the charge uniformity . \n electrons are clocked 10 pixels up and then brought across to the detection gates . \n the electron signal does not decrease for the first 60 pixel cycle which says that the top 60 channels are unoccupied , as expected ( these channels were emptied by the c - pattern ) . \n the electron signal decreases linearly after 60 pixel cycles , which confirms the uniformity of bottom 60 channels ( see fig . \n manipulating a large number of qubits is necessary for applications in quantum computing . \n the charge - coupled device with electrons on the surface of helium has shown undetectably rare electron transfer failure , allowing electrons to be positioned at any of more than four thousand distinct sites by controlling only five electrostatic gates . \n this interpretation rests on the assumption that all the channels are approximately equally populated . \n non uniformity could affect the interpretation of the clocking result , and it raises the question as to whether we can expect uniform occupancy for qc applications . \n we have shown that channel uniformity is achievable with the electron loading methods we have established , and have verified it using the vertical channel . \n we would like to thank s. shankar and g. sabouret for helpful discussions and j. donnal for the electronics to apply clock voltages to the ccd . \n work at princeton was supported by the nsf under grant nos . \n ccf-0726490 and dmr-1005476 . \n additionally , this work was performed , in part , at the center for integrated nanotechnologies , a u.s . \n department of energy , office of basic energy sciences user facility . \n sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by sandia corporation , a lockheed martin co. , for the united states department of energy under contract no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 2661, "GeneratedTokens": 93, "SynthesizedBody": "cellular automata ( cas ) are discrete dynamical systems that have been studied for years due to their architectural simplicity and the wide spectrum of behaviors they are capable of @xcite . here \n we study cas that can be said to perform a simple `` computational '' task . \n one such task is the so -

point configuration of all 1 s that we indicate as @xmath5 ; otherwise it must relax to a fixed - point configuration of all 0 s , noted @xmath6 , after a number of time steps of the order of the grid size @xmath0 . here \n @xmath0 is set to 149 , the value that has been customarily used in research on the density task ( if @xmath0 is odd one avoids the case @xmath7 for which the problem is undefined ) . \n this computation is trivial for a computer having a central control . \n indeed , just scanning the array and adding up the number of , say , 1 bits will provide the answer in @xmath8 time . \n however , it is nontrivial for a small radius one - dimensional ca since such a ca can only transfer information at finite speed relying on local information exclusively , while density is a global property of the configuration of states . \n it has been shown that the density task can not be solved perfectly by a uniform , two - state ca with finite radius @xcite . \n the lack of a perfect solution does not prevent one from searching for imperfect solutions of as good a quality as possible . in general , given a desired global behavior for a ca ( e.g. , the density task ) , it is extremely difficult to infer the local ca rule that will give rise to the emergence of the computation sought . \n this is because of the possible nonlinearities and large - scale collective effects that can not in general be predicted from the sole local ca updating rule , even if it is deterministic . since exhaustive evaluation of all possible rules is out of the question except for elementary ( @xmath9 ) and perhaps radius - two automata , one possible solution consists in using evolutionary algorithms , as first proposed by packard in @xcite and further developed by mitchell et al . \n + the _ standard performance _ of the best rules ( with @xmath10 ) found at the end of the evolution is defined as the fraction of correct classifications over @xmath11 randomly chosen ics . \n the ics are sampled according to a binomial distribution ( i.e. , each bit is independently drawn with probability @xmath3 of being 0 ) . \n + mitchell and coworkers performed a number of studies on the emergence of synchronous ca strategies for the density task ( with @xmath12 ) during evolution @xcite . \n their results are significant since they represent one of the few instances where the dynamics of emergent computation in complex , spatially extended systems can be understood . as for the evolved cas , it was noted that , in most runs , the ga found unsophisticated strategies that consisted in expanding sufficiently large blocks of adjacent 1s or 0s . \n this `` block - expanding '' strategy is unsophisticated in that it mainly uses local information to reach a conclusion . as a consequence , \n only those ic that have low or high density are classified correctly since they are more likely to have extended blocks of 1s or 0s . \n these cas have a performance around @xmath13 . \n a few runs yielded more sophisticated cas with performance ( around @xmath14 ) on a wide distribution of ics . \n however , high - performance automata have evolved only nine times out of @xmath15 runs of the genetic algorithm . \n this clearly shows that the search space is a very difficult one , even there exists some recent works on coevolutionary algorithm @xcite which able to find a number of `` block expanding '' strategies . \n these sophisticated strategies rely on traveling signals ( `` particles '' ) that transfer spatial and temporal information about the density in local regions through the lattice , and have been quantitatively described with a framework known as `` computational mechanics '' @xcite . \n the gkl rule @xcite is hand -

{"ContextTokens": 3916, "GeneratedTokens": 82, "SynthesizedBody": "in the past few years , quantum theory on a cone has attracted much attention . \n one of the motivations , besides theoretical interest in @xmath0 dimensional field theory , is the application to quantum field theory around cosmic strings . \n an idealized cosmic string , which is infinitely thin , can be represented by a conical singularity of space - time . \n quantum effect around cosmic strings has been studied by many authors including dowker @xcite , frolov @xcite , linet @xcite and smith.@xcite    the scattering by a cosmic string or a conical singularity has also been investigated recently.@xcite this non - trivial scattering is often dubbed as the gravitational aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .    it is interesting to consider `` radiative '' corrections to the gravitational ab scattering , which arise due to quantum fluctuations of all interacting field around cosmic strings .    in the present paper , \n we consider vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . \n then , charged particles scattered by a cosmic string undergo quatum corrections even if the cosmic string has no charge and no classical field strength . \n the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , the vacuum polarization of gauge field is obtained . in section 3 , we derive the quantum - mechanically corrected klein - gordon equation for a charged scalar field . the scattering amplitude is calculated in section 4 . \n section 5 is devoted to conclusion . \n in this section , we compute the vacuum value of @xmath1 around a infinite straight cosmic string , where @xmath2 is the electromagnetic field . \n connection to an effective wave equation for a charged scalar field is presented in the succeeding section . \n we first anticipate that @xmath3 , since there is no dimensional quantity other than the distance from the string . \n a comment on gauge invariance is in order . \n classically the presence of the cosmic string does not break the gauge invariance . at the one - loop level , however , one can see the breakdown of gauge symmetry near the cosmic string , due to the mass - like term @xmath4 in the scalar qed ; here the vacuum expectation value @xmath5 depends on the distance from the cosmic string . \n thus the non - zero expectation value of @xmath6 does not give rise to a real conflict . \n note also that we often encounter the expression @xmath7 in the discussion on the coleman - weinberg potential ( or radiative gauge - symmetry breaking ) in scalar qed at zero and finite temperature.@xcite    we assume the following line element around the idealized cosmic string which lies along the @xmath8 axis : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is related to the mass density of the string @xmath11 by @xmath12 . \n working in the coulomb gauge , we can denote the gauge field in the form of normal - mode expansion , such as @xmath13 mode functions @xmath14 are the solutions for the maxwell equations . in the coordinate system represented by eq . \n ( [ 2.1 ] ) , we find the following set of mode functions : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bessel function , @xmath17 is positive integer and @xmath18 .    using the mode functions \n , we can perform the calculation of @xmath19 by mode - summation . \n after regularization , we find that a finite portion of @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    the quantity has been regularized so as to become zero if @xmath21 . \n ( note that this is twice of the real - scalar contribution.@xcite ) the mode expansion is also useful to investigale properties of charged fields around a cosmic string.@xcite    in the next section , we consider the modification of field equation due to the vacuum field @xmath19 . \n suppose that a minimally - coupled scalar field @xmath22 is governed by klein - gordon equation , where the space - time derivative is replaced by the covariant derivative including the gauge field .    in this paper , we assume that the cosmic string has no classical electromagnetic field . \n although general cosmic strings in guts have fluxes in their core , their fluxes are not magnetic fluxes we know , but are associated with gauge fields of broken symmetry . for a superconducting cosmic string @xcite \n the analysis ought to be done by some other ways , since the metric is more or less deformed by electric currents . \n therefore , we treat the case with normal cosmic strings throughout this paper .    however , we take into account the vacuum expcctation value of the electromagnetic field . \n only the second moment @xmath23 appears and the field equation is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling constant and @xmath26 is the mass . \n the term @xmath27 behaves as a potential term .    if we use the metric ( [ 2.1 ] ) and substitute ( [ 2.2 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ 3.1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    a solution for the modified equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is written in the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in the following section \n , we study the scattering problem by use of this solution . \n we set @xmath33 in the following analysis in this paper . \n to treat the scattering by an infinite string , we consider two - dimensional scattering , taking the @xmath8-component of the momentum ( @xmath34 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) ) to be zero . we have set @xmath33 . \n we first review the scattering in two dimensions.@xcite the wave function behaves asymptotically , @xmath35 when a target sits at the origin . here \n @xmath36 is a scattering amplitude , and a differential cross section ( for a cosmic string , per unit length ) is given by @xmath37 . \n the phase in front of @xmath36 is chosen to simplify the expression of the optical theorem in two dimensions @xcite ( see later ) . in order to find the scattering amplitude , we compare the asymptotic form of the solution of the wave equation with ( [ 4.1 ] ) . \n we determine @xmath38 by matching the coefficient of the in - going `` spherical '' wave ( @xmath39 ) . \n the asymptotic form of the plane wave going in the @xmath40-direction is given by @xmath41 further if we assume that we can take the following asymptotic behavior of the solution for the wave equation : @xmath42 then we find @xmath43 where @xmath44 is called as a phase shift . \n now , we will turn back to the present problem . the wave equation to be considered \n ( [ 3.2 ] ) with @xmath33 . \n we regard @xmath45 as an independent parameter of @xmath10 for a later use . \n the mode solution ( [ 3.3 ] ) behaves asymptotically as @xmath46 where @xmath47 . \n thus one can find @xmath48    if @xmath49 is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath44 is negative when @xmath21 and @xmath50 . \n therefore we can say that the `` potential '' @xmath51 gives rise to a repulsive force . as studied and stated in ref . \n @xcite , the scattering amplitude for @xmath52 contains delta functions . \n namely , for @xmath53 , one can find @xcite @xmath54 this peculiarity originates from the conical space generates `` long - range force '' in some naive sense . \n we discuss the amplitude in which such divergences are removed.@xcite    we will calculate @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath17 : integer ) . \n we first compute the scattering amplitude for @xmath21 and @xmath58 ( we take @xmath45 as an independent parameter . ) . \n this is used for a check of general results . \n the result obtained by numerical calculation is shown in fig .  1 . \n we examine some approximation schemes .     and \n @xmath58 .

{"ContextTokens": 4096, "GeneratedTokens": 238, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spatial anisotropy at intermediate angular scales provide critical information on conditions in the early universe at redshifts @xmath5 , and put strong constraints on cosmological scenarios . \n in particular , measurements at degree angular scales provide a sensitive test of scale free fluctuations below the so called doppler peak ( @xcite ) .    on an angular scale of 10 , the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) \n satellite has detected anisotropy of @xmath6 @xmath3k ( @xcite ) . \n cross correlation with firs , an independent observation at much shorter wavelengths ( @xcite ) , confirms the cobe observation and its interpretation as cosmic in origin . \n white , scott , & silk ( 1994 ) provides a recent summary of measurements in this field . \n we report here the first results from a new instrument , bam ( balloon - borne anisotropy measurement ) , which measures at angular scales from to several degrees , angles just larger than typically predicted for the location the first doppler peak . measurements at this scale will determine the angular spectral index of primordial inhomogeneities . \n bam consists of a cryogenic differential fourier transform spectrometer coupled to an off - axis prime focus telescope . \n the advantages of the bam approach to measuring cmb anisotropy , consisting of a clean optical system and good spectral coverage , have been described elsewhere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the spectrometer ( @xcite ) was previously used for a measurement of the cmb spectrum ( @xcite ) . for this experiment , the spectrometer is fitted with new input optics and passband - limiting filters , a new long duration @xmath7he refrigerator ( tucker et al . \n 1996 ) and is housed in a new cryostat . \n the telescope is pointed with a three - axis servo system locked to guide stars . \n the electronic and electromechanical components of a pointing system used previously with other balloon - borne instruments ( @xcite ) were incorporated into a new lightweight balloon gondola . \n the two input collimators of the differential spectrometer view the same portion of the aluminum primary mirror , resulting in two input beams on the sky which are @xmath8 fwhm separated by @xmath9 . \n the optical arrangement is sketched in figure 1 . \n particular attention is paid to the suppression of spurious radiation entering the instrument . \n a diffraction control horn surrounds the two spectrometer entrance windows so that neither window is visible from anywhere except in reflection off the primary mirror . \n a reflective ground shield surrounds the entire lower portion of the instrument so that no part of the diffraction control horn , input collimators , or primary mirror is directly illuminated by radiation from the earth . \n the interferometer has two independent bolometric detectors , one for each output port . \n each bolometer yields a double sided interferogram proportional to the brightness difference between the two input beams . \n the scanning time for one interferogram is 0.67 s , and the optical path length difference runs from 1.44 to @xmath10 cm . \n spectra are obtained _ a posteriori _ by fourier transforming these interferograms . \n bam was launched from the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas at 00:45 ut ( at sunset ) on 8 july 1995 and reached a float altitude of 41.5 km at 05:00 ut . \n observations ended at 09:00 ut , in darkness , when the payload was near the end of telemetry range and the flight was terminated . \n the payload was recovered with only minor damage .    to calibrate the instrument and measure the beam profile , three scans of the telescope beams across the planet jupiter \n were made just prior to reaching a stable float altitude . \n the scans were made in azimuth at three fixed elevation angles , so that jupiter passed through both beams of the telescope . \n unfortunately , the elevation angles were not chosen optimally so jupiter was scanned only with the lower half of the telescope beams . as a result the maximum possible signal from jupiter was never realized . using data about the beam shape obtained on the ground prior to flight , along with the flight data \n , it is estimated that the maximum observable signal is @xmath11 times larger than the measured response . \n the data of griffin et al . \n ( 1986 ) for jupiter have been used as an absolute reference to calibrate the power sensitivity of the instrument . \n the total calibration uncertainty is 20% .    soon after reaching float altitude , \n an integrated circuit on board the telescope pointing system failed . \n this caused disruption of commands controlling the telescope orientation . \n the telescope remained locked to guide stars , but slewing the telescope to new orientations could not be carried out on the planned schedule . \n after diagnosing the problem , a switch was made to a redundant telemetry channel not originally intended to be used for in - flight control ; and a software patch was also developed . \n thus , reliable operation of the pointing system was re - established for the last half hour of flight . \n the instrument performed well despite these problems , but the reduction of observing time reduced the sensitivity , and the disruption of the planned observing pattern limited the ability to check for atmospheric effects .    as this was the first flight of bam , a conservative observation strategy was adopted to allow the instrument performance to be understood . \n the telescope observes near the meridian above the north celestial pole . \n the left telescope beam is moved to a target spot east of the meridian and the telescope is locked with reference to a guide star within 5@xmath12 of the beam . \n a series of single difference interferograms , @xmath13 , are obtained while tracking the guide star . \n after a period of observation , called a stare , the telescope is slewed so that the right beam is on the target spot and a second series of interferograms , @xmath14 , is accumulated . \n the series @xmath15 is called a wobble . \n the difference signal @xmath16 is an interferogram of the difference in brightness between the target spot and the average of the two spots to either side of it . \n wobbling is repeated while tracking the target spot to west of the meridian after which a new target spot east of the meridian is acquired . \n it had been intended to initiate a new stare every three minutes , but the command intermittency resulted in not wobbling for periods of up to fifteen minutes in duration . \n the data set consists of a series of three - minute long data files containing the bolometer and optical path length difference signals sampled uniformly in time along with 50 channels of auxiliary data . \n each file contains approximately 263 interferograms . about 10% of the data in each interferogram \n is deleted corresponding to the time that the interferometer mirror is slowing and reversing direction at the ends of the scan . because the bolometer signals are sampled uniformly in time and the interferometer speed is not constant , it is necessary to perform an interpolation of the data to acquire interferogram samples uniformly spaced in optical delay . \n these interpolated interferograms are edited as follows . \n those interferograms corresponding to periods in which the telescope was slewing are deleted ( 23.2% ) . \n data contaminated by the effects of cosmic rays striking the bolometers are removed from the remaining data using the following algorithm . for each stare , a mean and variance are computed at each value of optical delay in the interferogram . \n any individual interferogram containing a point more than @xmath17 from the mean is excluded from further analysis ; a total of 6.7% of the data are deleted this way . to exclude smaller cosmic ray events which are hidden in the variance caused by the events removed above \n , the process is repeated on the remaining interferograms , and a further 2.0% of the data are deleted . after the above editing 61.4% of all the data remain for analysis . \n spectra are calculated using an fft routine to find the fourier transform of each interferogram . \n interferograms obtained during ascent contain an appreciable atmospheric signal . \n these data are used to provide a reference for phase correcting the interferograms , that is , removing the effects of phase shifts in the bolometers and amplifiers . \n thus , optical signals appear only in the fourier cosine transform . \n the sine component of the phase corrected fourier transform contains no optical data at any frequency but provides a monitor of systematic errors . \n signals from the atmosphere at float altitude are too weak to provide a phase correction reference . \n an independent and consistent phase correction is obtained from the jupiter data . \n we had intended to analyze the data using a double difference technique taking data from temporally adjacent stares in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 positions . however , the unreliable wobbling achieved during flight precludes such an analysis . therefore only single differences are analyzed . \n each stare is divided into two half - stares . \n for each half - stare the difference spectrum @xmath20 ) is calculated where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 subscripts on the symbol @xmath21 have been dropped since only single differences are being considered . \n the symbol @xmath22 indicates a fourier transform , and @xmath23 is a known constant offset interferogram due to radiation internal to the instrument . \n the magnitude of the offset is about 20 mk . \n the variances of the @xmath24 s , @xmath25 , are also computed and are an error estimate unbiased by sky signal ; these error estimates are propagated through the remainder of the analysis .    during the flight , a gap in the anisotropy data of about an hour occurred while the software patch was being developed . during this time \n the telescope observed another part of the sky , at a different elevation angle than for the data reported here . \n ( unfortunately , because wobbling was absent conclusions about anisotropies could not be drawn at this different elevation angle ; the data were used , however , to help check for systematic errors . ) \n the data taken before and after the gap are analyzed separately but identically . \n for each frequency channel the data are simultaneously fitted to a model of the sky , a constant offset , a linear drift in time , payload altitude , and the temperature of the torque motor which drives the spectrometer scan mechanism . \n the fits are done independently for the cosine and sine transforms and a full covariance matrix is propagated . \n the reduced @xmath26 for the fits range between 0.37 and 1.20 . in the worst frequency channel \n the total drift during the flight is 2.5 mk while in the best channel the drift is 500 @xmath3k . \n the torque motor just referred to is located in an ambient temperature region of the cryostat vacuum space . \n approximately every 30 minutes by operator choice , a heater on the torque motor was turned on or off in order to maintain the motor temperature in a useful range . \n this power variation caused the motor temperature to vary by 4 k during the flight . \n apparently heat conducted from the motor through the shaft to the mirror scanning mechanism differentially heated the interferometer housing . a significant drift ( up to 600 @xmath3k ) correlated with the torque motor temperature is observed in the sine transforms but is not apparent in the cosine transforms . since light emitted from the interferometer walls is modulated differently from light entering the interferometer through the input collimators , it is plausible that such a signal would only appear in one phase of the transforms , as observed . \n in addition to the torque motor temperature , a number of other temperatures and differential temperatures are measured both inside the cryostat and elsewhere on the gondola . with the exception of the torque motor temperature , no correlation between @xmath27 and any temperature or differential temperature is observed . \n in particular , a 2 k temperature gradient was induced across the primary mirror near the end of the flight by heating one side of the mirror . \n no correlation is observed between @xmath27 and the temperature of the primary mirror or temperature gradient across the mirror .    due to the limited integration time and failure to obtain a sufficient number of _ \n double _ differences , the sensitivity achieved in each frequency channel is modest and inadequate to accurately constrain the spectral index of any observed signal ; therefore we present only band average data . \n the final single differences are shown in figure 2 .    if each stare is divided instead into thirds , the analysis yields consistent results . \n however with finer subdivision , the final differences are discrepant indicating the presence of a non - stationary noise source . \n the cross elevation of the telescope oscillates with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 04 and a period of 12 s. this may be the source of the non - stationary noise . however , the sensitivity on these very long time scales is low and it has been impossible to find and remove any correlation . \n another problem which gave concern is that there is increased noise in the detectors when the interferometer mirror is scanning ; however , there is no evidence that this has introduced systematic effects that could mimic a detected signal . \n there is strong evidence that the observed signals are from optical sources external to the instrument . \n significant power is detected only in the cosine component of the spectrum , which contains optical signals , while the sine component , which does not contain optical signals , is consistent with noise . \n given the limited integration time , we can not reliably dismiss the possibility that the signal is from the atmosphere . \n it is also difficult to rule out definitively earthshine and moonshine entering the instrument differentially although much care has been exercised in designing the ground shield . \n there appears to be a mild correlation between the cosine and sine single differences ( consisting of a monotonic drift in offset during the flight ) . \n the cause of this possible correlation is unknown . \n because the power in the correlated part of the signal does not exceed the power in the sine component , and the power in the sine component is negligible , it can be concluded that the small correlated component has minimal effect on the detected power in the cosine component . \n the structure in figure 2 does not correlate with the iras 100 @xmath3 m maps ( wheelock et al . \n 1993 ) .    assuming that cmb anisotropy is gaussian correlated with a correlation angle @xmath28 , a likelihood analysis ( @xcite ) has been performed on the full frequency band data . for a given @xmath28 , the 90% confidence interval on @xmath29 \n is computed by integrating the resulting likelihood curve . \n the results are shown in figure  3 . \n a value @xmath30 at a coherence angle of @xmath31 is derived ; the calibration uncertainty is not included in this number . \n for the sine component of the spectrum a null signal is expected . applying the same analysis to the sine component , \n a signal consistent with zero is found ; a 95% upper limit of @xmath32 is found for @xmath31 . \n this is a measure of the instrumental sensitivity . in particular , the signal associated with any correlation between the sine and cosine components shown in figure 2 is not larger than the full sine amplitude , and thus is consistent with zero and not consistent with the power detected in the cosine component .    using the approximations of steinhardt ( 1995 ) and white & scott ( 1994 ) , \n the detected cosine amplitude can be expressed as @xmath2 @xmath3k where the effective spherical harmonic of the observation geometry is @xmath33 . \n statistically significant fluctuations in the microwave sky have been observed . \n however , the spectrum has not been measured with sufficient sensitivity to attribute these fluctuations definitively to cosmic origin . on the other hand \n the new results are similar to those of others measuring anisotropies ; that is , there are scattered regions of the sky whose temperatures are unexpectedly high . clearly , it is becoming urgent to establish whether these regions pertain to the cosmic background . \n this new instrument , bam , is potentially capable of doing this in a full flight , since it measures the spectrum of the anisotropies .    without pointing system problems and a longer balloon flight , \n an increase of 48 in integration time is easily achievable . \n in addition another factor of 24 in reduced detector noise is easily realizable with a new mirror scanning mechanism . \n we expect to adopt a more optimal observing strategy and spectral resolution for the next flight . \n we would like to emphasize that the modest sensitivity obtained in this flight is the result of a series of mechanical and electrical malfunctions and is not the result of any fundamental limit of the instrument . \n in addition all of the malfunctions have readily identifiable causes . \n preventing a recurrence of these malfunctions provides no serious technical challenges . \n we would like to acknowledge the expert flight support provided by the united states national scientific balloon facility , palestine , texas . \n caitlin davis , miranda jackson and chris padwick helped prepare for and assisted with the flight . \n the undergraduate students gill bakker , jamie borisoff , kevin driedger , dan griggs and chris trautman helped build parts of the instrument . \n we would like to thank ed wishnow for his extremely valuable help in palestine , texas during his vacation . \n we thank the ubc mechanical and electrical shops . \n this research was supported by the canadian space agency , the natural science and engineering research council of canada and the particle physics and astronomy research council of the united kingdom .", "StartTimeOffset": 203710659651, "RequestID": "b73d9496bed64e928a828a8613fe8bfe", "TotalTokens": 4334}
{"ContextTokens": 3842, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "results of the ceres experiment show a significantly higher dilepton yield in the invariant mass region between about 200 and 600 mev compared to that from a hadronic cocktail based on known reaction channels . after adding in the  expected  secondary @xmath0 yield the observed yield is still underestimated by a hadronic cocktail by a sensitivity factor of about 3 . while there is also an attempt to explain these observations in terms of standard classical hadronic sources @xcite by exploiting their experimental uncertainties , most theoretical explanations invoke a change of the properties of the vector meson masses and widths . \n some of these are based on classical collision broadening whereas others involve @xmath1 mixing as a precursor to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . however , all these attempts have in common that in a first step they determine the in - medium properties in hot and dense equilibrium and then use these locally either in transport calculations or in more simplified expansion scenarios . \n the latter procedure is obviously not a - priori correct for an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision which  at least in its early stages  proceeds far away from equilibrium . \n it is worthwhile to realize that even in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions with their high peak densities about 60 % of all dileptons are produced at densities below @xmath2 ( see fig .  7 in @xcite ) \n this is so because the observed yield inherently contains an integration over the whole reaction history and thus the late stages of the reaction with high pion densities contribute via @xmath3 a significant part to the total observed dilepton yield . \n it is , therefore , intriguing to ask if other reactions involving more elementary probes on nuclei that proceed closer to equilibrium can be used to investigate the question of in - medium changes of hadronic properties . while the density in such reactions obviously is always below @xmath4 , this disadvantage may be overcome by the cleaner and more stable environment in which dilepton production proceeds in such reactions .    in this talk \n i show that indeed pion- and photon - induced dilepton production on nuclei is as sensitive to possible in - medium changes as are heavy - ion reactions . \n i will also  in the last part of this talk  show how in - medium changes of vector mesons are expected to show up not only in dilepton spectra , but also in photo - absorption processes . \n such a connection , if it can be firmly established , clearly adds to the consistency of our picture of in - medium changes of hadrons . \n details to all the points i am going to discuss in this talk can be found in a number of recent publications @xcite and in particular in the phd thesis of martin effenberger @xcite . \n the calculations shown in this talk are all based on a new development in transport theory that allows one to also tranport broad resonances . \n while former calculations ( for a review see @xcite ) had to employ simplifiying assumptions the calculations of effenberger et al.@xcite , for the first time , implemented a transport - theoretical treatment of broad mesons and treated the widths of the vector mesons consistently . \n the theoretical breakthrough here was to transport not the phase - space density @xmath5 , but a spectral phase space density @xmath6 that contains also information about the spectral function of the resonance .    in @xcite \n ( see also @xcite ) we have discussed in detail that a consistent formulation of the scattering term , that takes the spectral function of the particles into account , puts automatically intrinsically broad , collision - broadened resonances ( such as , e.g.  the @xmath7 meson )  because of their frequent decay and reformation as they traverse the nucleus  back on their free spectral function when they leave the nucleus . \n a problem arises , however , when particles with intrinsically sharp spectral functions , such as the nucleon or the @xmath8 meson , get collision broadened . \n in such a case the repetitive decay and reformation is not frequent enough so that these particles would emerge from the collision still collision - broadened . in order to surpress this unphysical behavior we introduced an ad - hoc potential that drives all particles back on mass - shell when they leave the nucleus @xcite . \n it is amusing that this potential , that we intuitively guessed in ref . \n @xcite , can  for sharp resonances , where @xmath9  actually be derived from the kadanoff - baym equations @xcite . \n the results presented here are based on this method ( for more details see @xcite ) . \n the equation of motion for the spectral phase space distribution reads @xmath10 with the spectral phase - space - density @xmath11 the spectral function @xmath12 and the usual phase - space density @xmath13 . as stressed in particular by knoll \n @xcite it is essential to maintain the consistency condition that the total width appearing in the spectral function is related to the loss - term @xmath14 in the transport equation @xmath15 since this condition presents a major consistency problem it has been fulfilled in the calculations reported here only for the vector mesons . in @xcite it was shown that the two - body collisional width does not broaden the nucleon resonances significantly . \n for all further details i refer the reader to @xcite . \n with the availability of a @xmath16 beam at gsi and the detectorsystem hades @xcite it will be possible to explore dilepton production in pion - induced reactions on nuclei . \n we have , therefore , performed extensive studies of such reactions @xcite . \n input to these calculations are cross sections predicted by the manley coupled channel analysis of @xmath17 data @xcite on which our analysis is based . \n the transport calculations allow one to follow the collision history of all vector mesons produced . with realistic @xmath18 cross sections we obtain a collision width @xmath19 of up to 500 mev for the @xmath7 meson and 70 mev for the @xmath8 , both at normal nuclear matter density @xcite . \n the overall sensitivity to these effects is about a factor 2 , which is close to the expected systematic uncertainty of these transport calculations . \n however , this sensitivity can be enhanced by performing appropriate cuts on the dilepton cm momenta . \n [ picut ] shows that with a cut that selects only slow vector mesons the sensitivity to various in - medium scenarios , in particular for the @xmath8 meson , is clearly strong enough to be seen experimentally . \n pions have one possible disadvantage for such in - medium studies : they experience a strong initial - state interaction and thus a pion - beam illuminates only a part of the nucleus . \n this is visible in fig.[pi - gamma ill ] which shows in the two lower figures the location of the first collision of the pion with the nucleons of the target ( left ) and all meson - baryon collisions ( right ) . \n the upper two figures give the same information for a photon beam . \n the left part shows clearly how the photon illuminates the whole nuclear volume and not just the surface . \n subsequent collisions remember this initial state as shown in the right part of this figure . \n thus , we expect that photon - induced experiments will be even more sensitive to in - medium changes of hadronic properties than experiments with pions .    that the theory , with the proper , consistent treatment of in - medium broadening describes the normal photonuclear processes very well is shown in a comparison with data for photo - pion , photo-2pion and photon - eta production data at energies up to 800 mev @xcite . \n we are thus quite confident that we have these photonuclear processes well under control and can thus use these methods to predict and investigate the sensitivity of photonuclear dilepton production data to in - medium changes of vector meson properties . \n photon - induced dilepton data have the problem that they necessarily contain a big contribution from the so - called bethe - heitler process in which the incoming photon radiates already a dilepton pair before any coupling to the hadrons takes place \n . as is well known , however , this contribution can be surpressed by proper kinematical cuts @xcite , both for the incoherent and the coherent part @xcite . \n [ gamdilsens ] then shows the sensitivity of the dilepton spectra to various in - medium changes of the vector mesons . \n it is immediately apparent , that this sensitivity is just as large as for the ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . in particular , again the @xmath8 properties \n are reflected quite clearly in the ( still to be measured ) dilepton spectra . as in the case of pions \n one can enrich the in - medium sensitivity by making a cut on the dilepton cm momentum . \n all the in - medium effects on vector meson spectral functions are connected with a significant broadening and corresponding shift of strength to lower masses . \n this has an interesting consequence for the decay of the n(1520 ) resonance that i have already pointed out in @xcite in 1997 . according to the particle data group listing , which is based on manley s analysis @xcite in this respect , this @xmath20 resonance decays on resonance with a probability of 15 - 25 % into @xmath21 and this , even though this decay is energetically closed if one works with the pole mass of the ( broad ) @xmath7 . \n thus the decay can proceed only through the low - mass tails of the @xmath7-meson spectral function ; the rather large partial decay width in turn indicates a large coupling constant for the vertex @xmath22 . \n if the @xmath7 meson s spectral function in nuclear matter indeed gains strength at low masses then the partial @xmath7 decay width of the @xmath23 resonance would increase dramatically . \n this effect may already have been experimentally seen . the data for photoabsorption on nuclei exhibit a universal behavior that  beginning with rather small mass numbers @xmath24  scales with @xmath24 . \n this universal cross section exhibits the @xmath25 resonance  though somewhat broadened  , but the second and third resonance regions around 1500 and 1650 mev , respectively , that are well seen in photoabsorption on the nucleon , have disappeared in nuclei @xcite . \n fermi - motion alone is the more effective in smearing out resonance strength the higher the energy of the resonance is . \n this alone explains the absence of the third resonance region @xcite . \n the second resonance region , around 1500 mev , however , survives the effects of fermi - smearing . \n we have shown in @xcite that this finds a natural explanation in the opening of the @xmath7-decay channel of the @xmath23 resonance . with @xmath7 strength moving in medium down to lower masses \n the formerly nearly closed decay opens up dramatically thus leading to a very large ( several hundred mev ) total width of this resonance . \n crucial for this argument is the high partial decay width of the @xmath20 resonance into the @xmath21 channel . \n this has so far , not been directly verified by experiment ; the cited large partial decay width is based only on a theoretical coupled channel analysis @xcite . \n although it is gratisfying to see that a similar result also emerges now from the cc calculations of friman , lutz and wolf @xcite , a direct experimental verification of this decay branch would necessitate a detailed partial - wave analysis of ( @xmath26 ) reactions on the nucleon which so far does not exist . \n it is , however , encouraging , that the daphne collaboration @xcite and the taps collaboration @xcite , both at mami , have found experimental evidence for pion invariant mass spectra in such reactions that show clear deviations from phase - space . \n in this talk i have shown that pion- and photon - induced reactions show a sensitivity to in - medium changes of hadrons that is as large as that observed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . \n this result was originally unexpected because of the much lower baryon densities probed in such elementary reactions on nuclei ( @xmath27 ) , compared with those obtained in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( @xmath28 ) . \n it finds its explanation in the fact that all experimentally observed dilepton spectra contain an integration over the whole reaction history , which , in the case of heavy - ions , runs from @xmath29 to more than @xmath30 and then back down again to nearly @xmath31 while the pion- or photon - induced reaction on nuclei always proceeds close to @xmath4 , i.e.  much closer to equilibrium .    in my opinion , an unequivocal identification of the origins of changes of hadronic spectral functions observed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions \n will not be possible as long as the more elementary reactions on nuclei have not been studied as well . \n it is obvious that hadronic in - medium effects , if they are observed in such reactions at or below @xmath4 , have nothing to do with any transition to the qgp and even a possible connection with chiral symmetry restoration , a very popular keyword in this field , will be hard to establish ( of course , duality arguments can always be used to keep this connection alive ! ) . \n what we can learn , however , are interaction rates of hadrons with baryons , also for unstable hadrons , and this alone will be an exciting prospect . experiments with hades using the pion beam at gsi and experiments with photon beams , starting now with taps at mami , will help us to clarify the issue of in - medium changes of hadrons . \n for example , a close comparison of dilepton spectra obtained in pion - induced reactions with those obtained with photons should allow one to sample quite different density regions and thus in - medium effects , in particular for the @xmath8 meson . \n this is illustrated without further words in fig . \n [ spacedist ] . \n 99 v. koch , these proceedings , and references therein r. rapp , these proceedings , and references therein w. cassing , e.l . \n bratkovskaya and s. juchem , nucl -

{"ContextTokens": 3527, "GeneratedTokens": 271, "SynthesizedBody": "recent studies of the electronic structure of ( ga , mn)as by spin - resolved photoemission @xcite indicate that the surface region of a ( ga , mn)as sample can be regarded as a layer with properties qualitatively different from those of the underlying bulk . in particular , the authors of the cited paper demonstrate that the surface of this material has a ferromagnetic character even at room temperature ; consequently , in these temperature conditions a ( ga , mn)as sample will include a ferromagnetic phase confined to a very thin surface region . \n the above - mentioned finding can be a precious contribution to the ongoing debate @xcite on the essential mechanisms increasing the curie temperature in ( ga , mn)as , since in the light of the cited paper @xcite in - depth studies of the nature of the surface ferromagnetism in this material could bring us closer to the understanding of the processes that might increase its curie temperature even to the room temperature range . \n the present study is devoted to spin - wave resonance ( swr ) , a very effective experimental method for the study of ferromagnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as thin films , and their surface in particular . it allows full characterization of the _ surface magnetic anisotropy _ , which , as we demonstrate here , provides the basis for the determination of the existence conditions of magnetic ( spin - wave ) modes localized at the _ surface _ of a ( ga , mn)as sample . we believe that this result is a step forward in exploring the differences in ferromagnetic properties between the surface and bulk of this material . \n the existence of surface spin - wave modes ( sswms ) in ( ga , mn)as thin films was first reported by liu _ et al . _ \n @xcite , which observed sswms in both the out - of - plane configuration , with variable polar angle  @xmath3 between the magnetization of the film and its surface normal , and the in - plane configuration , with variable azimuth angle  @xmath0 between the in - plane magnetization of the film and the [ 100 ] crystal axis . in the former case sswms only exist when the polar angle  @xmath3 is larger than a certain angle    the _ out - of - plane critical angle _    while in the in - plane configuration sswms are observed in the azimuth angle range _ between _ two _ in - plane critical angle_s . \n these experimental findings are interpreted theoretically in our recent papers @xcite , in which we propose an appropriate model of surface anisotropy that both explains the existence of critical angles and allows to determine the conditions of existence of sswms in full agreement with the experimental data . in our model of surface \n anisotropy we use the concept of surface pinning parameter  @xmath4 , which describes the freedom of precessing surface spins in relation to the freedom of precessing bulk spins . we have determined the functions  @xmath5 and @xmath6 describing the configuration dependence of the surface parameter in the out - of - plane and in - plane configurations , respectively . the explicit formula for the in - plane surface parameter reads@xcite : @xmath7 . \n \\label{a_surf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a satisfactory interpretation of the experimental swr spectra obtained in the in - plane configuration @xcite is achieved with the surface parameter described by the series presented above in equation  ( [ a_surf ] ) ( found in an investigation discussed in detail in @xcite ) with the following values of the series coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 and  @xmath10 : @xmath11 the series coefficients in equation  ( [ a_surf ] ) describe the contributions of different surface anisotropy components to the surface spin pinning in ( ga , mn)as thin films : @xmath8 is the isotropic contribution to the pinning , @xmath9 is related to the uniaxial component , and @xmath10 describes the pinning due to the cubic anisotropy .    in our model \n the critical angles are determined by the condition , and the configuration angles for which sswms exist by the condition . \n based on these conditions , in the present paper we will discuss the impact of each of the surface anisotropy components appearing in eq . \n ( [ a_surf ] ) , and provide a physical interpretation of their respective roles in the generation of sswms . to this end we will use a surface pinning diagram built in the polar coordinate system ; using this pinning diagram we will obtain a graphical representation of the configuration dependence of the pinning felt by the surface spins . \n the surface pinning diagram is a planar map showing how the dynamics of surface spins in a ( ga , mn)as thin film changes with their orientation with respect to specific crystal axes that characterize the surface structure . the pinning diagram is based on a polar coordinate system lying in the plane of the film surface ( see  fig . \n [ rys1 ] ) .    in this coordinate system \n the azimuth angle  @xmath0 describes the orientation of the magnetization of the sample with respect to a reference axis , which is the [ 100 ] crystal axis ; the distance between a point in the diagram and the pole of the coordinate system measures the value of the surface pinning parameter  @xmath12 corresponding to a given azimuth angle . against the pinning diagram in fig . \n [ rys1 ] we have added the crystal axes characterizing the magnetic anisotropy in the ( ga , mn)as sample used in the spin - wave resonance  ( swr ) study@xcite ( in which the swr measurements were performed in the ( 001 ) in - plane configuration ) .    introduced in papers @xcite , the concept of surface pinning parameter  @xmath13 was proposed to describe the degree of freedom of surface spins in their precession . by definition \n the surface pinning parameter value  @xmath14 corresponds to the natural freedom of the surface spins resulting from breaking their bonds with neighbors eliminated from the system by surface cut . \n this particular value of  @xmath13 divides the ( @xmath15 ) plane into two different regions : within the circle of radius  @xmath16 , where only bulk spin - wave modes exist , and region beyond this circle , in which sswms exist in the spectrum of allowed modes ( see also @xcite ) . \n the pinning diagram in fig .  [ rys2 ] presents the configuration dependence of the surface parameter resulting from our formula ( 1 ) against the experimental data obtained by liu  _ et  al . _ \n @xcite ; squares indicate the experimental surface parameter values corresponding to different configurations . \n the theory proves to fit very well the experiment . \n moreover , as we will see below in fig . \n [ rys3 ] , the theory reproduces faithfully the experimentally observed evolution of the swr spectrum with the azimuth angle  @xmath0 . \n figure  [ rys3 ] shows spin - wave mode profiles resulting from our theory and the corresponding swr spectra for five representative in - plane configurations that correspond to azimuth angles  @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( these configurations are also indicated in fig \n .  [ rys2 ] , where they are marked with red circles ) . \n the most important feature of the configuration evolution that the experimental swr spectrum undergoes as the azimuth angle increases to reach the consecutive values mentioned above is that from a multi - peak swr spectrum at  @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) consisting exclusively of bulk modes , it becomes a single - peak fmr spectrum at the critical angle  @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) , and then , as the azimuth angle continues to grow above this critical value , regains its previous multi - peak form in the azimuth angle range @xmath23 , in which , however , it now includes a resonance peak corresponding to a surface mode ( see the case with @xmath24 ; @xmath25 . \n this result is a strong evidence that the swr spectra measured in the in - plane configuration by liu  _ et  al . _ \n @xcite fulfill perfectly the assumptions of the surface inhomogeneity model , in which a key role is played by the surface magnetic anisotropy , constituting the source of the above - discussed effects . \n figure  [ rys4]a shows two curves , each representing the azimuth angle dependence of a part of surface pinning resulting from selected anisotropies  the total contribution of the isotropic and uniaxial anisotropies is analyzed independently of the pinning related to the cubic anisotropy . \n the first two contributions consonantly introduce the pinning to that region of the diagram in which sswms exist for any azimuth orientation ( green ring in the diagram ) . \n in contrast , the pinning resulting from the cubic anisotropy , represented by a quadrifolium - like curve , is completely embedded in the region within the circle of radius  @xmath16 ; however , since the circle  @xmath16 corresponds to the natural pinning , this implies that the cubic anisotropy alone will not induce sswms in any azimuth orientation . \n thus , already at this point , before proceeding to the analysis of the full pinning diagram presented in fig . \n [ rys4]b , we must realize that it will result from two above - mentioned opposite tendencies .    as a result of the summation of the above - mentioned pinning contributions with different effects on the spins \n one increasing their freedom , the other reducing it    in the full pinning diagram ( fig . \n [ rys4]b ) the green ring is reduced to four islands that still remain within the region of surface mode existence . \n each of these islands is associated with one hard cubic anisotropy axis , as indicated in fig . \n [ rys1 ] . also , each island corresponds to an azimuth angle range between the two critical angles for which @xmath16 ; each of these angle ranges surrounds symmetrically the cubic anisotropy axis . \n _ it is in these azimuth angle ranges that sswms exist_. beyond them the cubic anisotropy has a destructive effect on the surface modes ; this destruction is apparent in regions symmetric with respect to the _ easy cubic anisotropy axes_.    now we can provide physical grounds to these observations . \n a hard magnetic axis is a direction in which spins are reluctant to align , and setting them in an equilibrium direction involves a high energy cost to the system . \n thus , the opposite tendency    divergence from the hard axis    must be more favorable energetically . \n this implies that a _ hard cubic anisotropy axis _ plays the role of an _ easy axis _ for the _ spin pinning _ ; we can refer to it as an _ \n easy pinning axis _ , i.e. , an axis from which spins diverge easily , since their pinning along its direction is weaker . and vice versa : an _ easy cubic anisotropy axis _ defines a direction that spins are reluctant to quit     a _ hard surface pinning axis _ that hampers the occurrence of sswms . \n thus , the following final conclusion can be drawn from our considerations based on the pinning diagram : _ in a ( ga , mn)as thin film conditions favorable for the occurrence of surface spin - wave modes in the in - plane configuration are fulfilled first of all for those azimuth orientations of the magnetization of the sample that lie around the hard axes of cubic magnetic anisotropy_. \n this study is a part of a project financed by narodowe centrum nauki ( national science centre of poland ) , grant no . \n dec-2013/08/m / st3/00967 . \n j.  kanski , l.  ilver , k.  karlsson , m.  leandersson , i.  ulfat and j.  sadowski , _ electronic structure of ( ga , mn)as revisited : an alternative view on the `` battle of the bands '' _ , arxive : 1410.8842v2 [ cond-mat.mtrl-sci ] . \n m.  dobrowolska , k.  tivakornsasithorn , x.  liu , j.  k.  furdyna , m.  berciu , k.  m.  yu and w.  walukiewicz , _ controlling the curie temperature in ( ga , mn)as through location of the fermi level within the impurity band _ , nature  materials * 11 * , 444 ( 2012 ) \n . n.  samarth , _ battle of bands _ , nature  materials * 11 * , 360 ( 2012 ) . \n x.  liu , y .- y . \n zhou , and j.  k.  furdyna , _ angular dependence of spin - wave resonances and surface spin pinning in ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as films _ , phys . \n b  * 75 * , 195220 ( 2007 ) . \n h.  puszkarski and p.  tomczak , _ spin - wave resonancphys . \n status solidi b , e model of surface pinning in ferromagnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as thin films _ , sci .  rep . \n * 4 * , 6135 ( 2014 ) . \n h.  puszkarski and p.  tomczak , _ spin - wave resonance in ( ga , mn)as thin films : probing in - plane surface magnetic anisotropy _ , phys . \n rev .  b  * 91*. 195437 ( 2015 ) . h.  puszkarski and p.  tomczak , _ \n model for the surface anisotropy field observed in spin - wave resonance in ( ga , mn)as thin films _ , acta  phys . \n polon .  a  * 127 * , 508 ( 2015 ) . h.  puszkarski , _ quantum theory of spin wave resonance in thin ferromagnetic films . \n part i : spin waves in thin films , part ii : spin - wave resonance spectrum _ , acta  phys . \n polon .  a  * 38 * , 217 and 899 ( 1970 ) . h.  puszkarski , _ theory of surface states in spin wave resonance _ , progr .  surf . \n * 9 * , 191 ( 1979 ) . \n l.  wojtczak , _ magnetic  thin  films  ( in  polish ) _ \n , wydawnictwo uniwersytetu dzkiego , d 2009 . \n a.  urbaniak - kucharczyk , _ the coherent potential approximation in the description of spin wave resonance _ , \n status solidi b ,  * 189 * , 239 ( 1995 ) . \n diep - the - hung and j.  c.  s.  lvy , _ critical angle of external magnetic field for surface spin waves in thin ferromagnetic films _ , surface science  * 80 * , 512 ( 1979 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 213256124109, "RequestID": "d151d380060541368568b24a4b99d9ad", "TotalTokens": 3798}

on nuclear disk of gas and dust with a diameter of @xmath1 pc , and a large - scale symmetric radio structure which implies that the radio axis is close to the plane of the sky . at an assumed distance of 40 mpc \n , 1 milliarcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to 0.2 pc . \n previous vlba observations of this galaxy revealed a parsec - scale radio jet and counterjet aligned with the kpc - scale jet ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . \n the opening angle of the jets is less than @xmath2 during the first 0.2 pc and @xmath3 during the first 0.8 pc . \n at 8.4 ghz we found evidence for a narrow gap in radio brightness at the base of the parsec - scale counterjet , just east ( left ) of the brightest peak which we identified as the core based on its inverted spectrum between 1.6 and 8.4 ghz ( see the left part of figure  [ fig2 ] , from jones and wehrle 1997 ) . \n we tentatively identified this gap as the signature of free - free absorption by a nearly - edge on inner disk with a width @xmath4 pc and an average electron density of @xmath5 over the inner 0.1 pc . \n we observed ngc 4261 at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz with halca and a ground array composed of 7 vlba antennas plus shanghai , kashima , and the dsn 70-m tidbinbilla antennas at 1.6 ghz ( 22 june 1999 ) and 8 vlba antennas plus the phased vla at 4.9 ghz ( 27 june 1999 ) . during \n both epochs the vlba antennas at st . \n croix and hancock were unavailable , as was the north liberty antenna at 1.6 ghz . \n data were recorded as two 16-mhz bandwidth channels with 2-bit sampling by the mark - iii / vlba systems and correlated at the vlba processor in socorro . \n both channels were sensitive to left circular polarization . \n fringe - fitting was carried out in aips after applying _ a priori _ amplitude calibration . \n for vlba antennas we used continuously measured system temperatures , for the vla we used measured @xmath6 values with an assumed source flux density of 5 jy , and for the remaining antennas we used typical gain and system temperature values obtained from the vsop web site . \n fringes were found to all antennas at 1.6 ghz except halca , but the signal / noise ratio to shanghai and kashima was very low and these data were not used . the _ a priori _ amplitude calibration for tidbinbilla was dramatically incorrect for unknown reasons . \n we calibrated tidbinbilla by imaging the compact structure of the source using vlba data , then holding the vlba antenna gains fixed and allowing the tidbinbilla gain to vary . \n this produced a good match in correlated flux density where the projected vlba and tidbinbilla baselines overlap . at 4.9 ghz fringes \n were found to all antennas , including halca . a similar correction to the _ a priori _ amplitude calibration for halca and the phased vla was applied .    in both observations we found that averaging in frequency over both 16-mhz channels in aips produced large , baseline - dependent amplitude reductions even though the post - fringe - fit visibility phases were flat and continuous between channels . averaging over frequency within each 16-mhz band \n separately fixed this problem . \n difmap was used for detailed data editing , self - calibration , and image deconvolution . \n both 16-mhz bands were combined during imaging . \n imaging within difmap used uniform weighting with the weight of halca data increased by a factor of 500 . \n several iterations of phase - only self calibration , followed by amplitude self calibration iterations with decreasing time scales , resulted in good fits ( @xmath7 ) between the source model and the data . \n although our image at 1.6 ghz does not include data from halca , it does have more than twice the angular resolution of our previous 1.6 ghz image ( jones and wehrle 1997 ) due to the addition of tidbinbilla . \n the previous image showed a symmetric structure , with the jet and counterjet extending west and east from the core . \n no evidence for absorption is seen in this image . \n however , with higher resolution we do detect a narrow gap in emission just east of the core , at the base of the counterjet . \n the width of the gap is less than 2 mas . \n we detected fringes to halca at 4.9 ghz when the projected earth - space baselines were less than one earth diameter . \n the halca data fills in the ( u , v ) coverage hole between continental vlba baselines and those to mauna kea , and also increases the north - south resolution by a factor of two . our 4.9 ghz image is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . \n note that the gap in emission is again seen just east of the peak . \n a careful comparison of brightness along the radio axis at 4.9 and 8.4 ghz shows that the gap is both deeper and wider at 4.9 ghz , as expected from free - free absorption . \n the region of the gap has a very inverted spectrum , the brightest peak ( core ) has a slightly less inverted spectrum , and the distant parts of both the jet and counterjet have steep spectra . \n our observations at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz appear to confirm the free - free absorption explanation for the sub - parsec radio morphology in ngc 4261 . \n measurements of the optical depth in the absorbed region and the distance between the absorption and the core as a function of frequency will allow the radial distribution of electron density in the inner parsec of the disk to be determined . \n we gratefully acknowledge the vsop pro -

{"ContextTokens": 3463, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "as discussed in some other talks in this symposium , low - energy final state scattering parametres have been the target of intense analyses of @xmath0-meson production in recent years . \n mostly the investigations aim at the extraction of the complex scattering length @xmath3 , where the real part is connected to the existence or nonexistence of a bound state . \n the definition common in meson physics @xmath4 requires a negative real part and @xmath5 ( more precisely including also the effective range @xmath6 > 0 $ ] @xcite ) . \n however , unfortunately the scattering cross section data alone can not give just the sign of this quantity . \n nevertheless , the magnitude of the energy of a bound state ( or a virtual state ) can be estimated from final state interaction ( fsi ) effects , though the existence can not . \n this was the original idea of ref . \n @xcite studying the relation in @xmath7he _ provided _ a bound state would exist . \n this work was recently extended to heavier nuclei @xcite , where the existence of bound states is less controversial and experiments are being performed ( see _ e.g. _ talks by gal , machner and wilkin in these proceedings ) . \n particularly suggestive is the possibly rapid change of the scattering lengths in @xmath7he and @xmath8he discussed by machner at the first symposium of this series @xcite . \n there the latter scattering length appears significantly smaller than the large @xmath9 , which would hint to a change of the sign ( of the real part ) , since one would expect more attraction in the heavier nucleus and thus either even larger scattering length ( for the nonbinding situation ) or a binding strength with undetermined size of the cross section and scattering length . \n however , the results seem to depend strongly on whether they are obtained with or without the effective range term of the low - energy expansion . \n this is discussed in subsec . \n [ efrange ]    the aim of this talk is to review and summarize the numerical relation of the complex binding energy to the complex scattering length and effective range . at the end \n some speculative extrapolation possibility is shortly played with . \n the basic idea is to employ various nuclear charge distributions @xmath10 in simple optical potentials @xmath11 where for each nucleus the strength parameters ( @xmath12 ) are freely varied to get a sufficient coverage to present the binding energy and width as contours in the @xmath13 plane . the normalization of the profiles shown in fig . \n [ profiles ] is chosen to the mass number as @xmath14 , so that in the simple impulse approximation optical model the strength @xmath15 would correspond to the elementary scattering length @xmath16 ( @xmath17 given in fm ) . \n however , it should be stressed that no claim is made about any absolute strength of the potential as in microscopic model works . \n the main purpose is to get _ the numerical connection of binding energies and widths to the scattering parameters _ , so that if the latter can be extracted from data , then a preliminary estimate could be obtained for the former . \n possibly this would be useful for planning experiments . in the spirit of the shape independence of @xmath18 forces \n , one might expect a more density profile independent connection between these quantities than in the direct relation to the potential of either of them . \n -wave binding energy @xmath19 contours for 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 20 mev in the complex @xmath20 plane . \n the solid line shows the zero energy , _ i.e. _ above it there is no binding . below the dashed line @xmath21.,width=472 ]    if the effective range term is included , then also the energy relation should include this and the low ( complex ) energy relation would be @xmath22 with @xmath23 the reduced mass of the system . in comparison with the actual exact results from solving equations of motion this relation \n was found to be much more accurate than keeping the first term alone . for binding energies up to @xmath24 mev and even beyond the accuracy of eq . \n [ relation ] was a few percent for the real part and about ten percent for the imaginary ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 taken from the calculation ) . \n this success can be attributed to the inclusion of a non - zero effective range @xmath26 and can be considered as an indication of the necessity of its inclusion also in data analyses . \n but for the imaginary part of the bound state energies @xmath27 , _ i.e. _ half widths . \n , width=472 ] \n going to heavier nuclei from @xmath7he carbon may be a representative compromise between the experimentally studied helium and magnesium isotopes . \n [ ereal ] shows the binding energy contours for five choices up to 20 mev . \n also shown are the zero energy limit and the borderline where @xmath21 . \n the latter is of interest as a measure of actually distinguishing any peak . to facilitate the complete connection fig . \n [ eimag ] shows also the contours of constant half - widths ( @xmath27 ) . \n the behaviour for a real potential is quite clear and understandable , but some peculiar features appear for strongly absorptive interactions . \n absorption , described by the imaginary part , acts in the bound system like a repulsion eating away the wave function in the attractive region : less wave function @xmath29 less attraction . \n so for increasing absorption the strength of also the attractive real part must be increased to stay on the equal - energy contours . \n however , as shown in ref . \n @xcite the effect of the imaginary part of the potential saturates in the scattering length and @xmath30 is not even monotonously increasing . \n therefore , the calculated points for the equidistant mesh of the potential strength become denser and denser with increasing absorption ( and stronger real part to remain at the same binding energy ) and eventually the contours turn back to left . \n however , in this region the states are so wide , anyway , that they may not be of experimental interest . furthermore , it may be worth noting that in the proximity of zero binding the widths tend to be large , significantly larger than the binding energy for the same @xmath31 without imaginary part at all . \n therefore , near threshold bound states may be hard to distinguish .    to get a more detailed picture of that behaviour and the general trend of increasing binding energies fig . \n [ mini ] shows a magnified detail of fig . \n [ ereal ] . \n it can be seen that the `` weak potential branch '' comes lower and lower in the @xmath30 direction and the opening angle between the `` branches '' decreases until they cross over at about 9 mev binding . \n so the 10 mev contour below the formal strong potential zero line belongs actually to the weaker couplings and 20 mev has gone even further . \n the behaviour seen in figs . \n [ ereal ] and [ eimag ] is very similar to that of @xmath7he @xcite and also @xmath8he and @xmath32 mg @xcite especially for large @xmath33 and `` weak potential branch '' dictated mainly by just the binding energy term in eq . \n [ relation ] . \n the next section discusses the potential dependence through the effective range , which in turn depends naturally on the size of the nucleus . \n , width=472 ]      from relation [ relation ] it is clear that at least with `` realish '' ( dominantly real ) quantities for a negative @xmath25 ( consequently also negative @xmath3 ) and a positive effective range the two terms on the left hand side tend to cancel making @xmath34 smaller and @xmath3 bigger . due to \n this cancellation @xmath3 is quite sensitive on the inclusion of the second term . \n this expectation is actually seen in drastic changes of the data analyses from refs . \n @xcite giving the scattering lengths shown in table [ scattlen ] . clearly leaving the effective range out \n may give scattering lengths even less than one half of their true values and consequently grossly overestimated binding energies . \n this is confirmed in the calculations and by eq . \n [ relation ] .    consequently \n , it is clear that consistency in estimating the possible binding energy from the more advanced scattering analyses needs also the effective range term . \n if one takes for example the scattering lengths for @xmath35he above , leaving that away and making the standard estimate for possible binding energy , the first one ( without @xmath26 ) would give about 4 mev and the second ( with @xmath26 ) 1 mev . \n however , from fig . [ ereal ] the results for \n these two @xmath3 s would be 10 mev and 2 mev , correspondingly , the second being preferable . \n ( the result for @xmath8he , fig . 8 of ref . \n @xcite , is very nearly the same as @xmath2c for such weak binding due to shape independence . \n practically only the region of the `` turning point '' tends to move left towards larger @xmath36 with increasing @xmath37 and right for decreasing . )    because of the apparent importance of the effective range ref . \n @xcite gives a parametrization of the complex @xmath26 in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering length . \n [ scattlen ]    .scattering lengths in fm from data with and without the effective range term . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      although the aim of this talk is not to promote a definite potential model , it may still be tempting to speculate by interpreting the strength parametres @xmath31 and @xmath38 in eq . \n ( [ optical ] ) to be the real and imaginary parts of the basic @xmath39 scattering length @xmath16 in a first order optical potential as done in _ \n e.g. _ ref . \n ( or they might represent some more general strengths perhaps extracted from microscopic nuclear models . ) then the strength @xmath40 fm , @xmath41 fm would support a barely bound state in @xmath8he , which would mean that all standard values of re @xmath16 ranging roughly between 0.4 fm and 0.7 fm could have the potential for binding in this nucleus . for this basic strength \n the binding energy in @xmath2c would be 8 mev and in @xmath32 mg 14 mev . to produce a barely bound state in the three nuclei considered above the fitted strength @xmath42 fm \n would be needed as shown by the squares and the dashed curve in fig . \n [ adep ] ( also @xmath7he is shown ) .    . \n , width=472 ]    however , @xmath16 is complex and as another example , assuming more realistically @xmath43 ( roughly true for most @xmath16 in the literature ) , @xmath44 fm would just bind the @xmath45he system and the corresponding binding energies would be 15 mev and 22 mev for @xmath2c and @xmath32 mg , respectively \n . their half - widths would be about the same as their binding energies ; in the case of @xmath8he the half - width would be 12 mev . in this case \n the barely binding strength could be parametrized as @xmath46 fm ( the circular dots and the solid curve ) . \n it may be of further interest to remind that the depth of a square well potential producing a zero binding energy should behave like @xmath47 . \n in this work a phenomenological connection between the low energy scattering length and the complex binding energy of possible eta - nuclear bound states has been studied in a simple but probably realistic model . \n the hope is that the results could be useful in searches of these bound states , if more easily accessible final state data are available to make predictions where to look for the states . \n the binding energies are explicitly presented as contours in the complex @xmath3 plane for the @xmath2c ( also for @xmath8he and @xmath32 mg in ref . \n it is seen that the connection is very closely the same and systematic for relatively different density profiles , from which it is easy to interpolate and even extrapolate to other nuclei . \n the calculations suggest that for even relatively moderate values of the absorptive potential and of the imaginary parts of the scattering lengths , the states can be wide especially compared with the real depths of the states . in view of also many other theoretical results , starting from the elementary @xmath39 scattering and predicting negative real parts for the scattering length but with rather large imaginary parts , \n the observation of such bound states might be difficult or even impossible . \n however , in the minireview @xcite of the situation a reanalysis of the existing data on @xmath48he final states made very small values of the imaginary part appear plausible , so that also the possible bound states may not necessarily be as wide as most theoretical works would indicate .    in our work for @xmath30 less than 2 fm with @xmath49 larger than , \n say , 5 fm a bound state should be recognizable . in the case of more likely smaller scattering lengths @xmath50 \n fm would be necessary . \n for the assessment of possible distinguishable bound states fig . \n [ ereal ] indicates the region where the half width is less than the binding energy . experimentally in this respect the result @xmath51 fm and @xmath52 fm for @xmath8he of ref . \n @xcite is quite interesting and suggestive . if @xmath53 is really larger than for @xmath54he scattering , it is difficult to see how this could be true for a more attractive but still unbinding system . \n the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath25 is very robust against potential differences even between different nuclides over a wide range once also the non - zero effective range is taken into account . \n therefore , due to this shape independence one may trust the results to be valid by interpolation also for the @xmath55 nuclei of recent experimental interest @xcite . \n + i thank pawel moskal for the invitation and kind hospitality at the symposium and hip for a travel grant . \n 99 a. sibirtsev , j. haidenbauer , j. a. niskanen , u. meissner , _ phys . \n c _ * 70 * , 047001 ( 2004 ) . \n j. a. niskanen , h. machner , _ nucl . \n phys . a _ * 902 * , 40 ( 2013 ) . \n h. machner , _ acta phys . \n polonica b _ * 41 * , 2221 ( 2010 ) . \n j.  smyrski , _ \n _ , _ phys . \n * b 649 * ( 2007 ) 258 .", "StartTimeOffset": 239197902184, "RequestID": "16965f17333d49f2a5194b27472f409a", "TotalTokens": 3601}

{"ContextTokens": 3704, "GeneratedTokens": 251, "SynthesizedBody": "ecc is an approach to public - key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields . \n the use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by neal koblitz@xcite and victor s. miller@xcite in 1985 . \n elliptic curve cryptography , in essence , entails using the group of points on an elliptic curve as the underlying number system for public key cryptography . \n the primary reason for using elliptic curves as a basis for public key crypto - systems is that elliptic curve based crypto - systems appear to provide better security than traditional crypto - systems for a given key size@xcite , thereby reducing the process overhead . \n one can take advantage of this fact to increase security , or ( more often ) to increase performance by reducing the key size while keeping the same security . \n designers are now working on designing dedicated hardware accelerator blocks along with the main processor @xcite@xcite@xcite to increase the throughput of the design . \n ecc algorithm is used for secured communication in smart cards@xcite and also in gsm security@xcite . \n so , high speed , resource constrained environment is required . using a dual - core instead of a dedicated co \n - processor enables the user to operate from the application layer without entering the subordinate layers . also , the thread - level parallelism , used by the dual - core ensures higher throughput without increasing the much power , which is an important issue for low - power communication devices like smart cards . \n implementations can be made in different platforms namely , fpga or asic or can be done using micro - controllers . \n fpgas provides reconfigurability and lesser design time , while asic provides better throughput though the design time is large and expensive . \n we propose the design and implementation of elliptic curve cryptography ( ecc ) encryption algorithm by developing suitable single core and dual core design on xilinx virtex 4 ( ml403 ) device . \n the system is optimized in terms of execution speed . \n we perform a trade - off between throughput , power and resource requirements for our dual core implementation . to the best of our knowledge , \n dual - soft core processor based implementation of ecc in an fpga is not yet available in related literatures and hence it is first of its kind . \n the paper is organized as follows : section 2 details the overview of ecc , the encryption and decryption process . \n the design and implementation details for single and dual - core processor architectures are described in section 3 . \n the experimental results are summarized in section 4 . \n conclusion and references are briefed in section 5 . \n this section provides some background on elliptic curves and ecc and then the hardness of decrypting the elliptic curve ciphers is also discussed . \n the idea of a multi processor system , establishment of communication between the processors using shared memory and the needed data synchronization is also briefed in the later part of this section . \n elliptic curves are described by curves , which are similar to cubic equations , used for calculating the circumference of an ellipse . in general , cubic equations for elliptic curves \n take the following form known as weierstrass equation@xcite : @xmath0 where _ a _ , _ b_,_c _ , _ d _ , _ e _ \n , _ p _ are real numbers and _ x _ and _ y _ take on any values in the real numbers . for our purpose , it is sufficient to limit ourselves to equation of the form given in equation[eqn : reduced weierstrass equation ] for appropriate curve parameters of ecc . \n @xmath1 figure [ fig : elliptic curve(a ) ] shows an example of elliptic curve . \n ecc can be used to encrypt a plain text message _ \n m _ into cipher text for secured communication . \n firstly , the plain text message _ \n m _ is converted into a set of finite points p@xmath2(_x _ , _ y _ ) , which lie in the elliptic curve e@xmath3(_a _ , _ b _ ) . \n a generator point , _ g _ \n e@xmath3(_a _ , _ b _ ) , is chosen next such that the smallest value of _ n _ for which _ ng _ = _ o _ is a very large prime number . \n the elliptic curve e@xmath3(_a _ , _ b _ ) and the generator point _ \n g _ are then made public . \n let there be two parties a and b who wish to communicate using ecc . \n each user selects a private key , user a s private key is n@xmath5 , while n@xmath6 is the private key for user b such that n@xmath5 , n@xmath6 < _ _ \n n__. then they compute their public keys . \n the public key of a is p@xmath5 = n@xmath5_g _ , while for b the public key is p@xmath6 = n@xmath6_g_. to send the secret message to b , a encrypts the message point p@xmath2 by choosing a random number _ \n k _ and computes the cipher text points c@xmath2 using b s public key . the cipher text is given by : @xmath7   \\label{ciphertext}\\ ] ] on receiving the cipher text ( pair of points ) _ c@xmath2 _ , b multiplies the first pair of points ( _ kg _ ) with his private key _ \n n@xmath6 _ , and then adds the result to the second point of the cipher text ( _ p@xmath2 + kp@xmath6 _ ) \n i.e. , @xmath8 = \\;\\;(p_{m } + kn_{b}g ) - [ n_{b}(kg ) ] = \\;\\;p_{m } \\label{palintext}\\ ] ] plain text message point p@xmath2 , corresponds to the message _ m_. \n it is to be observed here that only b can remove n@xmath6(_kg _ ) from the second part of the cipher text . \n no , third party or intruder can know the message except b. thus , ecc is very secured and can be relied for confidential communication . \n + breaking of ecc is a `` hard problem '' , which requires computing of discreet logarithm @xcite . \n a multi processor system consists of two or more processors working concurrently and capable of communicating with each other . \n such a design tends to double the throughput , with two processors running independently , but with an extra cost of resource and power . on the other hand , \n a multi core system is one in which more than one processor is build on the same die . \n in fpga we have on - chip soft processor cores , which has been utilized in our design to multi core design . \n there are some basic conditions required for the execution of a design in a multi core system . \n the primary being concurrency in the design i.e. , no data dependency must be present in processes that run in different processors and also the two processors must have some handshaking for synchronization of data . \n multi core processors often use a shared memory system or a mailbox system as a interprocessor communication mechanism , that operates very quickly@xcite .      in a multi core environment , mailbox and shared memory @xcite are the two mechanisms , provided by xilinx . \n out of these two mechanisms , shared memory is the most common and most intuitive way of passing information between processing subsystems and we have used it in our design .    a shared memory system has the following properties@xcite : + any processor can refer any location in the shared memory directly by some system call . \n + location of data in memory is transparent to the programmer . \n data could be distributed across multiple processors , with the help of some proper api , data can be handled at program level . \n + a synchronization is a must for accessing the shared memory segment by some hardware / software protocol between the two processors . \n + shared memory is typically the fastest asynchronous mode of communication , especially when the information to be shared is large . \n shared memory gives another approach of `` in - place '' message processing schemes . \n shared memory can be built out of on - chip local memory like bram or on external memory like ddr sdram . \n the region in which the shared data is stored is known as a critical region in operating system terminology . unless there is some sort of well - defined non - conflicting way in which each processor accesses the shared data , the multi core system can not work properly . a synchronization protocol or construct \n is usually required to serialize accesses to the shared resource . \n the xps mutex synchronization primitive is used in this work , which is provided by xilinx as a separate ip - core@xcite . when using shared memory as a method of data communication , the pseudo code should look like this to ensure proper synchronization , + _ / \n * shared tasks * / _ + _ xmutex_lock ( ) ; _ + _ / * critical region - perform shared memory access * / _ + _ xmutex_unlock ( ) ; _ + by calling the _ xmutex_lock ( ) _ it must be ensured that one processor is accessing the critical region and other processor should not be allowed to access the same until _ xmutex_lock ( ) _ is called by that processor . \n this section highlights the key components of our proposed design . at first \n , we describe the processor that is used and then we brief the design innovations made to enhance the throughput . \n the microblaze embedded processor soft core is a 32-bit reduced instruction set computer ( risc ) optimized for implementation in fpgas@xcite . as a soft - core processor , microblaze \n is implemented entirely in the general - purpose memory and logic fabric of xilinx fpgas . the embedded development kit ( edk ) \n platform from xilinx has been used to build a complete processor system on fpga .      in a single processor architecture , \n the fpga receives the input via the rs-232 port through uart and then the input plaintext message is encrypted using ecc algorithm , which is running in the microblaze processor of the the fpga . after encryption , \n the cipher text is send back to the host pc and is seen in the hyper terminal using serial communication between the board and the pc . \n figure [ single ] shows the flow of steps in the design . \n processor working at 100mhz clock frequency is used to encrypt 8-bits of message using ecc . \n scalar multiplication constitutes the main operation in ecc . \n it is seen that the processor takes 19.01 msec to perform the total encryption . the resource utilized i.e. , the number of luts and slices required by the design as well as the power requirements are summarized in the table [ table : resource and power calculation ] .          after evaluating the performance of ecc in single processor architecture by using microblaze soft - core processor , \n another approach is taken to implement it in dual processor architecture by considering the fact discussed in section  [ mps ] for higher throughput and efficiency . \n xilinx virtex4 ml403 is taken as a platform for design . \n shared memory is used for creating a handshaking between the two processors as described in section  [ shared ] and the synchronization for communication is achieved using the process described in section  [ sync ] . \n [ dual ] shows the architecture of dual microblaze design ,        in addition , multiple port memory controller ( ddr_sdram ) and inter - processor communication - xps mutex hardware ip @xcite is also incorporated in the test bed to facilitate the memory sharing and inter processor synchronization and communication .    in the experiment , \n the two processors are equally engaged to execute ecc in parallel fashion and in between the consequent steps , the two processors communicate with each other via shared memory with proper synchronization . \n the message to be encrypted is transferred to the fpga from a computer using rs232 serial port communication . \n the two multiplications are executed concurrently in two processors and the resulting data is assembled in the shared memory . \n the addition operation is then performed by the 1st processor and the resultant cipher text is generated . \n the resultant cipher text is send back to the pc using the rs232 interface and is viewed at the hyper terminal of the computer . \n [ dual - mb ] shows the mechanism in which the two processors communicate using the shared memory and using mutex locking and unlocking . \n it is seen that the encryption engine speeds up by 3.3 times as the proposed architecture takes only 5.72 msec to perform the encryption.the resource estimation , power required and throughput measurements for both the designs are shown in table [ table : throughput calculation ] and table [ table : resource and power calculation ] below . the design improves the throughput of execution , but utilizes more resources due to the dual cores . \n it is to be noted here that the throughput of the design can be improved further by enabling the cache memory . but due to the resource constraints of our implementation board the cache memory of the two processors \n could not be enabled . \n .for an encryption process [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : resource and power calculation ] \n this work is an exploration of ecc implementation for fpga based embedded systems . \n two specific designs have been addressed , the first one is simpler involving a single microblaze core whereas the other one utilizes two microblaze cores and thus enables multi - threading . \n the dual core based implementation gives almost a 3 times increase in the throughput but utilizes almost twice the resource and 30% more power as compared to the single core based implementation . \n this clearly shows a trade off between speed , resource utilization and power requirement . in future \n we look forward to do a further exploration of ecc implementation for embedded applications involving fpga based hard processor cores and asic based design .    00 , `` elliptic curve cryptosystems , '' _ mathematics of computation 48 _ , ( 177 ) : 203209 . \n jstor 2007884 . \n , `` use of elliptic curves in cryptography , '' _ crypto 85 _ : 417426 @xmath9 . \n , `` cryptography and network security : principles and practice ( 6th edition ) , '' , isbn : 0133354695 . \n , `` hardware architectures for public key cryptography , '' _ integration , the vlsi journal _ , 34(1 -

loops . \n only this property makes the gradient networks very common in seemingly unrelated problems , i.e. , synchronization in oscillatory networks @xcite . \n the relationship between network topology and congestion has also been investigated @xcite by introducing a measure of congestion , the jamming coefficient . \n this measure involves the ratio of the number of nodes that receive at least one gradient link , @xmath4 and the number of nodes that send a link . by definition \n , every node sends one out link , therefore the number of senders in the network , @xmath5 . \n the jamming coefficient is    @xmath6    the operations @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the statistical averaging over local potentials and networks respectively . \n maximal congestion occurs at @xmath9 , and no congestion occurs when every link receives a gradient link , corresponding to @xmath10 . \n it was also found that @xmath11 is independent of number of nodes @xmath0 for scale free substrate network , and these networks are not prone to maximal jamming . \n the jamming coefficient was extensively studied by park et al . \n @xcite where they compared it for er and sf networks with the same average degree , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 . with randomly assigned potentials on each node , below @xmath14 \n , they found that er networks are less congested than sf networks .    here \n we introduce a monte carlo optimization scheme that reduces jamming significantly and introduces structural correlations into the system that are not built in . \n the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : opt ] we introduce the algorithm for optimizing jamming coefficient that is initially calculated from randomly assigned scalar values at each node . \n we compare the optimized jamming values of a scale - free network and an erds - rnyi network for various values of average degrees . in section  [ sec : structure ] \n we investigate the structure of the optimal gradient network . \n in particular we study the degree distribution and the correlations between the degree and the potential of each node . finally in section  [ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications and the possible extensions of optimal gradient networks . \n previous work  @xcite has focused on random gradient networks where the potential on each node has a randomly assigned value . \n more generally , the potentials can be a dynamic quantity evolving in time due to perturbations , sources and sinks internal and external to the system of interest . \n alternatively , the potentials can evolve to become correlated to the network properties such as its degree distribution . \n for example , consider the networks of routers where every router has a capacity . \n if a router is central and highly connected , it usually has a higher capacity in order to handle the traffic en - route effectively . \n recently , a congestion aware routing algorithm has been introduced where the transport on the network of routers is driven by congestion - gradients @xcite .    here \n we develop a monte carlo algorithm to achieve two goals : reduce jamming in the network , and observe the emerging optimal correlation between in - degree and potential of each node . for a given network and potential distribution , we redefine j in eq . \n [ eq : jam ] as @xmath15 where @xmath16 by definition . \n the initial potential distribution is chosen from a gaussian distribution , and at each iteration the potential of a random node is modified such that global congestion is reduced . \n we use a metropolis algorithm @xcite with the following steps :    1 .   pick a node , @xmath2 at random . \n 2 .   vary @xmath1 by @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath17 is a gaussian random variable with variance @xmath19 . \n 3 .   recalculate @xmath11 with @xmath20 . \n 4 .   accept @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 . \n go to step 1 , and repeat . \n the fictitious temperature , @xmath23 is chosen to adjust the acceptance ratio to about 40% . \n we perform the optimization procedure until @xmath24 equilibrates , i.e. , at large @xmath25 the time autocorrelation function of @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath26 } { [ \\langle j^2 \\rangle - \\langle j \\rangle^2]},\\ ] ] goes to zero .    using the described optimization algorithm \n , we can significantly reduce the jamming coefficient in both sf and er networks . following previous work @xcite we choose as the sf network a barabsi - albert model  @xcite . for this network \n the average connectivity is @xmath27 where each node has at minimum @xmath28 links . \n the network size throughout the paper is chosen to be @xmath29 . \n for the er networks , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability of having a link between any pair of nodes . \n we use the same @xmath12 when comparing the two types of network by adjusting @xmath28 and @xmath31 . \n the evolution of jamming coefficient during optimization is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] as a function of algorithmic time in units of monte carlo steps ( mcs ) for @xmath32 . at @xmath33 \n ( see also inset of fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] ) , the sf network has a higher jamming coefficient , but after roughly 50000 mcs , the sf network becomes less congested compared to the er network . \n the initial and final jamming coefficients for the two networks are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively . \n , as a function of time in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) for sf ( @xmath38 ) and er ( @xmath39 ) networks with the same average degree , @xmath40 and @xmath29 . \n as shown in the inset , sf network with random potential distribution has a higher jamming coefficient at @xmath33 compared to the er network . \n after optimization is completed , however , optimal sf network has a lower jamming coefficient.,width=321 ]    we define @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the difference in jamming between sf and er networks for random and optimal networks respectively . for a given network with @xmath12 , @xmath41 \n is calculated initially at @xmath33 and @xmath42 at @xmath43 after optimization is completed , for @xmath44 . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] , @xmath45 for @xmath46 whereas @xmath47 indicating that sf networks have a lower jamming coefficient after optimization , a result significantly different than those for random gradient networks @xcite .     for various @xmath48 for random ( @xmath39 ) and optimal ( @xmath38 ) gradient networks . \n @xmath49 for all simulated @xmath50 indicating that optimal sf networks have a lower jamming coefficient than optimal er networks.[fig : fig2],width=321 ] \n as shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] congestion can be reduced in gradient networks by varying the potentials at each node . \n it is reasonable to expect that the obtained optimal potentials may also alter the structure of the gradient network . \n next , we analyze the structural properties of optimal gradient networks such as the degree distribution . previously , the random gradient network of an er substrate network was shown numerically and analytically @xcite to have an in - degree distribution of @xmath51 . \n however , the sf substrate network with degree distribution @xmath52 , was shown to have a gradient degree distribution of @xmath53 . \n the degree distribution of the random and optimal er and sf networks are shown for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) respectively in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] along with the expected scaling exponents for the random gradient networks of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n the statistical averaging is obtained over 100 networks . for er networks \n , the scaling region extends with higher average connectivity , however we chose to use a small @xmath55 for which optimization is more efficient . \n the optimization is performed for 1 million monte carlo steps . \n the jamming values initially are 0.62 , 0.71 and after optimization reduce to 0.36 , 0.60 for sf and er respectively . \n the in - degree distribution , @xmath60 , for the sf network varies significantly with the optimization . \n the cut - off degree is reduced an order of magnitude ( from roughly 100 to 10 ) compared to the random one , and the scaling is now steeper . on the other hand , the er network does not show a major change in the degree distribution .    , for gradient networks of ( a ) sf and ( b ) er networks with @xmath56 and @xmath54 respectively before ( @xmath39 ) and after ( @xmath38 ) optimization of jamming . \n the dashed lined indicates the scaling of @xmath61 from ref . \n @xcite , where @xmath62 and @xmath58 for random sf and er networks respectively . \n the scaling exponent @xmath63 is not a good fit for optimal sf data but a good fit for optimal er network . \n [ fig : fig3],width=321 ]    next , we analyze the probability distribution of potentials for nodes in the substrate networks with degree @xmath64 , before and after the optimization to observe any degree - potential correlations . the results are shown in fig .  [ \n fig : fig4 ] for the sf network ( @xmath56 ) . to reduce noise in the data especially for large values of @xmath64 , \n the degrees are binned into four groups : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . before optimization with initial random gaussian potentials within range [ -4 , 4 ] \n , each set has the same probability distribution @xmath69 as shown in the inset of fig  [ fig : fig4 ] . \n this behavior is expected as no correlation was built in between the degree of a node and its potential . after the optimization \n however , the range of the potentials has broadened significantly , and the nodes with high degree have accumulated very large potentials .     for sf network with @xmath70 before ( inset ) and after optimization . \n the degrees are binned to indicate the correlation between degree of a node and its potential : @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath39 ) . before the optimization @xmath69 \n do not show any correlations with @xmath64 , however after the optimization , nodes with high degree , get the large values of potential which facilitates reduced jamming . \n [ fig : fig4],width=321 ]    with the improved jamming coefficient , it is natural to expect some correlation to emerge between the potential of the node and its degree \n . if the node has a large degree and a small potential , this node will be preferred by most of its neighbors for sending an out link , and thus this will contribute to higher jamming . \n however if the potential is large , the neighboring nodes will not prefer this highly connected node and thus not increase the jamming . \n this intuitive observation implies the possibility of obtaining a reduced congestion by starting with potentials that are inversely correlated with the degree of each node on the substrate network . \n we tested this case for the sf network ( @xmath56 ) with a correlated potential distribution , @xmath75 at node @xmath2 with degree @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a random number chosen from a uniform distribution . \n this assignment with correlations built - in did not make the jamming coefficient lower . on the contrary it was higher , @xmath78 , than the value without degree correlation , @xmath79 . \n an interesting observation that fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] provides is that nodes with small degree carry potentials distributed over a large range @xmath80 $ ] . \n for example , nodes with degrees , @xmath81 have a roughly gaussian potential distribution . \n for higher @xmath64 , the distribution narrows down and shifts toward larger values . for nodes with @xmath82 , \n all nodes have large potentials , within range @xmath83 $ ] . \n this observation might explain why in the test case the jamming was actually higher when the degree was correlated with the potential . \n in that case , we only assigned low potentials to low degree nodes which still yields congestion much higher than the optimal one . an analytical formulation that distributes the potentials according to its degree mimicking the transitive behavior in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] seems possible , but is beyond the scope of this paper . \n we have introduced a monte carlo method to optimize congestion in random gradient networks . previously the potentials have been assigned randomly and was shown that er networks had lower jamming coefficient below @xmath55 than sf networks with the same connectivity @xcite . \n this was puzzling as the connectivity commonly observed in natural and man - made networks  @xcite is usually in this range , but tends to be scale - free , and in scale - free networks jamming is independent of @xmath0 . with the monte carlo based optimization scheme we optimized jamming by varying the potentials so that optimal congestion was achieved . \n we found that optimal sf networks have lower congestion factor for @xmath46 . \n this reduced congestion is the result of a complex correlation between the degree and the potential of a node . \n we found that nodes with large degrees in the substrate network get large positive values whereas nodes with small degrees get a gaussian like distribution of potentials .    throughout the paper \n we have used the definition of jamming introduced in ref . \n @xcite for a substrate network with unweighted links . \n a natural extension of this work for generality is to assign weights to links and redefine the jamming coefficient accordingly . \n a possible definition is @xmath84 \\big ) / \\sum_i c_i$ ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the number of neighboring links node @xmath2 has , @xmath87 is the capacity of node @xmath2 , @xmath88 is the weight of the incoming link from j to i , and the operation @xmath89 = 0 $ ] if @xmath90 . \n if the weights and capacity of all nodes are 1 , then this definition of @xmath11 reduces to the one in eq . \n [ eq : jam ] without the averaging . with this definition and the optimization method introduced in the paper , it is possible to study real world networks and get insights to the dominant structures of transport for these systems . \n the author thanks adilson e. motter for useful discussions and suggestions , gregory johnson and frank alexander for the careful reading of the manuscript . \n this work was carried out under the auspices of the national nuclear security administration of the u.s . \n department of energy at los alamos national laboratory under contract no.de-ac52-06na25396 and supported by the doe office of science ascr program in applied mathematics research .", "StartTimeOffset": 271091819439, "RequestID": "0b9261cf6c6e4f73995cf41a29ca35c1", "TotalTokens": 4161}

resolution adaptive optics ( ao ) @xmath6 and @xmath7-band observations of the arches cluster center obtained during the gemini north science verification ( sv ) with the university of hawaii ao system hokupaa ( graves et al . 2000 ) . \n these data are compared to hst / nicmos observations of the same field obtained by figer et al . \n ( 1999 ) . in uncrowded regions , the spatial resolution and limiting magnitudes in both datasets are comparable given a 3 to 4 times longer integration time in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , for the gemini observations . \n in crowded regions , the ao data are limited by uncompensated seeing haloes from bright stars caused by the low strehl ratio of only a few percent in the gemini sv data . \n these haloes locally decrease the detection efficiency of faint sources . \n evidence for this is seen at the faint end of the colour - magnitude diagrams and in the mf of the dense cluster center . \n the @xmath8 colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are shown in fig . \n 1 . the dominant feature in the cmds is the arches main sequence ( ms ) . due to the low strehl ratio in the gemini data \n , the upper part of the ms , corresponding to the bright population in the cluster center , appears less confined than in the nicmos cmd . \n the fainter stars , not detected in the cluster center due to crowding , show a large scatter towards redder colours , which is caused by a strong colour gradient observed over the arches field . \n the colour trend is apparent in both datasets , with increasingly red stellar colours observed at increasing radii ( fig . \n 2 ) . the change in @xmath9 corresponds to an increase in visual extinction of @xmath10 mag ( @xmath11 , rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) ) . \n the well confined main sequence at the bright end of the cmd shows that the innermost cluster center ( @xmath12 , 0.2 pc at 8 kpc distance ) is unaffected by this colour trend . \n this suggests that the remaining dust and gas has been expelled from the cluster center by winds and/or photoevaporation from the massive stars . \n after correction for the extinction variation , a 2 myr isochrone from the geneva basic set of stellar evolution models ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) has been used to transform @xmath13-band magnitudes into stellar masses . \n the resulting mf ( fig . \n 3 ) displays a slope of @xmath0 in the mass range @xmath14 in the gemini as well as the hst dataset . \n this slope is flatter than the salpeter slope of @xmath15 , often assumed to be universal in young star forming regions . \n when neglecting the colour trend , we derive a mf slope as flat as @xmath16 . \n this clearly shows that the changes in extinction in sf regions are not negligible when deriving mass functions . \n the flat mf observed in arches indicates an overdensity of high - mass stars as compared to other sf regions , thereby supporting models predicting enhanced high - mass sf in dense regions . \n we have analysed the stellar population at different radii from the cluster center to derive the radial variation in the mf ( fig . \n 4 ) . the mf slope appears very flat in the cluster center , where stellar and gas densities are highest , and increases with increasing radius . while mainly massive stars are found in the central part of arches , an increasing number of faint , low - mass stars is found in the cluster outskirts , indicating mass segregation . to exclude that the derived variation is due to crowding \n , incompleteness simulations have been performed in each radial bin , shown as dotted lines in figs . 3 and 4 . \n although incompleteness begins to affect the mf earlier in the cluster center ( @xmath17 ) , the corrected mf remains very flat for @xmath18 . from the distribution of stellar masses \n , we can obtain a rough estimate of the relaxation timescale , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass within the half - mass radius @xmath21 , @xmath22 the characteristic mass , and n the number of stars ( binney & tremain 1987 ) . \n we obtain @xmath23 and observe @xmath24 as a lower limit to the total mass . \n the median mass within @xmath21 is measured to be @xmath25 . assuming a total mass of at least @xmath26 leads to @xmath27 . a characteristic mass of @xmath28 , more typical for sf regions , yields @xmath29 . \n with @xmath30 being on the same order of magnitude as the age of arches , it is impossible to discrimate between primordial and dynamical mass segregation . \n the radial variation in the mf of the arches cluster as well as the flat integrated mass function support massive cluster and star formation models , suggesting high - mass stars to form in dense cluster environments . \n although the radial variation in the mf strongly suggests mass segregation in arches to be present , the short dynamical timescales , strongly influenced by the gc tidal field , prohibit discrimination between primordial and dynamical segregation effects . \n the close similarity of the mass functions obtained from the gemini ao and the hst datasets reveal that high - resolution ground - based ao data are capable to produce comparable physical results as space - based observations - in particular in dense regions where spatial resolution is essential .", "StartTimeOffset": 285502777856, "RequestID": "a4be2d336f3842e09377fba410e17b6e", "TotalTokens": 1715}

{"ContextTokens": 3514, "GeneratedTokens": 155, "SynthesizedBody": "the creation of stellar groupings by spectral characteristics is an often necessary first step in being able to explore underlying physical processes . \n the descriminating , or classification , criteria are often chosen arbitrarily from available observational data and without regard for the physical mechanisms which create them . thus , a single physical process may be responsible for the variation of spectral characteristics over a great range of temperature or luminosity . \n in some sense , the warm chemically peculiar stars may be overclassified . \n various subclasses exist which are loosely arranged by temperature or enhanced element , but they are now beginning to loose their identity and purpose as additional elements and spectral regions are explored . \n we describe here the analysis procedure and early results of a project that has been undertaken to ascertain the extent of common spectral properties amongst warm chemically peculiar star groups . \n our motivation is to test the theoretical hypothesis that diffusive element separation in the stellar atmosphere acts throughout the hgmn and am star temperature range to create the abundance and isotopic anomalies observed ( michaud 1991 ) . \n the concept that the am and hgmn stars may be a related sequence can be traced back to smith ( 1974 ) and perhaps even earlier , and has since been reiterated by others . \n however , an insufficient amount of evidence has been produced to either prove or disprove this assertion . \n the well accepted , but perhaps arbitrary , boundary at spectral type b9.5/a0 separates the hgmn stars from the realm of the cooler , metallic - lined a ( am ) stars . \n the classical am stars are usually limited to spectral types later than a3 . \n more recently the term _ hot - am _ star has found its way into the literature , representing those stars within the a0 - a3 subclasses whose spectra display a certain degree of am star spectral characteristics , most notably an apparent deficiency of calcium and/or enhancements of iron - group element lines . \n we are particularly interested in exploring the a0 - a2 stars for signs of an extension of the hgmn phenomenon to cooler temperatures as well as the b8 - a0 stars as an extension of the am star phenomenon to hotter temperatures . \n if we are to recognize objects exhibiting both the hgmn and am star phenomena we must first consider the defining qualities of each of these classes . \n let us start by ignoring their classic definitions , as these were set up in an era that predates satellite ultraviolet observations , and is solely based upon the blue optical region . \n however , the first and second ions dominate the spectrum for late - b through mid - a type stars , with most of their strongest transitions occurring at ultraviolet wavelengths . \n therefore , our thinking regarding the classification of peculiarity , and its implication for the responsible physical processes , must be expanded to include the clues found at ultraviolet wavelengths . \n for the cooler hgmn stars the defining characteristics must include the great line strength enhancements of the very heavy elements ( vhe ) pt , au , and hg . \n abundance anomalies for other elements , such as p , ga , mn , tl , and bi , have either been identified for a subgroup of stars or have yet to be thoroughly investigated . from a variety of studies \n it can be stated that the iron - group element abundances can be enhanced by up to 1 dex , which is also typical of the iron - group elements among the am stars . \n the identification of rare - earth element ( ree ) lines in hgmn stars has , up to now , received little attention . \n guthrie ( 1985 ) noted the likely occurrence of lines from nd ii , nd iii , and pr iii in the spectrum of hr 7775 , but `` no other rare earths were found in hr 7775 , and no rare earth lines were detected in any of the other hg - mn stars '' .    for the am stars the relative weakness of calcium and scandium lines compared to those of iron , along with the presence of the ree are notable characteristics . \n abundance enhancements for the heaviest elements ( pt , au , hg ) have not been identified in am stars at optical wavelengths , which has lead to the general belief that these elements are not enhanced above solar - system levels .    from these simplistic characterizations \n we have chosen to search for the presence of ree lines in hgmn stars and vhe lines in am stars as indicators of a common , albeit continuously varying , physical process that connects these two stellar groups . \n other common spectral properties are already known , i.e. the abundance levels for light elements ( he , c , n , o ) and iron - group elements , for example . \n the literature provides few explicit examples of stars that display spectrum features common to both groups . \n optical region spectral observations of hgmn , hot - am , and am stars were made at the 2.6-m nordic optical telescope during 1996 november . \n the sofin echelle spectrograph was operated at a resolving power of r = @xmath0@xmath1/@xmath1 = 80000 , with a single grating setting at blue wavelengths including the lines ptii 4046 , 4061 , 4288 , auii 4052 , hgi 4358 , and hgii 3984  . \n each spectral observation consists of partial data from 14 contiguous orders . \n typical signal - to - noise levels in the primary orders of interest were in excess of 100:1 and in some cases as large as 200:1 . \n details of the observations and data reduction will be presented in a later publication . \n we have supplemented the optical data with ultraviolet iue satellite high - dispersion spectra when available . \n the detection and analysis of platinum and mercury lines in am stars depends critically upon the use of synthetic spectra due to the crowded nature of the line spectrum in the blue spectral region . \n the hgii @xmath13984 line is further complicated by being blended with the lines fei @xmath13983.7 and cri @xmath13983.8  . \n the presence of an absorption feature at 3984   can be traced from the hgmn stars through the am stars , but the relative contributions of the mercury , iron , and chromium lines varies with temperature and abundance . \n other mercury and platinum lines have their own blending concerns . for example , the strongest optical ptii line , at @xmath14046  , is blended with a weak line of hgi . \n our line data for the platinum and mercury transitions accounts for their complicated hyperfine and isotopic structures , both from recent wavelength measurements with the lund fourier transform spectrometer ( wahlgren et al . \n 1998a ) and literature sources ( engleman 1989 , kalus et al . \n 1998 ) . \n we have determined the influence of blending lines by analysing the spectra of 68 tau and @xmath2 leo . from iue spectra of hgii @xmath11942 \n one sees that these stars have only weak , if any , contribution from mercury . \n therefore , we do not expect to see the intrinsically weaker , optical region lines of mercury ( or platinum ) . \n the rotational velocity and the abundances of fei and cri were determined from optical lines possessing experimentally determined oscillator strengths . \n these abundances were then used to evaluate the f - values of the blending lines to the optical region platinum and mercury lines .    after establishing the atomic - line data we proceeded to synthesize the spectra of the hgmn and am stars . \n model atmospheres were computed from the code atlas9 based upon stellar atmospheric parameters derived from the uvby photometric calibration of moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) . \n the synthetic spectrum program synthe and the atomic line data of kurucz ( 1993 ) were used to compute the synthetic spectra , with the exception of alterations that we have made for the heavy element line data , the hyperfine structure of yii 3982  , and the @xmath3-value for fei @xmath13983.7   ( obrien et al.1991 ) . \n the presence of rare - earth elements has previously been noted in the spectra of the cool , hgmn stars @xmath4 lupi ( wahlgren et al . \n 1994 ) and hr 7775 ( wahlgren et al.1998a ) at optical wavelengths . \n we therefore speculate that other , if not all , cool hgmn stars also display ree lines . \n although it is difficult to assess the exact abundance levels for the ree from their third spectra , due to a lack of oscillator strength data , an abundance enhancement on the order of 1 to 2 dex is obtained from lines of the singly - ionized state . \n this enhancement level is similar to that found in am stars . \n our high - resolution optical spectra have enabled us to study the isotopic shifts in the platinum and mercury lines found in the spectrum of the hgmn star hr 7775 . \n observations of isotopic shifts represent important tests of diffusion theory . \n we were unable to satisfactorily fit the observed mercury lines with synthetic spectra that were computed assuming a mercury isotopic mixture based upon the q - formalism of white et al.(1976 ) . by trial and error selection \n we were able to identify a difference in the isotopic mixture between hgii 3984   and hgi \n 4358  , where the former presents a mixture of @xmath5hg : @xmath6hg = 40:60 and the latter line a terrestrial - like mixture . for each of the three ptii lines an essentially similar isotope mixture of @xmath7pt : @xmath8pt : @xmath9pt = 10:60:30 provided good fits to the observed features . however , this platinum isotope mixture is different from that obtained from ultraviolet transitions by kalus et al.(1998 ) . \n the potential significance of this difference lies in the excitation energies of the transitions studied and the possibility that their isotopic variations ( for pt and hg ) are depth dependent in the stellar atmosphere . \n this would provide strong evidence for the effects of diffusion . \n further details are presented by wahlgren et al.(1998a ) . \n our optical region search for vhe in hot - am stars ( sirius , o peg , hr 3383 , @xmath10 gem ) has not yielded positive identifications . \n the spectrum of hr 3383 did show promise for a mercury enhancement in the hgii @xmath13984 line at the detection limit . \n however , further analysis showed that the enhancement could be reproduced with an abundance variation of 0.05 - 0.10 dex for iron and chromium . \n the calculations show that for the hot - am stars a mercury abundance enhancement of [ hg / h ] = + 3 dex would be easily noticeable in the 3984   feature , with a minimum detection limit set at approximately [ hg / h ] = + 2.5 dex . as a further check on the possibilty of a mercury enhancement in hr 3383 , \n the iue high - dispersion spectrum was investigated . \n the hgii @xmath11942 line is present in hr 3383 at a strength nearly identical to that found in sirius ( [ hg / h ] = + 1.5 , wahlgren et al . \n the three stars sirius , hr 3383 , and o peg ( wahlgren et al . \n 1993 ) all display the hgii @xmath11942 line at a mercury enhancement of 1 - 1.5 dex . \n this value is remarkable for two reasons . \n first , if the abundance enhancement level for the am stars only approaches a level of + 1.0 to + 1.5 dex , then by virtue of the difference in oscillator strength of approximately 1.7 dex between the strong hgii lines at 1942 and 3984  , we would not expect to notice the presence of enhanced mercury at optical wavelengths . \n thus , the b9.5/a0 boundary for the hgmn stars would be applicable as a classification criterion at _ optical _ wavelengths . \n secondly , the solar system abundances for platinum and mercury are poorly defined , the latter only from s - process systematics . \n this therefore raises the question of whether the abundance of platinum and mercury in hot - am stars is a reflection of the galactic abundance at a later epoch of star formation than that of the sun , or the result of a reduced degree of diffusion relative to the hgmn stars . \n engleman , r. jr : 1989 , _ astrophys . \n j. _ , * 340 * , 1140 guthrie , b.n.g . : 1985 , _ mon . not . \n _ , * 216 * , 1 kalus , g. , johansson , s. , wahlgren , g.m . , \n leckrone , d.s . , \n thorne , a.p . , \n brandt , j.c . \n : 1998 , _ astrophys . j. _ \n , in press kurucz , r.l . \n : 1993 , _ synthe synthesis programs and line data _ , kurucz cd -

{"ContextTokens": 3347, "GeneratedTokens": 101, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the earliest contributions in the theoretical understanding of grbs is often referred to the work of @xcite . \n some crucial ideas which later became very important in this field were there presented ( e.g. the relevance of an electron - positron plasma , the possibility of baryonic loading of such plasma , and the evolution from an optically thick to an optically thin phase ) . the treatment , based on qualitative consideration , provided little information about the dynamics . \n the electron - positron plasma was there purported to evolve toward a proliferation of photons and pairs , leading to a degradation of the mean energy of particles in the plasma and a consequent cooling . \n such a plasma would become transparent on a very short time scale and no dynamical phases are envisaged making this model inappropriate for grbs . \n the physical reasons of the non - validity of these crucial conclusions are being discussed elsewhere @xcite . \n it soon became clear , however , following the work of @xcite and @xcite that the major characteristic of a sudden energy release process in electron - positron plasma leads to a very rapid self acceleration of a shell of material , reaching ultra - relativistic regimes with lorentz gamma factors in the range @xmath0 . \n the major results were obtained in @xcite , in @xcite , in @xcite and in @xcite .    in our model \n the analysis of the dynamical expansion of the electron - positron plasma is not just a topic of academic interest , it is indeed crucial to the description of the entire grb phenomena . \n the initial process is the vacuum - polarization around the black hole @xcite , followed by the dynamical expansion of the pair plasma , leading to an ultrarelativistic accelerated motion @xcite . \n such acceleration leads to a shell of baryons with lorentz gamma factor @xmath1 which , by interacting with the interstellar matter ( ism ) , gives origin to the afterglow . \n a first crucial signature in our model is carried by the radiation emitted at the moment of transparency , what we have called the proper - grb . \n the current models in the literature identify two different components in the long grbs , the `` prompt radiation '' and the `` afterglow '' , the first one being emitted by an `` inner engine '' ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in our model , instead , the `` prompt radiation '' is an essential part of the `` afterglow '' and the entire long grb phenomena is uniquely due to external shock processes .    for the above reasons we return , in this communication , to a comparison and contrast between our results and the ones in the current literature \n now we can address with clarity the analogies and the differences in the treatments and pin down the source of such differences as due to inaccurate theoretical work or / and equally inaccurate numerical computations . \n ( solid line ) and kinetic energy of the plasma @xmath2 ( dashed line ) of the baryons in terms of the initial energy @xmath3 of the electron -

{"ContextTokens": 2249, "GeneratedTokens": 80, "SynthesizedBody": "the formation of traffic jams is one of the fundamental problems of traffic flow theory . \n traffic jams can form spontanously as well as due to hindrances , e.g. road works or slow cars . \n although these hindrances often cover only a small part of the road , they can cause large jams , or , in a more physical language , one observes macroscopic effects due to local defects in the system . \n this behaviour is one of the characteristic properties of nonequilibrium systems . in the context of driven lattice gases one can distinguish in principle two types of defects : 1 ) lattice defects , e. g. sites where the mobility of particles is reduced , and 2 ) particle defects , for example slow particles .    for the simplest model for a driven lattice gas in one dimension , the asymmetric exclusions process ( \n asep)@xcite , it has been shown that both types of defects can cause phase transitions . \n slow particles , i.e. particles with a reduced hopping rate , determine completely the flow at small densities . moreover , if the distribution of the hopping rates fulfills certain conditions , one can show analytically that the variance of the distance distribution has a logarithmic divergence at the transition density @xcite .    also lattice defects in the asep \n have been investigated extensively @xcite . implementing lattice defects one can observe three different phases : a high and a low density phase , where the average flow of the homogeneous system is recovered , and a segregated phase at intermediate densities , where the flow takes a constant value . despite extensive effort \n , exact analytical results exist only for a special type of update @xcite , but approximative descriptions are in reasonable agreement with simulation results .    in this work \n we generalize the results of the asep to the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model of traffic flow ( for a detailed explanation of the model see @xcite ) . compared with the asep , \n the particles ( cars ) can hop more than one site in a single update step and the update rules are applied in parallel to all cars . \n therefore slow cars can be considered in two ways . \n first , one can think of cars with a smaller maximum velocity and second , of cars with an enlarged braking probability . \n this has been done very recently and analogous results to the @xmath0 case have been found @xcite . \n in contrast to @xcite we discuss the case of two different maximum velocities in the third chapter . in the next chapter \n we show simulation results for the nasch model with defect sites , implemented as sites where the braking probability of cars is higher compared to the rest of the lattice . \n an alternative choice has been used in @xcite , where a speed limit in a part of the lattice has been considered . \n as already mentioned above , in this chapter we show simulation results of the nasch model on a lattice with defect sites .    fig . \n [ single_fund ] shows the fundamental diagram of a system with a _ single _ defect site . \n obviously we can distinguish three different phases depending on the density . \n in the high and low density phases the average flow of the defect systems takes the same value as in the homogeneous system . for intermediate densities \n the flow is constant and limited by the capacity of the defect site . \n this behaviour of the average flow can be explained looking at the density profile . in the high and low density phase only local deviations from a constant profile \n can be observed , but at intermediate densities one observes a separation into macroscopic high and low density regions . changing the global density within the segregated phase , \n the bulk densities in the high ( @xmath1 ) and low density region ( @xmath2 ) remain constant , only the length of the high and low density region changes . \n consequently the average flow is constant in the segregated phase , because the average density in the vicinity of the defect site does not depend on the global density . \n near the average position of the shock the density profile decays exponentially from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . therefore one can introduce a length scale @xmath3 , which corresponds to the magnitude of the fluctuations of the shock position . \n for @xmath4 we found numerically that @xmath5 for all densities in the segregated phase we took into account . \n this scaling behaviour is already known for the asep at @xmath6 . \n the modified scaling behaviour @xmath7 at @xmath8 was not found for @xmath9 . \n this confirms the picture that the reduction of fluctuations is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry @xcite . \n a good estimate for the plateau value of the flow for the case of @xmath0 can be obtained using the assumption that the system is separated into two regions of constant density , where the results from the homogeneous system can be used . using an argumentation similar to @xcite we \n obtain the plateau value of the average flow :    @xmath10    the bulk value of the density in the high ( low ) density region the density is given by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . \n the shock is located at @xmath15 if @xmath16 or at @xmath17 if @xmath18 . \n this approximative treatment of the defect system is in a resonable agreement with the simulation results for large system sizes ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) . in principle \n one could treat higher velocities in the same way , but unfortunately no exact analytical description of the homogeneous system has been found by so far . \n in order to study the effect of slow cars on the throughput of single lane traffic , we discuss a system which consists of fast cars with maximum velocity @xmath19 _ and _ one slow car with @xmath20 .    in fig . \n [ slcfund ] the fundamental diagram of this system is compared with the fundamental diagram of the analogous homogeneous systems . obviously for low densities \n the flow is given by @xmath21 in a agreement with the homogeneous system with @xmath22 . compared to the homogeneous system one \n observes the linear density dependence also for larger values of the average density . \n the average flow depends linearly on the global density if @xmath23 holds , where @xmath24 denotes the stationary flow of the homogeneous system with fast cars . \n deviations from this form that are observable near the intersection point of @xmath25 and @xmath24 , are due to the finite size effects . \n the reason for the stability of the free flow regime in the mixed system is the gap in front of the slow car in the stationary state . in fig . \n [ slcprof ] the density profile relative to the position of the slow car is shown . \n obviously a large jam behind the slow car appears and the density in front of the slow car vanishes . \n therefore the slow car can move with its free flow velocity @xmath26 . \n this velocity determines the velocity of the whole jam and therefore the average velocity of the cars is simply given by @xmath25 . \n this is one possible simple scenario for the occurance of moving jams that are well known from measurements . \n in addition to the macroscopic form , two details of the density profile have to be discussed . behind the slow car one \n observes an oscillating amplitude of the density profile . \n these oscillations are well know from the spatial correlation function of the homogeneous system for small @xmath27 and densities near @xmath28 @xcite . \n obviously the slow car synchronizes the motion of the faster cars . \n furthermore we want to discuss the decay of the density profile at the end of the jam . for finite values of the braking probability \n the jamlength is fluctuating . \n these fluctuations are responsible for the finite size effects discussed above , because temporarily the gap in front of the slow car vanishes due to fluctuations of the jam length \n . measurements of the jamlength show that the fluctuations scale according to @xmath29 . due to the subextensive scaling of the fluctations the segregated states are observable up to @xmath30 if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the bulk density of the jam . \n the investigation of local defects in the nasch model has shown that these defects can change the macroscopic properties of the model . in the case of lattice defects \n three phases occur analogous to the asep ( i.e. @xmath33 ) with continuous time update . \n the segregated phase also exists for higher maximum velocities , but some details of the density profile are changed . in the low density regime one observes an oscillating profile as a consequence of the parallel update . \n the anomalous scaling of the fluctuations of the shock position found for the asep at @xmath34 is absent for @xmath9 , for all parameter combinations that have been taken into account . \n this result confirms the picture that the particle - hole symmetry is essential for the reduction of fluctuations . \n particle defects also produce phase separated stationary states at low densities . \n these states consist of a large jam behind the slowest vehicle and a large gap in front of the slowest car . \n the velocity of the moving jam is completely determined by the free flow velocity of the slow car . \n the formation of large clusters due to slow cars can also be observed in two - lane traffic , but due to lane changing the lifetime of the large clusters is finite ( at least for low densities ) . \n nevertheless it has been shown , that already a small concentration of slow cars changes leads to a drastic reduction of the average flow at low densities @xcite . \n our results show that the system poperties can change completely , if local disorder is taken into account . these results might also be important for an understanding of the behaviour of real traffic which are often determined by imperfections. such imperfections are not only the defects considered here , but also other deviations from an ideal system , e.g. ramps or a finite system size .", "StartTimeOffset": 332047768021, "RequestID": "e4aba29486f340ddb8eadf2c8a8d12f2", "TotalTokens": 2329}

dependent evaluations we have demonstrated here , in the case of medium energy kinematics which will be explored in the near future at jlab and compass , that the inclusion of nlo corrections to the coefficient function could be an important issue . \n the difference of these corrections between the spacelike and timelike regimes is so sizable that they can be promoted to the status of direct tests of the qcd understanding of the reactions . considering cff fitting , global fits of dvcs and tcs data will be needed to separate quark and gluon contributions and allow an accurate interpretation of extracted data .    finally , let us emphasize that we do not consider as a weakness of the current physics program the apparent importance of nlo contributions to compton form factors and dvcs or tcs observables . although it certainly opens the way to a challenging verification that nnlo corrections are either under control or subject to a legitimate resummation procedure @xcite , it points to the very positive fact that the compass -

{"ContextTokens": 3071, "GeneratedTokens": 176, "SynthesizedBody": "a complex system is inherently sensitive to failures of its components . \n one must therefore determine maintenance policies in order to maintain an acceptable operating condition . \n optimizing the maintenance is a very important problem in the analysis of complex systems . \n it determines when it is best that maintenance tasks should be performed on the system in order to optimize a cost function : either maximize a performance function or conversely minimize a loss function . \n moreover , this optimization must take into account the random nature of failures and random evolution and dynamics of the system . \n the example considered here is the maintenance of the heated hold - up tank , a well know test case for dynamic reliability , see e.g. @xcite . \n the system consists of a tank containing a fluid whose level is controlled by three components : two inlet pumps and one outlet valve . \n a thermal power source heats up the fluid . \n the failure rate of the components depends on the temperature , the position of the three components monitors the liquid level in the tank , and in turn , the liquid level determines the temperature . \n the main characteristic of this system is that it can be modeled by a stochastic hybrid process , where the discrete and continuous parts interact in a closed loop . as a consequence , simulating this process and computing related reliability indices has been a challenge for the dynamic reliability community . to our best knowledge , optimization of maintenance policies for the heated hold - up tank has not been addressed yet in the literature . \n the only maintenance operation considered here is the complete replacement of all the failed components and the system restarts in its initial equilibrium state . \n partial repairs are not allowed . \n mathematically , this problem of preventive maintenance corresponds to a stochastic optimal stopping problem as explained by example in the book of aven and jensen @xcite . \n it is a difficult problem because of the closed loop interactions between the state of the components and the liquid level and temperature . \n a classical approach consists in using condition - based maintenance ( cbm ) to act on the system based on its current state and before its failure . \n one can for example calculate the remaining useful life ( rul ) of the system and the preventive replacement is carried out when the deterioration level exceeds a certain threshold or enters in a certain state @xcite . \n our approach also takes into account the current state of the process , but our decision rule is not based on damage accumulation nor does it correspond to hitting some threshold . \n instead , it involves a performance function that reflects that the longer the system is in a functioning state the better . \n the dynamics of the heated hold - up tank can be modeled by a piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) , see @xcite . \n therefore , our maintenance problem boils down to an optimal stopping problem for pdmp s . \n pdmp s are a class of stochastic hybrid processes that has been introduced by davis @xcite in the 80 s . \n these processes have two components : a euclidean component that represents the physical system ( e.g. temperature , pressure ,  ) and a discrete component that describes its regime of operation and/or its environment . \n starting from a state @xmath0 and mode @xmath1 at the initial time , the process follows a deterministic trajectory given by the laws of physics until a jump time that can be either random ( e.g. it corresponds to a component failure or a change of environment ) or deterministic ( when a magnitude reaches a certain physical threshold , for example the pressure reaches a critical value that triggers a valve ) . \n the process restarts from a new state and a new mode of operation , and so on . \n this defines a markov process . \n such processes can naturally take into account the dynamic and uncertain aspects of the evolution of the system . \n a subclass of these processes has been introduced by devooght @xcite for an application in the nuclear field . \n the general model has been introduced in dynamic reliability by dutuit and dufour @xcite . \n the objective and originality of this paper is twofold . \n first , we propose an optimization procedure for a well - known benchmark in the dynamic reliability literature . \n the tank model was first introduced by @xcite where only one continuous variable ( liquid level ) is taken into account , and then in @xcite and @xcite where the second variable ( temperature ) is introduced . \n they have tested various monte carlo approaches to simulate the process to compute reliability and safety indices . in @xcite , \n the authors have used the same system to present continuous cell - to - cell mapping markovian approach ( cccmt ) still to simulate the process . \n the simulation of the holdup tank example has been and is still widely studied in the literature ( not exhaustive ) @xcite . here \n we go one step further and not only propose to simulate the tank process but also we optimize it . \n second , even though pdmp s have been recognized as a powerful modeling tool for dynamic reliability problems @xcite , there are very few numerical tools adapted to these processes . \n our aim is to further demonstrate the high practical power of the theoretical methodology described in @xcite , by applying it to the tank benchmark . in @xcite , \n the authors have proposed a numerical algorithm to optimize pdmp s and have studied its theoretical properties . \n this optimization procedure was first applied to an example of maintenance of a metallic structure subject to corrosion , without closed loop interactions or deterministic jumps . \n in addition , the system has only one continuous variable and the cost function is simple and does not depend on time , see @xcite . in this paper , we adapt the numerical procedure proposed in @xcite to the more challenging heated hold - up tank problem with two continuous variables , deterministic jumps when these variables hit some given boundaries and closed loop interactions between continuous and discrete variables . \n furthermore , we consider a cost function that depends on both continuous variables as well as on the running time . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : \n model ] , the dynamics of the heated hold - up tank is presented with more details as well as the framework of pdmp s . in section [ section : opti ] the formulation of the optimal stopping problem for pdmp s and its theoretical solution are briefly recalled and the four main steps of the algorithm are detailed . in section [ section \n : res ] the numerical results obtained on the example of the tank are presented and discussed . finally , in section [ section : conclusion ] a conclusion and perspectives are presented . \n we are interested in the maintenance of a heated hold - up tank . \n the dynamics of the tank can be modeled by a piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) . \n we first describe with more details the dynamics of the tank , then we recall the definition and some basic properties of pdmp s . \n the tank model is a well known benchmark in dynamic reliability . \n it was first introduced by @xcite where only one continuous variable ( liquid level ) is taken into account , and then in @xcite and @xcite where the second variable ( temperature ) is introduced . \n we have kept the values of the parameters defined in those papers . \n the system is represented on figure [ fig1 ] . \n it consists of a tank containing a fluid whose level is controlled by three components : two inlet pumps ( units 1 and 2 ) and one outlet valve ( unit 3 ) . \n a thermal power source heats up the fluid . \n the variables of interest are the liquid level @xmath2 , the liquid temperature @xmath3 and the state of the three components and the controller . \n each component has four states : on , off , stuck on or stuck off . once a unit is stuck ( either on or off ) it can not change state . \n the possible transitions between these four states are given in figure [ fig2 ] . \n thus , by a random transition a working unit can only become stuck ( either on or off ) . \n the initial state of the components is on for units 1 and 3 and off for unit 2 .    , \n width=226 ]    the intensity of jumps @xmath4 for unit @xmath5 depends on the temperature through the equation @xmath6 with @xmath7 given in eq . \n ( [ eq : a ] ) , see @xcite @xmath8    function @xmath7 is represented on figure [ fig3 ] and the various parameters come from the literature , see @xcite , and are given in table [ tab1 ] . \n the special form of the failure rate @xmath4 as a product of a constant depending on @xmath5 and a function of the temperature allows for all three units to have failure rates with the same dependence on the temperature , but different scaling parameters . \n indeed , at the reference temperature of @xmath9 , the mean time to failure of unit @xmath10 is @xmath11 , for unit @xmath12 , it is @xmath13 and for unit @xmath14 it is @xmath15 . \n in addition , the shape for function @xmath7 was chosen in the original benchmark so that there is a very high failure rate when the temperature is high . \n more specifically , the parameters are chosen such that @xmath7 is lowest ( equal to @xmath10 ) when the temperature is equal to a reference temperature of @xmath9 , it equals @xmath16 when the temperature is @xmath17 and it is highest ( equal to @xmath18 ) when the temperature equals the critical temperature of @xmath19 . \n the exponential functions are chosen in order to enable this very high dependence with the temperature . \n roughly speaking , the units fail @xmath18 times more often when the temperate is @xmath19 than when it is @xmath9 .     as a function of @xmath3,width=188 ]    in addition \n , control laws are used to modify the state of the components to keep the liquid within two acceptable limits : @xmath20 meters and @xmath21 meters . \n if the liquid level drops under @xmath22 , the components 1 , 2 , 3 are put respectively in state on , on and off ( provided they are not stuck ) . \n if the liquid level rises above @xmath23 , the components are put respectively in the state off , off and on ( provided they are not stuck ) . unlike the classical model presented in @xcite , we also allow the control unit to fail . at each solicitation \n , the control may succeed with probability @xmath24 independently from previous successes . \n once it has failed , it will never succeed again . \n therefore the control unit has two possible states : working @xmath10 or failed @xmath25 . \n .parameters for the tank dynamics [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the numerical method described in @xcite has been applied to a well known test case of dynamic reliability to approximate the value function of the optimal stopping problem and an @xmath26-optimal stopping time for a piecewise - deterministic markov process , that is the maintenance date for the tank . \n the quantization method proposed can sometimes be costly in computing time , but has a very interesting property : it can be calculated off - line . \n moreover it depends only on the dynamics of the model , and not on the cost function chosen , or the actual trajectory of the specific process one wants to monitor . \n the calculation of the optimal maintenance time is done in real time , making our procedure applicable in practice . \n the optimal maintenance time is updated at the changes of mode and has a conditional threshold form , which allows scheduling maintenance services in advance . \n if one only changes the reward function @xmath27 without changing the dynamics of the tank , one just has to run the optimization part of the algorithm , and not the quantization grids . \n this can be done in real time . if one wants to change the dynamics of the system , or add some components , one has to rewrite the simulation code for the system , and with this new code re - run the quantization grids , which can be quite long . \n however , the general methodology is valid for a wide class of piecewise deterministic markov processes and not at all specific to the tank . \n the method has been implemented on the heated hold - up tank . \n the main characteristic of this system is that it can be modeled by a stochastic hybrid process , where the discrete and continuous parts interact in a closed loop . \n the optimization problem under study has no analytic solution . \n however , our method is based on a rigorous mathematical construction with proof of convergence . \n in addition , simple comparisons between no motoring and our policy also prove its practical validity with a significant improvement of the performance of the system ( the mean performance is increased by @xmath28 and the top events are almost always avoided ) . \n our next project is to extend this research in two main directions . \n first , we could allow only partial repair of the system . \n the problem will then be to find simultaneously the optimal times of maintenance and optimal repair levels . \n mathematically , it is an impulse control problem , which complexity exceeds widely that of the optimal stopping . \n second , our method requires a perfect observation of the state process at the jump times . \n it would be interesting to extend our results to a noisy observation of the process , as often happens in real life . \n this work was partially funded by the french national research , anr grant fautocoes , program arpege , anr-09-segi-004 . \n the authors also thank pr . \n franois dufour for initial discussions on how to define an interesting optimal stopping problem for the test -

{"ContextTokens": 3080, "GeneratedTokens": 196, "SynthesizedBody": "the importance of water in many areas of science has motivated a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations of the liquid . \n however , it is only recently that x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements have come to an overall agreement for properties such as the structure of water at ambient conditions @xcite . \n in addition , several details of the water structure remain the subject of debate , and many dynamical properties of the liquid are not yet well understood . \n theoretical models have played an important role in the interpretation of experimental measurements and in understanding the physical properties of water @xcite . over the last thirty years , rather accurate empirical force fields \n have been developed , which can reproduce not only the structure but also many dynamical properties of the liquid @xcite . \n although empirical models work well for pure water under ambient conditions , they are usually difficult to generalize to complex solutions or thermodynamic states far from ambient conditions . for example , the majority of empirical water models that are in current use employ potentials that do not change depending on the environment .    in recent years , it has become possible to simulate the properties of a liquid entirely from first principles , without having to resort to fitted potentials . \n this is due in large part to the development of the car - parrinello ( cp ) method @xcite along with the continual increase in high performance computing resources . \n although rather accurate and with the potential of being a truly predictive tool , cp simulations are much more computationally intensive than classical simulations . \n the case of water is particularly demanding for cp simulations . \n the ionic vibrational spectrum of the liquid exhibits high frequency modes , i.e. o - h stretch ( 3200 to 3600 @xmath0 ) and h - o - h bending modes ( @xmath11600 @xmath0 ) . \n therefore , in order to avoid a coupling between the ionic and electronic degrees of freedom , which could cause severe inaccuracies in a cp simulation , a relatively small fictitious electronic mass ( @xmath2 400 a.u . for protonated water ) needs to be used @xcite . in turn , the use of small values of @xmath3 , together with the high kinetic energy cutoff required to describe the oxygen pseudopotential in a plane wave description , necessitates the use of small integration time steps . the time step may need to be as small as 0.08 fs , which is approximately ten times smaller than what is often used in classical md simulations with empirical inter - atomic potentials . \n this poses a severe restriction on the time scales that can be accessed in cp simulations of water . \n we note that when using born - oppenheimer ( bo ) dynamics ( where the total energy of the system is minimized at each ionic step ) , one can use larger time steps than in cp simulations , since electronic degrees of freedom are not propagated at the same time as ionic coordinates . \n however , the accuracy required to reduce systematic errors on the ionic forces so as to have conservative dynamics is such that large number of iterations are usually necessary to minimize the kohn - sham energy at each ionic step . \n therefore , the gain in efficiency obtained with a large time step is more than counter - balanced by the computational time requirement for total energy minimizations . \n it is interesting to note that the problem of integrating fast vibrational modes in simulations of liquid water has also been encountered in classical md simulations , where the most common approach has been to completely eliminate the high - frequency intra - molecular motion by using bond length and angle constraints @xcite . \n based on this approach , a variety of classical water potentials , e.g. the tip series @xcite , are capable of accurately reproducing many of the interesting properties of water . in particular , results obtained with the rigid water tip5p potential are in very good agreement with a variety of experimental measurements such as the structure , the temperature of maximum density , diffusion , as well as dielectric properties @xcite .    with the aim of investigating how to increase the integration time step in cp simulations of water and thus access larger time scales , we have carried out calculations using a rigid water approximation . in this paper , we present the results of these simulations and compare them to those obtained with flexible water molecules ( i.e. without imposing any constraints on the geometry of the molecules in the liquid ) , and we discuss the effect of a rigid model on the structural properties of water at ambient and high pressure conditions . \n our results show that an _ ab initio _ rigid water model yields faster diffusion and radial distribution functions which are less structured than those found with a flexible model . \n overall , the properties computed with the rigid model are in better agreement with experiment than those determined with a flexible model . possible reasons for this improved agreement are discussed . \n in addition , we present a localized orbital analysis of the trajectories obtained with both a rigid and flexible water model , and we demonstrate that the large dipole moment changes in going from the gas to the liquid phase are not significantly altered by the rigid water approximation . \n the use of a rigid water model in _ ab initio _ simulations opens the way to much longer simulations of solutions where chemical reactions and dissociation effects do not occur . \n in order to examine how the structural and dynamical properties of water are altered by a rigid water approximation , we have performed a series of first principle molecular dynamics simulations @xcite of water with and without intramolecular bond and angle constraints under ambient and high pressure and temperature conditions . \n the simulations consist of 54 water molecules in a periodically repeated cubic cell with a lateral dimension of either 11.74   or 10.10  , which correspond to densities of 1.00 g / cc and 1.57 g / cc , respectively . at each density , we have compared simulations where the intra - molecular geometry of the water molecules are rigid to those where the geometries of the water molecules are fully flexible . \n .details of the simulations . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ diffusion ]    in addition to possible changes in structure and dynamics , we have examined how the rigid molecule approximation changes the electronic properties of water . in order to do this \n we have performed a localized orbital analysis by computing the mlwfs for a series of well - separated snapshots from the rigid water simulation b and the flexible water simulation c. within the pseudopotential approximation , there are four doubly occupied mlwfs around each of the water molecules in the simulations . \n two of the mlwfs are localized on the oxygen - hydrogen covalent bonds , and the other two are localized on the lone - pair locations of the oxygen atoms . given the large amount of data that the mlwfs represent , in the following , we only consider the centers of the mlwfs rather than the orbitals themselves . in fig . \n [ gow ] , the oxygen - mlwf center rdfs for simulations b and c are shown . \n the rdfs consist of two distinct distributions centered at r@xmath10.33   and r@xmath10.49  , which correspond to lone - pair and covalent bond locations , respectively . for comparison , the dashed vertical lines in fig \n .  [ gow ] represent the locations of the mlwf centers around the oxygen atom of an isolated gas phase water molecule . \n surprisingly , the rigid water approximation does not significantly alter the large changes in the mlwf centers that are expected when going from an isolated water molecule to the liquid state . as can be seen in fig . \n [ gow ] , the lone pair distributions are shifted away from the oxygen atoms by @xmath10.03  , and the covalent bond distributions are shifted toward the oxygen atoms by @xmath10.04  .    as proposed by silvestrelli \n _ et al . _ \n @xcite , an approximate dipole moment for each water molecule in the liquid can be defined by assigning the total charge of each mlwf to a point charge located at its corresponding center . because the mlwf on neighboring water molecules in the liquid do not significantly overlap , this provides a less ambiguous definition of the molecular dipole moments than arbitrarily assigning electron density to individual water molecules . as pointed out in ref . \n , dipole moments computed in this manner from static configurations may not be representative of the experimentally measured dipole moments in the fluid . \n however , the mlwf dipole moments are useful for examining qualitative differences in the polarization of water as a function of different approximations or of solutes present in the liquid .    in fig . \n [ dipole ] , the probability distributions of molecular dipole moments for rigid and flexible water systems calculated from the mlwf centers are shown . \n [ dipole ] indicates that the rigid water approximation has a rather small effect on distribution of dipole moments in the liquid . \n in particular , the average moment in simulation b is shifted to 3.08 debye as compared to 3.20 debye in simulation c. apparently , an explicit description of high frequency o - h stretch and h - o - h bending modes is not necessary to reproduce the broad range of moments that are characteristic of the liquid . \n it is also interesting to note that the latest experimental estimate based on an analysis of the x - ray structure factor of water indicates that the dipole moment of water in the liquid is 2.9 debye @xcite , which is in closer agreement with the rigid water model than the flexible simulation . \n the decrease in the average dipole moment obtained from the rigid water approximation offers another explanation for the observed softening of the liquid structure . \n in addition to mimicking quantum effects , it is possible that the rigid water approximation to some extent corrects for the general tendency of simple gga - based functionals to overestimate the polarizability of molecules @xcite . \n for example , the static isotropic polarizability of an isolated water molecule is 10.74 au with the pbe functional as compared to the experimental value of 9.64 au @xcite . \n it is interesting to note that hybrid dft functionals , which include some amount of hartree -

oxygen , oxygen - hydrogen and hydrogen - hydrogen rdfs for simulations d and e are compared in figs . \n [ goo - hp ] to [ ghh - hp ] . \n except for the expected intramolecular differences due to the constraints , the rdfs obtained from simulations d and e are remarkably similar . \n in particular , both the large increase in the number of nearest neighbors as well as the stiffness of the first peak in g@xmath4(r ) as a function of compression are reproduced by the rigid water model @xcite . \n as higher densities and temperatures are considered , intramolecular dissociation will become an common event in flexible water simulations @xcite and the rigid water approximation is expected to be inappropriate for the description of the liquid . \n in summary , we have used a series of car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations to examine how the rigid water approximation affects the computed properties of water in the liquid state at ambient conditions . in agreement with previous observations based on empirical interaction potentials @xcite \n , the rigid water approximation is found to cause an overall decrease in structure and an increase in diffusion of the liquid . \n these changes result in properties that are in better agreement with experimental measurements than the corresponding first principles simulations with flexible water molecules . at higher temperatures and densities in a regime where intramolecular dissociation is still a rare event , the differences between simulations where water molecules are either rigid or flexible become negligible . \n in addition to an improved structural and dynamical description of water , the rigid water model enables the use of time steps as large as 0.24 fs within the car - parrinello scheme ( i.e. @xmath13 times larger than in a flexible water simulation ) . \n a similar conclusion was reached in ref .   for first - principle simulations of a cytosine molecule in the gas phase . \n this represents an important advantage for first - principle simulations of aqueous solutions where chemical reactions do not occur , and opens up the possibility of investigating phenomena that take place on a long timescale . \n for example , understanding how water orients around a hydrophobic solute may require simulations of the order of 100 to 200 ps . \n the rigid water approximation presented here may prove to be an accurate and efficient approach for describing the interaction between a hydrophobic solute and water within a first - principles context . \n + the authors would like to thank j.  c.  grossman for many useful discussions . \n this work was performed under the auspices of the u.s . \n dept .  of energy at the university of california / lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract no .  w-7405-eng-48 .", "StartTimeOffset": 372689292358, "RequestID": "1ee482448ff1436180cc6c281da528fc", "TotalTokens": 3276}

pilot studies ) . \n the left panel shows the @xmath9-z  relation found for these galaxies , with color code indicating the integrated sfr for each galaxy . \n it is appreciated that the stronger gradient in sfr is along the stellar mass , as expected for star - forming galaxies . \n once subtracted the best fitted function to the @xmath9-z  relation , the residual of the abundance do not present any evident secondary relation with the sfr ( as it is seen in the right panel ) . \n thus , the results presented in @xcite are confirmed with a sample of galaxies enlarged by almost a factor two . \n we also confirmed the local -z  relation unveiled by @xcite , with a larger statistical sample of  regions ( @xmath75000 ) . \n this nebular gas -z  relation is flatter than the one derived for the average stellar populations @xcite , but both of them agree for the younger stars , as expected if the most recent stars are born from the chmical enriched ism . in @xcite , we confirmed that the abundance gradients present a common slope up to @xmath72 effective radii , with a distribution compatible with being produced by random fluctuations , for all galaxies when normalized to the disk effective radius of @xmath100.1 dex/@xmath6 . \n finally , in @xcite , we found evidence that  regions keep a memory of their past , by analysing the correspondance between the properties of these ionized regiones with that of their underlying stellar populations . \n in summary the results from the califa survey present a coherent picture of the mass - growth and chemical enrichment of galaxies . \n all the results indicate that the bulk of the galaxy population presents an inside - out growth ( at the mass range covered by the survey ) , with a chemical enrichment dominated by local processes , and limited effects by processes like outflows or radial mixing .", "StartTimeOffset": 378273189040, "RequestID": "ca35a88a7a3045abbc8c269b814b43d1", "TotalTokens": 2991}

[ smcb ] ) with two prominent central concentrations matching the carbon stars by hardy et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n the easternmost also coincides with the peak of the young  star distribution . \n the agb distribution axis is much less inclined ( pa @xmath35 ) than that of the younger and very similar to that of the rgb star distribution . \n as in the case of the lmc , the stellar distributions become more regular and smoother with increasing age , also apparent in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 band images by zaritsky et al . \n ( @xcite ) and for the outer contour in the carbon stars by kunkel et al . \n ( @xcite ) ; carbon stars by rebeirot et al . \n ( @xcite ) fill the second level countour ( fig . \n [ smcb ] ) .    the distribution of rgb stars ( fig . \n [ smcc ] ) is similar to that of the agb stars and also exhibits two major concentrations . \n the western most is more pronounced in rgb than in agb stars . \n the eastern concentration on average appears to be significantly younger than the western concentration dominated by the older stars . remarkably , the strongest hi concentration in the smc map by stanimirovic et al . \n ( @xcite ) appears to be just between the concentration of younger stars and that of older stars . \n it is also remarkable that the older star distribution extends over the full length of the suspected southwestern tidal feature , about @xmath38 from the main body of the bar . \n with respect to the overall distribution of the older stars , that of the hi appears to be displaced towards the east . \n the smc wing , prominent in hi and also traceable in the younger stellar population , has no counterpart in the older stars . \n counts of sources towards the magellanic clouds extracted from the dcmc ( cioni et al . \n @xcite ) allow differentiation in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) colour  magnitude diagram into three groups of objects with different mean ages . \n the spatial distribution of the three age groups is quite different : in either cloud , the youngest stars exhibit an irregular structure characterized by spiral arms and tidal features while the older stars are smoothly and regularly distributed . \n the distribution of younger stars is well  correlated with those of clusters , associations , hii regions and hi . \n the significant offset of the lmc bar with respect to the overall circular disk suggests that the lmc potential is dominated by dark matter \n . the well  defined southern spiral arm may be due to tidal interaction with the smc . \n the nature of the two northern spiral arms is uncertain . in the smc , the regular , but double  peaked , structure of the agb and rgb stars \n is remarkable , as is its offset from the hi distribution , and the mean age difference of the two maxima . \n relatively faint east \n west features in the younger star population ( including the wing ) are probably also due to tidal interaction . \n bica e.l.d . , \n dutra c.m . , 2000 , \n aj 119 , 1214 bica e.l.d . , \n schmitt h.r . , 1995 , \n ajs 101 , 41 bica e.l.d . , \n schmitt h.r . , et al . , 1999 , aj 117,238 bothun g.d . , \n thompson i.b . , 1988 , aj 96 , 877 caldwell j.a.r , coulson i.m . , 1986 , \n mnras 218 , 223 cioni m.r . \n , loup c. , habing h.j . , et al . , 2000 , \n a&as accepted cioni m.r . \n , van der marel r.p . \n , loup c. , habing h.j . , a&a submitted epchtein n. , de batz b. , et al . , 1997 , the messenger 87 , 27 gardiner l.t . , turfus c. , putman m.e . , 1998 , apj 507 , l35 hardy e. , suntzeff n.b . , azzopardi m. , 1989 , apj 344 , 210 kim s. , dopita m.a . , et al . \n , 1999 , aj 118 , 2797 kontizas m. , morgan d.h . , et al . , 1990 , \n a&ass 84 , 527 kunkel w.m . , demers s. , irwin m.j . , \n aj submitted kunkel w.m . \n , irwin m.j . , demers s. , 1997 , a&ass 122 , 463 maragoudaki f. , kontizas m. , et al . , 1998 , a&a 339 , l29 rebeirot e. , martin n. , mianes p. , et al . \n 1983 , a&as 51 , 277 sofue y. , 1999 , pasj 51 , 445 stanimirovic s. , staveley - smith l. , et al . , 1998 , \n mnras 302 , 417 staveley - smith l. , gibson b. , et al . , 2000 , iau 190 , p. 37 \n , 1999 ph . \n d thesis leiden university ( nl ) , ch . 4 weinberg m.d . , nikolaev s. , apj submitted westerlund b.e . , 1997 , the magellanic clouds , camb . \n astr . se . \n 29 zaritsky d. , harris j. , et al . \n , apj lett .  accepted", "StartTimeOffset": 408238515731, "RequestID": "2440dfb8c7c14db1a2b8eaa1590b1d6b", "TotalTokens": 4173}

scale of the interaction , from initial hard scattering to final state interactions by simultaneous measurement of a wide range of probes in the same detector .    here , the results on neutral pion production in the @xmath3  gev / c transverse momentum range are presented . \n high @xmath4 hadrons are produced primarily by initial hard scattering of partons , and their rate of production in @xmath5 collisions can be calculated in perturbative qcd , which simply scales to nuclear collisions by the relative number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . however , in the case of colliding nuclei , there are several nuclear effects that can modify the spectra of hadrons even in the ordinary nuclear medium , such as shadowing and @xmath4 broadening . in addition , there are predictions  @xcite that if the medium becomes very dense , the scattered partons may lose considerable energy via gluon bremsstrahlung or `` jet quenching '' . according to those predictions , this effect would cause a significant depletion of the spectra at high @xmath4 . \n the phenix detector consists of an axial - field magnet surrounded by two central arms ( called east and west ) , each one subtending @xmath6 in azimuth and @xmath7 units of pseudorapidity . \n two spectrometers at forward angles ( @xmath8 ) around the beam axis serve to identify and track muons . during the year 2000 \n data taking run , only a subset of the detectors of the central arm were read out and analyzed . \n trigger and basic event characterization was provided by two sets of beam - beam counters ( bbc ) covering @xmath9 in azimuth and @xmath10 , as well as by two zero - degree calorimeters located @xmath11 m from the collision point and covering @xmath12  @xcite . \n the primary interaction trigger is generated by the coincidence between the beam - beam counters which detect @xmath13% of the nuclear interaction cross section of @xmath14 barns . \n another trigger is generated by a coincidence between the two zero - degree calorimeters which are sensitive to unbound spectator neutrons from the nuclear interactions or from coulomb dissociation . \n the correlation between the bbc and zdc signals are used to determine the centrality of the collision . \n they are also used to establish the number of participant nucleons ( @xmath15 ) and binary collisions ( @xmath16 ) using a glauber - model calculation  @xcite . \n the central arm spectrometers consist of a multiplicity vertex detector ( mvd ) , drift chambers ( dc ) , two layers of pad chambers ( pc ) , a gas - filled ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) , a time expansion chamber ( tec ) , and a high granularity electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) consisting of eight sectors , each covering @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n six of the calorimeter sectors are lead - scintillator sampling calorimeters ( pbsc ) , while two sectors consist of lead glass calorimeters ( pbgl ) . \n the data presented here are obtained from two pbsc sectors in the west arm spectrometer , which have @xmath19 energy resolution and @xmath20  mm position resolution for electromagnetic showers in a low multiplicity environment . \n the energy calibration was established using minimum ionizing particles , maintained with a laser monitoring system , and verified from the data using @xmath21 matching for identified electrons in low multiplicity events , as well as with the mass of the @xmath0 . \n the systematic error on the overall energy scale is less than 1.5%  @xcite . \n only events taken at full magnetic field and satisfying the primary interaction trigger , as explained above , are analyzed . \n additional cuts include the measured event vertex position ( @xmath22  cm ) , consistency between the zdc and bbc interaction time measurement . \n altogether , 1.17 million events passed these cuts and form the sample referred to as `` minimum bias '' . based upon the correlation of the measured bbc charge and zdc energy , centrality classes were established as fractions of the total nuclear cross section . in this analysis \n `` central '' refers to the 0 - 10% most central collisions , while `` peripheral '' means the upper 60 - 80% range of @xmath23 . as `` peripheral '' . \n this is now replaced by the upper 60 - 80% of @xmath23 where the sample is much cleaner and the results are less biased by the inefficiencies of the trigger in the most peripheral collisions . \n the centrality selection for the `` central '' spectra is the same ( 0 - 10% most central ) , but the points and the systematic errors have been revised . ] \n neutral pions have been measured using their @xmath24 decay mode . in this measurement \n , the invariant mass of the photon pairs has to be within a narrow ( @xmath25 ) window around the observed @xmath0 mass , thus allowing for less stringent photon identification cuts , which reduces the systematic errors on efficiency losses due to these cuts . \n each cluster found in the calorimeter is subject to a timing cut : it has to arrive within 2.5 ns with respect to the expected time - of - flight of a photon coming from the event vertex ( tof cut ) . \n this cut eliminates slow hadrons , in particular anti - neutrons which are a major source of neutral clusters in the 1 - 2 gev energy range . \n in addition , the shape of each cluster is compared to the known and parametrized shape of electromagnetic showers , and the @xmath26 of the difference between the observed and predicted shower shape is calculated @xcite . \n a @xmath27 cut is then applied to the showers . \n both cuts are designed to keep the photon efficiency as high as possible . \n therefore the accepted clusters have a significant contribution for other particles which is removed by the backround subtraction method described below . \n furthermore , the efficiency of both cuts depends on the event multiplicity . \n this was verified from the data by comparing @xmath0 peak contents at a given @xmath4 extracted with different photon identification cuts , as well as by studying the effect of the cuts on well identified electrons . \n the @xmath28 invariant mass is calculated from all pairs of clusters in an event passing the photon identification cuts . \n the combinatorial background is estimated using an event mixing method , which after proper normalization , is subtracted from the invariant mass distribution . \n the @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency is calculated by the following procedure . \n first , the effect of a second particle contributing to the same cluster is investigated ( overlaps ) . \n simulated single electromagnetic showers are merged both in real and simulated events . for different single shower energies and event centralities , the distributions of the ratios of the measured and original energies are stored ( referred to as photon energy and event centrality - dependent @xmath29 `` smearing '' functions ) . \n these functions are then used in a fast monte carlo simulation as follows . \n neutral pions are generated with the expected @xmath4 distribution and allowed to decay . \n for those cases , when both decay photons reach the calorimeter , their respective energies are randomized with the appropriate @xmath29 smearing function , and the invariant mass is calculated using the randomized energies . \n the resulting simulated line - shapes are compared to line - shapes obtained from the data after mixed event subtraction . \n they agree very well , and the same cuts are applied to the data and the simulations to establish the efficiency . \n simulations are also used to determine the background from particles striking the pole - tips and structural elements of detectors in front of the calorimeter . \n an additional source of background arises from those @xmath0 s produced close to ( but not at ) the collision vertex which reconstruct in the calorimeter with the proper invariant mass , increasing the true @xmath0 yield . \n this background is also estimated using simulations ( hijing 1.35  @xcite ) . \n the calculated contribution of non - vertex but properly reconstructed @xmath0 is @xmath30 at @xmath31 and gradually decreases to @xmath32 at @xmath33 . \n this yield has been subtracted from the measured @xmath0 yield . \n the semi - inclusive transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 in peripheral ( upper 60 - 80% of @xmath23 ) and 10% most central au+au collisions is shown in figure  [ fig : plot_pt_ua1 ] . at high \n @xmath34 the peripheral spectrum is limited by statistics . \n error bars include both statistical and systematics errors . \n both spectra are compared to @xmath4 spectra derived from nucleon - nucleon data . since there is no measurement of @xmath0 production in @xmath5 at @xmath2  gev , this reference spectrum \n is derived from ua1  @xcite and cdf  @xcite charged hadron spectra . \n first , the available data are fitted with a function @xmath35 , then the fit parameters @xmath36 are interpolated to rhic energy . \n the result is divided by @xmath37 mb for the yield and by 1.6 to obtain the pion content from the unidentified charged spectra . \n ( the actual parameter values are @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . ) \n this parametrized curve is then multiplied by the estimated mean number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 in peripheral and central collision , respectively ) . \n the systematic error on the number of collisions is indicated by the two bands .    in peripheral collisions \n the scaled @xmath5 parametrization describes the results very well , but it significantly overpredicts the measured spectrum in central collisions , particularly at higher @xmath4 . the observed deficit in the @xmath0 yield is even more surprising if one takes into account that at 3 - 4 gev / c a cronin - type enhancement due to @xmath34 broadening above the scaled @xmath5 distribution would be expected . \n the same deficit can be seen in figure  [ fig : ratio_centperiph2 ] without referring to parametrized @xmath5 results . \n both the central and the peripheral spectra are normalized by the respective number of binary collisions , then divided point - by - point . \n the central / peripheral ratios are shown as triangles , and the error bars are statistical . \n the solid line gives the upper limit on the ratio if the systematic errors of the @xmath0 spectra are added in quadrature . \n the dashed line adds ( in quadrature ) the systematic error on the number of collisions ( @xmath16 ) . \n the central / peripheral ratio , normalized by @xmath16 , is expected to be one in the case of simple scaling with @xmath16 . \n however , the measured ratio is much smaller . \n the expected range of the central / peripheral ratio with a cronin - effect included is also shown . \n figure  [ fig : ptdist_wang_cent10 ] shows the results for both the peripheral and central collisions compared to three theoretical calculations  @xcite ( curves ) . \n the solid lines are a straightforward pqcd calculation for @xmath5 , with simple scaling to au - au collisions by the mean number of binary collisions @xcite . \n the dotted lines are a calculation where effects of nuclear shadowing and @xmath4 broadening are added , and result in a change of slope , suppressing the soft part of the spectrum and enhancing the hard scattering part ( cronin effect ) . \n the calculation plotted with dashed lines adds a constant @xmath43 parton energy loss to the shadowing and @xmath4 broadening . \n the peripheral data are consistent with all three scenarios \n . however , the central data are well below the first and second ( pqcd and shadowing / cronin ) curve , but they are not inconsistent with the third scenario that includes a parton energy loss . \n transverse momentum spectra for neutral pions in central and peripheral @xmath2 gev au+au collisions have been presented . \n the peripheral spectrum is consistent with the simple scaling of @xmath5 collisions with the mean number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . in the central spectra , \n a significant deficit with respect to this point - like scaling is observed at high transverse momenta .    9 x.n . \n wang , phys . \n c , ( 61 ) 064910 ( 2000 ) p. levai , g. papp , g. fai , m. gyulassy , nucl -

{"ContextTokens": 3804, "GeneratedTokens": 161, "SynthesizedBody": "despite having been studied for well over 20 years , the emission mechanisms active during the prompt phase in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remain unclear . \n a robust prediction of the fireball model for grbs@xcite is that the relativistic jet is initially opaque and therefore photospheric emission is inevitable . yet its strength is uncertain and it is therefore not necessarily detectable . in 1986 , both paczynski@xcite and goodman@xcite suggested a strong contribution of photospheric emission in grb spectra ; however , the observed spectra generally appear nonthermal and these models were therefore not considered viable . \n interest in the photospheric component resumed with observations of grbs using _ compton gamma - ray observatory_/batse ( 202000 kev ) . \n ryde@xcite found that in many individual emission pulses an equally good or better fit could be found by using a model comprising a planck function and a power - law , as compared to the traditional band function . \n additionally , it was found that the evolution of the planck function component during the prompt phase followed well defined and consistent characteristics . \n the planck component was interpreted as the photosphere of the grb . at present \n there is again mounting evidence from theoretical considerations that the photosphere of the relativistic outflow ( jet ) plays an important role@xcite .    in this paper the observational signs \n so far attributed to photospheric emission will be discussed and interpreted in light of models of subphotospheric dissipation , geometrical broadening and multi - zone emission . \n photospheric emission can give rise to many different spectral shapes , and pure blackbody emission is rarely expected . \n as noted above , predictions of photospheric emission came early in the study of grbs . \n yet it was not until the detailed spectral studies made possible by _ cgro_/batse that the first clear observational signs were seen . in part \n this may be due to the ambiguity in attributing spectral components to distinct physical processes . \n this has to some extent meant that the search for photospheric emission has become a search for blackbody ( or planckian ) components in the spectrum : while the photosphere can in principle give rise to many different shapes , a blackbody can only come from the photosphere . \n @xcite first reported the presence of a blackbody component in the initial phase of some grbs detected with _ \n @xcite also showed that some grbs could be well fit with single planck functions throughout the prompt phase . \n however , such cases are extremely rare . in the entire batse catalogue , only 6 out of @xmath0 grbs \n are well described by a pure blackbody . \n the situation is similar for the _ fermi _ catalogue : only 2 such bursts in over @xmath1 have reported @xcite . \n although these numbers may seem low , what is perhaps more surprising is that there are such cases at all . \n already from the start , it was shown that purely geometrical considerations meant that photospheric emission should be somewhat broader than a single temperature planck function . \n the fact that there are such narrow spectra is thus very constraining for theoretical models .    an interesting case for the study of photospheric emission is grb090902b , one of the brightest bursts seen by _ \n fermi_. during the first part of the emission episode , the main spectral peak is very narrow and well - fit by a multicolor blackbody @xcite . \n however , during later times in the pulse the spectrum broadens considerably . \n as the spectral evolution can be followed , it is clear that the same component is seen throughout the prompt phase . \n the blackbody - like spectrum at early times ties it to the photosphere , and grb090902b thus shows that photospheric emission is not necessarily planckian .        in summary : \n * observations of  blackbody - like spectra \" indicate that the photosphere is detected , and thereby also plays a role in grb prompt emission and the formation of spectra . \n * the fact that some spectra are well fit by single - temperature blackbodies has strong theoretical implications on the physical conditions of the emission region . * \n the slightly wider spectra allow us to probe the broadening mechanisms active in the outflow . \n this is particularly true for bursts such as grb090902b where width changes strongly during the pulse . \n however , most spectra are not well described by a single narrow component . \n nevertheless , evidence of photospheric emission in some grbs motivates us to search for its presence also in other bursts . \n one of the most striking results of the _ fermi _ satellite is the discovery of multiple components in the spectrum of grbs . \n bright bursts , where the signal - to - noise ratio is highest , show statistically significant deviations from a simple band function @xcite . \n one component commonly found is a power - law extending to high energies ( e.g. , grb 080916c ) . \n however , a few bursts also show features at lower energies ( @xmath2 kev ) , which are well - fit by a planck function . \n perhaps the strongest such example is grb110721a , where the significance of the extra component was greater than @xmath3 @xcite .    , \n width=321 ]    the results found with _ fermi _ match those previously seen in batse data . \n @xcite found that a model comprising a blackbody and a power - law provided a good fit to several grb spectra observed by batse . \n the power - law index was greater than -2 , so it was clear that there had to be a turn - over at higher energies . with the much broader energy range afforded by _ \n , the power - law seen in the batse data is revealed as the low - energy slope of the band component . it should be noted that also _ \n fermi _ has detected a power - law component in the spectra ; however , this feature is seen in addition the the band component , and the temporal behavior is very different . its origin is not yet understood , but may be related to the mechanism producing the temporally extended gev emission @xcite . \n another feature which strengthens the common origin of the blackbody components in batse and _ fermi _ spectra is their temporal evolution . \n the batse components showed a typical behavior where the temperature decayed with time as a broken power - law . \n this distinctive feature is also seen in the _ fermi _ data . \n the additional blackbody component detected is typically subdominant , in general contributing only 5 - 10% of the total flux . for this reason \n , its presence can only be firmly seen in very bright grbs . however , it may still be present in many more grbs , and this can have important consequences . \n when spectra are fit with models comprising a blackbody in addition to the main band component , the parameters of the band component change . \n this means that although a photospheric component may not be statistically detected , its presence can have a large impact on the interpretation of the bulk of the emission . \n for instance , the peak of the band component will shift to higher energies , and the measured value of the low - energy slope , @xmath4 , will soften @xcite . \n an example of this is shown in figure  [ peakshift ] , where the spectrum of grb120323 is fit with and without an additional blackbody component . \n the changed parameters may lead to the band component being more compatible with synchrotron emission , and thus change the theoretical interpretation also of the main emission component .    ]    as thermal emission is a well - known physical process , identifying such a component allows physical parameters of the outflow to be derived @xcite . \n these include the bulk lorentz factor , jet - launching radius and saturation radius . \n for instance , studies of grb110721a have found that the lorentz factor was initially around 1000 , then decreased throughout the pulse to values @xmath5 @xcite . \n the jet launching radius was instead found to increase from @xmath6 cm to @xmath7 cm @xcite . \n in the case of `` typical '' single - component grb spectra , it is generally assumed that a single process is giving rise to the emission . for spectra \n well - fit by a single or multi - temperature blackbody , the most likely candidate is photospheric emission .    for the multi - component grbs , \n the interpretation is less straight - forward . \n a natural first assumption is to connect the two components to different emission regions . \n the blackbody component is then attributed to thermal emission arising from the photosphere , and the band component related with non - thermal radiation further out in the jet . \n there are many different possible realizations of the scenario . \n for instance , the location of the photospheric radius in relation to the saturation radius will affect the strength of the blackbody and different magnetizations of the outflow will change the ratio between the two components @xcite .    as mentioned above , identifying a blackbody component in the spectrum can alleviate some of the difficulties facing interpretations suggesting a synchrotron origin for the band component . \n many observed grbs have hard spectra below their @xmath8 peaks . \n those with indices @xmath9 below this peak can not possess electrons that radiate synchrotron emission in the expected fast cooling regime , within this spectral window ; this is the so - called fast - cooling @xmath4 index limit @xcite . \n models including a low - energy blackbody component allow for softer slopes of the band component , thereby making the interpretation more compatible with synchrotron . \n spectra with hard @xmath4 slopes are however not the only issue facing synchrotron interpretations . studying the widths of spectra \n , it can be seen that most are too narrow to accommodate synchrotron emission from realistic electron distributions @xcite . \n this is shown in fig . \n [ widths ] . in these cases adding a blackbody component will not help , but rather worsen the issue ; the width of the band function component in a composite spectrum is if anything more narrow than the entire spectrum .    , \n width=321 ]    an alternative to multiple emission zones is that the entire spectrum arises from the photosphere . \n this of course requires a radical departure from the framework where photospheric emission is described by a ( single or multicolor ) blackbody . \n one suggested way of altering the spectrum is subphotospheric emission . in brief , in this scenario energy is dissipated below the photosphere , modifying the emergent spectrum . \n different models propose different origins , such as magnetic reconnection @xcite , internal shocks @xcite or collisional dissipation @xcite . by varying the amount of dissipation and parameters of the outflow \n , it is possible to produce a wide range of spectral shapes by such subphotospheric energy release @xcite .    as described by @xcite \n , geometrical effects will broaden the spectrum . considering relativistic limb darkening \n , @xcite used a combination of analytical model and monte carlo simulation to study the emergent spectrum from a jet . \n it was found that for a narrow jet , with opening angle is of the order of the relativistic beaming angle , a broadening of the photospheric spectrum is expected for any viewing angle . for a broader jet , \n the broadening effect is strong only if the viewing angle lies along the edge of the outflow , i.e. , is close to the jet angle . \n apart from increasing signal to noise in spectra , is there any way to distinguish between these scenarios ? \n recently , polarimetry has become the focus of attention , and does provide valuable extra information . in the case of non - thermal emission , synchrotron radiation is expected to have high degrees of polarization . yet also \n photospheric emission can be polarized , though polarization degrees @xmath10% are expected @xcite . predictions of correlations between spectra and polarization may thus allow us to determine the physics behind the prompt phase emission . \n unfortunately , there are at present very few reliable measurements of polarization in grbs . \n photospheric emission has been detected in a growing number of grbs , with planckian components appearing together with other components , or dominating the spectrum . \n this shows that the photosphere plays a part in the formation of the spectra . \n most grb spectra do not look thermal , and many instead having multiple components . \n this can be interpreted as radiation from two separate emission regions , or as pure photospheric emission . \n understanding the role of the photosphere is thus important to probe the physics of the outflow itself . \n polarimetry provides a possible way to determine the contribution of the photosphere . \n there are today several proposed missions capable of measuring polarization in grbs , which promises new insight into the physics of the relativistic jet . \n the _ fermi_-lat collaboration acknowledges support for lat development , operation and data analysis from nasa and doe ( united states ) ; cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs ( france ) ; asi and infn ( italy ) ; mext , kek , and jaxa ( japan ) ; and the k.a . \n wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board ( sweden ) . \n science analysis support in the operations phase from inaf ( italy ) and cnes ( france ) is also gratefully acknowledged . \n g. cavallo & m. j. rees 1978 , mnras,183 , 359 m. j. rees & p. mszros 1994 , apj , 430 , l93 b. paczyski 1986 , apj , 308 , l43 j. goodman 1986 , apj , 308 , l47 f. ryde 2004 , apj , 614 , 827 d. lazzati et al . \n 2010 , apj , 725 , 1137 i. vurm et al . \n 2011 , apj , 738 , 77 d. giannios 2011 , arxiv:1111.4258 b .- b . \n zhang et al . 2011 , apj , 730 , 141 g. ghirlanda et al . \n 2003 , a&a , 406 , 879 g. ghirlanda et al . \n 2013 , mnras , 432 , 3237 j. larsson et al . \n 2015 , apj , submitted . \n f. ryde et al . \n 2010 , apj , 709 , l172 m. ackermann et al . \n 2013 , apjs , 209 , 1 m. axelsson et al . \n 2012 , apj , 757 , l31 s. guiriec et al . \n 2013 , apj , 770 , 32 f. ryde & a. peer 2009 , apj , 702 , 1211 s. iyyani et al . \n 2013 , mnras , 433 , 2739 r. hascot et al . 2013 , a&a , 551 , 124 r. preece et al . \n 1998 , apj , 506 , 23 m. axelsson & l. borgonovo 2015 , mnras , 447 , 3150 d. giannios  2008 , a&a , 480 , 305 k. ioka  2010 , progr . \n phys . , 124 \n , 667 a. beloborodov  2010 , mnras , 407 , 1033 a. peer et al . \n 2006 , apj , 642 , 995 t. nymark et al . \n 2011 , arxiv:1111.0308 c. lundman et al . \n 2013 , mnras , 428 , 2430 c. lundman et al . \n 2014 , mnras , 440 , 3292", "StartTimeOffset": 434060373295, "RequestID": "2d4afb99c3f14168a46f4096a23ce36e", "TotalTokens": 3965}

{"ContextTokens": 3829, "GeneratedTokens": 83, "SynthesizedBody": "the interest to electric dipole moments ( edm ) of elementary particles and more complex systems like nuclei and atoms exists since 1950 , when it was first suggested that there was no experimental evidence for symmetry of nuclear forces under parity transformation  @xcite . \n the interest was renewed after 1964 when it was discovered that the invariance under cp transformation , which combines charge conjugation with parity , is violated in @xmath2-meson decays . \n this provided a new incentive for edm searches . since the combined cpt transformation is expected to leave a system invariant , breakdown of cp invariance should be accompanied by t violation . \n thus , there is a reason to expect that p and t violating edms should exist at some level .    the experimental upper limit on the neutron edm is @xcite @xmath3 the measured value for the proton edm is @xcite @xmath4 and is compatible with zero . \n this corresponds to an upper limit which is three order of magnitude weaker than the one for the neutron . \n the best upper limit on edm ever obtained was in an atomic experiment with @xmath0hg  @xcite . \n the result for the dipole moment of this atom is @xmath5 unfortunately , the implications of this result are somewhat less impressive , due to the electrostatic screening of the nuclear edm in this essentially coulomb system . \n the point is that in a stationary state of such a system , the total electric field acting on each particle must vanish . \n thus , an internal rearrangement of the system s constituents gives rise to an internal field @xmath6 that exactly cancels @xmath7 at each charged particle ; the external field is effectively switched off , and an edm feels nothing @xcite . \n still , some p and t odd component of the electrostatic potential survives due to final nuclear size . \n it is created by the next moment in the nuclear electric dipole density distribution . \n this is the schiff moment defined as @xcite @xmath8 the schiff moment generates a p and t odd electrostatic potential in the form @xmath9 interaction of atomic electrons with the potential given by eq . \n ( [ 2 ] ) produces an atomic dipole moment @xmath10 because of the contact origin of the potential , only the electrons in @xmath11 and @xmath12 atomic orbitals contribute to the dipole moment given by eq . \n ( [ 3 ] ) . \n the eq.([1 ] ) is valid for any system of point - like charges @xmath13 . \n let us split the sum in eq.([1 ] ) into the sum over coordinates of nucleons and the sum over coordinates of charges inside the nucleons : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a nucleon position and @xmath16 is the position of the @xmath17th charge inside the nucleon . \n combining the terms of the zeroth and first order in @xmath18 and using @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we obtain an expression for the schiff moment as a sum of two terms . \n the first of them is similar to ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 for a proton and zero for a neutron . \n the mean value of this operator is nonzero only in the presence of the parity- and time - invariance violating nucleon - nucleon interaction    the second term in the operator ( [ 1.1 ] ) is related to the internal dipole moments of the nucleons @xmath24    the previous calculations of the schiff moment of a heavy nucleus @xcite were performed in a simplified manner , without taking into account the residual interaction between a valence nucleon and the core nucleons . \n only recently more microscopic studies of the schiff moment of @xmath0hg @xcite and @xmath25ra @xcite appeared where effects of the core polarization with the effective forces for @xmath0hg and the octupole deformation for @xmath25ra based on skyrm - hartree - fock method were discussed . in this work \n we would like to concentrate on the nucleon edm contribution to the schiff moment of the @xmath0hg nucleus . in the picture of independent particle model only an edm of a valence nucleon \n contributes to the schiff moment . in case of @xmath0hg \n it is a neutron edm . \n however , when a residual quasiparticle interaction between the valence neutron and the protons in the core is taken into consideration , the proton edm contribution to the nuclear schiff moment becomes nonzero . \n we calculated this contribution using a random phase appriximation with effective forces . from the relation between the schiff moment and the electric dipole moment of the hg atom @xcite \n the new upper limit on the proton edm was obtained . \n in our calculations we used full single - particle spectrum including continuum . \n the single - particle basis was obtained using partially self - consistent mean - field potential of @xcite . \n the potential includes four terms . \n the isoscalar term is the standard woods - saxon potential @xmath26 with the parameters @xmath27 mev , @xmath28 fm , and @xmath29 fm . \n two other terms @xmath30 , and @xmath31 were obtained in a self - consistent way using two - body landau - migdal - type interaction of @xcite for the spin - orbit and isovector parts of the potential . \n the last term is the coulomb potential of a uniformly charged sphere with @xmath32 fm . \n the mean field potential obtained in this way produces a good fit for single particle energies and r.m.s . \n radii for nuclei in the region around @xmath33pb . \n the effects of the core polarization for a single particle operator can be treated by introducing a renormalized operator @xmath34 satisfying the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bare schiff moment operator given by ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 1a ] ) or ( [ 1b ] ) . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are single particle occupation numbers and energies . for static moments the external frequency @xmath39 . \n the value of the schiff moment is given by the diagonal matrix element of the z - component of the renormalized operator ( [ 11 ] ) between mean field states of the last unpaired nucleon with a maximal angular momentum projection . \n @xmath40    for the residual interaction @xmath41 we use the phenomenological landau - migdal interaction that has the form @xmath42\\delta({\\bf \n r}_1-{\\bf r}_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath43 300 mev @xmath44 . \n the values of the empirical interaction constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 are crucial for our calculations . \n the proton contribution is proportional to the proton - neutron interaction @xmath47 . \n the constant @xmath46 is determined from magnetic properties of nuclei and positions of gamow - teller resonances . \n its adopted value varies between @xmath48@xmath49 depending on details of the mean field potential used @xcite . \n the constant @xmath45 is not so well defined . \n the magnetic moments and m1 transitions are to large extent isovector and they do not fix @xmath45 . \n an attempt to fix it from the structure of high spin states in @xmath33pb has been done in @xcite . \n they found that @xmath50 had to be used in order to reproduce the excitation energies of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states . \n another value @xmath53 was quoted in the review paper @xcite . \n the schiff moment operator can be presented in coordinate space in the form @xmath54 where we have introduced the set of linear independent tensor operators @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the vector spherical harmonic . \n for @xmath57 we have @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . \n for a spherical nucleus we can separate the angular variables and solve the obtained equations in coordinate space . \n the equations are @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the radial part of the schiff moment operator ( [ 1b ] ) multiplied by @xmath63 . \n the kernel of the integral equation @xmath64 was calculated by means of the green functions of the radial schrdinger equation . \n @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the radial wave functions , and @xmath69 are the occupation numbers .    the solutions of eq

magnitude of the core polarization effects . \n repulsive residual interaction ( [ 15 ] ) leads to not very significant decrease of the mean value of the schiff moment . \n figure 2 shows the radial dependence of the proton contributions induced by the core polarization . \n note 1 order of magnitude difference in the scales in fig . 1 and 2 . the full curve in fig . \n 2 is the radial dependence at the first operator @xmath73 and the dashed curve is the radial dependence at the second operator @xmath74 . \n @xmath75 changes sign inside the nucleus , therefore its mean value is smaller than the mean value of @xmath72 which is mostly negative inside the nucleus . \n the value of the schiff moment of @xmath0hg can be presented as a sum of proton and neutron contributions @xmath76 in table i we list the values @xmath77 and @xmath78 calculated for different combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .       from table [ tabr ] \n one can see that the uncertainties in @xmath77 and @xmath78 due to uncertainties in @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath79 the main contribution to @xmath77 and @xmath78 comes from the second term in eq . \n ( [ 1b ] ) . \n the contribution of the first term is only -0.7 @xmath80 in @xmath78 and 0.006 @xmath80 in @xmath77 . \n the constraint for the schiff moment of mercury nucleus from the experiment @xcite can be obtained using the results of ref . \n they calculated edm of an atom created by the nuclear schiff moment . \n for @xmath0hg they found @xmath81.\\ ] ] from eq.([exp ] ) we obtain the following upper bound for the schiff moment @xmath82 from eq . \n ( [ sm ] ) we can give the following constraints for edm of nucleons : @xmath83 the constraint for the neutron edm is worse than the existing result @xmath84 @xcite , therefore , we shall not discuss it below . for proton edm the estimate ( [ an1 ] ) \n is 1 order of magnitude lower than the existing experiment @xmath85 e cm @xcite . in these circumstances \n the question about a real theoretical accuracy of our approach becomes important . \n it is clear that the value @xmath86 cited in eq.([spsn ] ) does not reflects the real accuracy of the theory . \n it just came from the difference in adopted values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \n the theoretical uncertainty appears from two sources . \n first , it is an uncertainty in the atomic calculations that couple the nuclear schiff moment and edm of an atom . \n we shall not discuss it here referring to the work @xcite . \n second , it is an uncertainty in calculations of the core polarization effects using rpa with effective forces . \n the latter can be estimated from the following considerations . using rpa with the effective forces we can fit different nuclear moments in one nucleus . \n then , in neighbor nuclei the calculated moments will differ from the data . \n this difference can be regarded as an uncertainty in the theory . in our experience \n this difference is of the order of 20% on the average , reaching sometimes the value of 30% @xcite . to be safe , \n we can adopt a conservative 30% uncertainty in calculations of @xmath77 . \n therefore , instead of ( [ spsn ] ) we would prefer to write for @xmath77 @xmath87 since the error in ( [ sp ] ) is not statistical , we can not give a probability distribution for @xmath77 . \n if one takes @xmath88 as a minimal value of @xmath77 , then it gives the following value for the proton edm upper bound @xmath89    in summary , we calculated the contributions of the proton and neutron edm to the schiff moment of @xmath0hg . \n the effects of core polarization were accounted for in the scope of rpa with the effective residual forces . \n a new upper bound of the proton edm has been obtained from the upper bound on the atomic edm

* ? ? ? * ) on spitzer @xcite to obtain high resolution spectroscopy of some positions in the outflow of the red rectangle . \n the observed regions in the outflow are about 30@xmath3 away from the central source , to avoid saturation by the central binary and its direct environment . here \n we report the first results obtained with the short high ( sh ) module of the irs in two lines - of - sight in the nebula ; a full description of the spitzer data will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( markwick - kemper et al . \n _ in prep . \n the first slit position probes the region just outside the biconical x , while the second one probes inside the biconical region ( fig . \n [ fig : slitpos ] ) . \n the coordinates of these slit positions are @xmath4 = 6@xmath519@xmath659.94@xmath7 , @xmath8 = @xmath910@xmath1037@xmath1156.0@xmath3 ( j2000 ) and @xmath4 = 6@xmath519@xmath659.18@xmath7 , @xmath8 = @xmath910@xmath1037@xmath1150.5@xmath3 ( j2000 ) , respectively . at both these positions we observed 2 cycles of 30 seconds . \n the sh module covers the 10.019.5 @xmath0 m wavelength range , with a spectral resolution of @xmath12 . \n the spectra were reduced using the smart package @xcite . \n we performed our data reduction on the products of pipeline version s9.5 . \n we worked with the _ droopres _ images , which is the least processed product available to the observer . \n the last few processing steps of the pipeline were repeated off - line and adjusted to the needs of our observations : first , we divided the _ droopres _ \n images by the flatfields , to get the equivalent of the basic calibrated dataproduct ( bcd ) . \n we applied s10.0 flatfields , which yielded less noisy results , to the s9.5 _ droopres _ data ; while no s10.0 _ droopres _ data were distributed to the observers . \n subsequently , full aperture extraction using smart was performed on these images , using the flux conversion and other calibration files provided by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) . \n bad pixels were removed by hand . finally , where the orders were overlapping in wavelength coverage we cut off the band edges according to the order optimalization provided by the ssc . \n in addition to the full aperture extraction , our data was sufficiently complex that performing sub - aperture extraction was necessary . \n this mode of extraction is not offered for the high - resolution modules in the standard smart version , however , modified the full - aperture extraction routine to extract a specified fraction of the aperture and produce a spectrum of the flux for that sub - aperture . \n we approximated the size of the two high resolution slits as five pixel widths in the spatial direction by two pixel widths in the dispersion direction . \n we then extracted five sub - apertures of an entire column in the dispersion direction with a width of one pixels in the spatial direction . \n the sum of the five sub - apertures is equal to the original full aperture extraction .    currently the irs data calibration is optimized for point sources , and little attention has been given so far to the extraction of spectra from extended sources . \n several problems arise when extended source calibration is attempted . \n first , no extended source flux conversion tables are available at this time . \n using the flux conversion tables for point sources affects the absolute flux levels to some extent , although we expect the relative flux levels to be reasonably accurate . \n second , it is not possible to use the measurements of the standards stars to calibrate the flux levels of extended sources , since it will cause fringing . \n a two - dimensional spectral response function is necessary to overcome this problem , but is not currently available . \n finally , geometric effects should be taken into account , since the slit projection on the detectors covers only 2@xmath135 pixels , and the point spread function is  depending on wavelength  about 3 pixels large , comparable in size to both the individual pixels as well as the entire slit . @xcite \n discuss the wavelength dependence of the point spread function , causing an additional slope in the spectra . \n for the high - resolution modules , the tilt of the slit with respect to the detector combined with the small number of pixels in the slit causes additional low - frequency fringing in the spectra . while the first geometric effect may be easily corrected , the second effect is fundamentally uncorrectable , since the spatial distribution of photons on a pixel is unknown . \n [ fig : full ] shows the full aperture extracted spectra of the two lines - of - sight of interest , inside and outside the biconical region . \n the observed variation in spectral features between the two positions is very large , and variations occur even on the scale of the pixel size . in fig . \n [ fig : sub ] , we show how the spectra change within both apertures , by extracting 3 pixel wide sub - aperture spectra while stepping along the slit one pixel at a time . \n it is straightforward to identify the features shortward of 13 @xmath0 m present in all lines - of - sight with the out - of - plane bending modes of the polycyclic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; e.g.   * ? ? ? \n * ) , but these features are dwarfed by the spectral features detected at wavelengths longer than 13 @xmath0 m . \n these new resonances show some interesting and unique characteristics . \n first of all , the bands are very broad ( several microns ) and are very strong with respect to the dust continuum . \n moreover , there is not a single set of well defined wavelengths at which these resonances occur , but instead the peak positions seem to vary spatially \n .    interestingly , inspection of the iso sws spectroscopy shows no evidence for the presence of the newly detected features , perhaps because in iso s large beam many lines - of - sight are averaged , and individual contributions at various wavelengths gets averaged out to a broad , shallow plateau , or alternatively , the carrier of these features may only be present in detectable amounts at considerable distance from the disk , a region not probed by iso s line - of - sight ( fig . \n [ fig : slitpos ] ) .    here we will explore possible carriers for the new features . \n although the outflow shows strong pah emission at 11.2 @xmath0 m even at this large distance from the central star , we can rule out pahs as the main carrier . \n emission from pahs in the 13 - 20 @xmath0 m wavelength range is known and is also variable @xcite . \n pah emission from 1520 @xmath0 m varies from a very broad plateau that perhaps can be disentangled into a number of completely separate resonances in the 1520 @xmath0 m range @xcite , which do not vary in peak position . \n although these pah bands fall in the correct wavelength range , they are much weaker than the 11.2 @xmath0 m pah band @xcite , and their fwhms do not match . \n the low intensities and the fixed wavelengths at which the components of the pah plateau are found , we rule out pahs as a significant contributor to the resonances observed .      the extreme breadth of the resonances observed in the 1320 @xmath0 m range is characteristic for solid state carriers , and the shift in the peak positions can be explained by variations in the temperature , composition , grain shape , grain size or lattice structure . \n the strong feature - to - continuum ratio dictates that the carrier has clean resonances without a strong continuum component , while the breadth implies an amorphous structure . moreover , the opacities in the uv and optical need to be high enough so that the grains heat to sufficiently high temperatures , while the band strength in the material needs to be strong enough so that the amount of dust required to explain the feature does not violate abundance constraints . \n although it is believed that the outflows of the red rectangle are dominated by carbon - rich components , the features from 1320 @xmath0 m show this picture is incomplete . \n simple mg - fe - oxides are a possible carrier for these new features . in fig . \n [ fig : sub ] the spectra from the region outside the biconical outflow are compared to a few mg - fe - oxide minerals calculated from optical properties measured by @xcite . \n indeed , peak strength and width are easily fitted , while the peak position suggests that a composition slightly more mg - rich than mg@xmath14fe@xmath15o is likely . \n the situation inside the biconical region seems quite different . \n there are two clear differences ; a distinct band centered near 15 @xmath0 m and a strong rise starting near 17 @xmath0 m . \n interestingly , features of both bands , such as peak position and onset of the rise , shift as a function of position in the slit , and the shift seems correlated . \n this is consistent with a changing fe - content in a relatively fe - rich oxide . using the correlation between composition and peak position for spherical grains ( fig . \n [ fig : fetrend ] ) it is possible to constrain more precisely the compositions of the oxides . \n we find that the oxides inside the biconical region have an fe - content mg@xmath16fe@xmath17o , while the oxides outside the biconical region have a more mg - rich composition of mg@xmath18fe@xmath19o . \n taking the mg - fe oxides as an example , we determine that oxide grains with a grain size of 0.1 @xmath0 m heat up to about 75 k at 30@xmath3 of the central star , using @xmath20 , @xmath21 k , @xmath22 pc @xcite and assuming no extinction toward the central star . to account for the observed flux levels in the features a dust mass of @xmath23 in the form of mg - fe - oxides \n is required in the aperture of each of the slit positions , an amount which seems large . \n the distance of 710 pc derived by @xcite might be an overestimation ( see e.g.   * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , which would affect the derived dust masses considerably . for a distance of 500 pc for instance , the dust can be heated to 150 k at 30@xmath3 , and an oxide mass of only @xmath24 g , which is comparable to the mass of our moon , is needed in each aperture to account for the observed emission features . \n the strong feature at 1317 @xmath0 m remains unidentified . \n however , because the peak position shifts with the change in onset of the feature longward of 17 @xmath0 m we conclude that the two carriers are related , and that perhaps the 1317 @xmath0 m feature is caused by a mixture of mg - fe - oxides with another material . \n a good candidate are spinels ( mgal@xmath25o@xmath26 ) , which have features in this wavelength range @xcite . \n their uv / optical opacity is too low to provide enough grain heating to explain the observed flux levels on their own , but when they are in thermal contact with oxides , the spinels may get warm enough to explain the observed flux level , while the changing fe - content still explains the shift in peak position . \n the detection of new mid - infrared features in the bipolar outflow of hd 44179 is surprising . \n these features are carried by oxygen - rich minerals , possibly including simple mg - fe - oxides . \n previously it was argued that the nature of the chemistry in these outflows is carbon - rich , while the dust in the circumbinary disk is oxygen - rich @xcite . \n independently obtained spatially resolved ground - based observations of the pah features in the infrared support this view ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n our work , along with the recent suggestion of small pahs in the circumbinary disk @xcite , indicate that the chemical distribution to the red rectangle may be more complicated than previously thought ; both the disk and the outflow are not strictly oxygen - rich or carbon - rich , and apparently mixed chemistry environments occur in both components of the system . \n there are clearly different episodes in mass ejection @xcite and these may be connected to changes in the chemical composition . \n the origin of the oxygen - rich dust in the outflow of hd 44179 remains speculative at best . \n it is possible that the oxides found in the outflow are remnants of an earlier , circumstellar mass loss phase , which is currently being overtaken by the bipolar outflow . \n simple oxides are found in the low density winds of semi - regular variables and early type miras @xcite , likely progenitors of a system like the red rectangle . \n these stars are known to develop a outflow velocity which is significantly lower than what is seen in later stages of the mass loss phase ( e.g.   * ? ? ? \n an alternate explanation is that the oxygen - rich dust found in the bipolar outflow originate from the circumbinary disk . \n interaction between the stellar wind and the disk may have eroded the disk and the wind may have dragged some of the disk material along in the collimated outflow directions . in this interaction , \n the oxygen - rich dust grains from the disk ( predominantly silicates ; * ? ? ? \n * ) may have partially or completely evaporated , and recondensed high above the disk . \n when recondensation occurs , the density will have dropped considerably , and the formation of significant amounts of anything beyond the simplest condensates may have been difficult , which could explain why the oxides are dominating the spectroscopy .    of course , whether mg - fe - oxides are indeed the carriers of these newly discovered oxygen - rich dust features remains to be seen , and further studies of the spectral appearance and spatial distribution of these features is required to further establish the nature of the dust . \n fmk is grateful for her time spent at ucla as a spitzer fellow , working with mike jura . \n his detailed knowledge of the red rectangle and his insightful comments were of crucial importance to this project . \n we also thank lou allamandola for sharing his thoughts on the origin of the spectral features discussed in this paper . \n we thank dan watson and ben sargent for aiding in developing irs data reduction tools , jan cami for careful reading of the manuscript and hans van winckel for making available the hst wfpc2 image of the red rectangle . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through the spitzer fellowship program , under award 011 808 - 001 ;

standard interactions , which can be made by using the ratio [ ratio : bdbs ] r. referring to , it is important to note that the suppression of @xmath6 in the sm is largely due to the ratio of the ckm elements . \n this dependence on the ckm factors allegedly pertains to all models in which the quark mixing matrix is the only source of flavour violation . \n it is therefore interesting to ask if @xmath6 could be of the order unity in some non - standard models where flavour violation is governed exclusively by the ckm matrix . \n working in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a large ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath8 ( ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ) , we show that such a scenario does exist , and study its consequences for the @xmath5 branching ratios . \n the outline is as follows . \n first , in , we define modified minimal flavour violation ( @xmath4 ) and discuss briefly three distinct scenarios within the mssm . \n second , the effective hamiltonian describing the decays @xmath5 in the presence of non - sm interactions is given in . \n furthermore , in , numerical results for the branching fractions @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath6 are presented . \n finally , we summarize and conclude . \n there exists no unique definition of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) in the literature ( see , e.g. , ) . \n the common feature of these mfv definitions is that flavour violation and/or flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are entirely governed by the ckm matrix . on the other hand , \n they differ , for example , by the following additional assumptions : i ) there are no new operators present , in addition to those of the sm , ii ) fcnc processes are proportional to the same combination of ckm elements as in the sm @xcite or iii ) flavour transitions occur only in charged currents at tree level . while these ad hoc assumptions are useful for certain considerations , such as the construction of the universal unitarity triangle @xcite , they can not be justified by symmetry arguments on the level of the lagrangian . \n for example , the number of operators with a certain dimension is always fixed by the symmetry of the low - energy effective theory .  whether the wilson coefficients are negligible or not , depends crucially on the model considered and on the part of the parameter space . \n furthermore , the requirement that fcnc processes are proportional to the same combination of ckm elements as in the sm fails , for example , in the mssm and can be retained only after further simplifying assumptions . the last statement in iii ) is of pure phenomenological relevance in order to avoid huge contributions to fcnc processes . \n using symmetry arguments , we propose an approach that relies only on the key ingredient of the mfv definitions in , without considering the above mentioned additional assumptions i)iii ) . \n we call an extension of the sm a modified minimal flavour - violating ( @xmath4 ) model if and only if fcnc processes or flavour violation are entirely ruled by the ckm matrix ; that is , we require that fcnc processes vanish to all orders in perturbation theory in the limit @xmath22 . for a motivation of this definition using symmetry arguments \n we refer the reader to . \n as will become clear , the advantage of @xmath4 is that it is less restrictive than mfv , while the ckm matrix remains the only source of fcnc transitions . \n our definition of @xmath4 is manifest basis independent . \n however , in order to find a useful classification of different @xmath4 scenarios within the mssm , we will work in the super - ckm basis . \n in this basis the quark mass matrices are diagonal , and both quarks and squarks are rotated simultaneously . \n the scalar quark mass - squared matrices in this basis have the structure [ squark : mass ] _ \n u^2 = (    cc ^2_u_ll & ^2_u_lr + ^2_u_lr & ^2_u_rr    ) , _ \n d^2 = (    cc ^2_d_ll & ^2_d_lr + ^2_d_lr & ^2_d_rr    ) , where the @xmath23 submatrices are given in @xcite . here \n we present the two important entries only : @xmath24 @xmath25 because of su(2 ) gauge invariance , the mass matrix @xmath26 is intimately connected to @xmath27 via [ su2 ] = ^ , which is important for our subsequent discussion . \n the above given definition of @xmath4 requires that the soft susy trilinear couplings @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the soft susy breaking squark masses @xmath30 , @xmath31 are diagonal .    taking into account the relation in , \n one encounters three cases of @xmath4 . \n * scenario ( a ) : * + @xmath27 is proportional to the unit matrix , and so @xmath32 .  as a result , there are no gluino and neutralino contributions to flavour - changing transitions at one - loop level . \n this scenario of @xmath4 coincides with the mfv scenario at low @xmath8 as defined in refs . . \n * scenario ( b ) : * + @xmath33 is diagonal but not proportional to the unit matrix and , in consequence , @xmath27 has non - diagonal entries . \n in such a case , there are again no gluino and neutralino contributions to flavour - changing one - loop transitions involving only external down - type quarks and leptons . \n however , additional chargino contributions show up , due to non -

{"ContextTokens": 3284, "GeneratedTokens": 258, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , there has been a great deal of activity on attempts of using grbs as cosmological probes  @xcite . in the original proposal  @xcite , it has been suggested that the magnitude versus redshift plot could be extended to redshifts up to @xmath2 , via correlations found between the isotropic equivalent luminosity , @xmath3 , and two grb observables , namely the time lag ( @xmath4 )  @xcite and variability ( @xmath5 )  @xcite . \n the isotropic equivalent luminosity is the inferred luminosity ( energy emitted per unit of time ) of a grb if all its energy is radiated isotropically , the time lag measures the time offset between high- and low - energy arriving grb photons , while the variability is a measure of the complexity of the grb light curve . using these correlations , one can infer two estimates of the absolute isotropic equivalent luminosity , which are combined through a weighted average . knowing the absolute isotropic equivalent luminosity together with the observed fluence yields an estimate of the luminosity distance to the grb .    unfortunately , these correlations are affected by a large statistical ( or intrinsic ) scatter . \n this statistical spread affects not only the cosmological precision via its direct statistical contribution to the distance modulus uncertainty , @xmath6 , but also through the calibration uncertainty given that the suitable grb sample with known redshift is rather small . in what follows \n we show that a relatively small sample of grbs with low redshifts is sufficient to greatly reduce the systematic uncertainty thanks to a more robust and precise calibration . \n more recently , a new correlation has been suggested  @xcite , which is subjected to a much smaller statistical scatter . \n the so - called ghirlanda relation is a correlation between the peak energy of the gamma - ray spectrum , @xmath7 ( in the @xmath8 plot ) , and the collimation - corrected energy emitted in gamma - rays , @xmath9 . \n this collimation - corrected energy is a measure of the energy released by a grb taking into account that it is beamed into a narrow jet . \n unlike the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations , the ghirlanda relation is not affected by large statistical uncertainties , however , it depends on poorly constrained quantities related to the properties of the medium around the burst . indeed , to infer @xmath9 one must estimate the angular opening of the jet , which can be performed assuming a density profile for the medium around the burst ( or circum - burst medium for short ) , where a fraction @xmath12 of the fireball kinetic energy is emitted in the prompt gamma - ray phase , and where one has measured the jet break time , @xmath13 @xcite . \n assuming that the circum - burst medium has a constant density , the simplest possible assumption , requires one additional parameter . \n this constant density has been measured for a few bursts  @xcite , and it exhibits a wide variation from burst to burst . \n another difficulty involving grbs is that they tend to occur at rather large distances , which makes it impossible to calibrate any relationship between the relevant variables in a way that is independent from the cosmological model . \n the method that is usually employed consist in fitting both , the cosmological _ and _ the calibration parameters , and then use statistical techniques to remove the undesired parameters . in here , we follow a different procedure @xcite . \n we consider that the luminosity distance for @xmath14 was previously measured using type ia supernovae , and divide the grbs sample in two sets ; the low redshift sample , with @xmath14 , and the high redshift one , with @xmath15 . \n since the luminosity distance of grbs in the range @xmath14 is already known , one can calibrate the luminosity estimators independently of the cosmological parameters and use the high redshift sample as a probe to dark energy and dark matter models . \n this method also allows us to verify whether the larger redshift range probed by grbs can compensate for the larger uncertainty associated with the distance estimates thus obtained . \n we have analyzed the use of these correlations in order to study of gcg , a model that unifies the dark energy and dark matter in a single fluid @xcite through the equation of state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are positive constants . \n the case @xmath19 describes the the chaplygin gas , that arises in different theoretical scenarios . \n if the curvature is fixed , there are only two free variables , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , although it is more convenient to use the quantity @xmath20 instead of @xmath17 . \n thus , we consider two free parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath21 . a great deal of effort has been recently devoted to constrain the gcg model parameters  @xcite , which include , for instance , supernovae  @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , gravitational lensing  @xcite and cosmic topology  @xcite . \n in addition to the gcg model , we also study the more conventional flat xcdm model . \n likewise the gcg model , the xcdm model is also described by two free parameters , the dark energy equation of state , @xmath22 , and the fraction of non - relativistic matter , @xmath23 . \n testing these models is particularly relevant since they are degenerate for redshifts @xmath24  @xcite . \n let us describe here the approach based on the correlation between the isotropic luminosity , and the variability and time lag . \n the @xmath10 and @xmath11 correlations are written as @xmath25 the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are found through fitting of these relationships to the data points , that is , via calibration of the luminosity estimators . \n given that the grb sample with measured redshifts is rather small , at present the calibration is rather poor . to test \n what improvements one expects to achieve in the future , we assess the gain in calibrating these relationships with larger samples . \n three mock , yet realistic , samples were generated , using the method detailed in ref . \n @xcite ; these mock data sets were used to calibrate the luminosity estimators .    we find that a calibration performed with @xmath28 grbs greatly improves the previous results , decreasing @xmath6 by close to half , yielding @xmath29 . \n however , by increasing the calibration sample to @xmath30 grbs the resulting improvement is just marginal , suggesting that very large calibration samples are not required . \n it is worth noting that a sample of about @xmath28 grbs may be available in the near future thanks to the _ swift _ satellite . \n we also find that despite the large statistical scatter , due to improvements in calibration , the uncertainty for this estimator becomes quite close to that obtained with the ghirlanda relation , @xmath31 ( c.f . \n however , it is also evident that , due to this large statistical uncertainty , one can not expect to significantly reduce the observational uncertainty of the variability and time lag method beyond about @xmath32 . in a sense , one arrives at a minimum possible uncertainty plateau , beyond which any further improvement seems impossible .    ) and 400 high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) grbs , while the dashed line show the 68% cl constraints for a sample made up of 500 high - redshift grbs only . \n on the left figure , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 relations have been used , while on the right one the ghirlanda relation was employed . \n the degeneracy of the @xmath18 parameter is quite evident.[gcg ] ]    next , we examine how grbs fare when used to constrain both models under consideration . \n the methodology is essentially the same of that used for type ia supernovae @xcite . \n one starts by defining a fiducial cosmological model , described by the parameters @xmath35 , and then use the @xmath36 function , defined as @xmath37 ^ 2~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the dimensionless luminosity distance , to build confidence regions in parameter space . \n the dimensionless luminosity distance of the grbs can be estimated using @xmath10 and @xmath11 . \n somewhat against our expectation , we found that grbs are not very suited to study the gcg model . \n the @xmath21 parameter can be constrained , however no limit can be imposed on @xmath18 , as shown in figure [ gcg ] . \n larger samples of grbs decrease the area of the allowed parameter space , however there is no significant improvement on the constraints imposed on either parameter . we also find that using some low - redshift grbs or the ghirlanda relation does not alter these conclusions significantly . \n the results for the xcdm model are , however , more promising . \n we find that grbs are sensitive essentially to @xmath23 , and very weakly sensitive to @xmath39 . \n the reason for this is the redshift range probed by grbs . \n we have verified that when using a sample that includes 100 grbs with @xmath14 , the constraints on the xcdm model are substantially better , as depicted in fig . \n it should be pointed out that this redshift dependence is not found for the gcg fiducial model . \n these results were found using the minimal @xmath40 . \n this uncertainty is essentially due to the statistical component , and hence it can not be reduced by better calibration or data , only through larger grb samples .    ) and 400 high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) grbs , while the dashed lines show the 68% cl constraints for a sample made up of 500 high - redshift grbs only . on the left figure , \n the @xmath33 and @xmath34 relations have been used , while on the right one the ghirlanda relation was employed . \n we discuss here the use of the ghirlanda relation , which is known to be intrinsically more precise . \n a drawback of this relation is its dependence on more parameters , and on how the circum - burst medium is modeled  @xcite . \n the calibration testing procedure was not repeated , as the main sources of uncertainty in the ghirlanda relation are the poorly constrained values of the peak energy , jet break time and circum - burst density  @xcite .    as before , \n we find that the characteristic feature of grbs of having rather high redshifts , makes them somewhat unsuitable to study dark energy models , even the gcg one . despite the increased precision , the allowed parameter range for the gcg model \n is not greatly improved when one uses the ghirlanda relation . as for the xcdm model \n , one finds that results are better if one uses the ghirlanda relations , but not significantly in what concerns the dark energy component . \n however , this independence on the the nature and amount of the dark energy component means that grbs can provide a estimate of @xmath23 alone , something which is not possible when using type ia supernovae . \n thus , while an improvement in calibration should not greatly alter the above conclusions , it should be noted that data quality and statistics will greatly improve in the future thanks to _ swift _ and _ hete 2 _ experiments . \n thus , as one expects significant improvements on the determinations of the peak energy , jet break time and circum - burst density , it is reasonable to assume that the distance modulus uncertainty for the ghirlanda relation will decrease . \n ]    the main conclusion of our study is that although grbs are poor dark energy probes , for @xmath15 , their luminosity distance is quite sensitive to the dominating energy density component . for the xcdm model , \n this is dark matter , and we find that the amount of dark matter can be remarkably constrained . for the gcg model , on the other hand , it turns out that what arises is a combination of the @xmath21 and @xmath18 parameters , and the data can not lift the degeneracy on @xmath18 . \n actually , if @xmath41 , the hubble function for the gcg becomes @xmath42 and one can easily observe that the allowed parameter region predicted from grbs does follow the line @xmath43 . \n this feature is also encountered in various phenomenological studies of the gcg , the only exception being on data from large scale structure formation  @xcite . \n also , the transition into an accelerated expansion phase in a gcg universe is faster , and at a lower redshift , than for the xcdm model . \n this explains why using some @xmath14 grbs improves the results for the latter model , while it does not have any impact on the former . \n the sensitivity on the non - relativistic matter density in xcdm models means that grbs may have a complementary role to play with respect to type ia supernovae . to test the impact of such a joint use \n , we built joint confidence regions for grbs and type ia supernovae constraints that may be imposed by the _ \n snap _ satellite . \n it was found that grbs may play an important role in the near future if a large grb data set is built before the promised scientific bounty of _ snap _ becomes available ( see figure [ sngrb ] ) . \n however , grbs should only marginally improve the constraints imposed by _ \n snap _ , unless the uncertainty is reduced by at least a factor of two by then . \n it must be realized that these results did not take into account several other systematic sources of error , namely selection and gravitational lensing effects . \n while for a tentative study , such as the one considered in this contribution , these potential sources of uncertainty may be neglected , a more careful assessment must be performed if one aims to impose robust constraints on cosmological models . \n furthermore , it is relevant to point out that the used correlations are purely phenomenological and lack , so far , a theoretical explanation . \n it is interesting that a new correlation has been recently proposed  @xcite which does not require any assumptions with regards to the circum - burst medium or the gamma - ray production efficiency . \n we are currently in the process of assessing the potential of such a relationship and testing whether marginalization methods , such as those used for type ia supernovae , can be advantageously employed  @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 477656326335, "RequestID": "ab28321492ec44929a5beac1abf97171", "TotalTokens": 3542}

{"ContextTokens": 3323, "GeneratedTokens": 210, "SynthesizedBody": "star clusters are commonly used to trace the stellar content and star formation history of their host systems . \n the main limitations to this approach are the finite lifetime of a cluster ( disruption ) and evolutionary fading . from a theoretical point of view \n , the lifetime of a cluster should depend upon its initial mass and the properties of the environment in which it evolves ( ( * ? ? ? \n * spitzer 1958 ) ; ( * ? ? ? \n * baumgardt & makino 2003 ) ) . \n observations have , however , produced _ two _ empirical disruption laws :    * mass dependent disruption ( mdd , ( * ? ? ? \n * boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) ) * mass independent disruption ( mid , ( * ? ? ? * fall , chandar & whitmore 2005 ) )    in the mid model , ` survivors ' are selected on a purely random basis and a constant fraction is destroyed every age dex . \n intriguing as it may be , this model clashes with several principles of cluster dynamics that would need to be revised considerably to accommodate it . in this contribution \n we test cluster dissolution and attempt to disentangle it from incompleteness and the statistical biases that have in the past limited such studies . \n we then compare theory to observations of the m33 cluster system . \n before providing a treatment of an observed data - set , let us try to understand the ` tools of the trade ' , the statistical distributions used to study and characterise the cluster disruption process . to achieve that , we have created an artificial population with a constant cluster formation history ( cfh ) and masses drawn from a power -

bins accentuate the increase of the number of high mass clusters with increasing age . \n this arises because the sample grows with time  a ` size - of - sample ' effect . as the sample increases , \n so does the likelihood of producing a massive cluster .      unlike the top envelope of the age - mass diagram , the line along the bottom of the distribution is not caused by statistics , but the detection limit of our modelled observations . \n as clusters fade with time , this constant limiting flux translates into an increasing limiting mass .    in most of the cases observed cluster samples will be luminosity limited . as the population ages , clusters of higher mass fade below the detection limit \n we have denoted this by a green line , representing the mass of a cluster with @xmath6 ( adapted to the study of m33 that will follow ) at a given age . \n @xmath3  band is normally the limiting filter in observational studies and we emulate the detection limit in this plot .      the lower panel shows the main diagnostic used in the study of cluster disruption . \n the vertical axis gives the number of clusters our imaginary galaxy formed in each log - age bin , normalised to unit time ( in this case one myr ) . \n here we present the input sample as a solid line : a constant cfh gives rise to a flat line . \n this will not , however , be observed , due to the detection limit . \n the green line shows all clusters that lie above the detection limit in each log - age bin and displays the characteristic power - law shape found in all observational studies . \n the interpretation of this plot is far from trivial : this @xmath5 shape means that 90% of the population is lost with each age dex . \n mid interprets this as 90% of clusters dissolving each age dex (  in m33 , ( * ? ? ? \n * sarajedini & mancone 2007 ) ) . in this example \n , however , this is due to detection incompleteness . \n thus , a model has to treat _ fading _ and _ dissolution _ as two separate and concurrent causes of cluster disappearance .      having established the above , we can now perform a simple test for the mass dependence of cluster disruption : cutting the sample according to mass .    in the @xmath4  plot we present two mass cuts as a red and blue line respectively . both cuts \n split the power - law distribution to a composite shape : a flat part , i.e. a constant cluster formation rate , and a power - law decline , due to clusters fading below the detection limit . \n after understanding the caveats inherent in the study of the @xmath4  plot , we can proceed to plot the distribution of an observed cluster sample . \n we obtained the age and mass of a sample of @xmath7 _ bona fide _ clusters in m33 ( spanning the entire surface of the galaxy , an unbiased , _ hst_-selected sample ; ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * sarajedini & mancone 2007 , san roman et  al . \n 2009 ) ) using _ ubvi _  imaging from the local group survey ( ( * ? ? ? \n * massey  et  al .  2006 ) ) . \n the sfr is known to have been constant for @xmath8  gyr in m33 , making it ideal for our study . \n [ fig : obs ] presents the age distribution of the magnitude -

law for a magnitude - limited sample . \n crucially , as predicted by the models of fig . \n [ fig : theory ] ( left ) , taking a mass cut produces a composite structure , with a flat initial part and a power - law decline at older ages . \n this demonstrates that an observed sample needs to be interpreted as the result of fading and dissolution at different timescales . \n we have argued so far that the observed @xmath4   plot will show a combination of disruption and fading . \n the right hand side panel of fig . \n [ fig : theory ] shows the combined effect of 90% dissolution ( the mid hypothesis ) _ and _ 90% disappearance due to fading . \n this results in a very steep power law decline ( blue line ) that is _ inconsistent _ with the observations of fig . \n [ fig : obs ] . \n this result stands firmly against the mid cluster disruption model and implies the existence of a mass dependence . \n sample incompleteness causes a @xmath5 decline in the observed age distribution of cluster populations . size - of - sample effects and thorough statistical methods can help to interpret the disruption process at play \n the fundamental difference between magnitude- and mass - limited samples can then be used to discover the underlying physics . \n our results from the nearby population of m33 are inconsistent with mass -

s_v , where the kinetic term @xmath3 is given by s_k = dtd^3x n k_ijg^ijklk_kl , @xmath4 is the extrinsic curvature of the spacelike hypersurfaces , @xmath5 a coupling constant with suitable dimensions and g^ijkl=(g^ikg^jl+g^ilg^jk)-g^ijg^kl , is the generalized dewitt metric . \n the potential term can be written as s_v = dtd^3x n v[g_ij , n ] . \n the action is required to be invariant under the subclass of diffeomorphisms that leave the foliation intact , _ \n @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so in principle @xmath8 should include all terms compatible with this symmetry . \n in addition , @xmath8 should contain terms which are at least 6th order in spatial derivatives for the theory to have the desirable uv properties @xcite . \n an unappealing feature of the full theory is that , without any further restrictions or symmetries , @xmath8 will contain a very large number of terms ( and independent couplings ) . \n two restrictions have been considered as the means to limit the proliferation of couplings in the original proposal : _ projectability _ and _ detailed balance_. projectability sums up to the requirement that @xmath9 , whereas detailed balance requires @xmath8 to be derived from a  superpotential \" ( see below ) . \n an important characteristic of the theory is that it propagates not only a spin-2 , but also a spin-0 mode . \n the assumption of projectability , with or without detailed balance @xcite leads to pathologies in the dynamics of the scalar mode , in particular instabilities and strong coupling at low energies @xcite . \n for this reason , here we discuss a version of the theory which satisfies the detailed balance condition without assuming projectability . \n this proceedings contribution is based on ref . \n @xcite , where a more detailed discussion can be found . \n see also ref . \n @xcite for a brief review on the various version of hoava  lifshitz gravity . \n detailed balance prescribes that the potential @xmath8 is derived from a superpotential @xmath10 as follows v = g_ijkl , [ db ] where @xmath11 is the inverse of the dewitt metric @xmath12 . \n once @xmath10 has been chosen the action is fully determined . \n @xmath10 can be a functional of the metric @xmath2 but also of the lapse @xmath0 , and in particular of the combination @xmath13 , if invariance under foliation preserving diffeomorphisms is imposed @xcite . \n furthermore , in order to have a power - counting renormalizable theory one needs at least sixth order spatial derivatives in the action @xcite , thus the superpotential @xmath10 must contain at least third order spatial derivatives . \n then , the most general @xmath10 containing all of the possible terms up to third order spatial derivatives is w=++ , [ w ] where @xmath14 is the gravitational chern - simons term , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 have dimensions of a mass , whereas @xmath19 is a dimensionless coupling . \n the corresponding action is [ faction ] s_h&=&dt d^3x n\\ { k_ijk^ij - k^2+r-2+a^ia_i - r_ijr^ij+ r^2 + & & + - ( a^ia_i)^2+^ijkr_il_j r^l_k + & & + c^ija_ia_j - c_ijc^ij } , where @xmath20 is the cotton  york tensor and = , = ^2(1 - 3)m_4 ^ 2 . \n [ cc ] for @xmath21 , which are the values these parameters have in general relativity , the bare cosmological constant , @xmath22 , is negative @xcite . \n moreover , the magnitude of @xmath22 is directly related to @xmath17 @xcite which is the mass scale at which lorentz - violating effects become manifest as modifications to the dispersion relation . the mildest constraint on the value of @xmath17 , which comes by the fact that the gravitation interaction has been tested down to mm scales , is @xmath23 . \n but depend on the details of how lorentz violations percolate into the matter sector , see _ \n e.g. _  ref . \n thus , the bare cosmological constant is at best 60 orders of magnitude bigger than the observed value \n .    the overall value of the cosmological constant would be the sum of the bare cosmological constant and the contribution from the vacuum energy of matter fields . \n therefore , the size and not the sign of the bare cosmological constant is the main concern here . the contribution of the vacuum energy is not known with any certainty , but one can only hope for a miraculous cancelation if the overall value is to match the observed value . there is no known reason to expect such a cancelation ( see , however , ref . \n in order to highlight that the magnitude of the cosmological constant is the only real concern and that the action constructed here describes a dynamically sensible theory , we will proceed as follows : we will set @xmath24 by fiat ( to simplify the analysis ) and consider perturbations around a flat background . \n we focus in particular to scalar perturbations , as the main concern is the dynamics of the scalar mode . \n thus we have n=1 + , n_i=_i y , g_ij = e^2_ij , and at quadratic order the action becomes [ quad ] s^(2)=dt d^3x \\{^2 + 2(-1)^2-(^2)^2 } , where we have integrating out the nondynamical degrees of freedom @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n the corresponding dispersion relation for the scalar is ^2=(-1)p^2+()^2p^4 . \n [ disp ] then we can conclude that there is a suitable choice of the parameters such that the scalar has positive energy ( the right sign is determined by the sign of the kinetic term of the spin-2 graviton ) , and at the same time is classically stable : 2>>0 . \n the coefficient of the @xmath27 term in eq . \n ( [ disp ] ) is manifestly positive , so there are no short - wavelength instabilities . \n however , the dispersion relation does not contain any sixth order terms . \n this is because the only sixth order term in action ( [ faction ] ) does not contribute to the dynamics of the scalar more . \n the absence of sixth order terms in the dispersion relation poses a threat for renormalizability . \n however , a straightforward resolution is to add to the superpotential @xmath10 fourth order terms , so as to generate sixth ( and eight order terms ) in the action , which would restore the appealing renormalizability properties of the theory . \n the minimal consistent prescription would be to add to @xmath10 all possible fourth order terms that respect invariance under foliation preserving diffeomorphisms , but also impose parity invariance . \n then the terms added would be r^2 , r^r _ , r ^i a_i , r^ija_i a_j , r a_i a^i,(a_i a^i)^2 , ( ^i a_i)^2 , a_i a_j ^i a^j . \n one would be left with 12 free couplings , which is an appreciable improvement with respect to the theory without detailed balance . \n we have put together an action for hoava  lifshitz gravity that satisfies detailed balance without assuming projectability . \n this version appears to lead to sensible dynamics for the scalar mode and be free of other pathologies that plague the projectable version of hoava  lifshitz gravity . \n additionally , it has the appealing renormalizability properties of the most general non - projectable theory , with about an order of magnitude less independent couplings . \n however , imposing detailed balance leads to a large and negative bare cosmological constant . barring a miraculous cancelation with the ( yet to be understood ) vacuum energy contribution to the cosmological constant , \n this is obviously hard to reconcile with low energy gravitational phenomenology . \n an additional caveat in the use of detailed balance is the fact that it is not clear if or why it should be robust against radiative corrections . \n the implementation of detailed balance presented here leads to a consistent theory which is free of pathologies and , therefore , allows to consider this question rigorously . \n 15    hoava p 2009 _ phys . \n _ d * 79 * 084008 visser m 2009 _ phys . \n _ d * 80 * 025011 visser m 2009 arxiv:0912.4757 [ hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3269, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "by now , the inflationary universe @xcite is generally recognized to be a likely scenario that leads to the big bang . \n so far , its predictions of the flatness and the scale - invariant power spectrum of the density perturbation that seeds structure formations are in good agreement with observations @xcite . \n future data will test inflationary predictions to a very high accuracy . \n in fact , there is widespread hope that the enormous growth in scale during inflation may provide a kind of planck scale microscope , allowing us one day to probe stringy and/or brane world effects from precision cosmological measurements @xcite .    in conventional inflationary models , \n the physics lies in the inflaton potential . \n although there are constraints from observations , such as enough number of e - foldings , the amplitude of the density perturbation etc . , there are very few theoretical constraints on the underlying dynamics of the inflaton field . as a result \n , this scalar field potential can take a large variety of shapes . in hybrid inflation \n @xcite or other variations , additional fields and/or parameters are introduced , allowing even more freedom . \n however , the problem in a conventional 4-dimensional theory is the difficulty of finding an appropriate inflaton potential . in general , a potential that yields the correct magnitude of density perturbation and satisfies the slow - roll condition is not well - motivated and requires some fine - tuning . \n generically , such fine - tuning is not preserved by quantum corrections . \n recently , motivated by the idea of brane world @xcite , the brane inflationary scenario@xcite was proposed , where the inflaton is identified with an inter - brane separation : @xmath0 . \n inflation ends when the branes collide , heating the universe that starts the big bang . in this scenario , \n the inflaton potential has a geometric interpretation . \n in particular , higher dimensional gravity ( or more generally , bulk modes or closed string states ) dictates the form of the inflaton potential . \n for example , the inflaton potential may simply be the newton s potential between branes . \n this visualization of the brane dynamics allows one to implement inflation physics pictorially . \n suitable inflaton potentials naturally appear in the brane world scenario , and their forms are robust under quantum corrections . in this paper \n , we demonstrate further this unusual feature of brane inflation . if the fundamental string scale is substantially above a few tev , brane inflation will be a valuable testing ground for the brane world scenario . \n the motion of the branes is dictated by interbrane ( which can be brane - brane , brane - orientifold or brane - antibrane ) forces . moreover , a velocity - dependent term in the potential is present generically . \n so when branes move , this term may become important . \n this velocity - dependent term is calculable in string theory ; the precise values of the parameters that appear in this term depend on the details of the model . \n in fact , one might expect such a velocity - dependent term from the post - newtonian approximation in higher dimensional gravity . in this paper \n , we also examine the impact of such a velocity - dependent force on the slow - roll and the power spectrum of the density perturbation . \n we find that the effect on the tilt of the spectral index of the density perturbations may be small . \n however , such a term is likely to have an observable effect on the ratio of the tensor to scalar perturbations . \n moreover , the scale dependence of the spectral index is also modified . \n therefore , a global analysis of data from various measurements may allow us to distinguish these effects from that of the conventional inflationary scenario . \n our starting part is the effective action @xmath1 for the canonically normalized inflaton @xmath2 of the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective potential . \n the precise form of @xmath5 will be specified later on . \n note that the field @xmath2 in the brane world is related to the separation @xmath6 between the branes by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the string scale . to lowest order @xmath9 . \n there are also higher order corrections to @xmath10 . in the usual inflationary scenario , \n the deviation of @xmath11 from unity is due to quantum effects . \n typically , it takes the form of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a constant and @xmath14 is the coupling constant . here \n , we will consider a different type of contribution to @xmath11 which is motivated by brane world physics ( or higher dimensional gravity ) .    in an expanding universe , @xmath15 , then , @xmath16    for inflation to take place , there is some choice of @xmath2 so that the potential @xmath17 satisfies the slow - roll conditions : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the solution of @xmath171 does not change greatly with the velocity - dependent term , @xmath172 furthermore , @xmath158 and so the velocity - dependent term is also negligible . \n therefore , @xmath173 where @xmath136 . \n the spectrum is tilted to the red . if the lowest non - vanishing contribution to the potential comes from the dipole of a brane - orientifold plane system , @xmath174 which gives a slightly larger red tilt . \n in this paper , we have examined the density perturbation spectrum in the brane inflationary scenario . \n we have also studied the effect of a velocity - dependent potential . \n the form of the inflation potential as well as the velocity - dependent potential is strongly motivated from higher dimensional gravity ( in particular , string theory ) . in the usual four - dimensional inflationary scenario , \n the deviation of @xmath11 from unity is due to quantum effects and is usually small . in brane inflation , however , the velocity - dependent potential can give rise to a significant effect in @xmath11 . \n generically , the effect on the spectral index is comparable with that from the slow - roll parameter @xmath43 ( from eq.([index ] ) ) . \n therefore , in models where @xmath43 is not small , this may be a measurable effect . even though this effect on @xmath46 can be small in a generic model \n , the scale - dependence of @xmath46 has a stronger dependence on the velocity dependent term , as it scales @xmath175 by a factor of @xmath176 ( see eq . \n ( [ ktilt ] ) ) . \n more importantly , the velocity - dependent potential can also modify the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations ( see eq.([t / s ] ) ) . with a global analysis of data from various measurements , \n one should be able to distinguish these effects from those that can be obtained from a conventional inflationary scenario . \n we expect that a few percent deviation of @xmath39 from unity may be measurable . \n it seems that the power spectrum index in a generic inflationary scenario in the brane world has a red tilt of a few percent . \n the velocity dependent potential can further tilt the density perturbation spectrum to the red or to the blue , depending on the specific form of the potential . \n the blue tilt due to the velocity - dependent term does not require extra fields , in contrast to other inflationary models ( _ e.g. _ , hybrid inflation ) . \n the velocity - dependent potential in the brane flationary scenario is similar to that appears in k - inflation @xcite . \n however , unlike k - inflation , in our scenario , inflation is still driven by the static potential . \n the additional velocity dependent term provides modifications of the usual slow - roll inflation . \n furthermore , the kinetic term and the static potential in the brane inflation scenario are related by string theory or by post - newtonian approximation ( see eq.([postnewton ] ) ) . \n potential of the type @xmath177 has been studied in the context of quintessence @xcite . \n it was argued in @xcite that this type of potential appear naturally in supersymmetric theory . \n as we have described , this type of potential is also motivated when we study cosmology involving branes . \n furthermore , the velocity dependent term has a close resemblance to that in k - essence @xcite \n . it would be interesting to explore whether the specific form of k - essence motivated by brane dynamics may offer an explanation for the present accelerating universe . \n the research of g.s . was supported in part by the doe grant fg02 - 95er40893 , the university of pennsylvania school of arts and sciences dean s fund , and the nsf grant phy99 - 07949 . \n the research of s .- h.h.t . was partially supported by the national science foundation . \n g.s . would like to thank the m - theory workshop at itp , santa barbara , and the theory division at cern for support and hospitality during the final stage of this work . \n in this appendix , we derive the equation for the quantum fluctuation @xmath25 in the presence of a non - trivial @xmath11 , and show that at late time , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obey the same differential equation with respect to time . \n we used this fact to derive eq.([gpformula ] ) analogous to the original derivation of @xcite .    to study quantum fluctuations , we split @xmath2 into the classical piece @xmath178 ( which satisfies ( [ eom ] ) ) and the quantum piece @xmath25 : @xmath179 the classical piece is homogeneous , whereas the fluctuations satisfy : @xmath180 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath13 for the classical part of @xmath2 . \n we note that for scales outside the horizon ( hence the gradient term is negligible ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obeys the same time - dependent differential equation . by expanding @xmath25 in fourier modes : @xmath181 \n the equation of motion for @xmath182 is @xmath183 it is convenient to rewrite it in terms of @xmath184 . in the conventional case , @xmath9 , @xmath185 where prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath186 . for de sitter space \n , the solution is @xmath187 which reduces to @xmath188 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 .    in the presence of a velocity - dependent potential , @xmath192 for scales inside the horizon , when the fluctuations are generated \n , the dominant term is still @xmath193 . \n therefore , @xmath194 is still given by the bunch - davies vacuum , @xmath195 hence the quantum fluctuations @xmath182 is still given by the de sitter temperature , @xmath196                        v.f . \n mukhanov , g.v . \n chibisov , jetp lett . \n * 33 * , 532 ( 1981 ) ; sov . \n jetp * 56 * , 258 ( 1982 ) ; + s.w . hawking , \n . lett . * b115 * , 295 ( 1982 ) ; + a.a . \n starobinsky , _ ibid _ , * b117 * , 175 ( 1982 ) ; + j. bardeen , p.j . \n steinhardt , m. turner , phys . rev . * \n d28 * , 679 ( 1983 ) ; + v.f . \n mukhanov , jetp lett . * 41 * , 493 ( 1985 ) . \n m.  bianchi , g.  pradisi and a.  sagnotti , nucl . \n b * 376 * , 365 ( 1992 ) ; + m.  bianchi , nucl . \n b * 528 * , 73 ( 1998 ) ; + z.  kakushadze , g.  shiu and s .- h . \n h.  tye , phys . \n d * 58 * , 086001 ( 1998 ) ; + z.  kakushadze , int . \n j.  mod . \n a * 15 * , 3113 ( 2000 ) . \n e.  witten , jhep * 9802 * , 006 ( 1998 ) . \n g. dvali , phys . lett . * \n b459 * , 489 ( 1999 ) ; + n.  arkani -

{"ContextTokens": 3976, "GeneratedTokens": 105, "SynthesizedBody": "recent analyses of spectroscopic data using modern three dimensional hydrodynamic atmospheric models have suggested that the solar abundance of oxygen and other abundant elements needs to be revised downward ( allende prieto , lambert & asplund 2001 , 2002 ; asplund et al . \n 2004a , b ; melendez 2004 ) . \n asplund et al . \n ( 2004a ) claim that the oxygen abundance should be reduced by a factor of about 1.48 from the earlier estimates of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) . \n the abundances of c , n , ne , ar and other elements are also reduced ( asplund et al . \n 2004b ) . as a result , \n the ratio ( by mass ) of heavy element to hydrogen abundance , @xmath0 , reduces from 0.023 to 0.0165 , which causes the heavy element abundance in the solar envelope to reduce from @xmath1 to 0.0122 . \n this will cause the opacity of solar material to decrease , in turn reducing the depth of the convection zone ( henceforth cz ) in solar models . \n bahcall & pinsonneault ( 2004 ) have constructed a standard solar model using these revised abundances to find that the depth of the cz is indeed reduced significantly making it inconsistent with seismically established value . \n basu & antia ( 2004 ) and bahcall et al . \n ( 2004a , 2005 ) also attempted to study solar models with reduced abundances and found that opacities near the base of the convection zone needs to be increased by 1020% to make them consistent with seismic data . \n turck - chize et al . \n ( 2004 ) also find that solar models constructed using revised heavy element abundances are not consistent with seismic inferences . \n subsequently , asplund et al .  ( \n 2004b ) have revised the abundances of some elements still further . as a result \n , the discrepancy can be expected to be somewhat larger .    since the discrepancy can be attributed to reduced opacities \n , there is a need to examine the opacity calculations . \n recently , seaton & badnell ( 2004 ) and badnell et al . \n ( 2004 ) have carried out independent opacity calculations under the op project . near the base of the solar cz , \n they only find a 2% increase in opacity as compared to opal . \n this is not likely to resolve the discrepancy , but nevertheless , the effect needs to be studied in detail . \n since two completely independent opacity calculations agree very well with each other , it is unlikely that any possible revision in opacity will be large enough to address the discrepancy caused by the downward revision of solar abundances . nevertheless , additional independent tests of opacity calculations are desirable to ensure reliability of opacities which are crucial input to stellar model calculations .    in this work \n we also study the effect of varying abundances of many heavy elements separately to check which of them are effective in addressing the discrepancy . such studies will help in identifying the elements which play a crucial role in the discrepancy in solar models . \n it turns out that the problem may be resolved if the neon abundance is increased by about 0.6 dex , i.e. , by a factor of 4 . \n it may be noted that the neon abundance in the photosphere can not be determined spectroscopically and hence the uncertainties could be large . \n following basu & antia ( 2004 ) we construct solar envelope models with different heavy element abundances . \n all these models have the seismically estimated hydrogen abundance , @xmath2 , of 0.739 ( basu & antia 1995 , 2004 ) and the depth of the convection zone of @xmath3 ( christensen - dalsgaard  et al .  1991 ; basu & antia 1997 , 2004 ) . as a result \n there are no free parameters in these models and the sound speed and density in these models can be compared with seismically inferred values to check for consistency . \n these models use the opal equation of state ( eos ) ( rogers & nayfonov 2002 ) and opacity tables from opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) or op ( badnell et al . \n 2004 ) . in all cases , \n the opacity has been calculated using the appropriate mixture of heavy elements , while the eos has been calculated using a standard mixture for which the opal tables are available . in principle \n , the eos tables also need to be modified in view of the change in mixture of heavy elements . \n that has not been done since the eos is not particularly sensitive to the detailed breakup of heavy element abundance . \n we construct solar envelope models using the heavy element abundances as given by grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) ( referred to as gs98 ) or asplund et al . \n ( 2004b ) ( referred to as asp04 ) . \n furthermore , to study the effect of abundances of individual heavy elements , we have constructed models where the abundances of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s and fe are separately reduced as compared to their abundances in gs98 . for each solar envelope model \n we compare the density profile in the lower part of the convection zone with that inferred through seismic inversions . \n in general , the two do not agree with each other and we need to modify the opacity near the base of the convection zone to get agreement . \n the opacity modification required to get the density to agree is a measure of consistency between seismic data , abundances and opacities . \n we compare the density profile in each solar envelope model with seismically inverted density and the results for some of the models are shown in fig . \n it is clear that the density profile in models constructed using the revised abundances is significantly different , from that of the sun , the densities being higher than solar density . \n the estimated errors in the density inversion results in the lower cz is about 1.5% , including systematic errors due to uncertainties in x , eos etc . \n ( basu & antia 2004 ) . the difference in density is more than 15% , much larger than the errors . \n on the other hand , models with gs98 abundances have density profiles within error limits , thus these models are consistent with seismic constraints . for the asp04 mixture the opacities need to be increased by @xmath4% for opal models and @xmath5% for op models to get the density profile in agreement with seismic inversions . \n the op and opal models for the same mixture are close to each other and the difference between them are consistent with known differences in opacity estimates . \n it is clear from fig .  1 that there is not much difference between models using opal and op opacities . \n in order to quantify the differences in opacities , fig .  2 shows the relative difference between the two opacities as a function of temperature in a solar model using asp04 mixture . \n the differences are taken at the same density and temperature and reflect the differences in the actual opacity calculations . \n the differences are generally less than 2% in the radiative interior . near the base of the cz \n the difference is of order of 1% . \n since the two independent opacity calculations agree remarkably well with each other , it is unlikely that the discrepancy caused by reduced abundances can be due to uncertainties in opacities . to separate out the contribution of each element we construct a series of solar envelope models with the gs98 mixture , with the abundance of one element at a time reduced by the amount shown in the third column of table  1 . \n two of these models ( for reduction in o and fe abundances ) are also shown in fig .  1 . \n the results using opal opacity tables are summarized in table 1 , which lists the required opacity modification to restore the density profile to that inferred by inversions . \n it also lists the logarithmic derivative of the required opacity modification with respect to abundance of each element . \n it is clear that the derivative is significant for abundant elements like o , ne , fe . \n thus the required opacity modification can be controlled by adjusting the abundance of some of these elements . \n and we see from fig .  1 , that the model with the increased ne abundance is actually consistent with seismic results . \n if we believe that the abundance determination of o , fe have improved significantly in recent times , then there may not be much uncertainty in their estimated abundance and we do not have much freedom to vary those abundances . \n the photospheric abundance of ne however , may involve higher uncertainties since it can not be determined spectroscopically due to lack of suitable photospheric lines and has to be determined from coronal lines . \n this could also involve uncertainties due to possible fractionation in these layers , as the coronal ne abundance may not reflect that in the photosphere . \n thus we speculate that the effect of reduction in abundance of other elements like c , n , and o may be compensated by an increase in the ne abundance . the required ne abundance \n can be estimated by constructing models with different values of ne abundance to estimate the required abundance to match the density profile . \n it turns out that we need an increase in ne abundance by @xmath6 dex when op opacities are used , and by @xmath7 dex when opal opacities are used . \n this corresponds to an increase in abundance by a factor of just over 4 . \n it can be seen from fig .  1 that the envelope models constructed using these abundances have the correct density profile . \n we can also estimate the required increase in ne abundance from the partial derivative given in table  1 , but that gives a somewhat larger estimate , presumably because the derivative itself would increase when ne abundance increases by a factor of 4 . \n primary seismic inversions for sound speed and density are independent of opacities , but we need to use opacities in order to infer the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles in the solar interior ( gough & kosovichev 1988 ; shibahashi & takata 1996 ; antia & chitre 1998 ) . \n we therefore check the differences in the inferred temperature and @xmath2 profile of the sun arising from the use of the two different opacity tables . \n figure  3 shows the difference in temperature and hydrogen abundance inferred using the technique described by antia & chitre ( 1998 ) . \n the differences are taken between the profiles calculated using op and opal opacities ( in the sense op @xmath8 opal ) when the same heavy elements abundances are used . \n the differences of less than 0.005 are comparable to estimated errors from other sources . \n in contrast , the difference between the @xmath9 and @xmath2 profiles obtained using gs98 and asp04 mixtures with the same opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger . \n thus the differences in opacities between opal and op do not lead to significant differences in seismic inversions for the solar temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles . \n recently , bahcall et al . \n ( 2004b ) have also compared models constructed using opal and op opacities and they also find similar differences in solar models due to opacities . \n although , the change in mixture from gs98 to asp04 leads to large changes in the inferred solar @xmath2 and @xmath9 profiles , these results do not have much significance because the value of @xmath2 near the base of the convection zone obtained with the asp04 mixture is inconsistent with helioseismic estimate of @xmath2 in the convection zone . \n the estimate of @xmath2 in the convection zone is barely affected by abundances of heavy elements ( basu & antia 2004 ) . \n the discrepancy in the @xmath2 profile is yet another measure of the inconsistency between opacity , abundances and seismic constraints . \n we find that solar envelope models that have reduced abundances of oxygen and related elements do not have the correct density profile in the cz despite having the seismically determined cz depth and surface @xmath2 . \n the density difference is about 15% , which is more than 10 times the estimated uncertainties in density . in order to get a seismically consistent solar model it is necessary to increase the opacities near the base of the convection zone . \n the required increase in opacity is 25% for op tables and 27% for opal tables . the slight increase in this estimate as compared to that by basu & antia ( 2004 ) and bahcall et al . \n ( 2004a ) is due to the further reduction of the abundance estimates for some elements . \n bahcall et al . \n ( 2005 ) who used evolutionary solar models , estimate that an increase in opal opacity by 11% may be enough to get solar models in reasonable agreement with seismic constraints . \n the difference is most likely due to the fact that the envelope helium abundance in these models is somewhat low ( 0.243 ) compared with seismic abundances , and because evolutionary standard solar models do not have abundance profiles that agree with the seismically determined abundance profiles ( antia & chitre 1998 ) in the region just below the base of the cz . \n these reasons are in addition to the further reduction of the abundances since the work of bahcall et al . \n if we construct solar envelope models with @xmath10 , then the required opacity modification reduces by 5% . \n the remaining difference is almost certainly due to difference in composition profile just below the base of cz and further reduction in abundances of some elements .    considering the excellent agreement between opal and op opacities it is unlikely that the error in computed opacity is of order of 10% or larger . \n thus the discrepancy between solar model with latest abundances and seismically inverted density profile is not likely to be due to opacities . \n an independent study of solar abundances is required to verify the recently estimated values . \n one possibility is that abundance of some element has been underestimated . to study the effect of each element \n separately we have constructed models with reduction in abundance of only one element at a time . from this study \n we find that the required opacity modification is mainly controlled by abundances of o , ne and fe . \n thus it would be worthwhile to determine the abundances of these elements independently to estimate any possible systematic errors in their determination . \n of these the photospheric abundance of ne has not been determined spectroscopically and hence the uncertainties could be high . \n thus we speculate that the ne abundance may be increased to compensate for reduction in abundances of other elements . \n we find that the required increase is @xmath6 dex for op opacities and @xmath7 dex for opal opacities . \n thus the estimated ne abundance [ ne / h]@xmath11 may be compared with a value of 7.84 ( asplund et al . \n 2004b ) and @xmath12 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . \n of course it is unlikely that the entire discrepancy is due to ne abundance , and almost certainly a part of the discrepancy is due to other uncertainties , including those in abundances of other elements . for example , if we construct models with abundances of c , n , o , fe increased by 0.05 dex ( which is the @xmath13 error estimate in their abundances ) over the values obtained by asplund et al . \n ( 2004b ) , the ne abundance needs to be increased by only a factor of 2.5 ( 0.40 dex ) to get the density within 1.5% of the inverted values in the lower part of the cz . \n it may be noted that we have increased the abundances of c , n , o by the same amount since these abundances are correlated . the required increase in \n ne abundance is comparable to the factor of 1.74 ( 0.24 dex ) decrease in ne abundance between grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) and asplund et al . \n ( 2004b ) . \n asplund , m. , grevesse , n. , & sauval , a. j. 2004b , in cosmic abundances as

{"ContextTokens": 3276, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "dispersion theoretical analyses have been very successful in the description and understanding of pion nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction already in the 60s . based on unitarity , analyticity , crossing symmetry , gauge invariance and lorentz invariance they provide a powerful tool to investigate the low energy behaviour of the nucleon and the structure of nucleon resonances . during the last few years beams of high current and high duty factor \n together with considerably improved particle detection techniques have reduced the statistical errors to the order of a few percent , and promise to keep control of the systematical errors at the same level . to interpret these data with respect to the most interesting features , \n i.e. the threshold behaviour and the electromagnetic excitation of resonances , a partial wave analysis is mandatory . to ensure the consistency and uniqueness of such an analysis \n , constraints from unitarity and dispersion relations have to be imposed . \n such concepts have proven to be quite successful in pion - nucleon scattering @xcite . in comparison with that field , \n the situation in pion photoproduction is considerably more complex . \n the spin and isospin structure leads to twelve independent amplitudes , while in pion - nucleon scattering there are only four such amplitudes . as a consequence \n a complete experiment requires the use of many polarization observables . \n such a complete experiment has not yet been performed . \n however , the new experiments provide an ever increasing amount of precise and new data . at present \n , the experimental thrust is mainly on measurements near threshold and around the @xmath7(1232 ) resonance . in the coming years \n , a series of experiments at jefferson lab will cover the whole resonance region . \n restricting our theoretical investigations to the threshold region and the low - lying resonances , we are lead to choose the method of omns and muskhelishvili to analyse the existing data , because it introduces a natural parametrization and fulfills the constraints of unitarity at the same level . \n starting from fixed-@xmath0 dispersion relations for the invariant amplitudes of pion photoproduction , the projection of the multipole amplitudes leads to a well known system of integral equations , @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for any of the multipoles @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the corresponding ( nucleon ) pole term . \n the kernels @xmath14 are known , and the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes are related by unitarity . in the energy region below two - pion threshold , unitarity is expressed by the final state theorem of watson , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the corresponding @xmath17 phase shift and @xmath18 an integer . \n we have essentially followed the method of schwela et al @xcite to solve eq . \n ( [ inteq ] ) with the constraint ( [ watson ] ) . \n in addition we have taken into account the coupling to some higher states neglected in that earlier reference . at the energies above two - pion threshold up to @xmath19 gev , eq . \n ( [ watson ] ) has been replaced by an ansatz based on unitarity @xcite . finally , the contribution of the dispersive integrals from @xmath20 gev to infinity has been replaced by @xmath0-channel exchange , parametrized by certain fractions of @xmath21- and @xmath22-exchange . \n furthermore , we have to allow for the addition of solutions of the homogeneous equations to the coupled system of eq . \n ( [ inteq ] ) . \n the whole procedure introduces 9 free parameters , which have to be determined by a fit to the data.@xcite    in our data base we have included the recent mami experiments for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production off the proton in the energy range from 160 mev to 420 mev@xcite , both older and more recent data from bonn for @xmath23 production off the proton@xcite , and older frascati@xcite and more recent triumf data@xcite on @xmath4 production off the neutron . \n our fit obtained with this data base describes this data very well and in addition it also gives good agreement with data from the world data base ( e.g. said@xcite ) not included in our fit . \n in table 1 we give our results for the @xmath24- and @xmath25-wave amplitudes at threshold and compare them to the available information from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite and experiment . \n the reduced @xmath25-wave amplitudes are defined as usual by @xmath26 , in the limit @xmath27 . \n in fact the dependence on the photon energy @xmath28 is not stringent , and in explicit calculations this definition leads to less energy dependence for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while @xmath31 would vary less without the factor @xmath32 . in general there is a very good agreement between our analysis , hbchpt and experiment . in our analysis the uncertainties are mainly in the neutron channel , especially for @xmath33 , where the lack of precise experimental data , in particular of polarization observables , reflects in the threshold values . \n in fact it is interesting to note that the threshold amplitudes given in table 1 are not fitted to the threshold data . \n they are only determined from experimental information above @xmath34 mev , therefore , they should be considered as predictions rather than fits . the interplay of the complete knowledge of pion photoproduction at all energies in the framework of dispersion relations can be seen in the individual contributions to the threshold values of the @xmath24-wave amplitudes . for @xmath35 \n we obtain @xmath36 where the individual contributions are from the pole terms , from @xmath37 and higher multipoles , respectively . \n there is special theoretical interest in the @xmath38 amplitude of @xmath39 because it allows for an independent determination of the charge exchange pion - nucleon scattering length via the panofsky ratio , @xmath40 . \n this ratio is well determined by experiment , @xmath41 @xcite , and related to the scattering length by time reversal , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath45 momenta of photon and neutral pion at @xmath46 threshold . \n using our value of the threshold amplitude , and the measured panofsky ratio , we find @xmath47 . \n this has to be compared with the value @xmath48 resulting from a partial wave analysis of pion - nucleon scattering @xcite ( solution kh80 ) . \n recently , @xmath49 has also been determined by studying the level spacing of pionic atoms , with a preliminary value of @xmath50 @xcite .    .threshold \n amplitudes for pion photoproduction . \n the @xmath24-waves @xmath38 are in units of @xmath51 and the reduced @xmath25-wave multipoles are in units of @xmath52 . \n our values are compared with results from chiral perturbation theory @xcite and data analysis for charged pion production@xcite and neutral pion production off the proton@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ratios ]    in table 2 we compare our result with two vpi solutions , the solution of the rpi group in a field theoretical lagrangian approach and the experimental analyses of mainz and brookhaven . with the numerical solutions of vpi and rpi we have applied the speed - plot technique in order to separate resonance and background contributions and to determine the pole position and residues . while the `` full '' ratios @xmath53 vary by more than a factor of 2 among these solutions , the ratios @xmath54 are much closer to each others . in particular , the imaginary parts are very stable within only about 30% .    finally , we have determined the photon couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the delta resonance \n . from our energy - dependent analysis we get @xmath57 and @xmath58 , both in units of @xmath59 . \n however , it should be again noted that both the @xmath53 ratio and the photon couplings , calculated at the k - matrix pole are well - defined quantities but they have no direct connection to quark model calculations of a `` bare '' resonance . \n with the new and very precise data obtained at mami in mainz we have obtained a new partial wave analysis for pion photoproduction . \n the uncertainties in most multipoles could be considerably improved compared to previous analyses . \n very accurate results can be obtained at threshold and in the resonance region . at resonance \n we must clearly distinguish between the resonance position @xmath60 mev on the real axis and the pole at @xmath61 mev in the complex plane . at the resonance position , where the phase passes @xmath62 \n , we obtain an rem ratio of @xmath63 in very good agreement with the experimental analysis@xcite . \n this was also recently confirmed in a vpi analysis with a restricted data base@xcite . at the pole in the complex plane \n we obtain the ratio of the resonant electric and magnetic multipoles as @xmath64 . \n this is a model - independent ratio that can be determined in any analysis or calculation of pion photoproduction . after a long time of confusion about the different ratios that can be defined and constructed out of the measured cross sections or the analysed multipoles @xmath65 and @xmath66 \n , it now appears that the ratio @xmath54 is the closest one can get to a background subtracted value . \n such a ratio must be complex , and it will be a challenge for all microscopic models to determine this ratio . \n 99 g.  hhler , pion - nucleon scattering , landoldt - brnstein , vol . \n i/9b2 , ed . \n h.  schopper , springer ( 1983 ) . \n d.  schwela and r.  weizel , z. physik 221 ( 1969 ) 71 . \n w.  pfeil and d.  schwela , nucl . phys . \n b 45 ( 1972 ) 379 . for further details see o.  hanstein , d.  drechsel and l.  tiator , phys . \n b 385 ( 1996 ) 45 ; phys . lett . \n b 399 ( 1997 ) 13 ; nucl - th/9709067 ( submitted to nucl . phys . \n a ) and our theory homepage : www.kph.uni - mainz.de / theory/. m.  fuchs et al . \n b 368 ( 1996 ) 20 . r.  beck et al . , phys . \n 78 ( 1997 ) 606 , + h .- p . \n krahn , ph.d . \n thesis , mainz ( 1996 ) . \n f.  hrter , phd . \n thesis , mainz ( 1996 ) . \n d.  menze , w.  pfeil and r.  wilcke , compilation of pion photoproduction data , bonn ( 1977 ) . \n k.  buechler et al . , nucl . \n phys . a 570 ( 1994 ) 580 . \n h.  dutz , phd . \n thesis , bonn ( 1993 ) , + d.  krmer , phd .  thesis , \n bonn ( 1993 ) , + b.  zucht , phd . \n thesis , bonn ( 1995 ) . \n f.  carbonara et al . , nuovo cim . 13 a ( 1973 ) 59 . \n a.  bagheri et al . \n , phys . rev . \n c 38 ( 1988 ) 875 . \n r.  a.  arndt , i.  i.  strakovsky and r.  l.  workman , phys . \n c 53 ( 1996 ) 430 ; the multipole analysis ( sp97k ) and the world data base was taken from said . \n v.  bernard , n.  kaiser and u .- g . \n meiner , phys . \n b 383 ( 1996 ) 116 . j.  spuller et al . , phys . \n 67 b ( 1977 ) 479 . \n m.  janousch et al . , proc . of the @xmath67 int . \n conf . on particles and nuclei , williamsburg 1996 , eds . \n carlson , j.j . \n domingo , world scientific , singapore 1997 , p. 372 . \n m.  i.  adamovich , proc . \n p. n. lebedev phys . \n ( 1976 ) 119 . j.  c.  bergstrom et al , phys . \n c 50 ( 1994 ) 2979 and phys . \n c 55 ( 1997 ) 2016 . \n g.  hhler and a.  schulte , @xmath17 newsletter 7 ( 1992 ) 94 . \n r.  m.  davidson , private communication . \n r.  workman , vpi solution b500 , presented at this conference . \n g.  blanpied et al . \n , preprint bnl-64382 , brookhaven 1997 .", "StartTimeOffset": 565396653151, "RequestID": "db08ac9cc9cb4566845ebf3262d575b0", "TotalTokens": 3505}
{"ContextTokens": 3313, "GeneratedTokens": 87, "SynthesizedBody": "pi and pid controllers ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) are still by far the most popular feedback design in industry . to the best of our knowledge \n , there is no clear - cut explanation of their strange ubiquity for a wide range of systems . \n remember that , from a purely mathematical standpoint , they are only fully justified until now for first and second order linear differential equations with constant coefficients ! \n we solve here this long - standing and quite irritating open problem via the newly introduced _ \n intelligent _ pids ( @xcite ) , which have already been utilized quite successfully in several concrete situations ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . \n the proof relies on a crude time - sampling of both types of regulators . \n it shows that the gains in a classic pi or pid take into account , if they are properly tuned , the estimated `` structural '' part of the intelligent controllers . \n thus the efficiency of these intelligent controllers with respect to arbitrary nonlinear plants ( @xcite ) is enough for fulfilling our purpose . \n let us nevertheless emphasize that the classic tuning rules are quite intricate whereas their counterparts for intelligent controllers are obvious . \n only few references ( see , _ \n e.g. _ , @xcite ) in the huge literature on pids exhibit some connections with our viewpoint .    our paper is organized as follows . \n section [ mfc ] is devoted to a brief review of _ model - free _ control and of the corresponding intelligent pid controllers . \n section [ connect ] , which establishes our results by comparing the sampling of classical and intelligent controllers , gives a table for the connections between classic and intelligent gains . \n the computer simulations in section [ applications ] confirms the superiority of the intelligent controllers ( see , also , @xcite for other examples ) . \n some concluding remarks are given in section [ conclusion ] . \n the input - output behavior of the system , which for simplicity s sake is assumed to be monovariable , is `` approximatively '' governed within its operating range by an * unknown * finite - dimensional ordinary differential equation , which is not necessarily linear , @xmath0 replace equation by the following `` phenomenological '' model , which is only valid during a very short time interval , @xmath1 the derivation order @xmath2 , which is in general equal to @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and the constant parameter @xmath5 are chosen by the practitioner . \n it implies that @xmath2 is not necessarily equal to the derivation order @xmath6 of @xmath7 in equation ( [ e ] ) . \n the numerical value of @xmath8 at any time instant is deduced from those of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , thanks to our quite efficient numerical differentiators , which are moreover real - time . \n the desired behavior is obtained by implementing , if , for instance , @xmath11 , the _ intelligent pid controller _ ( _ i - pid _ ) @xmath12 where    * @xmath13 is the output reference trajectory , which is determined e.g. via the rules of flatness - based control ;

{"ContextTokens": 3090, "GeneratedTokens": 286, "SynthesizedBody": "over the past years the dominant explanation for the large mass to light ratios inferred for galactic and meta - galactic systems , that these are embedded within massive dark matter halos , has begun to be challenged . \n direct detection of the dark matter particles , in spite of decades of extensive and dedicated searches , remains lacking . \n numerous alternative theories of gravity have appeared ( e.g. teves of @xcite , f(r ) theories e.g. @xcite ) mostly grounded on geometrical extensions to general relativity , and leading to laws of gravity which in the low acceleration regime , mimic the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) fitting formulas e.g. @xcite . \n similarly , @xcite have explored mond not as a modification to newton s second law , but as a modified gravitational force law in the newtonian regime , finding a good agreement with observed dynamics across galactic scales without requiring dark matter . \n recently @xcite have constructed an @xmath5 extension to general relativity which in the low velocity limit converges to the above approach . \n a generic feature of all such modified gravity schemes is the appearance of an acceleration scale , @xmath2 , above which classical gravity is recovered , and below which the dark matter mimicking regime appears . \n this results in a general prediction ; all systems where @xmath6 should appear as devoid of dark matter , and all systems where @xmath7 should appear as dark matter dominated . \n it is interesting that no @xmath6 system has ever been detected where dark matter needs to be invoked . on the other hand \n , the latter condition furnishes a testable prediction in relation to the orbits of wide binaries . for test particles in orbit around a @xmath1 star , in circular orbits of radius @xmath8 \n , the acceleration is expected to drop below @xmath9 for @xmath107000 au@xmath11 . \n this provides a test for the dark matter / modified theories of gravity debate ; the relative velocities of components of binary stars with large physical separations should deviate from kepler s third law . \n seen as an equivalent newtonian force law , beyond @xmath127000 au the gravitational force should gradually switch from the classical form of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and the orbital velocity , @xmath15 , should no longer decrease with separation , but settle at a constant value , dependent only on the total mass of the system through @xmath16 . under modified gravity theories , binary stars with separations beyond 7000 au should exhibit `` flat rotation curves '' and a `` tully - fisher relation '' , as galactic systems in the same acceleration regime do . \n we apply this test to the binaries of two recent catalogues containing relative velocities and separations . \n the two catalogues are entirely independent in their approaches . the first one , @xcite , comprises 280 systems from the _ hipparcos _ satellite , while the second , @xcite , identifies 1,250 ones from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . \n details can be found in @xcite . \n the newtonian prediction for the relative velocities of the two components of binaries having circular orbits , when plotted against the binary physical separation , @xmath8 , is for a scaling of @xmath17 , essentially following kepler s third law , provided the range of masses involved were narrow . in a relative proper motion sample however , only two components of the relative velocity appear , as velocity along the line of sight to the binary leads to no proper motion . \n thus , orbital projection plays a part , with systems having orbital planes along the line of sight sometimes appearing as having no relative proper motions . \n a further effect comes from any degree of orbital ellipticity present ; it is hence clear that the trend for @xmath17 described above , will only provide an upper limit to the distribution of projected @xmath18 vs. @xmath8 expected in any real observed sample , even if only a narrow range of masses is included . \n one should expect a range of measured values of projected @xmath18 at a fixed observed projected @xmath8 , all extending below the newtonian limit , which for equal mass binaries in circular orbits gives @xmath19 . \n further , over time , the orbital parameters of binaries will evolve due to the effects of galactic tidal forces and dynamical encounters with other stars in the field , specially in the case of wide binaries . \n to first order , one would expect little evolution for binaries tighter than the tidal limit of 1.7pc , and the eventual dissolution of wider systems . \n a very detailed study of all these points has recently appeared , @xcite . \n these authors numerically follow populations of 50,000 @xmath1 binaries in the galactic environment , accounting for the evolution of the orbital parameters of each due to the cumulative effects of the galactic tidal field at the solar radius . also , the effects of close and long range encounters with other stars in the field are carefully included , to yield a present day distribution of separations and relative velocities for an extensive population of wide binaries , under newtonian gravity . \n it is found that when many wide binaries cross their jacobi radius , the two components remain fairly close by in both coordinate and velocity space . \n thus , in any real wide binary search a number of wide pairs with separations larger than their jacobi radii will appear . finally , \n @xcite obtain the rms one - dimensional relative velocity difference , @xmath20 , projected along a line of sight , for the entire populations of binaries dynamically evolved over 10 gyr to today , as plotted against the projected separation on the sky for each pair . \n the expected keplerian fall of @xmath21 for separations below 1.7 pc is obtained , followed by a slight rise in @xmath20 as wide systems cross the jacobi radius threshold . \n @xmath20 then settles at rms values of @xmath22 . \n this represents the best currently available estimate of how relative velocities should scale with projected separations for binary stars ( both bound and in the process of dissolving in the galactic tides ) under newtonian gravity . \n we see that all we need is a large sample of relative proper motion and binary separation measurements to test the newtonian prediction for the rms values of the 1 dimensional relative velocities of @xcite , and to contrast the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 predictions for the upper envelope of the @xmath18 vs. @xmath8 distributions . \n in the @xcite catalogue wide binaries are identified by assigning a probability above chance alignment to the systems by carefully comparing to the underlying background ( and its variations ) in a 5 dimensional parameter space of proper motions and spatial positions . \n we keep only binaries with a probability of non - chance alignment greater than @xmath25 . \n the binary search criteria used by the authors requires that the proposed binary should have no near neighbours ; the projected separation between the two components is thus always many times smaller than the typical interstellar separation . \n we use the reported distances to the primaries , where errors are smallest , to calculate projected @xmath18 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 values reported . \n although the use of _ hipparcos _ measurements guarantees the best available quality in the data , we have also removed all binaries for which the final signal to noise ratio in the relative velocities was lower than @xmath28 . \n we are left with a sample of 280 binaries , having distances to the sun within @xmath29 in pc . \n the data show a perfectly flat upper envelope in a @xmath18 vs. projected @xmath8 , @xcite . \n the average signal to noise ratio for the data is 1.7 , with an average error on @xmath18 of 0.83 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the distribution to the real underlying upper limit for the sample , results in 3 @xmath30 as our estimate of the actual physical upper limit in @xmath18 . \n the sloan low mass wide pairs catalogue ( slowpokes ) of @xcite contains a little over 1,200 wide binaries with relative proper motions for each pair , distances and angular separations . \n also , extreme care was taken to include only physical binaries , with a full galactic population model used to exclude chance alignment stars using galactic coordinates and galactic velocities , resulting in an estimate of fewer than 2% of false positives . \n this yields only isolated binaries with no neighbours within many times the internal binary separation . \n again , we use the reported distances to the primaries to calculate projected @xmath18 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 values reported by @xcite , to obtain a sample of 417 binaries . \n the upper envelope of the distribution of @xmath18 from this catalogue does not comply with kepler s third law . as was the case with the _ hipparcos _ sample , \n the upper envelope describes a flat line , as expected under modified gravity schemes . \n the average signal to noise in @xmath18 for the @xcite catalogue is 0.48 , with an average error on @xmath18 of 12 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the complete distribution to the real underlying upper limit gives the same @xmath33 as obtained for the @xcite _ hipparcos _ catalogue . \n figure ( 1 ) shows the rms value of the one - dimensional relative velocity difference for both of the samples discussed . \n the error bars give the error propagation on @xmath26 and @xmath32 . \n we construct @xmath20 by considering only one coordinate of the two available from the relative motion on the plane of the sky . \n thus , each binary can furnish two @xmath20 measurements , which statistically should not introduce any bias . \n indeed , using only @xmath34 or only @xmath35 or both for each binary , yields the same mean values for the points shown . \n the small solid error bars result from considering an enlarged sample where each binary contributes two @xmath36 measurements , while the larger dotted ones come from considering each binary only once , and do not change if we consider only @xmath34 or only @xmath35 . \n the series of small @xmath37 interval data are for the _ hipparcos _ catalogue of @xcite , while the two broader crosses show results for the @xcite sdss sample . \n the solid curve is the newtonian prediction of the full galactic evolutionary model of @xcite for binaries , both bound and in the process of dissolving . \n note that the results of this simulation deviate from kepler s law for @xmath8 larger than the newtonian jacobi radius of @xmath38 , whereas the discrepancy with the observed samples also occurs at much smaller separations . even considering the large error bars , where each binary contributes only one @xmath20 value \n , we see eight points lying beyond 1@xmath39 , making the probability of consistency between this prediction and the observations of less than @xmath40=@xmath41 . \n we obtain a constant rms value for @xmath20 of 1 @xmath30 , in qualitative agreement with expectations from modified gravity schemes . \n the vertical line marks @xmath42 ; we see the data departing from the newtonian prediction outwards of this line , and not before . \n the two independent catalogues , each using different sets of selection criteria , each perhaps subject to its own independent systematics , are consistent with the same result , a constant horizontal upper envelope for the distribution of relative velocities on the plane of the sky at an intrinsic value of 3 @xmath431 @xmath30 , extending over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath8 , with a constant rms @xmath20 value consistent with 1 @xmath430.5 @xmath30 . \n this supports the interpretation of the effect detected as the generic prediction of modified gravity theories . \n the solid curve gives the rms values for one dimensional projected relative velocities as a function of projected separations , for the dynamical modelling of large populations of wide binaries evolving in the galactic environment , taken from @xcite . \n the same quantity for the data from the catalogues analysed is given by the points with error bars ; those with narrow @xmath37 intervals being from the _ hipparcos _ sample of @xcite , and those two with wide @xmath37 intervals coming from the sdss sample of @xcite ] \n we identify a critical test in the classical gravity / modified gravity debate , using the relative velocities of wide binaries with separations in excess of 7000 au , as these occupy the @xmath0 regime . \n we present a first application of this test using the best currently available data . \n results show constant relative rms velocities for the binary stars in question . \n this is quantitatively inconsistent with detailed predictions of newtonian dynamical models for binaries evolving in the local galactic environment . \n our results are qualitatively in accordance with generic modified gravity models which explain galactic dynamics in the absence of dark matter . \n bekenstein , j. , 2004 , phys . \n d. , 70 , 3509", "StartTimeOffset": 592913872157, "RequestID": "ee33e13263234ca5923cc32c61205f59", "TotalTokens": 3376}
{"ContextTokens": 4002, "GeneratedTokens": 64, "SynthesizedBody": "ordinary perturbation theory often leads to asymptotically divergent series @xcite . \n several techniques have been devised in the past in order to improve the convergence of the standard perturbative expansion ( see , e.  g. , refs . \n @xcite and references therein ) . \n some of the `` optimized expansions '' that have been proposed are based upon the so - called linear delta expansion ( lde ) @xcite , where the terms in the schrdinger equation are rearranged in `` non - perturbative '' and `` perturbative '' pieces , with the contributions of the latter being minimized by introducing a suitably chosen variational parameter , that is by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite .    recently , in ref . \n @xcite , an improved ansatz for the choice of the parameter that allows for an `` optimal '' expansion has been proposed and tested in the case of the ground and first excited states of the quantum ( quartic ) anharmonic oscillator ( aho ) . within this scheme calculating an observable with higher precision \n that is going to higher order in the expansion  requires the solution of algebraic equations of increasing order . \n this can be done analytically , thus allowing one to get analytical expressions for both the energies and the wave functions of the aho at any desired order . \n given the success of the method for the quartic aho , one would like to have a formal proof of the convergence of the method and to verify whether it works for more general potentials . in this paper \n we address this latter issue , extending the previous study to the sextic and octic aho potentials : this is of interest for the study of realistic potentials  since they can often be approximated as polynomials  and also in itself , since general anharmonic potentials have applications in studies of nonlinear mechanics , molecular physics , quantum optics , nuclear physics and field theory @xcite . \n we also improve the convergence of the method for the calculation of the energy with respect to ref . \n @xcite , by introducing a variational principle , that is by considering , at a given order , not the expression for the energy stemming from the lde , but the matrix element of the hamiltonian obtained using the wave function at that order and applying the pms to it : since the resulting expression is quadratic in the wave function , one gets higher order contributions that turn out to substantially improve the convergence of the expansion and , at the same time , to satisfy a variational principle . \n the paper is organized in the following way : section  [ sec_met ] contains a description of the method and a discussion of the computation of the energy through its expectation value and its relation to the variational principle . in section  [ sec_res ] \n we present our results for the quartic , sextic and octic potentials , comparing them with those obtained with other techniques available in the literature . \n finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec_conc ] . \n the method employed in this paper has been originally devised in ref . \n @xcite and applied to the study of the quartic anharmonic potential . \n it relies on the the identification of three different scales in the problem , which reflect in a different behavior of the wave function : an asymptotic scale , which is fully determined by the potential ; an intermediate scale , where the wave function decays exponentially , although with less strength ; a short distance scale where the wave function is sizable .    in this work we consider the application of our method to anharmonic potentials of the form @xmath0 and discuss the accuracy of the approximations obtained in this framework in the case of quartic , sextic and octic potentials ( with @xmath1 respectively ) . \n the schrdinger equation in the present case reads @xmath2 \\psi_n(x ) = e_n      \\psi_n(x ) ,   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the anharmonic coupling , @xmath4 is the wave function of the @xmath5 excited state and @xmath6 its energy .    although one can not find the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq2 ] ) exactly , it is possible to determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath4 in the region of large @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) by substituting the ansatz @xmath9 into eq . \n ( [ eq2 ] ) . \n one obtains @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in the spirit of ref . \n @xcite we therefore write the wave function as @xmath12 where the exponential takes care of the correct behavior in the limit @xmath13 . notice that the quadratic term in the exponential does not affect the behavior at large distances , but is relevant at intermediate scales . \n the coefficient @xmath14 is written in terms of the frequency @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is an arbitrary parameter introduced by hand , see below ) . \n the reduced wave function @xmath17 is well - behaved and fulfills the equation . ] : @xmath18       \\xi_n(x ) = 0 . \n \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe that no approximation has been invoked in the derivation of eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) . in the spirit of the linear delta expansion ( lde ) we now write eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) as @xmath19 \\xi'_n(x ) +       \\left[\\frac{2 m e_n}{\\hbar^2 } - \\frac{m \\to } { \\hbar } \\right ] \\xi_n(x )       = \\delta \\left\\ { 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu m}{n } } \\frac{x^n}{\\hbar } \\xi_n'(x )       \\right . \n \\nonumber \\\\     & - & \\left . \n \\frac{m^2 \\omega^2}{\\hbar^2 } x^2 \\xi_n(x ) - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu m}{n } }      \\frac{x^{n-1}}{\\hbar^2 } \\left(2 m \\to x^2 - \\hbar n \\right ) \\xi_n(x )      \\right\\ } . \n \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in writing this equation we have added a parameter @xmath20 , which was not present in eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) . for @xmath21 \n one recovers the original equation in eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) , while by taking @xmath22 one obtains the equation for the hermite polynomials , corresponding to a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath23 . \n notice that @xmath20 here is used as a power counting device : as a matter of fact we will treat the right hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) as a perturbation , although its size is not necessarily small , given the arbitrary nature of the parameter @xmath16 . \n an optimal choice of @xmath16 will make the right hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) small . \n we now write the following expansions : @xmath24 and substitute them in eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) , thus generating a hierarchy of equations , corresponding to the different orders in @xmath20 . \n such equations , which take the form of the equation for the hermite polynomials in the presence of a source term , can be solved sequentially up to some finite order . \n ( crosses ) . \n the dotted line is the result of ref . \n we use @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]     ( crosses ) . \n the dotted line is the result of ref . \n we use @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    given the perturbative nature of the approach that we are using , all the results , obtained to a finite order in perturbation theory , will display a dependence upon the arbitrary frequency @xmath16 . \n however this dependence is artificial since the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) does not depend upon @xmath16 . in the framework of the lde such dependence \n is minimized by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , i.e. by requiring that a given observable @xmath28 ( the energy , for example ) be locally independent of @xmath16 : @xmath29 in the present work we will enforce the pms by using the energy of the state as the observable . \n we need however to make an important point : by solving the equations corresponding to the different perturbative orders , we obtain two different estimates of the energy of the solution . \n one corresponds to the expansion in eq . \n ( [ eq6a ] ) , which was indeed used in @xcite ; the other corresponds to calculating the energy as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the state described by the wave function obtained in eq . \n ( [ eq6a ] ) . \n this second choice turns out to provide a much better estimate of the energy : as a matter of fact , the energy calculated in this way not only contains contributions of higher order in @xmath20 ( the expectation value of the hamiltonian is bilinear in the wave function ) but it is also constrained by the variational principle ( at least for the ground state ) to lie above the exact result . \n therefore the pms applied to the expectation value of the hamiltonian corresponds , for the ground state , to the statement of the variational principle . \n this finding is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : compsandw ] , where we compare the energy of the ground and first excited states of the quartic aho  evaluated at order 15  to the average value of the hamiltonian  obtained using the wave function at the same order  as a function of @xmath16 .    in fig . \n [ fig : compsandwene ] , on the other hand , one can see the ground and first excited state energies of the quartic aho as a function of the perturbative order @xmath30 , obtained after application of the pms both to @xmath31 of eq . \n ( [ eq6a ] ) and to @xmath32 . \n the faster convergence to the correct result in the latter case is quite apparent . \n it is interesting that also in the case of the excited state the approach based upon the minimization of the average value of the hamiltonian seems to satisfy a variational principle . \n let us start by comparing the accuracy of our method with the one of ref . \n @xcite which is based on a variational improvement of the ordinary perturbation theory that gives a convergent sequence of approximations \n .     iterations . \n we use @xmath33 and @xmath34.,width=321 ]    in fig . \n [ fig : bellet ] we display the logarithm of the percentile error for the ground state energy of the quartic oscillator as a function of the approximation order . \n the error is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath6 is the `` exact '' value of the energy of the @xmath36-th state and @xmath37 the approximate estimation to order @xmath30 . \n the results using the present method ( crosses ) are compared to the outcome of the calculation in ref . \n @xcite , obtained after 47 iterations , for the ground state of the quartic aho ( the `` exact '' value of @xmath38 is taken from ref . \n @xcite ) . \n we now turn to compare our results with those of ref . \n @xcite , where the quartic , sextic and octic aho have been thoroughly analyzed with a method based on the generalized bloch equation . \n this method calculates iteratively certain matrix elements of the wave operator ( wave function expansion coefficients ) and then uses a renormalization technique .     and @xmath39 ;

photon squared matrix elements @xmath11 for the @xmath12 processes @xmath13 in terms of the standard kinematical variables @xcite .    at order-@xmath0 , \n the partonic cross sections receive contributions from the following reactions : @xmath14 where any of the outgoing partons can fragment into the final state hadron @xmath7 .    at variance with the @xmath15 case , where the integration over final states leads to overlapping singularities along various curves in the residual phase space , here \n the only remaining singularities are found at @xmath16 and thus they can be dealt with the standard method . after combining real and virtual contributions to a given partonic process , the cross section can be written as @xmath17 where the coefficient of the single poles , @xmath18 , as well as the finite contributions @xmath19 , include ` delta ' and ` plus ' distributions in @xmath20 . \n the ir double poles present in the individual real and virtual contributions cancel out in the sum , providing the first straightforward check on the angular integration of real amplitudes and the loop integrals in the virtual case . in the real terms \n , the above mentioned double poles come from the product of a pole arising in the integration over the spectators phase space and a single pole coming from the expansion of @xmath21 factors . \n double poles in the virtual contributions always arise from loop integrals . \n the remaining singularities , contributing to the single pole , are of uv and collinear origin . \n the former are removed by means of coupling constant renormalization , whereas the latter have to be factorized in the redefinition of parton densities and fragmentation functions . \n in figure [ fig : x_bj ] we show the lo and nlo predictions for the electroproduction of neutral pions as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , in the kinematical range of the h1 experiment @xcite , together with the most recent data for the range @xmath24 . \n the cross sections are computed as described in the previous sections , applying h1 cuts and using mrst02 parton densities @xcite . \n similar results are found using other sets of modern pdfs . for the input fragmentation functions , we use two different sets , the ones from reference @xcite denoted as kkp and those from @xcite referenced as k. we set the renormalization and factorization scales as the average between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and we compute @xmath27 at nlo(lo ) fixing @xmath28 as in the mrst analysis . \n the plots clearly show that the nlo cross sections are much larger than the lo ones , even by the required order of magnitude in certain kinematical regions . \n another interesting feature is that the uncertainty due to the choice of a fragmentation functions set is also quite noticeable , this fact driven by the different gluon content of the two sets considered here . \n low @xmath25 bins seem to prefer kkp set , which have a larger gluon - fragmentation content , whereas for larger @xmath25 both sets agree with the data within errors . \n lo estimates show a much smaller sensitivity on the choice of fragmentation functions , since gluon fragmentation does not contribute significantly to the cross section at this order . \n the rather large size of the k - factor can , then , be understood as a consequence of the opening of a new dominant ( ` leading - order ' ) channel , and not to the ` genuine ' increase in the partonic cross section that might otherwise threaten perturbative stability . \n the dominance of the new channel is due to the size of the gluon distribution at small @xmath22 and to the fact that the h1 selection cuts highlight the kinematical region dominated by the @xmath29 partonic process .      in figure \n [ fig : discri ] we show the different contributions to the cross section discriminated by the underlying partonic process . \n notice that at very small @xmath22 the @xmath30 term can be by itself several times larger than the lo contribution , remaining larger or comparable even for higher @xmath22 values . \n the forward selection is also responsible of the scale sensitivity of the cross section , as it supresses large components with small scale dependence whereas it stresses components as @xmath30 whose scale dependence would be partly canceled only at nnlo        a. daleo , c. garca canal , r. sassot , _ nucl . \n phys.b _ * 662 * 334 ( 2003 ) . \n a. daleo , r. sassot , _ nucl . \n phys.b _ * 673 * 357 ( 2003 ) . \n p.  aurenche , r.  basu , m.  fontannaz and r.  m.  godbole , _ eur . \n j. c _ * 34 * 277 ( 2004 ) . \n m.  fontannaz , arxiv : hep -

? ? \n * lemma 3.3.12 ) , we have @xmath46 . in particular , this is nonzero . \n then the only possibility is that @xmath0 .          in the classical adams spectral sequence , @xmath49 and @xmath50 \n are both zero . \n this means that our proof is strictly motivic in nature . \n we do not know a proof using only the classical adams spectral sequence .    using only classical information \n , we suggest a possible argument that @xmath7 does not survive the classical adams spectral sequence . \n start with the massey product @xmath51 and the classical differential on @xmath52 . \n moss s convergence theorem @xcite then implies that @xmath53 is not a well - formed toda bracket . \n the only possibility is that @xmath7 does not survive . \n however , that still leaves two possible differentials : @xmath54 , or @xmath55 . \n we do not know how to rule out the second alternative using only the classical adams spectral sequence . \n mahowald s original argument for the differential @xmath6 used a faulty computation of the toda bracket @xmath56 . \n partial information about this toda bracket is used in the construction of a kervaire invariant element @xmath57 in dimension @xmath58 @xcite . \n our improved understanding of the toda bracket does not contradict any of the claims of @xcite . \n e. b. curtis , p. goerss , m. mahowald and r. j. milgram . \n calculations of unstable adams @xmath33 terms for spheres . algebraic topology ( seattle , wash . , 1985 ) , 208266 , lecture notes in math . , 1286 , springer , berlin , 1987 . \n s. o. kochman . \n stable homotopy groups of spheres , a computer - assisted approach . \n lecture notes in mathematics 1423 , springer - verlag , 1990 . \n j. p. may . \n matric massey products . \n j. algebra 12 ( 1969 ) , 533568 .", "StartTimeOffset": 626922030084, "RequestID": "58f6208d2a814d5d9efac28187d56ae9", "TotalTokens": 2156}
{"ContextTokens": 4033, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "the idea of thermoacoustic tomography ( tct , sometimes also called tat )  @xcite can be briefly described as follows ( see figure  [ fig : tctsketch ] ) . \n a short pulse of radiofrequency ( rf ) electromagnetic waves is sent through a biological object heating up the tissue . \n it is known that the cancerous cells absorb several times more rf energy than the healthy ones  @xcite . as a result \n a significant increase of temperature occurs at the tumor locations causing a thermal expansion of cancerous masses pressing on the neighboring healthy tissue . \n the created pressure wave is registered by the transducers located on the edge of the object . \n assuming speed of propagation of these acoustic waves constant inside the object ( an assumption which is not always correct , but is satisfactory , e.g. for mammography ) , the signals registered at any transducer location are generated by the inclusions laying on a sphere centered at that location . \n in fact the measured data are the integrals of rf absorption coefficient @xmath0 over those spheres or , in other words , the spherical radon transform @xmath1 of the rf absorption coefficient @xmath0 . \n hence , to reconstruct the image one needs to invert the spherical radon transform . \n the spherical radon transform of @xmath0 is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the surface area on the sphere @xmath4 centered at @xmath5 .    in the definition \n we allow arbitrary set of centers @xmath6 and radii @xmath7 . \n however , from the dimensional consideration it is clear , that this mapping is overdetermined . \n the tomographic motivation suggests to restrict the set of centers to a surface @xmath8 ( the set of transducers locations ) , while not imposing any restrictions on the radii . in this paper \n we will deal only with the case of spherical acquisition ( i.e. the transducers are located on a unit sphere ) and from now on we will suppose @xmath9 . \n two different approaches have been used to derive exact inversion formulae for this case . \n fourier - bessel and spherical harmonic expansions result in solutions written as an infinite series for two and three dimensions respectively  @xcite . \n the tct analog of @xmath10-filtered backprojection inversion is derived in  @xcite @xmath11 as well as a filtered backprojection type version @xmath12 both formulas can be generalized to higher odd dimensions  @xcite . \n notice that , as one can expect for a codimension 1 radon transform in 3d , the formulas are local .    in section 2 we describe the numerical simulation of the data acquisition . the reconstruction algorithms based on the @xmath10-filtered backprojection formula  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) and the filtered backprojection one  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) \n are discussed in section  3 . \n the region of reconstruction is the unit ball centered at the origin ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . \n all phantoms considered in the paper are sums of indicator functions supported in ellipsoids completely contained inside the unit ball . \n the transducers are located on the surface of the unit sphere . \n we parameterize the transducer location by two angles @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the the azimuthal angle in the @xmath15-plane and @xmath16 $ ] is the polar angle measured from the @xmath17-axis . \n since the spherical radon transform is linear , it is enough to create projections for phantoms with a single ellipsoid and then superimpose the projections . for a single ellipsoid the data measured at a fixed transducer location at a given moment ( i.e. for fixed @xmath18 ) is the surface area of a part of the sphere of integration cut by the intersecting ellipsoid . \n it can be expressed as a finite sum with terms of the form @xmath19 d{\\phi } \\label{eq : doubleint}\\ ] ] where each such term corresponds to a connected component of the intersection . here \n @xmath20 and @xmath21 parameterize the sphere of integration and are independent of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which parameterize the transducer location . \n the angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined by the intersection of the integration sphere and the phantom s ellipsoid . \n the cosines of these angles can be found from the solution of a quartic equation describing that intersection .    in the numerical results presented below the quartic equation \n is solved using the matlab built - in function  roots \" . by adding up these roots in an appropriate way we obtain the inner integral with respect to the polar angle @xmath26 in equation  ( [ eq : doubleint ] ) . \n the result is a function of azimuthal angle @xmath27 , which we will denote @xmath28 . \n depending on the location and parameters of the ellipsoid , @xmath28 might be either a smooth @xmath29-periodic function of @xmath27 , or a piecewise smooth one ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .    in the first case we compute its values at uniformly discretized locations on the interval \n @xmath30 $ ] and use the trapezoidal rule to compute the integral . for , numerical integration using \n the trapezoidal rule is accurate to @xmath31  @xcite . \n if , however , @xmath28 is only piecewise smooth on @xmath30 $ ] , then we locate the pieces of where it is smooth and use gaussian quadrature to integrate over each piece . \n once we have generated the projection data , we reconstruct the original indicator functions of the phantoms . the reconstruction algorithms \n are based on the @xmath10-filtered backprojection  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) or the filtered backprojection  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) . \n the integrals over the unit sphere in  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) and  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) are computed as double integrals with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath22 and the polar angle @xmath23 . \n the function to be integrated is periodic with respect to @xmath22 making the trapezoidal rule an appealing quadrature choice . \n integration with respect to @xmath23 is done by gaussian quadrature . \n the laplace operator is implemented through the matlab built - in function  del2 \" . \n the reconstructions were generated using matlab 5.0 .    in the results below \n the resolution is over a volume resulting in isotropic pixel dimension of . \n the algorithm is tested on the defrise phantom which consists of five thin ellipsoids symmetrically centered along the @xmath17-axis ( see fig .  [ \n fig : def2d ] ) . \n we numerate them from @xmath32 to @xmath33 starting with the lowest .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the data was acquired from the transducers located discretely over the sphere in the following way . \n the azimuthal angles of the transducer locations were uniformly discretized to @xmath34 points between 0 and @xmath35 . \n the polar angles of the transducer locations corresponded to @xmath36 gaussian nodes on the interval form 0 to @xmath29 , as described in the previous section . \n the radii of the integration spheres were uniformly discretized to @xmath37 points from 0 to 2 . \n the reconstruction was done by both methods : filtered backprojection ( fbp ) and @xmath10-filtered backprojection . \n +    the obtained results validate reconstruction formulas  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) and  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) ( see fig .  [ defrise ] ) . in both cases \n the defrise phantom has a good reconstruction everywhere except along the @xmath17-axis ( @xmath38 ) , where some noise is present which , while not always noticeable on reconstructions , is visible on the graphs . \n the reason for appearance of that noise is the correlation of numerical errors along that axis of phantom s symmetry and is discussed in section  [ subsec : errors ] . \n half - scan reconstructions were done using data from only the eastern hemisphere ( @xmath39 , @xmath36 ) or the southern hemisphere ( @xmath34 , @xmath40 ) . \n these hemispheres are highlighted in figure  [ fig : defpartialscan ] . \n the rest of the data has been zero - filled . \n +    -0.3 in    it is known  @xcite that in case of incomplete data one can expect to recover stably only certain parts of the image the rest of it being blurred out . \n namely some parts of the wavefront set of the image will be lost . for our phantom \n the singularities are jump discontinuities ( edges ) of imaged value @xmath0 across an interface @xmath41 ( a surface of an ellipsoid in 3d ) . \n the wavefront @xmath42 of @xmath0 in this situation is the set of pairs @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a point on @xmath41 , and @xmath45 is a vector normal to @xmath41 at @xmath44 . \n as it was shown in  @xcite using microlocal analysis , a point @xmath46 can be stably detected from the radon data , if and only if @xmath1 includes data obtained from a sphere passing through @xmath44 and normal to @xmath45 . in other words , one can see only those parts of an interface , that can be tangentially touched by spheres of integration centered at available transducer locations . \n the rest of the interface will be blurred . \n edges in the defrise phantom were reconstructed in figure  [ fig : defpartialscan ] as expected . when the data is collected from the eastern hemisphere \n there are enough spheres to touch tangentially all edges in the eastern hemisphere ( see fig . \n [ fig : def2d ] ) but none to do it in the western hemisphere . \n that is why the locations of the edges in the eastern hemisphere were correctly reconstructed while those in the western part were blurred . \n when the data is collected from the southern hemisphere there are enough spheres to touch tangentially all edges in the defrise phantom , hence all of them were resolved . \n from the geometric description above it is not hard to see that there may exist certain regions of reconstruction ( locations of @xmath44 , sometimes called audible zones ) where any possible pair @xmath43 belonging to @xmath42 is recognizable from @xmath1 . in our examples , \n when the data is collected from the eastern or southern hemisphere , these regions are the eastern and southern half of the unit ball correspondingly . \n notice that the image values were not reconstructed correctly , since part of the data was missing . however , certain iterative techniques allow one to improve substantially the image values in the audible zone  @xcite .      in early experimental work on thermoacoustic tomography , \n an approximate backprojection formula was used . \n it was written in analogy with the backprojection of regular radon transform and looked similar to equation  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) , except the missing weight factor @xmath47 . \n the composition of this operator with the direct radon transform is an elliptic pseudo - differential operator of order zero ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite . ) \n thus the locations and  strengths \" of image singularities are recovered correctly . \n however the values of the image function will not be recovered correctly . \n the obtained reconstructions validate the predictions correctly recovering locations of edges . \n the values of image functions are accurate near the center where but degrade slowly with distance from the origin , as expected . \n +    -0.3 in      as it was mentioned before , the reconstructions of defrise phantom have some noise along the axis of phantom s symmetry @xmath38 ( see figs . \n [ defrise ] , [ fig : defpartialscan ] ) . to discuss the reasons of appearance of that noise we consider reconstructions of some simpler phantoms consisting of indicator functions of a perfect ball . \n this allows us to compute the radon transform analytically , hence to exclude the errors in the data simulation . for every fixed @xmath48 \n , @xmath49 is a third order polynomial with respect to @xmath7 for @xmath50 and is zero for every other @xmath7 . filtered backprojection requires differentiating with respect to the radial variable @xmath7 . \n we used centered finite differences to estimate which is exact on the third degree polynomials . \n therefore , we compute exactly for all radii , @xmath7 , at least @xmath51 away from @xmath52 and @xmath53 . hence the only errors in numerical differentiation that spread into the backprojection come with the data from spheres close to the ones touching tangentially the phantom ball . \n none of these spheres passes inside the phantom ball , hence backprojection at those points is free of errors from numerical differentiation ( see fig . \n [ errors ] ) . \n now let us consider a point @xmath54 on the axis of symmetry of the ball phantoms ( the line connecting the center of the phantom ball and the origin ) . \n there are two sets of spheres that pass through that point and touch the phantom ball tangentially . \n the spheres in the first set contain the phantom ball , while the spheres in the second set do not . \n a 2d slice of this scenario is presented in figure  [ circles ] . \n notice that all spheres in the same set have the same radius . \n so the errors from the numerical differentiation that they will bring into the backprojection algorithm are absolutely the same . \n the axis of symmetry is the only location in the reconstruction region where these errors are perfectly correlated . \n this resonance increases the magnitude of errors resulting in the noise along the symmetry axis on reconstructed images ( see fig . \n [ errors ] ) .    in case of ellipsoids in the defrise \n phantom everything said above holds . \n in fact magnitude of errors is five times bigger since there are five ellipsoids with the same axis of symmetry there . at the same time \n , the reconstruction of an ellipsoidal phantom without any rotational symmetry has no axis of emphasized errors ( see fig . \n [ ellipsoid ] ) . \n we have implemented a straightforward numerical validation of both fbp and @xmath10-filtered inversion formulae for tct data on the high - frequency defrise phantom . \n fbp and @xmath10-filtered have virtually identical performance with noise - free simulated data from this high - contrast object . \n artifacts due to numerical errors are more severe in fbp than @xmath10-filtered images and might be reduced by mollification techniques  @xcite . comparing fbp and @xmath10-filtered performance in the presence of noise and for low -

[ \n fig : model ] ) . \n more explicitly , @xmath28 where @xmath29 describes the dynamics of ghost condensation , @xmath30 and ` @xmath31 ' constains the rest of sm sector and @xmath32 is gravity scale in five dimension which is related to planck scale as @xmath33 . \n the bulk mass @xmath34 is consistent with orbifold symmetry as it is @xmath35 .    to get the four dimensional effective action \n , we do the kaluza - klein(kk ) decomposition as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the dimensionless kk basis functions satisfying the equation of motion : @xmath39 for zero mode , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , the eq . \n is separable @xmath42 so is easily solved as @xmath43 for @xmath44 , right - handed zero mode is localized toward @xmath19 and left - handed zero mode is localized toward the other end point , @xmath20 . here the normalization constant @xmath45 for @xmath46-handed zero mode are determined by the normalization condition @xmath47 : @xmath48 if dirichlet boundary conditions to @xmath49 is imposed , @xmath50 at boundaries and right -

handed and right - handed states , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , \n respectively , we can construct the mass term @xmath58 with @xmath59 mass matrix @xmath60 where @xmath61 after electroweak symmetry breaking and the effective yukawa coupling for the n - th kk state is @xmath62 . \n the physical mass eigenstates and their masses could be obtained after diagonalizing @xmath63 by @xmath64 . \n if @xmath65 were zero , the matrix @xmath66 would have a zero eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath67 where the angle @xmath68 describes the mixing between the zero mode and the higher kk modes . \n thus , to the leading order in the small parameter @xmath69 , we can get the lowest eigenvalue which gives the physical neutrino mass squared : @xmath70 as the wave function of r - handed state at @xmath20 is exponentially suppressed as @xmath71 , we naturally get a small neutrino mass , @xmath72 , with a largish @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as it is clearly seen in eq . \n , the zero mode can mix with kk excitation modes but the mixing angle is highly suppressed @xmath75 . \n however the mass splitting between particle and antiparticle in the zero mode states , which we can take as a perturbation , can not be neglected and actually is important to account the minos anomaly . \n once ghost condensation takes place on @xmath19 brane , @xmath76 , the second term becomes another neutrino bilinear term @xmath77 where @xmath78 . \n a convenient parameter , @xmath79 , measures the lorentz violation . \n when @xmath80 the masses of particle ( neutrino , in our case ) and anti - particle ( anti - neutrino , in our case ) are different by @xmath81 : , the dirac equation in momentum space is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dirac mass coming from conventional higgs mechanism . in the rest frame , @xmath84 \n , the equation is reduced to @xmath85 and the mass eigenvalues are @xmath86 or @xmath87 . ] \n @xmath88 the minos data in eq . \n implies that the mass difference in neutrino and anti - neutrino would be in the range of @xmath89 or @xmath90 here we used @xmath91 to fit the correct neutrino mass scale with @xmath92 . \n note that @xmath93 is consistent with the bound @xmath94 from neutron @xmath95 decay  @xcite . \n again as the splitting is small enough we can neglect the mixing between zero mode and other kk modes . \n taking @xmath96 and the bound on the size of extra dimension ) if they are light enough . \n taking current mass bound for the higgs into account , we conclude that @xmath97 or @xmath98 is allowed by lep - ii and tevatron experiments . ] , we get the lower bound on @xmath10 from the neutrino sector , @xmath99 gev . on the other hand , from nonlinear dynamics of the gravity sector , we obtain the upper bound on @xmath10  @xcite . \n thus , there is only a small window for @xmath10:@xmath100 since @xmath10 should be pretty close to @xmath101 we expect to see twinkling of the cmb  @xcite and blinking of the light from a quasar at a large distance with the twinkling timescale @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the overall velocity of the rest frame of ghost condensation relative to the cmb and the quasar rest frame , respectively . \n there are other bounds which we should take into account but , as shall see , they do not set additional constraints . \n due to the coupling of neutrinos to ghost condensation , an ultrarelativistic neutrino emits a nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite . \n this is an analogue of erenkov radiation . demanding that neutrinos from sn1987a should not be deflected by this process , we obtain the bound  @xcite @xmath104 this is automatically satisfied if ( [ eqn : boundsonm ] ) is satisfied . if we demand that the total relative energy lost from cosmological neutrinos to nambu - goldstone bosons during the epoch between neutrino decoupling to the last scattering surface of the cmb , then we obtain the bound  @xcite @xmath105 again , this is satisfied under ( [ eqn : boundsonm ] ) . \n in this paper we have considered ghost condensation as a source of _ cpt _ violation . taking the coupling with neutrino current into account \n , we could provide a possible difference between neutrino and anti - neutrino , namely @xmath106 which has been recently hinted by minos experiment even though the result is preliminary . to avoid a sizable _ cpt _ violation in other sectors , we suggest an extra dimension model where the right - handed neutrinos in the bulk mediate the standard model sector and the ghost condensate which takes place at a distance from the standard model brane . \n the model leads to interesting observational consequences : twinkling cmb and blinking quasars with the timescale around tens to hundreds of minutes which might be within the reach of future cmb observations ( e.g. planck @xcite ) and astronomical point source observations . \n finally discussion on flavor non - diagonal _ cpt _ violation is in order . \n flavor non - diagnoal dimension five operators directly contribute to neutrino oscillation as in the standard matter effects and so are highly constrained by solar , atmospheric and other ground based neutrino experiments . \n to forbid flavor non - diagonal terms we assume flavor symmetry on the ghost condensate brane so that only flavor diagonal dimension five operators are induced at the leading order . \n on the other hand , flavor transition induced by yukawa couplings are small @xmath107 . \n the authors would thank tsutomu yanagida , hitoshi murayama and masahiro tanaka for helpful discussions and comments . \n this work was supported by the world premier international research center initiative ( wpi initiative ) by mext . \n the work of s.m . was supported in part by grant -

order dispersion and self modulation . but for femtosecond pulses another important physical effect namely , the third - order dispersion comes into play . in this case \n the appropriate evolution equation for the pulse propagation is given by @xcite @xmath7 understandably , the parameter @xmath8 is a measure of the perturbation caused by the third - order dispersion . due to the effect of perturbation \n a soliton could have wave numbers residing inside the linear spectrum of the system . \n such a soliton is called an embedded soliton @xcite . \n clearly , the embedded solitons can be in resonance with the perturbation to generate continuous wave radiation for subsequent decay . despite this , in certain parameter regimes these solitons can be stable @xcite . in view of this \n the stability analysis of embedded solitons arising in the solutions of higher - order nls equation has been subject of considerable current interest . \n the present work is an effort in this direction . \n studies in embedded solitons @xcite within the framework of a third - order nls equation indicate that these soliton exits as a continuous family . \n the members of the family being characterized by their propagation velocities are connected through a gauge transformation @xcite . \n we demonstrate the existance of such a family by using a straightforward analytical model and argue that embedded solitons can be fully stable despite their tendency to shed radiation . \n we believe that such an approach has distinct advantages to deal with physical problems because many unknown effects are then readily expressed and evaluated . to achieve our goal \n we shall derive a variational approach involving trial functions in order to describe the main characteristics of the embedded solitons as determined by the third - order nls equation in @xmath9 . \n although the chosen trial functions have a specific form , the shape parameters are allowed to evolve as the solitons propagate . with this assumtion \n the evolution equation under consideration simplifies to a reduced lagrangian problem @xcite . \n we shall try to study the stability of embedded solitons by taking variations of this lagrangian with respect to the shape parameters . \n for the nls equation in @xmath6 there exists a well - defined spectral problem @xcite such that one can write a closed form analytical solution of it in terms of sech functions . \n as opposed to this , the third - order nls equation can not be solved analytically . keeping this in view we look for a variational treatment of @xmath9 to find an accurate approximation solution . for our treatment \n we will essentially rely on a ritz optimization procedure @xcite applied to the lagrangian function for the nls equation in @xmath9 . \n we have found that the action functional @xmath10 with the lagrangian density @xmath11 reproduces the third - order nls equation via the hamilton s variational principle .    in the ritz optimization procedure , the first variation of the action functional is made to vanish for a suitable chosen trial function . in analogy with the well - known solution of @xmath6 \n we introduce a sech type trial function @xmath12\\times \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\nonumber \\\\\\exp i\\left [ v(x)(t - y(x))+\\frac{b(x)}{2a(x)}\\left ( t - y(x)\\right)^2+\\sigma(x ) \\right ]   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are real functions of @xmath3 . \n the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 are related to the three lowest -

{"ContextTokens": 2005, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "hash table is a common data structure used in large set of data storage and retrieval . \n it has an o(1 ) lookup time on average , but the worst case lookup time can be as bad as o(@xmath1)(@xmath1 is the size of the hash table ) \n . such a time variation is essentially caused by possibly many collisions during keys hashing . in this paper \n , we present a set of hash table schemes called cascade hash tables which consist of several levels(@xmath2 ) of hash tables with different size . \n after constant probes , if an item ca nt find a free  cell\"(slot ) in the first level table , it will try to find a cell in the second level , or subsequent lower levels . with this simple strategy \n , these hash tables will have descendent load factors , therefore descendent collision probabilities . \n so finally the probability that the item can not find an empty cell in any hash table is slight . \n this enables the whole hash table to reach a high load factor with constant probes in random generated test set , before a _ \n crisis_(the situation that when an item comes , we can not find a free slot in limited probes in any hash table ) happens . \n a hash table is a data structure that associates keys with values . \n the primary operation it supports efficiently is a _ \n lookup _ : given a key ( e.g. a person s name ) , find the corresponding value ( e.g. that person s telephone number ) . \n it works by transforming the key using a _ hash function _ into a hash  a number that the hash table uses to locate the desired value . \n a hash function is a many - to - one mapping , which maps keys in a large domain to hashes in a relative small range . so collisions among keys which are mapped to the same hash are inevitable . \n differences among hash table schemes lie in hash function and collision resolution strategy . \n generally a string type key is hashed into an integer by a hash function , then mapped into an index not bigger than the table size(a common method is to compute the hash value modulo the table size . \n there are various hash functions on strings , such as crc , _ \n lookup2 _ and md5 . as to integer type keys , \n they are directly mapped into indices .      if two keys hash to the same index , the corresponding records can not be stored in the same location . \n so , if it s already occupied , we must find another location to store the new record , and do it so that we can find it when we look it up later on . \n the most popular collision resolution techniques are _ chaining _ and _ open addressing_.    in the chained hash table technique , each slot in the array references a linked list of inserted records that collide to the same slot . \n insertion requires finding the correct slot , and appending to either end of the list in that slot ; deletion requires searching the list and removal . \n this technique is intuitive and the performance degrades gracefully when the load factor increases . \n but if the record size is small , the overhead of the linked list is significant . \n additionally , traversing a linked list has poor cache performance . \n some popular hash table implementations , such as stl , use this technique . \n open addressing hash tables store the colliding records directly within the array . \n a hash collision is resolved by probing through alternate locations in the array(the probe sequence ) until either the target record is found , or an unused array slot is found , which indicates that there is no such key in the table . \n well known probe sequences include : linear probing , in which the interval between probes is fixed  often at 1 ; quadratic probing , in which the interval between probes increases linearly ( hence , the indices are described by a quadratic function ) ; double hashing , in which the interval between probes is fixed for each record but is computed by another hash function . \n any of these methods may probe indefinite number of locations , even as many as @xmath1 in the worst case ! \n we call these methods _ unlimited_. a method is _ limited _ , if the number of probes can not exceed some limit . \n in the implementation of @xmath3-level cascade hash table , we have @xmath3 hash tables , and use limited double hashing in every level of table . in turn , the hash table size is half of its preceding hash table(the proportion @xmath4 is chosen empirically ) . \n we limit the total number of probes to @xmath5 . \n thus in every level , the probe number is @xmath6 . here \n @xmath3 is a factor of @xmath5 , so @xmath7 . if an item ca nt find a free cell in level @xmath8 in @xmath9 probes , it will probe in level 2 , and if still with bad luck , it turns to search lower levels . \n if a crisis happens , the hash table will be enlarged and rehashed . \n the lookup procedure is similar to the insertion procedure . \n it also takes not more than @xmath5 steps .    clearly , insertion and \n lookup both take at most @xmath5 probes , so the time complexity of cascade hash table is o(1 ) .    specially , when @xmath10 , it s the ordinary ( limited ) double - hashing scheme . when @xmath11(one probe every level ) \n , it s the  multilevel adaptive hashing \" scheme presented by paper@xcite . \n experiments show that it is not the best configuration . \n are all occupied ) ] \n by experiments on random data sets , we get the result as in table [ result1 ] , [ result2 ] and [ result3 ] .    .experiment result 1 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from these tables , we can see that in a certain level of a multiple level hash table , the load factor decreases drastically . \n take three - level hash table for example , when hash tables are  full\"(not really full , but we can not insert the coming new item into it in limited probes ) , @xmath12 is around @xmath13 , @xmath14 is @xmath15 , but @xmath16 is only around @xmath17 . \n so if a new item comes , the _ crisis rate_(the probability that the item ca nt find an empty room in any hash table ) is not bigger than @xmath18 . \n given a one level hash table , assume it has a load factor of @xmath19 , then it will take at least @xmath20 probes on average to obtain the same small crisis rate(which ensures a high load factor ) as 3-level cascade hash table . \n but cascade hash table just makes @xmath5 probes meanwhile .    to our surprise \n , the space efficiency of @xmath3-level hash table does nt increase monotonically with @xmath3 . at @xmath21 , \n the space efficiency hits the climax , then falls down at @xmath11 . \n in this paper , we introduce a series of hash table schemes  cascade hash tables . \n it uses @xmath3 levels of hash tables ; in every level , we use limited double hashing to make probes . \n smaller hash tables work as fail - safes of bigger hash tables . roughly speaking , \n different tables are similar with sieves with holes in different shapes . \n we hope no object escape through these sieves . with more sieves , \n the chance that an object is screened in some level is bigger . \n the idea is simple , but its performance exceeds the ordinary one level hash table dramatically when there are more than @xmath22 levels . by choosing @xmath21 , it s much better than the hash scheme proposed in paper@xcite . \n obviously , if we permit a larger total probe count , we can achieve higher load factor . \n but the average speed will be slower . \n so a user can choose an appropriate configuration which balances best between speed and space efficiency to him . \n 12 andrei z. broder , anna r. karlin . \n multilevel adaptive hashing . in proceedings of the 1st acm - siam symposium on discrete algorithms ( soda ) , pp . \n 43 - 53 , 1990 . \n bill mcquain . \n hashing , slides for class cs 2604 . \n http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs2604/summerii_2005/notes/c10.hashing.pdf thomas h. cormen , charles e. leiserson , ronald l. rivest and clifford stein . \n introduction to algorithms , second edition . the mit press \n hash table \" entry in wikipedia .", "StartTimeOffset": 672435981586, "RequestID": "81e9f4abe6c9482bada7f4db74912259", "TotalTokens": 2130}
{"ContextTokens": 2808, "GeneratedTokens": 153, "SynthesizedBody": "massive ( @xmath2 ) stars are the progenitors of most of supernovae ( sne ) . the explosion of a massive star results in the origin of an extended ( tens of parsecs ) diffuse supernova remnant ( snr ) and a compact stellar remnant . in most cases \n the stellar remnant is a neutron star ( ns ) . \n therefore most of snrs should be associated with nss . \n a ns could be located within the confine of the associated snr or beyond it , depending on the kick velocity received by the star , the age of the system and some other factors ( see below ) . \n however , only a small fraction of known snrs was found to be associated with nss . \n moreover , it is believed that some of proposed ns / snr associations are the result of geometrical projection . \n thus , the obvious lack of associations should be explained or filled up . \n the latter seems to be more attractive and fruitful in view of the recent splash of discoveries of nss in snrs . \n the reliability of ns / snr associations is usually assessed with help of several criteria ( see e.g. kaspi 1996 ) . \n some of them are trivial , i.e. should be fulfilled for any association . \n other criteria are based on the use of the standard sedov - taylor model of snrs and therefore are over - simplified . \n the application of these criteria can lead to rejection of genuine associations ( gvaramadze 2000 , 2002a , b ; bock & gvaramadze 2002 ) . \n the point is that the massive stars strongly modify their environs by virtue of their winds and ionizing emission , and it is the subsequent interaction of sn blast waves with their processed ambient medium that results in the observed snrs ( e.g. shull et al . \n 1985 ; ciotti & dercole 1989 ; chevalier & liang 1989 ) . \n it is clear that the presence of circumstellar and interstellar structures could strongly affect the standard sequence and duration of evolutionary stages of the sn blast wave ( e.g. woltjer 1972 ) . \n for example , the sedov - taylor stage could be absent at all if the sn exploded within the wind - blown cavity surrounded by a massive shell ( e.g. franco et al . \n another important point is the proper motion of massive stars , which causes them to explode far from the geometrical centres of their cavities and makes the cavities and other circumstellar and interstellar structures non - spherically - symmetrical . \n the natural consequence of an off - centred cavity sn explosion is that the sn blast centre does not coincide with the geometrical centre of the future snr . \n taking into account these considerations allows us to enlarge the circle of possible ns / snr associations and to explain the morphological peculiarities of snrs ( gvaramadze 2000 , 2002a , b ; bock & gvaramadze 2002 ; gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ) . on the other hand \n , the better understanding of origin of peculiar snrs helps to infer the  true \" sn explosion sites in these remnants , and therefore to search for new nss associated with them ( gvaramadze 2002b ; gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2002 , 2003 ; see also sect.4 ) .    to illustrate the significance of the concept of off - centred cavity sn explosion \n we show how this concept could be used to preclude the anti - humane decapitating the duck ( g5.4@xmath01.2 @xmath1 g5.27@xmath00.9 ) and dismembering the swan ( cygnus loop , g74.0@xmath08.5 ) recently attempted , respectively , by thorsett , brisken , & goss ( 2002 ) and uyaniker et al . \n ( 2002 ) , and to search for a ns associated with the snr rcw86 ( msh14 - 6_3 _ , g315.4@xmath02.30 ) . \n the association between the pulsar b1757@xmath024 and the snr g5.4@xmath01.2 was for a long time one of a few most reliable ns / snr associations . \n however , recently this association was questioned by thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) , who suggested that psr b1757@xmath024 and the compact nebula g5.27@xmath00.9 behind it ( the  head \" of the  duck \" ) are unrelated to the snr g5.4@xmath01.2 ( the  body \" of the  duck \" ) . to justify the decapitating the duck , thorsett et al . used a set of standard criteria for evaluating the reliability of ns / snr associations ( e.g. kaspi 1996 ) , which include the agreement of distance and age estimates for pulsar and snr , the consistence of the implied pulsar transverse velocity ( i.e. the velocity inferred by the displacement of the pulsar from the geometrical centre of the snr ) with the measured ( e.g. proper motion ) velocity , and the correct orientation of the vector of pulsar transverse motion . \n we agree with thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) that the estimates of the distance to the pulsar and the snr are not inconsistent and therefore will concentrate on the rest three criteria .    two main arguments against the association put forward by thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) are based on their interferometric proper motion measurements of psr b1757@xmath024 [ an upper limit on the westward motion of the pulsar , @xmath3 \n @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the distance to the snr in units of 4.5 kpc ) was found to be an order of magnitude less than the implied transverse velocity ] and the  incorrect \" orientation of the pulsar proper motion ( a cometary - shaped nebula behind the pulsar does not point back to the geometrical centre of g5.4@xmath01.2 ) . both  inconsistencies \" , however , could be removed if the snr g5.4@xmath01.2 is the result of off - centred cavity sn explosion . \n we suggest that : a ) psr b1757@xmath024 was born near the northwest edge of a wind - blown cavity ; b ) the cavity was surrounded by a massive ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the sn ejecta ) wind - driven shell ( see also gvaramadze 2000 , 2002b ) . \n the first suggestion implies that : _ i _ ) the  true \" transverse velocity of the pulsar is much smaller than the implied one ; _ ii _ ) the tail behind the pulsar has a correct orientation . \n the second suggestion implies that : _ i _ ) \n the sn blast wave was drastically decelerated by the interaction with the wind - driven shell , so that the pulsar ( moving in the westward direction at the velocity @xmath10 ) was able to overrun the resulting snr ; _ ii _ ) the current radius of the snr is about the same as the radius of the wind - driven shell . \n the proper motion measurements by thorsett et al . \n ( 2002 ) provide an estimate of the kinematic age of the system : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance travelled by the pulsar from its birthplace . for @xmath13 pc \n ( gvaramadze , in preparation ) , one has @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the characteristic age of the pulsar . \n the  true \" pulsar age , however , could be equal to @xmath16 if the spin - down rate of the pulsar is mainly due to the interaction between the pulsar s magnetosphere and the dense ambient medium ( see gvaramadze 2001 and references therein ) , or if the pulsar braking index is @xmath17 ( cf . gaensler & frail 2000 ) . \n recent polarized intensity image of the cygnus loop obtained by uyaniker et al . \n ( 2002 ) revealed a prominent shell - like structure encompassing the  break - out \" region in the south of this snr . \n uyaniker et al . \n advocated the widely accepted point of view on the origin of snrs consisting of two overlapping shells and suggested that the cygnus loop is actually two individual snrs interacting with each other . \n an alternative possibility is that the snrs of this type are due to off - centred cavity sn explosions ( dubner et al . \n 1994 , gvaramadze 2002b ) . \n we suggest that the snr cygnus loop is the result of sn explosion near the south edge of a cavity blown up by the sn progenitor during the main - sequence phase ( cf . \n gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ; see also sect.4 ) . \n this implies that the conventional shell of the cygnus loop corresponds to the former cavity re - energized by the sn blast wave , while the south shell is created by the interaction of the sn blast wave with the unperturbed interstellar medium . \n accordingly , we expect that only one stellar remnant is associated with both shells . \n uyaniker et al . \n ( 2002 ) discussed eight reasons for considering the cygnus loop as two colliding snrs . \n we note however that these reasons could also be considered as indications of the off - centred cavity sn explosion . \n for example , we believe that the presence of a ns candidate ( miyata et al . 2001 ) near the centre of the south shell is a strong argument in support of our suggestion . \n note also that the absence of centrally peaked x - ray emission in the south shell implies that the sn progenitor exploded after the red supergiant phase of its evolution ( cf . \n gvaramadze 2002b ) , i.e. the initial mass of the progenitor was @xmath18 . \n rcw86 is a bright shell - like snr with a peculiar protrusion in the southwest encompassing a prominent hemispherical optical nebula . \n we believe that rcw86 is the result of a cavity sn explosion of a moving massive star , which after the main - sequence phase has evolved through the red supergiant phase , and then experienced a short  blue loop \" ( gvaramadze & vikhlinin 2003 ;

axis and @xmath17 along the x - axis , there is a `` giant '' size backending at about half the excitation energy available to the system . \n but this is merely a reflection of the fact that the excitation energy available to the system is finite . \n this will drastically change in the nuclear lgm where availability of kinetic energy will remove the upper limit . \n for canonical calculation , we pick a positive temperature : to get the caloric curve we compute @xmath18 . subtracting out the ground state energy we obtain the plot in fig . \n the same procedure can be used for negative temperature . \n both are used in fig . \n the similarity between caloric curves calculated in the microcanonical and canonical models is obvious although there are quantitative differences . \n from slgm we now turn to nuclear lgm which serves as a model for nuclear disaasembly . \n this was the case presented in @xcite . \n the excitation energy can come from two sources now : kinetic and potential . \n consequently , we compute @xmath19 where @xmath20 is discrete and taken from the table and @xmath21 is taken to be the integral @xmath22 @xmath23 in our chosen case is 11 . \n now there is no upper limit to @xmath9 . in fig . \n 3 we have plotted @xmath19 . the most important difference from fig . 1 \n is that the negative temperature zone has completely disappeared . \n thus the difference in the caloric curves obtained from slgm and lgm will be profound . \n there are two ways one can calculate the temperature in the microcanonical model . \n one is the standard formula : @xmath24 where @xmath25 the other intuitive approach would be to make the following ansatz . \n although we are talking of one system only , formally eq . \n ( 5.2 ) is similar to that of two systems characterised by @xmath8 and @xmath26 which share energy with each other but are insulated from the rest of the universe so that the total energy @xmath9 does not change . \n if the systems characterised by @xmath8 and @xmath27 are large then the sum above would be dominated by the largest term in the sum which is obtained when the temperature of each subsystem is the same , i.e. , @xmath28 . \n we now use @xmath29 . \n this leads to @xmath30 . \n this @xmath31 and the standard definition of @xmath17 agree quite well as can be seen in fig.4 . \n notice also there is no backbending in the microcanonical caloric curve . \n if one wants to use the microcanonical nuclear lgm for practical calculations with nucleon numbers about 100 or higher and also wants to obtain a value for temperature , getting the temperature from kinetic energy is the only easy option .    in fig.4 \n we have also shown the caloric curve in nuclear lgm in the canonical model . \n this agrees with the microcanonical calculation quite well . \n in the particular example ( 11 particles in @xmath0 boxes in the nuclear lgm ) , one has exact expressions for microcanonical density of states . \n one can also compute numerically the canonical partition function . in nuclear physics one \n often has numerical values for canonical or grand canonical partition functions . \n the direct expression for the microcanonical density of state is usually intractable and in order to obtain a value one uses the saddle - point approximation @xcite . \n we can use the nuclear lgm to test the accuracy of the saddle - point approximation since here both the microcanonical density of state and the canonical partition function are directly calculable . \n the microcanonical density of states and the canonical partition function are related by @xmath32 . \n the inverse transformation is @xmath33 . \n the saddle - point approximation for this integral leads to @xmath34}{\\sqrt{2\\pi ( < e^2>-<e>^2)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the value of @xmath35 is so chosen that at this value @xmath36 . \n the saddle - point approximation for the density of states is also compared to the exact density of state in fig.3 . except for low excitation energies \n , the saddle - point approximation is seen to be excellent . \n we performed an exact microcanonical calculation of the caloric curve of 11 particles in a @xmath0 lattice . \n the caloric curve does not have a backbending which means there was no negative specific heat in this model for 11 particles . \n we then conclude that the phenomenon of backbending can be quite model dependent . \n this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering council of canada and by _ le fonds pour la formation de chercheurs et laide  la recherche du qubec_. we acknowledge communications with professor dieter gross .", "StartTimeOffset": 716268419905, "RequestID": "7a196d43805a4a7a923265ddbd19bbd7", "TotalTokens": 2334}

to - light ratio , which is assumed to be uniform throughout a galaxy , contrary to what we should expect based on well known spatial variations of stellar population and dust properties . \n hence , resolving the distribution of stellar mass is crucial to properly measure total stellar mass and mass density and to start investigating the structure and dynamics of galaxies in an unbiased way . having access to the mass distribution also allows to address questions like : is there any relation between _ local _ stellar mass density and the _ local _ sed and physical properties _ within _ a galaxy , similarly to the relations observed _ globally _ ? \n if so , what does it tell us about the internal mechanisms of galaxy evolution ?    with these goals and questions in mind , we have developed a new method to build stellar mass maps of galaxies ( * ? ? ? \n * zcr09 hereafter ) , which we review in this contribution ( sec . 2 ) . \n we also present preliminary results on the colour - stellar mass density relation within galaxies for a small sample of different morphological types ( sec . \n as described in zcr09 , our goal is to provide a computationally fast and observationally cheap method to obtain stellar mass maps . \n we express the surface stellar mass density at any given position @xmath2 of a galaxy as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the surface brightness in the chosen ` luminance ' band of effective wavelength @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the corresponding effective m / l ratio . in turn \n , we want to express @xmath7 as a function of colour indexes . despite the diversity of stellar population parameters and dust properties , \n if the luminance band and the colour indexes are appropriately chosen , the scatter of @xmath7 as a function of colour(s ) can be reasonably small ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n we choose the @xmath8 band ( largely equivalent to @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) as luminance band and we use @xmath0 and @xmath1 colour indexes to predict m / l@xmath11 . \n this choice is supported by the fact that m / l variations in nir are minimal with respect to shorter wavelengths , while these two colours are the best combination in terms of sensitivity and wavelength leverage . based upon the 2007 version of the @xcite code , which implements updated prescriptions for the tp - agb stellar evolutionary phase according to @xcite \n , we build a monte carlo library of 50,000 stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models with a variety of star formation histories , both continuous and bursty , metallicities and dust attenuations  la @xcite . in this way \n we mean to cover as uniformly as possible the parameter space occupied by individual regions in galaxies on scales of @xmath12  pc , from old , metal - rich bulges / spheroids , to young spiral arms with different degrees of dust absorption . then we bin the models in cells of @xmath13  mag@xmath14 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 and for each cell we consider the median m / l@xmath11 . \n this look - up table is then used to assign the median - likelihood m / l to each pixel in a galaxy , depending on its colours . \n our approach is therefore bayesian rather than frequentist and , as such , depends to some extent on the chosen prior distribution of models : a different choice of sfhs in particular can affect the m / l of the bluest stellar populations ( see zcr09 for a detailed discussion ) . \n we confirm ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) that the treatment of the tp - agb phase in the sps models has a great systematic impact on the resulting colours and m / l in nir , but this is mainly limited to young / blue stellar populations . \n apart from systematic effects , we find that the confidence half - range for the m / l is @xmath15% over most of the colour space , with the notable exception of the stellar populations with ages @xmath16  gyr , where the stellar evolution is very rapid and results in larger ranges , up to a factor 2 . \n the use of two colours is crucial to obtain such accurate estimates : by neglecting the dependence on @xmath1 one would easily over / under - estimate the m / l by a factor 2 to 3.-band and the @xmath0 colour as m / l predictor gives results that are in very good agreement with those based on @xmath17 in most cases , except in stellar populations dominated by a very young burst or with very large extinction . ]    to test our stellar mass mapping method we select a sample of 9 nearby galaxies , which are also part of the sings survey @xcite and for which optical sdss imaging and medium - deep nir imaging ( either from gold mine , @xcite , or ukidss , @xcite ) are available . \n the sample spans all range of morphologies , from ellipticals to late spirals . as fluxes and colours in individual pixels \n have to be accurate at few percent level in order for our method to work , it is necessary to pre - process the images to ensure that sufficiently high s / n can be reached also in the regions with surface brightness as low as 24 - 25 mag@xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 . \n this is done using a newly developed adaptive smoothing code adaptsmooth ( zibetti in prep . , zcr09 ) , which preserves the maximum spatial resolution compatible with the requested s / n . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows the maps of effective @xmath20 for the 9 galaxies of the sample . \n earlier type galaxies have more uniform and higher \n m / l , on average . \n the young stellar populations that characterize spiral arms result in lower m / l ratios , which in turn decrease the spiral arm contrast . \n the resulting stellar mass maps reveal that the structure of spiral galaxies is significantly smoother than it appears at any optical or nir wavelength . \n the colour gradients , especially visible in spiral galaxies , result in m / l gradients , which in turn affect the structural parameters and make them differ from the ones derived from light distribution . \n in particular , the effective radius of spirals is smaller when the stellar mass distribution is used .    in fig . \n [ fig1 ] one can see lanes of much higher m / l ( especially ngc4569 and ngc4536 ) , which correspond to dust lanes . \n these regions can hide a significant amount of stellar mass , although the emerging light hardly affects the global luminosity and colours of the galaxy . \n as we show in zcr09 , this causes stellar masses obtained from global photometry to be biased low with respect to what one gets from integrating resolved stellar mass maps : the latter may miss up to 40% of the total stellar mass of a galaxy if dust obscured regions are very extended ( as in ngc4569 and ngc4536 ) . \n based on the analysis of the previous section , we study the correlation between colours ( namely the optical @xmath0 ) and the surface stellar mass density _ within _ each galaxy . \n the distribution of pixels as a function of these two quantities are shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , where the grey scale denotes the density of pixels . as a general result \n , we see that the colour positively correlates with surface stellar mass density : galaxies are redder in higher density regions . \n although this holds for all galaxies , the slope and the dispersion of the correlation varies a lot along the morphological sequence . for a typical elliptical galaxy \n the relation is very flat and very tight ( consistent with a scatter due to photometric errors only ) . \n as we move to later types the colour - mass relation steepens , with low - density regions becoming increasingly bluer , while the highest density regions have roughly constant red colours . \n we can interpret this as a sign that star formation prefers low density and that the colour - morphology relation is mainly set by the relative weight of the younger stellar populations in the lower density regions with respect to the red high - density ` cores ' . \n in addition , we see that the scatter around the mean relation increases going to later types , which have a more disomogeneous distribution of physical properties at given surface mass density . \n the presence of dust also increases the scatter , especially at high surface mass density . \n these preliminary results based on a small sample of only 9 galaxies will be put on a much more solid ground , both from the statistical and physical point of view , by the forthcoming analysis of a larger sample of galaxies for which multiwavelength observations , from uv to radio , are available .", "StartTimeOffset": 737055743709, "RequestID": "0c0b0537e4bd4f6ab2fd352ef336c092", "TotalTokens": 2309}

spherical particles are rather small as it is the case for spherical grains . \n the shape effects are the most prominent in the case of grains consisting of absorbing materials ( see figs . \n [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] ) . \n such particles emit more radiation at long wavelengths where the imaginary part of the refractive index @xmath34 is large and increases significantly with wavelength ( excluding ac1 ) . in comparison with other materials presented in fig . \n [ f1 ] , the iron particles absorb much more radiation at visual wavelengths . for intermediate values of @xmath9 , \n the emissive capacity of spheroids is almost the same as for spheres and therefore spheroids have larger temperatures . \n this explains the peculiar curves for iron in fig . \n note also that for extremely prolate or oblate particles the decrease of the temperature with the growth @xmath9 ceases . \n for example , for prolate particles from cel1000 the ratio @xmath35 + @xmath36 0.51 , 0.38 , 0.28 and 0.26 if @xmath37 and 100 , respectively . \n the behaviour of @xmath34 for all silicates is rather similar and the values of @xmath34 in the ir are usually smaller than for materials with metallic properties . as a result , \n the ratio @xmath38 changes in narrower limits in fig . \n [ f2 ] in comparison with fig . \n [ f1 ] . \n the behaviour similar to described above is kept when the incident radiation is slightly polarized ( @xmath39 ) or its spectral distribution changes due to attenuation of the uv field and other components in eq . \n ( [ isrf ] ) . in both cases \n the relative changes of the ratio of temperatures remain in the limits smaller than 5% . \n the alignment of dust grains does not affect strongly the temperature of non - spherical interstellar grains . \n its influence becomes more important for particles immersed in an anisotropic radiation field like in circumstellar shells ( especially in the case of oblate grains , see voshchinnikov & semenov  @xcite for discussion ) . \n a similar situation exists near the the edges of dark interstellar clouds . for a fixed @xmath12 the difference in temperatures of porous spherical and non - spherical particles is smaller than for compact ones . \n the temperature of interstellar dust grains can be found by fitting the galactic ir emission by modified blackbody curves . \n the dust emission spectrum obtained from cobe data for dust associated with hi gas can be represented by a single modified blackbody curve with @xmath40 ( boulanger et al . \n @xcite ) . in order to compare the observationally - based emissivity law with dust models , the shape , size , and porosity distribution of the particles have to be taken into account . \n it is not the goal of this paper to perform such an analysis , but to provide necessary input data . from table  1 \n , it can be clearly seen that the temperature of refractory spheroidal grains with @xmath41 ranges between 12.1k and 15.7k , lower than predicted by the observations . \n the steady - state temperature of grains also dictates the efficiency of the process of molecule formation on grain surfaces . as it is shown by pirronello et al . \n ( @xcite ) , the decrease of a grain temperature by 20  30% can enhance the efficiency of hydrogen recombination by 2  4 times . \n in the conditions typical of the interstellar radiation field the temperature of the non - spherical ( spheroidal ) grains deviates from that of spheres of the same volume less than 10% if the aspect ratios @xmath0 . \n more elongated or flattened particles are usually cooler than spheres and in some cases the temperatures may differ by a factor 2 and more . \n the shape effects are almost independent of particle size but increase with the growth of the material absorption in the infrared ( i.e. , they are more important for carbonaceous and metallic particles than for silicates and ices ) . in dark interstellar clouds the non - spherical particles \n will be cooler than spheres , facilitating the molecule formation on grain surfaces . \n boulanger f. , abergel a. , bernard j .- \n , et al . , 1996 , \n a&a 312 , 256 dombrovski v.a . , 1949 , doklady akad . \n nauk armenia , 10 , 199 greenberg j.m . , 1968 , in : middlehurst b.m . , aller l.h . \n ( eds . ) , stars and stellar systems . \n vii , uni . \n chicago press , p.  221 \n greenberg j.m . , 1971 , a&a 12 , 240 greenberg j.m . , \n shah g.a . , 1971 , a&a 12 , 250 hall j.s . , 1949 , \n science 109 , 166 henning th . \n , 1998 , chem . soc . \n 27 , 315 henning th . \n , ilin v.b . \n , krivova n.a . , et al . , 1999 , \n a&as 136 , 405 hiltner w.a . , 1949 , \n science 109 , 165 ilin v.b . \n , voshchinnikov n.v . , 1998 , a&as 128 , 187 jger c. , mutschke h. , henning th . , 1998 , a&a 332 , 291 mathis j.s . , mezger p.g \n , panagia n. , 1983 , a&a 128 , 212 mezger p.g . , mathis j.s . , panagia n. , 1982 , a&a 105 , 372 ossenkopf v. , henning th . \n , mathis j.s . , 1992 , a&a 261 , 567 pirronello v. , liu c. , roser j.e . \n , vidali g. , 1999 , a&a 344 , 681 van de hulst h.c . , 1949 , rech . \n utrecht 11 , pt . 2 voshchinnikov n.v . , \n farafonov v.g . , 1993 , \n ap&ss 204 , 19 voshchinnikov n.v . \n , semenov d.a . , 1999 , \n , in preparation voshchinnikov n.v . , \n ilin v.b . , henning th . , et al . , 1999 , jqsrt , in press whittet d.c.b . , 1992 , \n dust in the galactic environments , institute of physics publishing , new york", "StartTimeOffset": 763045208056, "RequestID": "902acee6ecdf4052af97a014dafd6cce", "TotalTokens": 4149}
{"ContextTokens": 2942, "GeneratedTokens": 140, "SynthesizedBody": "one approach for probing light curves which has received attention  @xcite is to express them as a series of displaced pulses , each with a parametric form . \n there is an appeal to this approach because fitting routines are well - understood and interpretations of rise time , decay time , full width at half max , etc , are possible . on the other hand \n , one must make certain assumptions when using the pulse - fitting procedure such as the choice of the functional form to use for an individual pulse and the number of parameters to be included in the fitting function . \n moreover , light with high variability at low power may show variations which are not statistically significant . \n a complementary approach using a wavelet - based analysis of a set of both long and short grb light curves is discussed by  @xcite in which a time scale , @xmath0 , is identified that marks the transition from white noise to a power law in the power density spectrum ( a @xmath1 behavior ) . \n it is argued that over time scales smaller than @xmath0 the light curves appear stochastic and signal power is distributed uniformly . at time scales larger than @xmath0 , identifiable structures ( such as pulses ) with signal power are no longer distributed uniformly over the periods of light variation . for this reason @xmath0 \n is referred to as the _ minimum variability time scale_.    the analysis presented in  @xcite is a non - parametric approach to probing light curves for time scales . \n it makes no assumptions about the nature of the structures in a given light curve that give rise to the @xmath1 character . \n the technique , however , offers no firm connection between @xmath0 and the constituent structures although it seems reasonable to associate @xmath0 with the scale of the smallest emitting structures present . \n results from an application of a log - normal pulse - fitting procedure to grb light curves have been published by  @xcite . in this paper \n we make a meta - analysis of the timing results presented by  @xcite compared with the techniques of  @xcite for a set of 34 grbs used in both studies . \n we begin by considering the relation between @xmath0 and the pulse parameters given in table 3 of  @xcite . \n the parameters with temporal units in table 3 are : _ time - since - trigger _ , _ rise time _ , _ decay time _ , and _ fwhm_. in all , 34 grbs comprising 379 pulses are considered here . \n we note that rise time , decay time , and fwhm as presented in table 3 of  @xcite are tightly correlated and for the argument that follows are interchangeable without affecting the conclusions . \n however , we use rise time to make our argument because , as  @xcite noted , rise times are observed to be shorter than decay time and fwhm ( see table 3 in  @xcite ) . \n we considered only those light curves from nai detectors and summed over the energy acceptance as in table 3 of  @xcite and in  @xcite .    in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] we plot the rise time for all 379 pulses ( 34 grbs ) along the vertical axis and @xmath0 along the horizontal . \n note that for each grb for which one @xmath0 is computed , there is a possibility for multiple pulses and therefore multiple rise times , hence the vertical columns of rise times for a single value of @xmath0 . \n for a given column of pulse times the shortest pulse rise times are at the bottom and one finds larger rise times by moving up the column . \n an equality line is also shown which is the locus where @xmath0 equals rise time . \n arguing as we do that @xmath0 represents the minimum variability time scale the space in the @xmath0-rise time plane below the equality line should be interpreted as a structureless white noise region . \n if some method were capable of discerning light curve structure in the region we define as white noise , then our assertion of having found a minimum variability time scale will have been disproven . indeed , in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] there are 27 pulses with rise times below the equality line . \n the uncertainties accompanying these 27 rise times are small , making their intrusion into the white noise region significant .    [ \n cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : goodshortrisetimes ]    however , a closer inspection of table 3 of  @xcite reveals that there are 20 light pulses in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] with rise times that are _ smaller _ than the smallest bin widths , in some cases smaller by factors of ten or a hundred . \n moreover , of those 20 pulses there are 16 pulses in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] with full widths at half max that are _ smaller _ than the smallest bin widths and indeed those 16 all fall below the equality line . \n while it seems that inclusion of these pulses in table 3 is important for the sake of completeness , we question the physical reality of these pulses . \n note that in  @xcite all light curves are binned at 200 microseconds . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errs ] shows the effect of removing the 20 non - physical pulses . \n = rise time . \n we identify the area below the line with white noise . \n the data are expected to press up against the line from above but not to cross it . \n , width=317 ]        note that in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errs ] the white noise region has been vacated by all but seven points and none of the pulse rise times above the equality line have been disturbed by the bin width cut . for the seven points that remain beneath the equality line , \n we show in table  [ table : goodshortrisetimes ] that six are within one sigma of the equality line . \n we make one other point regarding the pulse rise times in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] and fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errs ] , in particular regarding the size of the uncertainties . of the 379 pulse rise times reported by  @xcite and \n used for this meta - analysis , 301 have uncertainties smaller than the binning of the light curve , in some cases hundreds or thousands of times smaller . \n we argue that a conservative estimate of the uncertainties for the pulse rise times should be no smaller than a bin width . \n thus , we add in quadrature a bin width ( as reported in table 3 of  @xcite ) to the rise time uncertainties ( also reported in table 3 of  @xcite ) and plot the result in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_combquaderrs ] .    in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_combquaderrsmin ] we plot only the smallest rise times for each grb against @xmath0 . \n we argue that by rejecting pulse rise times smaller than light curve bin widths and by folding rise time uncertainties with a bin width we get strong evidence that @xcite and @xcite have tracked the same physical observables over approximately three orders of magnitude using independent methods .    . \n we have folded a single bin width into the rise time uncertainties.,width=317 ]     but with only smallest rise times included . \n note that the equality line between @xmath0 and rise time marks a boundary between scaling processes and white noise and gives substance to the interpretation of the minimum variability time scale.,width=317 ] \n for a large sample of short and long fermi gbm bursts , @xcite used a technique based on wavelets to determine the minimum variability time scale , @xmath0 . \n the authors associate this time scale with a transition from red - noise processes to parts of the power spectrum dominated by white noise or random noise components . \n accordingly , the authors note that this time scale is the shortest resolvable variability time for physical processes intrinsic to the grb . \n in addition , histograms of the values of @xmath0 for long and short grbs were shown to exhibit a clear temporal offset in the mean @xmath0 values for long and short grbs .    in a separate analysis , using a particular functional form for pulse shapes , @xcite have extracted an extensive set of key pulse parameters such as rise times , decay times , widths ( fwhm ) , and times since trigger for a host of bright grbs detected by fermi / gbm . using the fwhm values \n , these authors also reported a significant temporal offset between the mean values for long and short grbs . \n although neither group offers a concrete explanation for the temporal difference between the distributions of long and short grbs , it is noteworthy that they arrive at a result which is quantitatively in good agreement with one another , especially having used independent approaches . both sets of analyses also suggest scaling trends between characteristic timescales . in the case of minimum variability timescales the trend is between @xmath0 and the duration of the burst , typically denoted by @xmath2 . for the pulse - shape analysis , the trend is more readily evident and is demonstrated through a number of positive correlations involving key parameters such as rise times , decay times and fwhm times . \n it is relatively straightforward to interpret the scaling trends in terms of the internal shock model in which the basic units of emission are assumed to be pulses that are produced via the collision of relativistic shells emitted by the central engine . in the case of the pulse - fitting method \n this is essentially the default assumption . \n indeed , @xcite in their study of the brightest batse bursts with @xmath3 sec were the first to demonstrate this explicitly by identifying and fitting distinct pulses and showing a strong positive correlation between the number of pulses and the duration of the burst . \n more recent studies ,  @xcite have provided further evidence for the pulse paradigm view of the prompt emission in grbs . \n the wavelet analysis does not , however , rely on identifying distinct pulses but instead uses the multiresolution capacity of the wavelet technique to resolve the smallest temporal scale present in the prompt emission . \n nonetheless , as  @xcite have demonstrated , if the smallest temporal scale is due to pulse emissions , then we can still get a measure of the upper bound on the number of pulses in a given burst through the ratio @xmath4 \n . in the simple model in which a pulse is produced every time two shells collide , the ratio @xmath4 , should show a correlation with the duration of the burst . \n indeed , this correlation was reported by @xcite . \n the similar trends of scaling demonstrated by these two methods , not only suggest the robustness of both methods , but also point , perhaps more importantly , to an underlying interconnection between key parameters extracted by the two techniques . \n in other words , the minimum variability time scale extracted by the wavelet technique is directly related to key pulse time parameters such as rise times ( as depicted in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_combquaderrsmin ] ) , under suitably controlled pulse - fitting methods . \n through a meta - analysis of results presented by @xcite and by @xcite , we have studied the relationship between key parameters that describe the temporal properties of a sample of prompt - emission light curves for long and short - duration grbs detected by the fermi / gbm mission . \n we compare the minimum variability timescale extracted through a technique based on wavelets , with the pulse - time parameters extracted through a pulse - fitting procedure . \n our main results are summarized as follows :    \\a ) both methods indicate a temporal offset between short and long - duration bursts . \n the quantitative agreement between the two methods is quite good . \n \\b ) both methods point to scaling trends between characteristic timescales . in the case of the pulse - fitting method \n the scaling appears to involve parameters such as rise times , fwhm , and pulse intervals . for the wavelet technique , \n the scaling involves a correlation between the minimum variability time scale and the duration of the bursts . \n \\c ) by demonstrating a strong positive correlation between @xmath0 and the rise time of the shortest fitted pulses , we provide for the first time , a direct link between the shortest resolvable temporal structure in a grb light curve with that of a key pulse profile parameter . \n \\d ) by combining the two techniques , we have shown that one can arrive at a much tighter demarcation of the boundary between the power spectrum domains that separate red noise and white noise processes . \n the nasa grant nnx11ae36 g provided partial support for this work and is gratefully acknowledged . \n the authors , in particular gam and ksd , acknowledge very useful discussions with jon hakkila and narayan bhat .", "StartTimeOffset": 773862785736, "RequestID": "d1718a8460ab479596cacaf40b1b0b42", "TotalTokens": 3082}

heat data .    in the present work \n we will examine the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising octahedron and dodecahedron , which can be calculated from the exact analytical results reported in our previous study @xcite . \n let us consider the spin-1/2 ising octahedron and dodecahedron ( see fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) , which are defined trough the following hamiltonian @xmath5 here , @xmath6 denotes the ising spin placed at @xmath7th vertex of a regular polyhedron , the first summation accounts for the antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath8 between adjacent spins , the second summation accounts for the zeeman s energy of individual magnetic moments in the external magnetic field @xmath9 and finally , @xmath10 stands for the total number of spins ( bonds ) of a regular polyhedron . \n the magnetization curves and thermodynamic properties of the regular ising polyhedra defined through the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) were comprehensively studied in our previous works @xcite . in the present paper \n we will focus our attention on magnetocaloric response functions of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron ( see fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) , which exhibit a giant magnetocaloric effect close to zero magnetic field due to an abrupt magnetization jump towards the one - third and one - fifth plateau , respectively @xcite . \n the isothermal entropy change can be calculated as a difference of the entropy at non - zero and zero magnetic field @xmath11 at the constant temperature . \n the molar entropy can be easily obtained from the exact results ( 6)-(10 ) presented in ref . \n @xcite for the gibbs free energy @xmath12 according to @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes avogadro s number . \n the adiabatic temperature change @xmath15 can be obtained from the transcendent equation @xmath16 which can be numerically solved by the bisection method . here , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and \n @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) denote the initial ( final ) temperature and magnetic field for a given adiabatic process . \n let us proceed to a discussion of temperature dependences of the isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising octahedron and dodecahedron . \n the isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron is plotted in fig . \n [ fig2](a ) for a few different values of the magnetic - field change . \n as one can see , the isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron is negative for arbitrary magnetic - field change independently of temperature . \n this result implies a substantial cooling performance of the ising octahedron in thermal contact with the heat bath . \n the zero - temperature asymptotic values of the isothermal entropy change are in agreement with the difference of ground - state degeneracy at zero and non - zero magnetic fields . \n if the magnetic - field change is lower than the saturation field of the ising octahedron @xmath21 , then , one finds a gradual increase of the working temperature interval with increasing of the magnetic - field change until roughly a midpoint of the one - third magnetization plateau is reached @xcite . \n however , the largest isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron can be found for the magnetic - field change , which is higher than the saturation field . \n the maximum value of isothermal entropy change of the ising octahedron for @xmath22 is @xmath23 at low enough and moderate temperatures ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) , whereas one observes its gradual decrease at higher temperatures ( @xmath26 for @xmath27 at @xmath25 ) . \n the adiabatic temperature change of the ising octahedron linearly increases with temperature up to the threshold temperature , which corresponds to the residual entropy @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is universal gas constant ) of the ising octahedron for a given magnetic - field change , see fig . \n [ fig2](b ) . \n consequently , the ising octahedron achieves the absolute zero temperature during the adiabatic demagnetization process whenever the initial temperature is selected below the threshold temperature forming a cusp in the relevant temperature dependence . \n this result is apparently in contrast with one of the formulations of the third law of thermodynamics @xcite . on the other hand \n , there is a rapid decrease in the adiabatic temperature change above the threshold temperature , which indicates a less efficient cooling . \n the threshold temperature , which corresponds to the residual entropy for a given magnetic - field change , thus defines the working temperature interval of the ising octahedron that monotonically extends with increasing of the magnetic - field change \n .    the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising dodecahedron also shows large mce @xmath30 for most of the magnetic - field changes , see fig . [ \n fig3](a ) . \n the notable exception to this rule represent the field changes approximately equal to the saturation field @xmath31 , for which the inverse mce @xmath32 can be detected in a relatively wide temperature range . \n the most efficient cooling through a thermal contact with the ising dodecahedron can be thus achieved just for sufficiently high values of the magnetic - field change @xmath33 , because the maximal value of isothermal entropy change @xmath34 then persists up to moderate temperatures ( @xmath35 for @xmath36 ) . \n contrary to this , the isothermal entropy change decreases down to @xmath37 at much higher temperature ( @xmath38 for @xmath36 ) . \n the adiabatic temperature change of the ising dodecahedron has a similar behavior as that of the ising octahedron [ see fig.[fig3](b ) ] \n . for arbitrary magnetic - field change there exists the threshold temperature corresponding to the residual entropy @xmath39 , under which the ising dodecahedron reaches the absolute zero temperatures during the adiabatic demagnetization . \n contrary to the ising octahedron , the adiabatic temperature change of the ising dodecahedron may become negative at moderate temperatures as a result of the inverse mce . \n in addition , the adiabatic temperature change is at the same magnetic - field changes less than a half of the adiabatic temperature change of the ising octahedron . in this respect , \n the ising octahedron is more efficient refrigerant than the ising dodecahedron , since it provides a higher gain of the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change at the same values of magnetic - field change due to an absence of the inverse mce . \n in the present work we have exactly examined two basic magnetocaloric characteristics of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron : the isothermal entropy change and adiabatic change of temperature . it has been demonstrated that the largest isothermal entropy change can be found whenever the field change is greater than the saturation field of the relevant ising spin cluster . \n the adiabatic change of temperature confirms an outstanding cooling capability of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron , which may reach during the adiabatic demagnetization absolute zero temperature . \n the ising octahedron and dodecahedron can be therefore regarded as promising frustrated spin structures for magnetic refrigeration , whereas the maximum of the adiabatic change of temperature shifts to higher temperatures with increasing of the magnetic - field change . \n this work was financially supported by grant nos . \n vega 1/0043/16 , apvv-14 - 0073 and vvgs - pf-2016 - 72606 .", "StartTimeOffset": 785873096608, "RequestID": "d14d8619ee4c41b5ac2adeb70fd254c4", "TotalTokens": 2206}
{"ContextTokens": 4078, "GeneratedTokens": 238, "SynthesizedBody": "a central problem in the search for earth - like planets is to suppress the light from a star so as to reveal a planet which might be 10 to 12 orders of magnitude fainter than the star and might be in quite close to the star . in earlier papers ( nisenson and papliolios , 2001 ; nisenson et al , 2003 ) we showed that apodizing a telescope pupil reduced the diffraction of a telescope that would allow exo - planet detection . \n in addition to diffraction suppression , extremely low scattering optical surfaces at frequencies of 3 to 30 cycles / mirror are necessary . obtaining such low scattering will require a combination of super - polishing and adaptive optic correction . in this paper \n , we describe a technique for designing an apodizer that minimizes diffraction in a chosen region of the focal plane while maximizing the throughput of the apodizer . \n the image of a star ( unaberrated by the atmosphere ) is the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope . \n we want to design a real , non - negative , continuous tone mask , i.e. , an apodizer , to place in the aperture ( or a relay plane of the aperture ) such that the psf has a compact , central peak with minimal spread beyond the core of the psf . \n this problem was first studied by slepian & pollack ( 1961 ) in the context of radar , communications , and superresolution . \n the authors show that the band - limited signal , @xmath0 , which has the most energy in time t satisfies the integral equation :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a zero - one function which time - limits @xmath0 to t seconds and the fourier transform , @xmath3 , of @xmath4 is another zero - one function which band - limits @xmath0 . \n the solutions ( eigenfunctions ) of this integral equation are prolate spheroidal ( ps ) functions and @xmath0 is the eigenfunction with the largest eigenvalue . the authors show that @xmath0 , inside t , is identical to its fourier transform , @xmath5 , suitably scaled in f. kaiser ( 1966 ) presented an approximation to @xmath0 and subsequent authors ( oppenheim and schafer , 1989 ; aime et al , 2002 ) have used the kaiser window because @xmath0 is difficult to compute . \n papoulis ( 1968 ) studied the same problem in the optical context and showed that @xmath6 , the fourier transform of @xmath0 , is the optimal one - dimensional apodizer . \n he showed that the optimal apodizer for a square aperture is the product @xmath7 , which is the form proposed by nisenson and papaliolios ( 2001 ) . \n he also shows that the optimal apodizer for a circularly symmetric aperture is a sum of the first and second order bessel functions . \n other authors ( kasdin et al , 2002 and aime et al , 2001 ) , have shown the optimality of a ps apodizer . \n kasdin et al ( 2002 ) suggest a ps - shaped , binary aperture with the key advantage that the binary aperture may be easier to manufacture . \n in this paper we present an iterative calculation of an optimal apodizer . \n the method does not require the kaiser approximation and it can accommodate any special features of the measurement process , such as the likely position of a planet in reference to its star . \n we use a very simple iterative procedure to calculate the apodizer , an iterative algorithm that has its roots in linear system theory and is closely related to the well - known gerchberg - saxton algorithm ( gerchberg and saxton , 1972 ) . \n we use the method of alternating projections which was introduced by von neumann ( 1950 ) . \n we write equation ( 1 ) in the compact form    @xmath8    where r is an operator , sometimes called the kernel . \n r space - limits the two - dimensional function @xmath9 with a specified spatial mask , @xmath10 , then band - limits it with a specified spatial frequency mask , @xmath11 . the latter is determined by the shape of the aperture . \n to solve eq . \n ( 2 ) we repeatedly impose r on an initial @xmath9 until eq . \n ( 2 ) is satisfied . \n more specifically , we calculate    @xmath12    then we calculate the fourier transform of f(x , y ) , namely f(u , v ) , and calculate    @xmath13    the inverse fourier transform of @xmath14 is @xmath9 , which completes one iteration of the algorithm . \n we rely on the fact that n iterations will produce an expansion of @xmath9 in eigenfunctions of eq . \n 2 with coefficients which are multiplied by eigenvalues raised to the power n. eventually , only the eigenfunction with the largest eigenvalue will emerge , a property which is well - known . \n the algorithm is described by the figures and text in papoulis 1968 book . \n because the operation r uses a forward fourier transform , a masking operation , an inverse fourier transform , and another masking operation , the algorithm is similar to the iterative transform algorithm generally known as the gerchberg - saxton algorithm ( gerchberg and saxton , 1972 ) . \n we emphasize that the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be any desired shape , which gives us the opportunity to shape both the aperture and the search region . \n a one - dimensional , unapodized aperture of width d has inverse fourier transform , @xmath15 , a sinc function with its first zero at @xmath16 . \n we call @xmath17 the diffraction - limited spot size or , more simply , a dl element . the magnitude squared of @xmath15 is @xmath18 , the one - dimensional point spread function ( psf ) . \n a square , two - dimensional aperture has @xmath19 . on the left in figure 1 \n is the logarithm of the psf for such an unapodized aperture . \n the diagonal line in the image shows where we will sample the psf for comparison purposes . in all of our examples \n we assume that the available light is broadband with a bandwidth which is 20% of the central wavelength . \n thus , the deep nulls in a conventional sinc function are blurred out when we combine the psf s at various wavelengths .    to form this first apodized aperture \n we space - limit a one - dimensional @xmath20 to the interval , say , @xmath21 , then we band - limit the result to d. ( for these examples , we used fft software with a calculation size of n = 256 and we set the aperture size to d = 41 . ) these space and bandwidth limiting operations are defined by equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . \n we repeat them until the iterations converge . \n what emerges is the prolate spheroidal function , @xmath22 . \n its fourier transform , @xmath6 , is the apodizer . following previous authors ( i.e. aime et al , 2002 ) , we form the product aperture @xmath23 , which we call a product prolate spheroidal ( pps ) aperture , and its inverse fourier transform , p(x , y ) , is the telescope s psf . in the center of figure 1 \n is the logarithm of the psf for this apodizer . \n note that the psf is concentrated along the x and y axes . \n the aperture has a transmission of @xmath24 . \n papoulis ( 1968 ) showed that this aperture best concentrates the psf into a central square of size @xmath25 by @xmath25 . \n figure 1 shows a third psf . \n this was formed by defining a one - d spatial mask , @xmath26 , which is 1 in the range from 0 to @xmath27 , zero from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and 1 for all larger x ; and is symmetric about @xmath29 . \n the mask forces the psf to be narrow , as above , but also allows it to rise outside a restricted search region from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . \n we apply the same iterative algorithm , starting with the pps apodizer and stopping the iterations when the transmission is ( @xmath30 ) . \n the result is the psf shown on the right of figure 1 . \n figure 2 shows a @xmath31 cut through three psf s . \n the horizontal axis plots diagonal distance in units of @xmath17 and the vertical axis plots the logarithm of @xmath32 , scaled such that @xmath33 . \n figure 2 also shows the psf for the unapodized aperture . \n note that the pps plot is about seven orders of magnitude below the no - apodizer plot , beyond about @xmath34 . \n the modified pps plot matches the pps plot from 0 to @xmath34 , drops about 2 db below it to about @xmath35 , then rises almost to the no - apodizer plot . \n figure 3 shows horizontal cuts through the pps apodizer and the modified pps apodizer .    for our next set of examples we used a circular aperture of diameter @xmath36 . \n first we calculated the psf for an unapodized aperture . \n it is the well - known airy disc . \n the logarithm of this psf is shown on the left of figure 4 . \n ( as in figure 1 the psf s are for wideband light so the rings are somewhat indistinct . \n the horizontal and vertical bands at the edge of the figures are aliasing , caused by our finite sampling . ) \n next we formed a circular mask of radius 3.5z and exercised a two - dimensional version of the iterative algorithm . \n this results in the 2-d psf in the center of figure 4 . \n this is the psf which papoulis ( 1968 ) reports but does not sketch . \n we call the apodizer a circular bessel ( cb ) apodizer \n . then we allowed the mask to rise at a radius of @xmath37 , so that the mask looks like a bulls eye , and exercised the two - d algorithm . \n the psf is on the right of figure 4 . \n cuts through the psf s are shown in figure 5 . inside the search region \n the bulls eye psf is about two orders of magnitude below the psf for the cb aperture . \n the apodizers are shown in figure 6 . both have transmission of about @xmath38 .    finally , we formed an apodizer for a square aperture with a two - dimensional mask which is a cross of width @xmath39 , imbedded in a circular mask of radius @xmath35 , a hybrid apodizer . \n it has a restricted search area as shown on the left in figure 7 . \n we exercised the iterative algorithm , starting with the cb apodizer . \n figure 7 shows the mask ( the search area ) and the log of the psf . \n figure 8 shows a slice through the psf and , for comparison , a slice through the psf for the cb apodizer . despite what appear to be only subtle differences in the shapes of the two apodizers , the hybrid apodizer has a transmission of @xmath40 , almost double that of the cb apodizer ; it also has a narrower central peak and better sidelobe supression . \n the reduced search area of this hybrid apodizer provides significant advantages over our earlier examples . \n figure 9 shows cuts through the apodizer at 0 and at @xmath31 , which shows that the hybrid apodizer is not circularly symmetric . \n we have described an approach to designing an apodization mask that is optimized for minimizing diffraction in a selected local area of the focal plane . \n this would allow use of selectable apodization masks in a tpf telescope that could , for example , reduce diffraction over a wide area in the focal plane for a survey , and then produce deeper nulls in local areas for spectroscopy of an already detected planet . or one could select an apodizer for the minimum width of the central peak , trading off the size of the searchable region for minimum detectable separation of star and planet \n . we also investigated use of apodizers that vary only in one direction ( constant in the other ) . \n these apodizers result in maximizing throughput ( close to 50% ) while allowing detection of luminosity ratios of @xmath41 . \n this is insufficient for tpf - like missions ( luminosity ratios will be of order @xmath42 for an earth - like planet orbiting a star at 10 pc ) but hybrid apodizers , as described in the paper , allow a continuous trade - off between maximizing throughput and minimizing diffraction . \n the speckle due to optical surface errors and the diffraction will produce a psf that is highly centro - symmetric when ( as required for a tpf telescope ) the phase errors are extremely small . for very small phases , \n the exponential phase can be accurately approximated by only the linear term of the power series expansion of the exponential . \n so , for example , a telescope with 1/1000 wave rms surface errors will have a centro - symmetric psf to a precision of about 0.1% and 1/10000 wave results in centro - symmetry of 0.01% . \n one can then use this asymmetry to calibrate the residual speckle and diffraction in the half - plane of the psf that contains a planet using the opposite half - plane . \n subtraction of the calibration region then increases the dynamic range to an accuracy limited only by photon statistics . \n accurate intensity transmission of the apodizers is critical for their success - this is evident from the apparently small differences in apodizer shape , as illustrated in figure 3 , producing substantial effects on the psf . \n we have estimated the precision required in the transmission of the apodizer to be 0.3% or better for it not to affect the dynamic range . \n this is the same requirement as one for the uniformity of the reflective coatings of the telescope mirrors . \n numerical simulations that substantiate this result are included in nisenson et al . \n ( 2003 )    the usual problems with iterative algorithms are choosing an initial function and choosing a stopping point in the iterations . \n for the examples which yielded the ps and cb solutions , we started with a gaussian shape and we stopped the iterations when there was no significant change in the solution , typically a few hundred iterations . for the other examples we started with a ps or cb aperture \n . continued iterations result in deeper and deeper suppression of diffraction in the chosen region but also resulted in decreasing throughput for the apodizer . \n we stop the iterations when the diffraction is reduced to a selected level while leaving the throughput at a maximum . \n we have shown an approach to calculating an optimum apodizer that maximizes the detectable luminosity ratio for exo - planet detection in the focal plane of the tpf telescope . \n the next step in this analysis would be to include realistic specifications on wavefront errors from the telescope optics and also to factor in practical limits on the accuracy in the manufacture of apodizing masks . \n how well continuous tone apodizers can be manufactured is an open question . \n many of the techniques developed for photolithography allow very precise shaped transmission to be generated in special glass . \n such a mask was used in a laboratory demonstration of imaging two close point sources with a luminosity ratio of nearly @xmath43 ( melnick et al , 2001 ) . \n melnick , g. j. , fischer , d. , geary , j. c. , gezari , d. y. , hardesty , c. , harwit , m. , holman , m. , korzennik , s. g. , lyon , r. g. , marley , m. s. , mcelroy , m. b. , neufeld , d. a. , nisenson , p. , noyes , r. w. , papaliolios , c. , ridgway , s. t. , sasselov , d. d. 2001 , american astronomical society meeting 199 , # 09.10 . \n nisenson , p. , melnick , g.j . , \n geary , j. , holman , m. korzennik , s.g . \n , noyes , r.w . , \n papaliolios , c. , sasselov , d.d . , \n gonsalves , r. , hardesty , c , gezari , d. , lyon , r.g . , fischer , d. , harwit , m. , marley , m.s . , \n neufeld , d.a . , \n ridgway , s.t . \n 2003 , to appear in asp conf . \n , scientific frontiers on research of extrasolar planets , eds . \n d. deming & s. seager , ( san francisco : asp ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 797879165907, "RequestID": "6242d5695db04abe891553753d499a89", "TotalTokens": 4316}
{"ContextTokens": 3186, "GeneratedTokens": 180, "SynthesizedBody": "towards the detection of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100pev , the use of acoustic pressure waves produced in neutrino - induced cascades is a promising approach . \n one advantage of acoustic waves is the absorption length of the order of 1 km for the peak spectral density of the generated sound waves around 20khz @xcite . to investigate the feasibility of building a detector in the deep sea based on this method , \n it is necessary to understand the acoustic background conditions and characteristics of transient noise sources in detail on a long time scale . especially the rate and correlation length of neutrino - like acoustic background events is not known and yet is a prerequisite for the estimation of the sensitivity of such a detector . \n the aim of the project described here is to measure the acoustic conditions of the deep - sea environment at the antares site with a dedicated array of custom - designed acoustic sensors at different distances .    towards this goal several additional basic detector elements ( _ storeys _ , cf . \n [ cap_antares ] ) of the antares neutrino telescope will be equipped with acoustic sensors . on these storeys \n the sensors will substitute the optical sensors ( photo - multiplier tubes , _ pmts _ ) used for cherenkov detection of neutrinos . \n several components of the antares infrastructure have to be modified or substituted to integrate the acoustic sensors into the antares data acquisition ( _ daq _ ) scheme . in these proceedings \n the changes will be described , and an overview of the project will be given ( cf .  also @xcite ) . \n the antares detector @xcite is currently installed in the mediterranean sea , 40 km off the coast of toulon ( southern france ) in a water depth of up to 2500 m . its completion is foreseen in 2007 ; the neutrino telescope will then consist of 12 vertical structures ( _ detection lines _ ) with a total of 900 optical sensors for the detection of cherenkov light of neutrino interaction secondaries . \n each line is fixed to the sea bed by an anchor and held vertically by a buoy on the top . \n a detection line has a total height of 480 m and comprises 25 storeys spaced evenly within the instrumented height of 350 m . \n the 12 lines are placed on the sea floor in an octagonal shape with 4 lines in a quadratical layout in the centre . \n the distance between two neighbouring lines ranges from 60 m to 80 m , covering a total area of approx.180@xmath0180m@xmath1 on the sea - floor . \n an extra 13th line - the instrumentation line ( _ il _ ) - will be equipped with sensors to monitor environmental parameters and with devices to calibrate the detector . \n the detector is connected to the on - shore control room via deep - sea cables providing electrical power and data transmission . at the writing of these proceedings , \n two detection lines and a progenitor of the il are installed at the site and operated successfully .    a sketch of the complete antares detector with the acoustic addition described in sec .

[ fig_antares_storey_acou ] . \n , height=264 ]    , title=\"fig:\",height=226],title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]      in the antares daq scheme the digitisation is conducted within the lcm on each storey by several custom - designed electronics boards , which send as much unfiltered data as possible to shore . with its capability of timing resolutions on a nanosecond - scale and synchronous transmission of several mbyte per second and storey , it is perfectly suited for the acquisition of acoustic data \n . additionally , the antares infrastructure provides measurements of the position of the storey with a precision better than 10 cm and of miscellaneous environmental parameters ( e.g.  the speed of sound , temperature and sea current ) . for the digitisation of the acoustic signals and feeding into \n the antares data stream the so - called acoustics digitisation board ( _ acouadc - board _ ) was designed . \n there are a total of three such boards per storey receiving the data of two sensors each . \n the acouadc - board consists of an analogue and a digital part . \n the analogue part amplifies the voltage signals coming from the acoustic sensors by adjustable factors between 1 and 512 and filters the resulting signal . \n the system has low noise and is designed to be  together with the sensors  sensitive to the acoustic background of the deep sea over a wide frequency - range ( approx \n . 1 to 100khz ) . \n figure  [ fig_frequency_response ] shows the measured filter characteristics of the analogue part of a prototype acouadc - board for a gain of 10 in amplitude ( 20db ) . in the left hand plot \n the frequency response of the integrated bandpass is observable . \n this filter suppresses frequencies below approx . \n 4khz and above approx.130khz . \n the high - pass part cuts into the trailing edge of the low frequency noise of the deep - sea acoustic background @xcite and thus protects the system from saturation . \n the low - pass part efficiently suppresses frequencies above the nyquist frequency of 250khz for the digitisation frequency of 500khz ( see below ) . for frequencies above roughly 10khz , the time delay of signals passing through the analogue part ( right plot of fig . \n [ fig_frequency_response ] ) is negligible on the digitisation time scale of 2@xmath3s . \n s. the dashed line in the right - hand plot denotes the electronics digitisation time of 2@xmath3s , showing the characteristic time scale.[fig_frequency_response],height=215 ]    s. the dashed line in the right - hand plot denotes the electronics digitisation time of 2@xmath3s , showing the characteristic time scale.[fig_frequency_response],height=215 ]     + by the calibration of the whole data taking chain \n the transfer function of the system  it is possible to reconstruct the acoustic signal from the recorded one with high precision within the sensitive frequency range of the setup . \n the dynamic range achieved is from the order of 1mpa to the order of 10pa in rms over the frequency range from 1 to 100khz . \n this allows for studying both the acoustic background in the deep sea under all prevailing conditions @xcite and bips from noise sources mimicking neutrino signatures of energies exceeding e.g.  gzk - neutrinos by several orders of magnitude . \n the digital part digitises and processes the acoustic data . \n it is designed to be highly flexible by employing a micro controller ( _ @xmath4c _ ) and a field programmable gate array ( _ fpga _ ) as data processor . \n the @xmath3c can be controlled from the on - shore control room and is used to adjust settings of the analogue part and the data processing . \n also , the complete programming of the acouadc - board can be updated in situ . \n the fpga reads the digitised acoustic data from the analogue to digital converter ( _ adc _ ) which has a 16-bit resolution and a maximum sampling rate of 500ksamples per second ( _ ksps _ ) . \n the data is processed , e.g.  down - sampled to reduce data traffic , and is read out by the antares daq system which handles the transmission to the control room . \n the maximum data rate per storey is limited to 20mbit per second by the electronics sending the data to shore , limiting the maximum sample rate of acoustic data per storey to 1.25msps . \n therefore the digital data is down - sampled to 200ksps at the acouadc - board , to allow for continuous and synchronous read - out of all six sensors of each storey . \n however , the bandwidth can be distributed freely between the sensors , so transmission of the acoustic data is also possible for two sensors at each storey at full sampling - rate .    on - shore \n a dedicated pc - cluster will be set up to process and store the acoustic data arriving from the storeys and to control the off - shore daq . on this cluster , different data filtering schemes and triggers \n will be implemented , as well as raw data stored . \n a dedicated array of acoustic sensors will be installed in the deep - sea environment of the antares site in 2007 . \n the aim is to study the feasibility of a future neutrino detector in water employing the acoustic detection method . \n the technical realisation of the project is well advanced with prototypes of each component ready and tested . \n the setup will provide the possibility to study the acoustic background noise and signals of the deep sea on a long time scale in the frequency range of interest between 1 and 100khz . \n the main goal is to measure the rate of correlated neutrino - like background events on different length scales , which is decisive for assessing the sensitivity of a future acoustic detector for ultra - high - energy neutrinos .", "StartTimeOffset": 805592782491, "RequestID": "714ed23054f64bc1beded9f596ee64eb", "TotalTokens": 3366}

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the average instanton number for the configurations is @xmath5 . \n the average number of monopole loops for the smoothed configurations as well as for the instanton ensembles , is approximately the same . \n is there some explanation behind or this is simply an accident ? \n we studied the number of monopole loops versus the instanton number for all configurations . \n correlation analysis of mathematical statistics clearly showed a strong linear correlation between these quantities in case of the artificial instanton configurations . \n however , no correlation exists between the same quantities for the smoothed monte carlo configurations . \n this indicates the following . on the artificial instanton configurations ( both with parallel and random instanton orientation ) , in average , each instanton is accompanied by a monopole loop close to its centre . \n the average instanton radius is @xmath6 and the instanton distribution is dilute ( see the average instanton number ) . \n the average length of monopole loops is @xmath7 for the parallel and @xmath8 for the randomly oriented instanton ensembles , i.e.  the loops are small , local loops ( see also the length of the largest loops in the table ) . \n in contrast , for the smoothed configurations the average length of the monopole loops is @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the once smoothed and for the 9 times smoothed configurations , respectively . on these configurations , large loops are formed which can cross several instantons and the number of loops and number of instantons is uncorrelated . \n we illustrate the situation for a configuration sample in fig .  1 ( which is available in colour from the hep / lat archives ) . on the real configurations large loops are present which can not be paired with individual instantons . \n using renormalization group inspired smoothing in su(2 ) lattice gauge theory we showed , that the first smoothing step drastically reduces the number of abelian monopoles . \n additional smoothing steps result only in moderate effect . \n the correlation between monopoles and instantons increases with smoothing . \n we find a much stronger correlation for mag than for pg .    in case of the artificially prepared instanton configurations the size of the monopole loops \n is determined mainly by the size of the instantons . \n the monopole - instanton correlation is the strongest for these ensembles . in average , \n each instanton is accompanied by a small monopole loop . \n the monte carlo generated smoothed configurations differ considerably from the artificial ones . \n large loops of monopoles are present . \n work is in progress to determine the monopole contribution to the string tension at different stages of the smoothing sequence . \n we thank the colorado experimental high energy group and the ucla elementary particle theory group for granting us computer time . \n this work was partially supported by u.s . \n department of energy grant de - fg02 - 92er-40672 , otka hungarian science foundation t 23844 and the physics research group of the hungarian academy of sciences , debrecen . \n s.  thurner , h.  markum and w.  sakuler , hep - th/9506123 ; v.  bornyakov and g.  schierholz , phys . \n b384 ( 1996 ) 190 ; a.  hart and m.  teper , phys . \n b371 ( 1996 ) 261 ; h.  suganuma , a.  tanaka , s.  sasaki and o.  miyamura , nucl . phys . \n b ( proc . \n suppl ) 47 ( 1996 ) 302 m.  feurstein , e.m . \n ilgenfritz , h.  markum , m.  mller - preussker and s.  thurner , hep - lat/9709140 t.  degrand , a.  hasenfratz and t.g . \n kovcs , nucl . \n b505 ( 1997 ) 417 t.  degrand , a.  hasenfratz and t.g . \n kovcs , hep - lat/9710078 t.g . \n kovcs and z.  schram , phys . \n d56 ( 1997 ) 6824 a.  hart and m.  teper , nucl . \n b ( proc . \n suppl ) 63 ( 1998 ) 522", "StartTimeOffset": 810262069682, "RequestID": "fb6639ca85484206baee7cc3e300b87d", "TotalTokens": 1877}

{"ContextTokens": 3806, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "ce gru ( also known as grus v-1 and hawkins v-1 ) was discovered by hawkins ( 1981 , 1983 ) during a search for variable objects using uk schmidt plates . \n further observations by tuohy et al ( 1988 ) confirmed its binary nature ( an orbital period of 108.5 mins ) while cropper et al ( 1990 ) found strong circular polarisation \n a characteristic of the polar ( or am her ) class of cataclysmic variable . \n these objects are interacting binaries in which material flows from a dwarf main sequence star onto a magnetic ( @xmath210200 mg ) white dwarf . \n this strong magnetic field is high enough to force the spin of the white dwarf to be synchronised with the binary orbital period . \n tuohy et al ( 1988 ) demonstrated that there are two accretion poles which are characterised by different emission properties : one pole which is always in view and is stronger in blue light , while the other pole which is visible for only @xmath00.35 of the white dwarf spin period is stronger in red light . \n cropper et al ( 1990 ) showed that the pole always in view was positively circularly polarised , with the other being negatively polarised . \n the uk schmidt plates show that ce gru exhibits two distinct levels of brightness , ( @xmath218 and @xmath221 ) . in the fainter state \n the accretion flow is much reduced , or stopped altogether . \n this may be the reason why ce gru was not detected during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( verbunt et al 1997 ) . \n indeed , ce gru has never before been detected in x - rays . in this paper \n , we report the first x - ray detection of ce gru which were made as part of a survey of polars using _ xmm - newton_. \n the satellite _ xmm - newton _ was launched in dec 1999 by the european space agency . \n it has the largest effective area of any x - ray satellite and also has a 30 cm optical / uv telescope ( the optical monitor , om : mason et al 2001 ) allowing simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv coverage . \n ce gru was observed using _ xmm - newton _ on 2001 oct 31 . \n the epic instruments ( imaging detectors covering the energy range 0.110kev with moderate spectra resolution ) were operated in full frame mode ( the count rate was not high enough to cause pile - up problems ) . \n the rgs detectors ( high resolution spectrographs operating in the 0.32.0kev range : den herder et al 2001 ) were configured in the standard spectroscopy mode . \n we clearly detect ce gru in the x - ray band . \n om data were taken in two uv filters ( uvw1 : 24003400  , uvw2 : 18002400  ) and one optical band ( @xmath3 band ) . the observation log is shown in table [ log ] . \n the data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ _ science analysis software _ v5.2 . \n the rgs spectra were of low signal to noise and showed no evidence for significant line emission : we do not consider them further . for the epic pn detector ( strder et al 2001 ) , data were extracted using an aperture of 40@xmath4 arc sec centered on the source . \n background data were extracted from a source free region . for the epic mos detectors ( turner et al 2001 ) we extracted data in a similar way , but extracted the background from an annulus around the source . \n the background data were scaled and subtracted from the source data . in extracting the epic pn spectrum \n , we used only single pixel events and used the response file epn_ff20_sy9_thin.rmf . in the case of the mos data we used the response files m[1 - 2]_thin1v9q19t5r5_all_15.rsp \n the om data were analysed in a similar way using omichain and omfchain ( this latter task was not incorporated in sas v5.2 but will be in a later version ) . \n data were background subtracted and corrected for coincidence losses ( mason et al 2001 ) . \n the optical monitor data shows that ce gru had a mean brightness of @xmath3=17.9 and a maximum @xmath3=17.5 . since the @xmath3 band observations started at the descent from maximum its likely that its true maximum was brighter than this . assuming a similar colour to that found by tuohy et al ( 1988 ) ( @xmath5=0.53 ) this places ce gru in a high accretion state at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observations and a similar brightness to observed by tuohy et al ( @xmath618 ) . \n the length of the observation in the epic mos detectors covered just over 1 orbital cycle . \n the flux in the uv filters corresponds to : uvw1 @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 , uvw2 @xmath10 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9 , ( based on om observations of isolated white dwarfs ) . \n the mean flux in the @xmath3 filter corresponds to @xmath11 ergs s@xmath8 @xmath9  at 5000  . \n .the log of _ xmm - newton _ observations of ce gru .

ray luminosity of am her ( whose distance is reasonably well determined ) . \n ishida et al ( 1997 ) observed am her using _ asca _ when it was in a high accretion state and find @xmath14 ergs s@xmath8using a distance of 75 pc . \n we find that ce gru would have to lie @xmath0400 pc distance to equal the @xmath15 found for am her . \n although ce gru was detected in x - rays for the first time and was clearly in a high accretion state , no distinct soft x - ray component was observed . on the face of it , this is surprising since a strong soft x - ray flux has long been considered one of the defining properties of polars . \n observations of polars using _ exosat _ ( eg osborne 1988 ) and _ rosat _ ( eg ramsay et al 1994 ) found a strong distinct soft x - ray component , and in general , the ratio @xmath16 . \n further , the ratio was correlated with the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf : a high field gave a high ratio . to account for the large ` soft x - ray excess ' seen in many polars , dense ` blobs ' of material which do not form a shock and radiate in soft x - rays were proposed ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 , frank , king & lasota 1988 ) . \n currently , four polars have been observed using _ xmm - newton_. of those systems observed in an intermediate or high accretion state , ww hor showed no distinct soft x - ray component ( ramsay et al 2001 ) while by cam has one pole which did show such a component and one which did not ( ramsay & cropper 2002 ) . \n indeed only one other system , dp leo , has shown a distinct soft x - ray component ( ramsay et al 2001 ) . \n even for those polars which showed the lowest ratios using _ rosat _ ( ef eri and am her ) a distinct soft x - ray component was still observed . \n a variation of the standard shock model has been proposed by heise & verbunt ( 1988 ) and gnsicke , beuermann & de martino ( 1995 ) who suggest that the reprocessed x - ray component lies in the euv band while the strong soft x - ray component seen in many polars originates from dense ` blobs ' of material which do not form an exposed shock . \n our data are consistent with this view if the temperature of the reprocessed component is @xmath17ev : below 2ev the flux of the reprocessed component is too small , while above 5ev it would be too high . \n a component with a temperature above 10ev would be evident in the spectrum ( figure  [ bb ] ) . \n the implication in this case is that the fraction of blobby accretion is small in ce gru . \n again this is consistent with the unfolded light curves ( not shown ) which do not show strong flaring seen in many systems ( such as by cam \n ramsay & cropper 2002 ) . \n the amount of irradiation that the white dwarf receives is a function of height in the post - shock region , with greater temperatures from higher up , but more overall flux ( even at higher energies ) from near the base ( cropper , wu & ramsay 2000 ) . on the other hand , because of the curved surface of the white dwarf , the illumination is decreasing , with slightly more than the square of the distance from the axis of the post - shock region . \n further , albedo varies as a function of temperature . although the effects of irradiating a white dwarf atmosphere have been explored to some extent ( williams \n et al 1987 , heise 1995 ) , this is an area which needs further work to determine how the temperature of the reprocessed spectrum is effected by parameters such as the accretion rate and magnetic field . \n we note , however , that higher specific accretion rates result in lower shock heights , and higher magnetic fields also reduce the height of the post - shock region ( see for example cropper et al 1999 ) , so the solid angle of emission from the post - shock flow intercepted by the white dwarf photosphere is increased . in these high - state data of ce gru , we have no reason to expect anomalously low specific accretion rates , and ce gru has a magnetic field strength typical of polars . \n therefore there is no obvious reason for the reprocessed component to have moved into the euv if it is normally in the soft x - ray band in polars . \n this gives support to the heise & verbunt ( 1988 ) suggestion that the soft x - ray component is indeed caused by blobby accretion . \n some factor(s ) must determine the number , length and density of blobs . \n obvious parameters include the magnetic field strength and orientation of the white dwarf , the orbital period and the mass transfer rate . \n ramsay et al ( 1994 ) identified the magnetic field strength as one important parameter . \n further progress in this regard awaits a systematic analysis of the strength of the soft x - ray component as a function of these parameters in a sufficiently large sample of polars . \n aizu , k. , 1973 , prog thei phys , 49 , 1184 cropper , m. , bailey , j. a. , wickramasinghe , d. t. , ferrario , l. , 1990 , mnras , 244 , p34 cropper , m. , wu , k. , ramsay , g. , kocabiyik , a. , 1999 , mnras , 306 , 684 cropper , m. , wu , k. , ramsay , g. , 2000 , new astronomy reviews , 44 , 57 den herder , j. w. , et al , 2001 , a&a , 365 , l7 frank , j. , king , a. r. , lasota , j. -p . , 1988 , a&a , 193 , 113 gnsicke , b. , beuermann , k. , & d. de martino , 1995 , a&a , 303 , 127 hawkins , m. r. s. , 1981 , nature , 293 , 116 hawkins , m. r. s. , 1983 , nature , 301 , 688 heise , j. , verbunt , f. , 1988 , a&a , 189 , 112 heise , j. , 1995 , in cape workshop on magnetic cataclysmic variables , asp conf ser , 85 , ed . d. a. h. buckley & b. warner , 162 ishida , m. , matsuzaki , k. , fujimoto , r. , mukai , k. , osborne , j. p. , 1997 , \n mnras , 287 , 651 king , a. r. , lasota , j. p. , 1979 , \n mnras , 188 , 653 kuijpers , j. , pringle , j. e. , 1982 , a&a , 114 , l4 lamb , d. q. , masters , a. r. , 1979 , apj , 234 , 117 mason , k. o. , et al 2001 , a&a , 365 , l36 nauenberg , m. , 1972 , apj , 175 , 417 osborne , j. , 1988 , societa astronomica italiana , memorie , vol . \n 59 , no . 1 -

flavour production in p \n pb collisions with pp results to test whether the yield and the transverse momentum distributions follow a scaling with the number of binary nucleon \n nucleon collisions in the p  pb collision . \n this scaling is expected for particles produced in hard ( high virtuality ) partonic scattering processes in the absence of nuclear effects in the initial or in the final state of the p  pb collision . \n this is studied by measuring the nuclear modification factor @xmath9 , defined as the ratio of the @xmath5-differential cross section measured in p \n pb collisions to that measured in pp collisions scaled by the mass number a of the pb nucleus . \n the d - meson @xmath9 in minimum bias p  pb collisions was found consistent with unity for @xmath10 1 gev/@xmath11 within uncertainties of about 20% @xcite , showing that cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects ( nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath12 broadening , energy loss in cold nuclear matter ) do not strongly affect charm - quark production in p \n pb collisions @xcite . \n it is interesting to measure the nuclear modification factor in p \n pb collisions in classes of the event activity , because the latter is related to the collision centrality ( i.e. impact parameter as well as the number of participating nucleons and binary collisions ) of the p  pb collisions . \n the measurement of the @xmath9 requires to estimate the average number of binary collisions @xmath7 for the event activity intervals used in the analysis . \n alice has identified in p \n pb collisions several sources that can induce a bias in the centrality determination based on particle multiplicity measurement @xcite . \n this bias have been observed in the measurement of the nuclear modification factor of charged particles in p \n pb collisions in multiplicity classes @xcite . \n this work investigates whether such a bias is also present for @xmath6 mesons . \n the results are presented in form of the @xmath6-meson self - normalized yield in pp and p  pb collisions , defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the d - meson per - event yield in multiplicity intervals , @xmath15 the multiplicity integrated per - event yield , @xmath16 are the corresponding reconstruction and selection efficiencies and @xmath17 is the trigger efficiency ( only relevant in pp ) . \n furthermore , the binary scaling is studied in several event activity classes via the @xmath18 ratio , defiled as : @xmath19 for the v0a and zna event activity estimators respectively , defined in the next section . \n these two observables represent different ways to study the multiplicity dependence of @xmath6-meson production in p \n pb collisions : the self - normalized yields are more focused on the study of mpis , while @xmath18 reflects the scaling of charm production in p \n pb collisions relative to pp collisions . \n the alice detector is described in @xcite . \n the data samples analyzed are from the 2010 pp run ( 300 @xmath20 events at @xmath0 = 7 tev ) and the 2013 p \n pb run ( 100 @xmath20 events at @xmath1 = 5.02 tev ) . \n details on the trigger and event selections can be found in @xcite . \n events are divided in event activity classes . \n three event activity estimators have been used :    * @xmath21 : number of track segments reconstructed in the silicon pixel detector ( spd - two innermost layers of the inner tracking system - @xmath22 ) ; * v0a : signal amplitude of the a - side vzero scintillator ( @xmath23 - pb going direction for p  pb collisions ) ; * zna : energy from nuclear fragments in the a - side zero degree neutron calorimeter ( 112.5 m from interaction point - pb going direction for p  pb collisions ) . \n the self - normalized yields are obtained in @xmath21 intervals , while the @xmath18 analysis adopts v0a and zna multiplicity classes ( 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% , 40 - 60% , 60 - 100% ) . \n the analysis is based on the reconstruction of @xmath6 mesons in their hadronic decay channels ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) in the alice central barrel ( @xmath270.9 ) , exploiting the excellent vertex resolution and particle identification capabilities of the alice detector as described in @xcite . \n @xmath6-meson efficiency corrections in pp and p  pb collisions are determined with monte carlo simulations based on pythia 6.4.21 and hijing event generators . \n a fraction of the total @xmath6-meson yield comes from the decay of b mesons . for the @xmath18 analysis \n this contribution was estimated based on fonll pqcd calculations as described in @xcite , while for the self - normalized yield analysis no subtraction has been performed , assuming that the fraction of feed - down @xmath6 mesons does not depend on multiplicity and cancels in the ratio of eq . \n a deviation from this assumption has been considered to estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty . the pp and p \n pb corrected yields have been used to compute the @xmath18 as in eq . \n 2 . the average values of @xmath28 in the four v0a and zna event activity classes have been evaluated as follows :    * v0a : the @xmath29 values have been obtained for each v0a multiplicity interval with the approach used for pb  pb collisions , i.e. via a fit to the v0a multiplicity distribution based on the glauber model for the collision geometry and a two - component model for particle production @xcite . * \n zna : the @xmath30 values have been calculated by scaling the @xmath31 in minimum - bias p  pb collisions by the ratio between the average multiplicity density measured at mid - rapidity for a given zn energy event class and the one measured in minimum bias collisions . \n @xmath32 is obtained as @xmath32 = @xmath30 - 1 . \n the self - normalized yields have been measured for prompt @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons . they are shown in charged - particle multiplicity ( dn@xmath33/d@xmath34 ) intervals ( fig.1 ) , since a simulation study has shown that @xmath21/@xmath35 equals @xmath36 . \n for all the @xmath6-meson species , the yield increases with charged - particle multiplicity . \n no @xmath5 dependence of this trend has been observed . \n the left panel of fig.1 shows @xmath2 self - normalized yields for pp and p  pb collisions . \n both systems show an increase of the yield with charged - particle multiplicity . \n the trend for pp collisions can be interpreted as being due to strong hadronic activity connected with charm production and to the presence of mpis affecting the hard momentum scale relevant for heavy - quark production . in the p \n pb case , it should be considered that high - multiplicity events can also originate from a higher number of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the nuclear interaction . \n the right panel of fig.1 shows the average values of self - normalized yields for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and j/@xmath8 in p \n pb collisions . \n j/@xmath8 yields have been measured in 2.5@xmath374.0 ( p - going direction ) and @xmath38 ( pb - going direction ) and they show an increase with charged - particle multiplicity . \n however a quantitative comparison of j/@xmath8 and @xmath6-meson yields has to take into account the rapidity dependence of cold nuclear matter effects such as gluon shadowing , that depends on the bjorken @xmath39 value of the parton involved in the process producing charm , and energy loss in cold nuclear matter @xcite . \n the average value of @xmath18 for prompt @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons is shown in the left panels of figs . 2 and 3 for the v0a and zna estimators , respectively . \n a bias can be observed in the v0a measurement , where the low - multiplicity @xmath18 is below unity in all six @xmath5 bins , while the zna measurement is compatible with unity within systematic and statistical uncertainties at both low and high event activity . \n these @xmath18 results are compared with the ones obtained for charged particles , shown in the right panels of figs . 2 and 3 . \n these comparisons demonstrate that the @xmath18 of high @xmath5 ( @xmath40 8 gev/@xmath11 ) charged particles feature a similar pattern as the one of @xmath6 mesons , confirming the presence of a bias in the v0a - based determination of @xmath29 that is reduced using the zna estimator . \n this indicates that the determination of @xmath7 depends on the rapidity region in which the event activity measurement is performed . with the least biased estimator ( zna ) \n we observe @xmath18 being compatible with unity for all multiplicites and @xmath5 . \n details on the @xmath28 bias have been presented at this conference and they are described in @xcite .    in conclusion , the d - meson self - normalized yields show an increasing trend with increasing charged - particle multiplicity . \n the trends observed for pp and p  pb collisions are compatible within uncertaintes . \n the @xmath18 results for @xmath6 mesons are qualitatively similar to the ones obtained for high @xmath5 charged particles . \n in particular the zna measurement shows no multiplicity dependence of the @xmath6-meson production in p \n pb collisions relative to binary scaling of pp production cross sections while v0a results show a similar bias as observed for high-@xmath5 charged particles . \n 00 v. khachatryan et al . \n [ the cms collaboration ] , eur . \n j. c 73 ( 2013 ) 2674 a. abelev et al . \n [ alice collaboration ] , jhep 09 ( 2013 ) 049 m aguilar -

{"ContextTokens": 2628, "GeneratedTokens": 135, "SynthesizedBody": "wavelength calibration is almost always needed in the process of producing useful astronomical spectra . \n to calibrate accurately is a non - trivial problem , in particular when working at high or very - high spectral resolution . \n fourier transform spectrographs ( fts ) are specially well - suited to this task , but they are not readily applied in conditions requiring high spatial or time resolution , so grating spectrometers are much more commonly used for astronomical observations . in this case , it becomes necessary to set reference positions corresponding to known wavelengths on the detector . \n this can be achieved by using very sharp observed telluric lines , but their location in the spectrum can not be chosen by the astronomer . \n it is very usual to find spectral calibration lamps available for use with an astronomical spectrograph . \n the emission lines produced in the lamps have been previously measured at the laboratory , and this method usually provides a valid reference frame . \n however , it is often impractical to expose the calibration lamp simultaneously with the astronomical target and , unless the spectrograph is installed at a very stable focal station , the position of the spectrum on the detector varies depending on the telescope position . \n accuracy is then limited by the instrument characteristics and observations of the calibration lamps are required between successive astronomical exposures . \n nonetheless , calibrations via arc or hollow cathode spectra are normally accurate enough for most purposes . \n ingenious techniques have been used to improve the accuracy of wavelength calibrations , such as placing gas cells at the entrance of the spectrograph ( e.g. , deming & plymate 1994 ) , but it is rare to find such systems available and convenient for regular observations .    on occasion \n the available lamps are not very rich in lines in the spectral range of observation . in some circumstances , \n an external check of the final precision in the translation into wavelengths would be desirable . \n one method for tackling problems such as these is to use solar spectra as templates . \n changes in the wavelengths of the lines in the integrated sunlight spectrum around the solar cycle have been proved to be very small , bellow some 15 m s@xmath1 ( jimnez et al . \n 1980 ; wallace et al . 1988 ; mcmillan et al . 1993 ; deming & plymate 1994 ) . at 5000 \n , this translates into @xmath2 0.3 m , so the solar spectrum does offer a very stable source . in most practical cases , \n the accuracy will be imposed by the spectral resolution achieved . during night - time observations , \n the solar flux spectrum is observable after reflection from the moon .    measurements of solar wavelengths in the integrated solar optical spectrum were published in 1929 by burns and collaborators ( burns 1929 ; burns & kiess 1929 ; burns & meggers 1929 ) , using photographic detectors and a grating spectrograph . \n the relatively recent solar flux fts atlases offer a much higher quality spectrum of the sun seen as a star . \n as the solar spectrum is so intense , on some solar telescopes no calibration lamps are deemed necessary , and the wavelength scale is set using the solar spectrum itself . \n reasonable precision can be reached using the spectrum at the centre of the disc to compare with previously measured disc centre wavelengths , thus avoiding differential shifts due to the limb effect . in this case , \n small scale motions have to be averaged out , integrating in time and/or space , in order to minimize errors . \n the _ kitt peak table of photographic solar spectrum wavelengths _ ( pierce & breckinridge 1973 ) has been extensively used by solar observers to set up the wavelength scale on their spectra . \n these observations , made on photographic plates , have been superseded in quality by the more recent fts observations at the centre of the disc . \n to improve on the various sets of photographically based measurements ( which date back to 1930 in the case of the solar flux spectrum ) , provide them in a homogeneous machine - readable format , use them to test spectral calibrations of very high resolution stellar spectra ( e.g. , allende prieto et al . 1995 ) , and improve the accuracy of our own solar observations , we have determined the position of the central wavelengths of 4947 atomic lines in the optical solar spectrum . \n the employed source solar atlases , prepared from fts data , and the fashion in which we performed the measurements is described in the succeeding sections . \n among other solar flux fts atlases , the _ solar flux atlas from 296 to 1300 nm _ \n ( kurucz et al . \n 1984 ) , which is available from the noao ftp site , provided us with a high - quality spectrum of the sun seen as a star . \n it was obtained at the mcmath telescope at kitt peak . \n the fts disc - centre spectrum included in the newer _ spectral atlas of solar absolute disk - averaged and disk - center intensity from 3290 to 12510  _ \n ( brault & neckel 1987 ; for details see neckel 1994 ) was also obtained at the mcmath telescope . \n the wavelengths of selected lines from the table of pierce & breckinridge ( 1973 ) , which was produced from observations with a grating spectrometer and a photographic detector at the same telescope , have been the base for placing its wavelength calibration on an absolute scale . \n we have measured line central wavelengths in this atlas , available to us as part of the idl kis library . a flux spectrum is also contained in this fts atlas , which shares the source data obtained by j. brault and collaborators with the atlas prepared by kurucz et al . \n ( 1984 ) . \n the atlases cited achieve signal - to - noise ratios of about 2500 and a resolving power @xmath3 400000 . \n a quantitative basis for confidence in these atlases has been established by comparison between central wavelengths of 1446 fei lines in the solar spectrum and at rest , performed by allende prieto & garca lpez ( 1998 ) . \n briefly , they found :    * the atlases have been corrected for all doppler shifts between the centre of mass of the sun and earth , and the maximum shift to the red exhibited by the lines studied is the gravitational shift : 636 m s@xmath1 , corresponding to a null convective blue shift . \n * there is no stronger than expected trend of the line shifts with wavelength . * \n a clean correlation exists between the equivalent width and the line shift , reaching a plateau near the gravitational redshift for lines stronger than 200 m . \n this work enlarges the measurements of allende prieto & garca lpez ( 1998 ) to many other species , with the aim of optimizing its use for wavelength calibration . the line list from thvenin ( 1989 , 1990 ) , including 6606 lines classified by moore et al . \n ( 1966 ) as singly blended or unblended , has been chosen as a guide to select the features to be measured . \n a fourth - order polynomial was fitted to the 50 m  wavelength interval around the line minimum to find the line centre as precisely as possible . in the electronic version of the atlases \n , this corresponds to 11 points for the solar flux spectrum and 25 points for the centre - of - the - disc spectrum . \n errors in the wavelength determination were estimated by translating the standard deviation of the fit into the corresponding units of the wavelength axis , neglecting the extremely low photometric noise . \n table 1 , available only in electronic form from the cds , lists the central wavelengths in the flux and disc - centre solar spectra , the errors of the measurements , and the element identification , excitation potential and solar oscillator strengths ( @xmath4 ; from thvenin 1989 , 1990 ) for 4947 lines between 3944 and 7960   included in thvenin s list . \n more than one line corresponding to the same feature is listed when the identification is not clear from the wavelengths published by thvenin .    a comparison between a limited sample of wavelengths ( 42 lines ) listed by pierce & breckinridge ( 1973 ) and those we have measured in the atlas of the disc - centre shows that the absolute scales agree ( difference : 79 @xmath5 6 @xmath6 10@xmath7  ) and that the relative differences are fully accounted for by a straightforward consideration of the expected errors in the photographic atlas ( @xmath2 2.5 m ) \n .    errors of the wavelengths measured in the flux spectrum can be as large as 100 m s@xmath1 , as quoted by kurucz et al . \n for the wavelengths in the spectrum of the disc centre , systematic errors are given from the comparison with the photographic atlas of pierce & breckinridge ( 1973 ) , which has been used as reference . \n they estimate the absolute accuracy from comparison with the interferometrically determined wavelengths of adam ( 1952 , 1958 ) and nichols & clube ( 1958 ) , arriving at 0.3 m . \n our systematic errors are then of the order of @xmath8 0.9 m , while fts intrinsic errors are about 10 m s@xmath1 ( neckel & labs 1990 ) , yielding a final precision of about 50 m s@xmath1 at @xmath9 5000  . \n these numbers allow us to claim that errors quoted in table 1 ( typically @xmath0 m s@xmath1 ) are conservative .    the present database updates others which were previously available based on photographic spectra , and the catalogue is presented in an homogeneous machine - readable format available via internet from the cds . \n the wavelengths measured conform a reference frame which can be used to calibrate or field test calibrations of astronomical spectra by comparing with the solar spectrum , and to set up an accurate wavelength scale for solar spectra , among other applications . \n we thank h. neckel for his help in dealing with his solar atlas . \n we wish to extend our gratitude to f. thvenin , who has kindly lent a digital copy of his line list , m. collados for fruitful discussions on the wavelength calibration of solar spectra , j. e. beckman for careful reading of the draft and h. h. r. kroll for performing the installation and maintenance of the kis computer libraries at the iac . \n nso / kitt peak fts data used here were produced by nsf / noao . \n allende prieto , c. , garca lpez , r. j. , lambert , d. l. , gustafsson , b. 1995 , in stellar surface structure , iau symp . \n 176 : poster proceedings , ed . \n k. g. strassmeier ( vienna : institut fr astronomie der universitt wien ) , 107", "StartTimeOffset": 863319628854, "RequestID": "493d3613f68e4feb8f5dbf2270f686a2", "TotalTokens": 2763}

[ p89-fig-1 ] ) increasing by  10% the information about this important subsystem of the galaxy ( glushkova et al .  2009 ) . \n the results of the ongoing study , sai open clusters catalog , are presented in a vo - ready form at the project . \n apart from convenient presentation and necessary vo access interfaces , the site provides advanced vo experience by a java applet providing possibilities of the direct interaction ( launch and manipulation ) of client vo applications right from the web browser ( zolotukhin & chilingarian 2008 ) . \n there is an ongoing effort to observe these clusters with 1-m class telescopes to confirm reliability of our method . \n this study showcases the potential of all - sky surveys and the virtual observatory for homogeneous studies which is far from being exhausted . \n in order to constrain sizes of some x - ray binaries we undertake photometrical measurements of those which do not possess reliable optical or infrared counterparts . given the x - ray luminosity and the observed optical / nir flux it is possible to estimate accretion disk size and overall system extent . \n this allows us to discover new ultracompact low mass x - ray binaries which is a small and poorly - studied population of the galactic objects expected to emit gravitational waves . \n we used vo data discovery methods to check large existing observational collections for the data on potential candidates and found a number of observed sources of interest without published measurements . \n three low mass x - ray binaries , 4u1323 - 619 , igr j17254 - 3257 and slx 1735 - 269 ( see two of them in fig . \n [ p89-fig-2 ] ) were identified in archival data then ( eso , _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ archives used ) . in case of 4u1323 - 619 there was a mis - identification based on _ einstein _ \n x - ray observations with an underestimated error radius . even without reliable identification \n , one can establish upper limit on brightness of a source that immediately implies upper limit on its disk size . \n this study demonstrates the importance of vo methods of data discovery since existing rich observational archives may contain comprehensive datasets which can give us clues about nature of poorly - known binary populations . \n we cross - identified a spectral sample of sdss dr7 galaxies lying at @xmath1 with ukidss dr5 data , and fitted their spectra with simple stellar population models , thus constructing a catalog of 200k galaxies with @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry measurements , redshifts , spectra , ages and metallicities . \n this allowed us to determine simple yet precise analytical approximations of @xmath4-corrections having great practical value for extragalactic research ( chilingarian , melchior , & zolotukhin 2010 ) . \n the traditional @xmath4-correction computation techniques based on the sed - fitting , require the multi - color photometry , which often is not available . \n our approach allows one to compute rest - frame galaxy magnitudes of the same quality using a minimal set of observables including only two photometric points and a redshift . \n using iphas ( int photometric h@xmath5 survey ) we identified the x - ray source ax j194939 + 2631 from asca galactic plane survey that initially had 1  positional uncertainty which contained hundreds of objects in modern surveys . by imposing highly selective criteria it becomes possible to distinguish between background stars and the object of interest if it is included in the survey . assuming that some set of unidentified asca x - ray sources should have hydrogen - rich accretion disks and therefore exhibit h@xmath5 emission excess , we used the method similar to color - color diagram analysis proposed by witham et al . \n ( 2006 ) ( see left panel in fig . \n [ p89-fig-3 ] ) to extract emitters in fields of interest . \n in bright case of ax j194939 + 2631 we confirmed the nature of the most prominent h@xmath5 emitter in the field by means of optical spectroscopy ( see right panel in fig . \n [ p89-fig-3 ] ) . \n this use - case is listed as an example of the comprehensive vo examination in order to identify x - ray source with challenging positional uncertainty . \n chilingarian , i.  et al .  2009 , \n science , 326 , 1379 chilingarian , i. , melchior , a .- \n , & zolotukhin , i.  2010 , accepted to chilingarian , i.  2009 , in multi - wavelength astronomy and virtual observatory , ed . \n d.  baines & p.  osuna , 165 ;

dependent behavior in the transient process . \n due to the complicate spectrum function , the transient current lacks analytic form . to numerically calculate @xmath32 \n , we set the fermi energy level of electrodes and the ground state energy level @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . \n therefore , the energy levels of qd are empty at zero temperature under zero bias . \n first of all , we plot the time - dependent tunneling current through a symmetric double - barrier tunneling structure with @xmath35 and @xmath36 in response to a step - like modulation for different applied voltages at zero temperature in fig . 1 : solid line @xmath37 , dashed line @xmath38 and dotted line ( @xmath39 ) . \n the tunneling current is zero at @xmath40 since the fermi level of electrodes is below the resonant state @xmath25 . \n when the gate voltage is added into the system , electrons from the left electrode are injected into the new resonant energy level @xmath41 . \n consequently , the tunneling current jumps instantly and finally reaches the steady state . \n current also displays an interesting ringing behavior , which was pointed out in ref.[2 ] . \n the oscillations of the curve do not maintain constant frequency in the transient process . \n in addition , the frequency of oscillations is increased , when the separation between the fermi energy of left electrode and the resonant level @xmath25 is decreased . due to symmetry tunneling rates , \n the behavior of @xmath32 can be understood by the analysis of @xmath42,where    @xmath43\\\\ \\nonumber & \\cdot & cos((\\epsilon -

dashed line ( @xmath56 ) . \n we see that the frequency of oscillation can be tuned by the magnitude of applied gate voltage . for @xmath56 , \n the fermi energy level is just aligned with @xmath41 , the oscillatory behavior of tunneling current almost vanishes . \n although the charge density of qd is not be directly measured , we plot @xmath57 in fig . \n 4 , where the curves correspond to those of fig . \n it is very clear that qd is empty before the gate voltage turns on . \n when the system reaches the steady state , the value of @xmath57 is fractional due to the result of opened system . \n it is unexpect that @xmath57 does not exhibit very manifest oscillation feature as well as @xmath32 . \n because the width of tunneling barrier could not be precisely controlled in the fabrication of sets , we attempt to study the tunneling current for the case of asymmetrical tunneling rates . \n we show @xmath32 for different tunneling rate ratio in fig . 5 : the curves from the bottom to the top ( for @xmath58 ) \n correspond to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . \n meanwhile @xmath61 . \n note that other parameters used in fig . \n 5 are the same as those of the solid line of fig . \n 1 . it is worthy noting that the maximum steady current occurs for the symmetry tunneling rates . \n this is consistent with other theoretical reports@xmath62 . \n in addition , the steady current of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the same as that of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . \n this indicates that the formula given by eq . \n ( 1 ) maintains the asymmetry of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . \n it is not avoided for high temperature sets to study the temperature effect on the transient current . \n figure 6 shows @xmath32 with symmetry tunneling rates for different temperatures at @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the ringing behavior of @xmath32 is swept out by temperatures . in addition , the magnitude of @xmath32 is suppressed with increasing temperature since the right electrode provides current @xmath69 into the qd , which is opposite to @xmath70 . consequently , the net current becomes small with increasing temperature . \n we also show the charge density @xmath57 in fig . 7 : \n solid line ( @xmath71 ) and dashed line ( @xmath72 ) . \n we see that @xmath73 approaches the same value for @xmath74 and @xmath71 in the steady state . to understand this feature , we plot @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are defined as the charge density provided from the left and right electrodes , respectively . in the steady state ( or a large time ) , @xmath75 declines with increasing temperature , on the other hand @xmath76 increases with increasing temperature . \n we see that they compensate in each other . \n next , we study the transient current for the case of different tunneling rate ratio @xmath77 at room temperature @xmath71 . comparing with the results at zero temperature , \n the oscillation structure of @xmath32 at room temperature is more complicate due to the enhancement of @xmath48 . \n for @xmath63 and @xmath65 , the former exhibits the exponential decay , the latter exhibits the exponential growth . \n this indicates that the location of qd exists a considerable effect on the transient transport properties of sets . \n even though the above theoretical analysis is for sets , we attempt to report the experimental measurement of the transient current of ge sht . \n for multivalley conduction band of germanium semiconductors , the intervalley interaction effect can not be ignored . however , such effect is not included in eq . \n the more realistic system described by eq . \n ( 1 ) is a ge sht , where valence band is a single valley . in figure 9 \n we show the transient current of ge sht for two different applied voltages @xmath78 and @xmath52 at room temperature and @xmath79 . \n the detailed fabrication process of ge shts and measurement technique of transient current will be discussed in elsewhere@xmath80 . \n the solid lines are the experimental curves . \n the dashed lines are the fitting curves . according to fitting curves , \n the transient currents display exponential growth feature . \n based on previous theoretical analysis , the ge sht has the characteristic of @xmath81 . \n two fitting curves also provide the bias - dependent tunneling times @xmath82 and @xmath83 for the applied bias @xmath78 and @xmath52 . \n this very long tunneling time is arising from a fact of very high barrier of @xmath2 which the ge qd is embedded into . \n besides , we observe the small oscillation structures on the exponential growth curves . \n the oscillation structures vanish for sufficient long time . \n this indicates that this oscillation structures are not the measurement error . \n owing to the lack of information about the detailed size and shape of qd , there are some difficulties to do the detailed comparison between the theoretical calculation and experimental measurement . \n in this study the transient current of a set is investigated by using the formula derived by jauho , wingreen and meir.@xmath8 the tunneling rate ratio exists a considerable influence on the transient current of sets . \n the tunneling current of a single ge sht at room temperature displays the oscillation structures in the transient process . \n this feature is attributed to time -

{"ContextTokens": 1785, "GeneratedTokens": 94, "SynthesizedBody": "handling high current proton beams is a challenge for beam diagnostics in future proton accelerators . in order to achieve a high beam power , \n it is mandatory to understand the beam dynamics and to determine the beam size and profile with precision . in high power proton linacs \n , such understanding would allow a full characterization of the beam after each linac section . with a beam transverse size of 2 to , \n intercepting profile diagnostics such as otr screens or cherenkov monitors can be used only during tuning and specific beam operation modes . to determine the longitudinal profile , feschenko - type bunch shape monitors ( bsm @xcite ) \n can be used in the low energy sections of the linac , however , bsm may not be sensitive to short bunch lengths . in the higher energy sections , \n it is highly advisable to use non interceptive devices to avoid radiations or damage to the equipment . \n wall current monitors or other methods based on detecting the fields at the vacuum chamber boundary could be used , but they are intrinsically limited in resolution due to the rather low relativistic @xmath0 @xcite and do not have an adapted temporal resolution . \n therefore , a diagnostic based on smith -

purcell radiation can be described by the `` surface current '' theory @xcite : when charged particles travel over a grating , they induce an image charge on its surface and keep pace with it . \n the corrugations of the grating cause the created current to accelerate , which in turn leads to the emission of radiation . in our coordinate system \n , we assume that the protons travel perpendicularly to the grooves of a blazed grating . \n due to the periodic structure of the grating , the emitted wavelength @xmath1 depends on the observation angle @xmath2 defined in fig . \n [ fig : coordinates ] . \n the grating shape and pitch defines its efficiency , that varies depending on @xmath2 and on the second observation angle called @xmath3 . \n our simulation describes the smith -

[ fig : bunchlength ] , is of the order of per bunch , and needs to be compared with the performances of the detectors used . for example , \n if the detectors measure an averaged signal over several ms , which is the case of the pyroelectric sensors often used in experiments involving electrons @xcite , they will detect the smith - purcell power produced by a whole train ( around bunches ) , thus a higher signal by several orders of magnitude , up to mj . \n however , these values do not take into account the transmission of the different optical elements that would need to be installed in front of the detectors . \n also , as seen in fig . \n [ fig : theta ] , the expected smith - purcell emission would occur in the millimeter - wave range where the background level needs to be evaluated to be able to distinguish it from the actual signal . \n if we use detectors that are sensitive only to signal variations , they will not impacted by the effect of the temperature . however \n , electromagnetic noise and other sources of radiations related to the beam can create background . \n since the smith - purcell radiation is linearly polarized , a way to decorrelate the signal and the background could then be to measure the two polarization components . \n angle , for different @xmath2 values . \n the emission source is the center of the figure , the detection optics would be placed on the right half of the figure.,width=340 ]    the efficiency of the grating is given in fig . \n [ fig : phi ] depending on the @xmath3 angle . \n this indicates that most of the radiation would be emitted along the x axis in a cone of approximately 40opening , allowing all signal to enter the optics . \n our simulations indicate that with the parameters used for our simulation a longitudinal bunch profile monitor based on coherent smith - purcell radiation installed at near a high intensity proton beam would be sensitive to changes in the pulse length and could be useful in the tuning phase of such accelerator . \n however such device has never been tested at low @xmath0 proton beams and preliminary tests on a high intensity proton source would be useful . \n the authors acknowledge george doucas from john adams institute in oxford for his useful advice .", "StartTimeOffset": 905975434585, "RequestID": "2d07dad0c6d54feba1958bbe03909f66", "TotalTokens": 1879}

{"ContextTokens": 2876, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , in the context of the jet - quenching phenomena @xcite , exciting jet - associated particle correlations @xcite have been observed in heavy - ion collisions at bnl s relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) . \n this indicates the formation of shock waves in form of mach cones @xcite induced by supersonic partons moving through the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and could give a direct access to the equation of state of the qgp . \n shock waves can be observed if the matter , where the shock waves are induced , behaves like a fluid . \n the large measured elliptic flow coefficient @xmath2 @xcite implies that the qgp created at rhic could be a nearly perfect fluid with a small viscosity . \n calculations of viscous hydrodynamics @xcite and microscopic transport theory @xcite have estimated the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio @xmath0 to be less than 0.4 . \n still , it is not known , if this upper limit of the @xmath0 ratio is sufficiently small to allow the formation of relativistic shock waves .    in this work \n we address the question , whether and when relativistic shock waves can develop in viscous gluon matter for given @xmath0 values . for this purpose \n we consider the relativistic riemann problem . \n its initial conditions are two regions of equilibrated matter with different constant pressure separated by a membrane which is removed at @xmath3 . \n the matter evolves in form of a one - dimensional expansion . \n we solve the relativistic riemann problem employing both the parton cascade bamps ( boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ) @xcite and the vshasta approach ( viscous sharp and smooth transport algorithm ) @xcite of viscous hydrodynamics . \n we demonstrate the transition from ideal shock waves to free diffusion by varying the @xmath0 ratio from zero to infinity . \n we estimate the upper limit of the @xmath0 value , for which shocks can still be observed experimentally on the time scale typical at rhic . \n bamps is a microscopic transport model solving the boltzmann equation @xmath4 for on - shell gluons with the collision integral @xmath5 . \n the algorithm for collisions is based on the stochastic interpretation of the transition rate @xcite . in this study \n , we consider only binary gluon scattering processes with an isotropic cross section , which is adjusted locally at each time step to keep a constant @xmath0 value @xcite . \n vshasta solves the israel - stewart ( is ) equations of dissipative hydrodynamics . in 1 + 1 dimensions \n is equations reduce to @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for vanishing shear viscous pressure , @xmath9 , eqs . \n ( [ cons_e ] ) and ( [ cons_m ] ) reduce to the equations of ideal hydrodynamics . \n figure [ fig01 ] shows the solution of the relativistic riemann problem for various @xmath0 values as computed with bamps .    , the pressure is @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 . \n the left panel shows the pressure and the right panel the velocity at time @xmath14 fm / c . \n , width=491 ]    the results demonstrate a gradual transition from ideal hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath15 ) to free streaming of particles ( @xmath16 ) . \n the ideal solution @xcite is reproduced with a very good precision for @xmath17 . \n we see that a shock wave is traveling into matter with lower pressure ( on the right ) with a velocity @xmath18 larger than the velocity of sound @xmath19 . \n the region behind the shock front is the so - called shock plateau , where matter is equilibrated and moves collectively with @xmath20 , shown on the right panel of fig . \n [ fig01 ] . \n simultaneously a rarefaction wave is propagating with @xmath19 into matter of higher pressure ( on the left ) .    a larger @xmath0 value results in a finite transition layer where the quantities change smoothly rather than discontinuously as in the case of a perfect fluid . \n furthermore a non - zero viscosity , if large enough , impedes the formation of a shock plateau and a clear separation of the shock front from the rarefaction fan .    . \n results are obtained using bamps and vshasta.,width=491 ]    in fig . \n [ fig03 ] we compare the results from bamps and vshasta for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . \n we see a perfect agreement for @xmath21 , whereas for larger value of @xmath23 small deviations in the region of the shock front and rarefaction wave are found . \n the reason for the difference is that in these regions the local knudsen number @xmath24 @xcite is large and thus the applicability of is equations is questionable . \n transport calculations do not suffer from that drawback . \n results are obtained using bamps for @xmath25.,width=491 ]    the formation of a shock wave takes a certain amount of time , as demonstrated in fig .  [ fig02 ] for @xmath25 . at early times \n a shock has not yet developed , the profile looks like a free streaming of particles . \n but at later times we observe the creation of a shock plateau . \n formally we define the time of formation of the shock plateau when the maximum of the velocity distribution @xmath26 reaches the value @xmath20 of the ideal - fluid solution in fig . \n [ fig01 ] . from the right panel of fig . \n [ fig02 ] , we see that this happens at @xmath14 fm / c .    in ref . \n @xcite we have found the scaling behavior of the riemann problem : the time scale of the formation of shock waves @xmath27 is proportional to the @xmath0 ratio . from fig . \n [ fig02 ] we also infer that , for @xmath28 , a shock plateau has not yet developed at @xmath14 fm / c , whereas for @xmath29 , it has already fully formed . \n for @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 fm / c , which is the typical lifetime of the qgp produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic . \n therefore , an imperfect quark gluon fluid with @xmath30 will prevent the observation of mach cone signals at rhic . \n using the parton cascade bamps we have solved the relativistic riemann problem . \n the transition from ideal - fluid behavior to free streaming is demonstrated . \n numerical results from bamps agree well with those obtained from viscous hydrodynamical calculations using vshasta . \n considering the scaling behavior we found that the formation of shock waves in gluon matter with @xmath30 probably takes longer than the lifetime of the qgp at rhic . \n this work was supported by the helmholtz international center for fair within the framework of the loewe program launched by the state of hesse . \n e.  molnr acknowledges support by the alexander von humboldt foundation . the work of h.  niemi was supported by the extreme matter institute ( emmi ) . \n f.  wang [ star collaboration ] , j.  phys . \n g * 30 * , s1299 ( 2004 ) ; j.  adams _ et al . _ [ star collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * 95 * , 152301 ( 2005 ) ; s.  s.  adler _ et al . _ \n [ phenix collaboration ] , _ ibid . _ * 97 * , 052301 ( 2006 ) ; j.  g.  ulery [ star collaboration ] , nucl . \n a * 774 * , 581 ( 2006 ) ; n.  n.  ajitanand [ phenix collaboration ] , _ ibid . _ * 783 * , 519 ( 2007 ) ; a.  adare _ et al . _ \n [ phenix collaboration ] , phys . \n c * 78 * , 014901 ( 2008 ) . \n h.  stcker , nucl . \n a * 750 * , 121 ( 2005 ) ; j.  ruppert and b.  mller , phys . \n b * 618 * , 123 ( 2005 ) ; j.  casalderrey - solana , e.  v.  shuryak and d.  teaney , j.  phys . \n * 27 * , 22 ( 2005 ) ; v.  koch , a.  majumder and x.  n.  wang , phys . \n * 96 * , 172302 ( 2006 ) . \n s.  s.  adler _ et al . \n _ [ phenix collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * \n 91 * , 182301 ( 2003 ) ; j.  adams _ et al . _ [ star collaboration ] , _ ibid . _ \n * 92 * , 052302 ( 2004 ) ; b.  b.  back _ et al . _ \n [ phobos collaboration ] , phys . \n c * 72 * , 051901 ( 2005 ) . \n m.  luzum and p.  romatschke , phys . \n c * 78 * , 034915 ( 2008 ) ; h.  song and u.  w.  heinz , arxiv:0812.4274 . \n z.  xu , c.  greiner and h.  stcker , phys . \n * 101 * , 082302 ( 2008 ) ; z.  xu and c.  greiner , phys . \n c * 79 * , 014904 ( 2009 ) . \n z.  xu and c.  greiner , phys . \n c * 71 * , 064901 ( 2005 ) ; * 76 * , 024911 ( 2007 ) . \n e.  molnar , h.  niemi and d.  h.  rischke , arxiv:0907.2583 [ nucl - th ] . \n e.  molnar , eur . \n j.   c * 60 * ( 2009 ) 413 i.  bouras _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n lett .   * 103 * , 032301 ( 2009 ) z.  xu and c.  greiner , phys . \n lett .   * 100 * , 172301 ( 2008 ) . \n p.  huovinen and d.  molnar , phys . \n c * 79 * , 014906 ( 2009 ) . \n et al . _ , \n c * 79 * , 044914 ( 2009 ) v.  schneider _ et al . \n _ , j.  comput . \n phys .   * 105 * , 92 ( 1993 ) ; d.  h.  rischke , s.  bernard and j.  a.  maruhn , nucl . \n phys .   a * 595 * , 346 ( 1995 ) ; d.  h.  rischke , arxiv : nucl - th/9809044 . b.  betz , d.  henkel and d.  h.  rischke , arxiv:0812.1440 .", "StartTimeOffset": 935185926777, "RequestID": "cf41b8f7ab6a48299e45ac080f02d923", "TotalTokens": 3005}

{"ContextTokens": 2241, "GeneratedTokens": 187, "SynthesizedBody": "recent hst proper motion measurements of the magellanic clouds by kallivayalil et al . \n ( 20006a , b ) and @xcite indicate that they are presently moving at velocities substantially higher ( almost 100 km s@xmath1 ) than those provided by previous observational studies ( van der marel et al . \n 2002 , kroupa & bastian 1997 ) . \n such high velocities ( @xmath2 km s@xmath1 and @xmath3 km s@xmath1 for the lmc and smc , respectively ) are close to the escape velocity of the milky way and consistent with the hypothesis of a first passage about the galaxy ( besla et al . 2007 ) . \n a single perigalactic passage has serious implications for the origin of the magellanic stream . \n it definitely rules out the tidal stripping hypothesis ( ruzicka , theis & palous 2008 ) since in this scenario the loss of mass is primarily induced by tidal shocks suffered by satellites at the pericenters ( mayer et al . \n 2006 ) and the stream would not have time to form before the present time . \n indeed kinematical data suggest that the clouds are now just after a perigalactic passage . on the other hand , ram - pressure scales as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the relative velocity between satellites and the ambient medium . \n the high velocities of the clouds could therefore compensate the effect of the reduced interaction time with the hot halo of the mw and hydrodynamical forces would play a determinant role in forming the stream . \n + in @xcite ( hereafter m05 ) we have performed high resolution n - body / sph simulations to study the hydrodynamical and gravitational interaction between the lmc and the mw using orbital constraints by @xcite and a present time satellite velocity of 250 km s@xmath1 . \n we found that , after two perigalactic passages , the combined effect of tidal forces and ram - pressure stripping can account for the majority of the lmc s internal features and for the formation of the ms . \n more in detail , ram - pressure stripping of cold gas from the lmc s disk produces a stream with morphology and kinematics similar to the observed ones , while tidal stripping has longer time - scales and is not efficient in forming stellar debris , consistently with the lack of stars observed in the stream . \n nevertheless , at each pericentric passage the lmc suffers tidal heating which perturbs the overall structure of the satellite reducing the gravitational restoring force and therefore indirectly contributing to the loss of gas . \n + the main objection to this model , in light of the new proper motion measurements of the lmc , is that the time spent by the lmc within the hot halo of the mw would be to short to cover the full extension of the stream ( more than 100 degree ) by ram - pressure mechanisms ( besla et al . \n moreover , hydrodynamical forces would affect a galaxy only weakly perturbed by the gravitational interaction and stripping would result more difficult .    in this work i present the results of n - body / sph simulations where the interaction between the mw and the lmc is modeled according to the new proper motion measurements of @xcite . \n the initial condition of the simulations are constructed using the technique described by @xcite . \n both the mw and the lmc are multi - component galaxy models with a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a spherical dark matter halo . \n the density profile of the nfw halo is adiabatically contracted due to baryonic cooling . \n stars and cold gas in the disks follow the same exponential surface density profile . \n we also explore the eventuality of an extended lmc gaseous disk . in this model \n the gaseous disk is characterized by an additional constant density layer which extends up to eight times the scale length of the exponential disk . \n the mw model comprises also a small stellar bulge and an extended low density ( @xmath6 @xmath7 within 150 kpc from the galactic center and @xmath8 @xmath7 at 50 kpc ) hot ( @xmath9 k ) halo in hydrostatic equilibrium inside the galactic potential ( m05 ) . \n the mw model , with virial mass @xmath10 and concentration @xmath11 , is similar to model a1 of @xcite while the structural parameters of the lmc are chosen in such a way that the resulting rotation curve resemble that of a typical bulgeless late - type disk galaxy . in details , the satellite has virial mass @xmath12 , concentration @xmath13 and the same amount of mass in the stellar and gaseous disk component ( @xmath14 ) . \n the toomre s stability criterion is always satisfied and the parameter @xmath15 set equal to 1.5 and 2.0 at the disk scale radius in the different lmc models . \n i performed adiabatic simulations using gasoline , a parallel tree - code with multi - stepping ( wadsley et al . \n high resolution runs have @xmath16 particles , of which @xmath17 are used for the disks and @xmath18 for the hot halo of the mw . \n the gravitational spline softening is set equal to 0.5 kpc for the dark and gaseous halos , and to 0.1 kpc for stars and gas in the disk and bulge components .        in my best model \n the lmc approaches the mw on an unbound orbit ( fig . \n [ orbit ] ) with initial galactocentric distance of 400 kpc and velocity @xmath19 km s@xmath1 . \n after the perigalactic passage ( at @xmath20 kpc ) the velocity decreases faster than for a ballistic orbit as a result of dynamical friction . \n the escape velocity at a given lmc position is indicated by a red curve in the right panel and calculated assuming a spherical unperturbed host potential . due to the effects of dynamical friction , at late times \n the satellite lies on a nearly parabolic orbit . at the present time \n ( @xmath21 gyr , vertical lines in the plots ) it reaches a velocity of @xmath22 km @xmath23 at @xmath24 kpc from the galactic center , in good agreement with the new proper motion measurements . + in choosing the initial inclination of the lmc i made the approximation that it does not change during the interaction due to the effects precession or nutation of the disk plane . at the beginning of the simulation \n the disk moves almost face - on through the external medium , and ram - pressure affecting the whole disk perpendicularly . in proximity to the perigalactic passage the velocity vector changes rapidly and \n the angle between the satellite s disk and the proper motion is close to zero . at the present time the simulated disk has an inclination of about 30 degree with respect to the orbital motion ( kallivayalil et al . \n 2006a ) and is indeed moving nearly edge - on through the external hot gas , with ram - pressure compressing its eastern side . \n [ aitoff ] illustrates the present time distribution of stars and gas originating from the lmc s disk . \n the stellar disk becomes elongated while tidal debris start forming after the perigalactic passage . \n but all stars stay bound to the satellite . \n tidal heating does not perturb significantly the vertical structure of the disk that remains thin and does not create a warp , unlike what observed in m05 . \n bar instability develops at the perigalacticon only in the case of @xmath25 . + ram -

detrimental to the accelerator , for example in an ante - chamber . \n finally , one may modify the surface to produce less than one secondary electron per incident electron . \n this can be done , for example , by using a rough surface , by using an emission suppressing coating , or by cleaning the surface in - situ ( thermal treatment , plasma glow discharge etc ... ) to remove high sey adsorbed gas and oxide layers . \n these remedies can also be mixed together to give the best results for solving the problem in an existing machine or to be applied in a forthcoming accelerator where the ece problem is expected to occur . \n of course , lowering the circulating beam intensity can retard cloud formation but that also affects luminosity . in this summary , \n we report sey measurements obtained at slac on flat surfaces , aluminium , tin , tizrv non evaporable getter ( neg ) and ticn . \n the system used to measure the sey is shown in fig.[figsketchsetup ] . the experimental methodology used to measure \n the secondary electron yield has been described in @xcite    1 analysis chamber -

situ bakeout . however , to be efficient the bake should be above 150@xmath7c . \n nevertheless , any increase of surface temperature has an effect on the sey @xcite . on some materials like cu or ag , certain oxides have an sey below that of the atomically clean metal . \n hence , growing an in - situ oxide by heating the surface , in presence of oxygen , is also a possibility @xcite . \n many examples can be found in the literature , and an excellent summary is available @xcite . \n another way of processing a surface to lower its sey is to expose it to energetic particles : photons , electrons or ions . \n usually the sey of metals obtained after exposure to energetic particles is close to that of an atomically clean surface . \n this trend seems also not to be observed in the case of exposure to very energetic ions , mev range per nucleons @xcite .    in the laboratory \n we have quantified the reduction of the sey as a function of electron or ion bombardment . by ion bombardment we mean an ion beam , not a plasma glow discharge . \n a plasma glow discharge is very effective in cleaning the surface in a few minutes , but plasma gas pressure required for a stable discharge is above a mtorr @xcite . \n moreover , performing an in - situ glow discharge of in an accelerator vacuum beam pipe is far from trivial . \n tin and activated tizrv getter coatings are good candidates for suppressing the ece . \n tin coating is known to have a sey max ( @xmath8 ) below or close to 1 when freshly deposited @xcite . however \n , when the `` as - deposited '' film is exposed to air , its sey maximum varies between 1.5 to 2.7 @xcite . \n sputtering of air exposed tin by ar@xmath0 ions or exposing it to a high dose of electrons will return @xmath8 to around 1 @xcite .    in the ece \n the energy gain of the secondary electrons is typically lower than 300  ev . in the case of the international linear collider ( ilc ) \n positron damping ring , the average energy was computed to be 130 ev @xcite . \n the effect of 130  ev electron conditioning on the sey and @xmath8 are shown in fig.[figseylblall ] and [ figseymaxelectron ] , respectively . \n it can be seen that after a surface has been cleaned by a bake ( fig.[figseylblall ] ) or by electron conditioning the sey will increase even when the surface is left under a good vacuum ( 5.10@xmath9 torr ) , fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] . \n any scrubbed or `` clean '' surface will adsorb molecules from the residual gas . \n the increase of the sey is linked to the oxidation of the surface by the presence of oxygen atoms in these molecules . \n this was directly verified by observing the evolution of the xps ( x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ) carbon spectrum of tizrv during exposure to residual gas @xcite .    during the passage of the circulating positron beam \n , ions will be created from the residual gas . \n their energy , for the ilc damping rings , is less than 200  ev . \n bombardment from these ions can also contribute to sey reduction . to probe this effect , \n we have submitted three surfaces to ion bombardment . \n the results are summarized in table.[tabseyiondose ] . \n the experimental parameters are described in @xcite . \n energy@xmath10 & dose @xmath11 + ticn & h@xmath12 & 1.29 & 280 & 1.11 + tin & n@xmath12 & 1.09 & 260 & 3.39 + tizrv & n@xmath12 & 1.15 & 300 & 2.29 +    [ tabseyiondose ]    comparing the effect of conditioning to tin , a gas - saturated tizrv neg was conditioned with a 130  ev electron beam , fig.[figseymaxelectron ] , and to a 250  ev ion beam , table.[tabseyiondose ] . \n an n@xmath13 ion dose of 0.96  @xmath14c / mm@xmath15 reduces @xmath8 from 1.45 to 1.18 , further exposure up to 2.29  @xmath14c / mm@xmath15 , causes only a @xmath8 decrease from 1.18 to 1.15 @xcite . \n aluminium is one of the common metal used in fabricating the accelerator vacuum chambers . \n the sey of atomically clean al ranks among the best material with a @xmath8 around 1 . \n clean al is extremely reactive to oxygen , however , upon air exposure , it will form a thick oxide with a @xmath8 well above 2 @xcite . as discussed earlier \n , electron conditioning will bring the @xmath8 of the metal to its atomically clean value . \n we repeated that measurement with oxidized aluminium . in the laboratory , we conditioned three different air - exposed technical aluminium surfaces and observed that the sey decreases at first and then re - increases . \n results shown in fig.[figseyalu ] are similar for the two other samples @xcite .    during conditioning the xps spectra \n show the c1s peak shifting toward lower binding energy ( be ) ) , signaling reduction of the oxide surface . with further conditioning , \n the trend stops and the peak broadens . \n atomically clean al shows one peak at 73  ev ( metallic ) and another , al@xmath12o@xmath16 , at 76  ev . \n two of our samples show this double peak structure . \n thus , during conditioning , the peaks evolve from oxide to clean al and then reverse again . \n the third sample was extremely oxidized but , again , the broad peak shifted to lower be and then broadened further , consistent with the other samples @xcite . \n activated getter surfaces @xcite , like st707@xmath17 , tizr and tizrv have a @xmath8 below 1.3 @xcite . \n they also provide linearly - distributed pumping capacity . \n the main interest in tizrv coating over the other neg alloys is that its activation temperature is lowest , 180@xmath7c @xcite . during residual gas pumping the sey of neg increases ( fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] ) , just as it does for initially - clean tin . \n the sey increase of neg was followed with xps measurement by monitoring the evolution of the carbon peak @xcite . \n significantly , during residual gas atmosphere saturation of neg , the @xmath8 exceeds 1.3 , the maximum value obtained when saturating neg with individual common residual gases present in an accelerator environment @xcite . \n this behaviour is seen for a freshly activated neg as well as from a 11.2  mc / mm@xmath15 electron conditioned surface , fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] . \n this suggests that fast saturation by a single species is different from slow saturation by multiple species , i.e. , that time may play a role or co - adsorption of multiple species , may enhance the surface oxidation mechanism , as it can be seen in some surfaces @xcite . \n the residual gas composition of a baked uhv is mainly composed of h@xmath12 which readily diffuses into the neg , co , co@xmath12 , h@xmath12o , and ch@xmath18 which is negligibly - pumped by tizrv @xcite . \n the co - adsorption of the three oxidizing species enhances oxidation , similar to an air - oxidation , compared to oxides formed by dosing with a single specie . \n thicker surface oxide has generally higher sey . \n the process involved in building this thick oxide might be somewhat equivalent to cryogenic co - adsorption @xcite . \n it is planned to test this hypothesis in our setup . \n we have investigated a series of flat surface materials for suppressing the ece . \n the most promising remedies are ti - based coatings . \n tin has historically been the choice for successfully reducing multipacting . upon conditioning exposure to low energy ions or electrons , \n its atmosphere - oxidized surface @xmath8 returns to 1 . \n ticn was developed as an oxidation - resistant replacement for tin ; however , it behaves similarly to tin . \n another coating option is low temperature activated neg , tizrv . following an activating - bake \n , its @xmath8 is 1.2 . as a bonus , \n neg coating provides distributed beam chamber wall pumping . while pumping toward film gas saturation , the @xmath8 increases . to return the sey to low value and restore the pumping capacity , \n the film can be thermally re - activated multiple times . \n the sey of the surface itself may also be restored by electron or ion bombardment , which will also recreate some surface pumping capacity . \n technical al surfaces were investigated under electron exposure . \n we found that @xmath8 will not go consistently below 1.8 . \n however , the behaviour at very large doses , above 3.10@xmath19  @xmath20 , was not measured . \n the sey may increase further , stabilize or oscillate .    in an accelerator environment , \n synchrotron radiation , ions and electrons not only desorb molecules but also produce electrons which can lead to the formation of the ec . \n as we have seen , electron exposure is very efficient in reducing the sey . \n however , as the ec conditions the surface , the number of secondary electrons diminishes , hence the ec can oscillate between being on or off . \n nevertheless , photons and ions directly created by the beam may ensure that an ec does not develop , but only direct measurements in beam chambers will confirm this @xcite . \n most of the thin film sample were graciously produced by d. lee and a. wolski at lbnl , p. he and h.c hseuh at bnl . \n our first tizrv getter was produced at cern , thanks to v. ruzinov of the est group .", "StartTimeOffset": 969490455795, "RequestID": "9b4e0da297a64835b093cd8cdeb5f0fc", "TotalTokens": 3281}

connections ( ivoa spectral data model 1.01 , 2007)[multiblock footnote omitted ] , that is to describe all the possible universes of classes of data . \n note that such description and interrelationships are fundamental in scientific research also , with the only difference that , in the last case , researchers are focused on _ particular _ types of objects . \n figure [ fig : ivoa - sdm ] shows the spectrum data model generated by the data model working group . \n this data model aims to describe all the universe of tables in the vo that contain a spectrum , hence the data model must not only be valid for observed data , but also for theoretical spectra . \n this data model ( the generic description of a spectrum ) allows to formulate new questions for researchers that either produce or use theoretical spectra : does this data model describe theoretical spectra ? can all the `` boxes '' in the data model be filled ? and , if this is the case , what is the accuracy of a theoretical model ? \n do theoretical models have systematic errors ? and , do they have statistical errors ? \n in addition to the spectrum data model , this working group has also proposed a data model for astrophysical dataset characterization ( ivoa data model for astronomical dataset characterization 1.11 , 2007)[multiblock footnote omitted ] . \n this data model defines the information required to describe the parameter space of observed or simulated astronomical datasets . \n [ fig : ivoa - cdm ] is a draft illustration of the description of an atmosphere library like those used in population synthesis . \n again , a correct characterization of models is fundamental for their application to observations . \n all theoretical models have a limited range of validity , given by the computational algorithms , the resolution of the input data and other factors . \n usually , these limitations are described qualitatively in the reference papers , but unfortunately , it is not so common for these limitations to be introduced in the code that computes the models ( fortunately , there are some significant exceptions , like cloudy by * ? ? ? * ) . \n we stress again that an answer of the previous issues is fundamental in scientific research , since the basic way to obtain the physical parameters of an observed system is to compare observational data with theoretical models . \n only if these questions are solved in a quantitative way , will it be possible to evaluate the accuracy ( not the precision ) of our knowledge of the observed system .    in the case of stellar populations , \n theoretical models are provided by stellar population synthesis @xcite . \n the general case of population synthesis aims to decompose the observed light of the system under study in different stellar populations components , that is the contribution of classes of stars , each class with different effective temperature and gravity @xcite . in this case \n , no further information about the observed system can be obtained unless additional a priori information is considered . in the case of _ evolutionary _ population synthesis @xcite , the contribution of the different stellar classes is defined by the evolutionary status of the system , hence the knowledge of the contribution of the different stellar classes can be transformed into knowledge about the age , metallicity , stellar birth - rate ( i.e. star formation history , initial mass function and the amount of formed stars ) of the system . \n although evolutionary synthesis models are powerful , it is necessary to take into account that :    * the transformation between the contribution of stellar classes and the associated physical parameters requires some a priori hypotheses : a set of atmosphere models , evolutionary tracks and defined star formation properties ( i.e. stellar birth rate ) . \n * there are different evolutionary conditions that result in the same integrated spectra , so the physical parameters obtained from the analysis of observations are not necessarily unique . \n these a priori hypotheses , together with the computational algorithms and approximations used by different synthesis codes , define the range of use ( i.e. characterize ) of the results . \n they are also the principal source of systematic errors in model computations . on the other hand \n , the degeneracy of the possible solutions produces an intrinsic precision loss in any fit of observational data and theoretical models : the best - fit solutions are not necessarily the correct ones and the distribution of the goodness of fit is also needed for a correct interpretation of the observed data . in order to analyze these issues in detail , \n we need to understand what a synthesis model is . \n the first step needed to evaluate systematic errors , dispersion and the range of application in population synthesis models is to understand how synthesis models work . the main result of synthesis models is the luminosity due to an ensemble of @xmath0 individual stars , each with a given luminosity , @xmath1 . \n the total luminosity of the ensemble is :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the _ estimation of the mean _ luminosity of an individual star . \n however , in a system where individual stars are not resolved , we can not perform such a sum , since we do not know the individual @xmath1 values . in this case \n , we can obtain the total luminosity as the composition of different stellar populations ( or different stellar types ) . \n if we assume that a given stellar type @xmath4 _ can be represented _ by a luminosity @xmath5 and we have some rules that give us the proportion @xmath6 between different stellar types for different physical parameters ( @xmath7 $ ] ) , then    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the _ \n mean _ ( or average ) luminosity of an average star that represents the ensemble . \n note that this mean luminosity is not necessarily the luminosity of any _ real _ star , but it is a description of an underlying probability distribution of the possibles luminosities of real stars in the ensemble . as a trivial example , remember the half - alive half - dead schrdinger s cat solution in quantum mechanics . \n although eq . \n [ eq : ltot ] and eq . \n [ eq : lssp ] look similar , they do not provide the same quantity : the first case is the _ actual _ integrated luminosity of a given cluster and the second case is the _ \n integrated luminosity of all the possible clusters with @xmath0 stars and in the same evolutionary conditions . \n note also that the problem in population synthesis is not the classical statistical one of estimating @xmath10 , but the inverse one : obtaining the _ possible _ theoretical @xmath10 values compatible with the observed integrated luminosity @xmath11 . \n so , it is necessary to use the complete distribution of theoretical integrated luminosities rather than its mean value @xmath12 . \n this distribution provides a _ \n metric for goodness - of - fit _ to stellar population studies .     transformed into stars , with a given metallicity and a given age . ]     transformed into stars , with a given metallicity and a wide range of ages . ]    as an illustration of the effects of this intrinsic dispersion , we show in fig . \n [ fig : sspmean ] the 90% confidence interval of the integrated luminosity of a stellar cluster with @xmath13 transformed into stars for a given stellar birth rate , metallicity and age . \n it represents the integrated spectrum of _ all _ possible clusters with this number of stars , and evolutionary conditions . \n [ fig : sspvariance ] show the mean spectrum of a cluster with similar conditions but different ages . \n the 90% confidence interval in fig . \n [ fig : sspmean ] , with a single age , covers all the region defined by the mean values of the spectra at different ages . \n any fit of a real spectrum of such a cluster would produce a very precise result for the age , but the accuracy of this fit can not be known if the underlying probability distributions of integrated luminosities at different ages are not taken into account . \n we refer to @xcite for a more extensive analysis of the probabilistic formulation of population synthesis and @xcite for a more complete description about the metrics for goodness of fit . \n once the origin of the intrinsic dispersion of population synthesis models has been described , we are going to discuss the sources of systematic errors and how to take advantage of the ivoa characterization data model to define the region of application of synthesis models in its parameter space . \n we refer to @xcite for a more complete review on the systematic errors .    in the following \n , we will only consider the systematic errors related to stellar population synthesis computations itself , assuming that the systematic errors of the inputs are known . \n the main source of systematic errors are :    1 . \n atmosphere libraries @xmath5 : systematic errors in atmosphere libraries mainly depend on how realistic our assumption about the classification of stars in the different stellar types are ( see garca - vargas et al . \n contribution in these proceedings ) . \n such an evaluation must be implemented by synthesis models makers . \n + in addition to the systematic errors , the range of application of synthesis models depends in the coverage on the parameter space ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , metallicity , ... ) , that is the characterization of the library in this parameter space . \n tracks / isochrones and their combination with the star formation history @xmath16 : in the case of synthesis models , the shape of isochrones and the _ density _ of stars along the isochrone must fit observational data . \n small variations in these densities can produce big differences in the models . \n hence , it is crucial to know the uncertainties in the evolutionary tracks / isochrones used to evaluate the systematic error in synthesis models . currently , there are different groups working on the evaluation of systematic errors in evolutionary tracks , like deglinnocenti et al . and bressan et al . \n + additionally , since synthesis models describe the whole population , they also need to take into account evolutionary phases that are included in standard evolutionary tracks , like pre - main sequence evolution , final evolutionary stages like sn or cooling white dwarfs , etc . in general , synthesis models \n makers combine tracks of different groups to obtain a good coverage in evolutionary phases , but in doing so , they include a potential source of error due to different physics used in track computations \n . the evaluation of the associated systematic errors and the coverage of the models results due to these effects must be implemented by synthesis models makers . \n synthesis models algorithms : the final issue is the algorithms used in the model . the main problem is how to combine the different coverage and sampling ( support and precision respectively , following the characterization data model ) of the atmosphere libraries and isochrones in the @xmath17 plane ( see fig . [ \n fig : ivoa - cdm ] ) . in some cases , it is necessary to extrapolate the behavior of atmosphere libraries to regions not covered by the libraries . \n in addition , there are also differences in how the correspondence of the points in the isochrones and in the atmosphere libraries is done , ranging from how the libraries are interpolated to how the closest model to the given isochrone point is chosen . \n although the characterization of synthesis models is a task under development , it is currently possible to define its range of application by comparing the coverage of isochrones and atmosphere libraries and using the ivoa characterization data model for this task \n . it will not be the final solution of the problem of coverage , but it will enormously help towards the use of synthesis models in their correct range of application . \n synthesis models , as any other theoretical model , are affected by systematic errors . \n although the evaluation of such errors is a difficult task that only can be performed by synthesis models makers , the current ivoa description of spectrum data model allows to add these errors to the output .    in the case of statistical errors , the spectral data model does not apply directly to theoretical results since the goal of statistics is inferring the underlying distribution from which the data have been drawn , which is assumed to be known in the computation of theoretical models . \n however , the _ staterror _ box in the current spectral data model can be used to describe the _ intrinsic dispersion _ of theoretical models . \n the dispersion of synthesis models , although not recognized as such , is computed by several codes under the label of surface brightness fluctuations , so this piece of information is already available . \n finally , a proper characterization of isochrones and atmosphere libraries coverage allows to obtain a realistic characterization of synthesis models , and its range of application . \n this research has made use of the spanish virtual observatory supported by the spanish mcyt through grants aya2005 - 04286 and aya2005 - 24102-e . \n it has also been supported by the spanish mcyt through the project aya2004 - 02703 . \n mc is supported by a _ \n ramn y cajal _ fellowship .", "StartTimeOffset": 978816266111, "RequestID": "b44ac73549cf45f9a7aabceab2d7be97", "TotalTokens": 3270}

ybj are investigated by the joint operation of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) detectors and a cherenkov telescope . \n this hybrid detection bridges the gap between balloon detectors and ground - based experiments , improves the shower energy resolution and enhances the capability to discriminate showers induced by light nuclei from events initiated by heavier nuclei . \n they yield clear evidence for a knee -

law can not reconcile the light components and all - particle energy spectra . \n we therefore propose a parametric model to reconcile them . in sec . \n @xmath6 we give two different scenarios and parameters to fit the experimental data . \n @xmath11 presents the average mass . \n finally , sec.@xmath10 gives some discussion and conclusions . \n cosmic rays emitted from the sources are most likely accelerated in the strong shock fronts of snrs by the dsa mechanism . \n the particles are deflected by chaotic magnetic fields , cross shock fronts frequently , and therefore gain energy up to the pev region . \n this acceleration leads to the observed approximate power - law spectrum . \n the energy spectrum is modified during diffusive propagation . \n the spectra near the sources vary from that observed on the earth , which may due to nuclear spallation or decay , ionization losses , leakage from the galaxy and solar modulation for low energies . \n we try to adopt two different phenomenological models to explain the observed energy spectra around knee structure . \n one is an expression of a simple broken power - law and the other is the broken power - law with non - linear modification term . \n the all - particle primary energy spectra derived from extensive air shower experiments can be described by a broken power - law function . \n we therefore use this kind of function to parameterize the observed differential energy spectra for individual elements of cosmic ray , which can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the differential flux of the individual element with energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the normalization constant , @xmath16 represents the break point of the proton spectrum , @xmath17 is the atomic number , @xmath18 is the power index in the energy range @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes the power index when @xmath21 . \n we try to use this expression to fit both the combined energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei observed by argo - ybj and the all - particle energy spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . \n the interaction model sibyll for tibet data is used in this work . \n we firstly fix the energy spectra of each component below the knee region , and then extrapolate the spectra beyond the knee . \n the observed data of individual elements ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) from cream are adopted . \n for the spectrum index of each element , see @xcite . \n an expression of simple power -

ybj @xcite , and get the fitting result of energy break point @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the proton . \n the break point for other elements can be calculated by @xmath43 . \n the spectral indices of all elements at the higher energy range beyond the knee region are assumed to be the same value as the result from argo - ybj , i.e. @xmath44 . \n we sum up the energy spectra of all elements to get the approximate all - particle spectrum , seen as the red solid line in fig . \n [ fig : zy1 ] . \n it can be seen from fig . \n [ fig : zy1 ] that this all - particle spectrum based on argo - ybj observation with this simple broken power - law model can not match the observed all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . \n the simple broken power - law function therefore can not describe the energy spectrum in the knee region , which perhaps is due to the influence of the dsa mechanism . \n [ fig : zy1 ]      since the differential energy spectrum in the form of the simple broken power - law can not reconcile the observations of argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 , a new correction term is added , so the broken power - law can now be expressed as @xmath45(1+\\frac{e}{z\\epsilon_{b}})^{-\\delta\\gamma } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is assumed to be a @xmath17-dependent parameter , and @xmath47 is a constant . \n the dsa mechanism may result in a spectrum with concave - up curvature , so we multiply the non - linear term @xmath48 into the simple broken power - law to structure a concave - up form as a phenomenological model . without this non - linear term , the superimposed all - particle spectrum from all elements is smooth and can not fit the sharp knee structure as measured by tibet-@xmath0 . \n in addition , we have tried some parameters in a non-@xmath17-dependent form , but these can not match the data , so we finally adopt the form in equation ( [ eq : zy2 ] ) . \n an equation to express the non - linear effects is proposed in @xcite . \n they propose the non - linear process by a modified exponential cut - off expression for the spectra from sources , and then deduce the observed spectra by the superposition of these spectra . from their formula , the model they deduced is a kind of broken power - law multiplied by a complex modified term . while our expression form is simpler , we modify the simple broken power - law directly as the observed spectra and then parameterize this scenario . \n combined with the newly published measurements from argo - ybj , our model is easier to quantify the parameters precisely . a model with precisely confirmed parameters \n will help us to review its intrinsic physical issues . from equation ( [ eq : zy2 ] ) , we get a good fit result to match the observations from both argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 with parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the proton . \n @xmath53 values of other elements are assumed to obey the formula @xmath54 . \n the fitting spectra are plotted in fig . \n [ fig : zy2 ] , where the solid red line represents the all - particle spectrum . from fig . \n [ fig : zy2 ] we can see that the all - particle spectrum based on argo - ybj observation can match the observed all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . based on this model , the distinctive knee structure is mostly contributed by heavy elements such as @xmath29 . \n [ fig : zy2 ]    in order to obtain the best fitting parameters for the non - linear model , we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite , a very efficient algorithm , to achieve our goal . considering that the calculation of @xmath55 will be affected by the too small errors of all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 \n , we amplify the errors of this spectrum by taking account of energy resolution . \n the initial form of data with errors listed in the literature @xcite are expressed by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the flux and @xmath58 denotes the systematic error . as a new deduced additional error , a new term \n is added to this expression , i.e. @xmath59 , where @xmath18 denotes the spectrum index . \n we take the energy resolution @xmath60 as a constant . \n the following @xmath61 parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath47 , @xmath16 and @xmath53 , are set free for the mcmc algorithm , where @xmath46 consists of free parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and redshift @xmath17 . \n the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath53 here refer to protons as mentioned above . \n because every spectrum index of elements in the higher energy band beyond the knee is supposed to be the same value , we can get the @xmath53 of other components from the @xmath53 of the proton . by this mcmc algorithm \n , we obtain the best fitting parameters as follows : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the proton . \n the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath16 decide the shapes of the energy spectra . \n different values result in different spectra , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : zy3 ] , where the elements @xmath22 and @xmath29 are taken as examples .          [ fig : zy3 ]    the best fit result is shown in fig . \n [ fig : zy4 ] . \n the measurements of hydrogen and helium nuclei spectra using the sibyll model by the kascade group @xcite are compared with our model in fig . \n [ fig : zy4 ] . \n the kaskade group claimed that the energy spectra of both proton and helium show a knee - like feature , but in our model , this seems not to be the case . \n [ fig : zy4 ] \n a commonly - used quantity to characterize the mass composition of cosmic rays is the mean logarithmic mass , which is defined as @xmath69 @xmath70 being the relative fraction of nuclei of mass @xmath71 . \n the average mass is reported by many air shower experiments , but the results are divergent because of the poor primary mass resolution . \n we calculate the average mass for two cases : one for the former non - linear model and another for the latter best fitting case , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : zy5 ] .    from our derived average mass of cosmic rays , we can see @xmath72 goes up between several hundreds of tev and several tens of pev . \n it implies that heavier components occupy an increasing proportion with the increase of energy , and predicts an iron - dominant composition above the knee . \n but the components above the knee are not all @xmath29 , because @xmath72 for @xmath29 is about 4.0 . \n further experimental measurements of the chemical composition of high energy cosmic rays will verify our prediction . \n if the light components dominate the knee structure , this model can be excluded , while if the heavy components dominate the knee structure , this model will be confirmed , and the measurements will be helpful to improve the model parameters .     [ \n fig : zy5 ] \n many mechanisms have been discussed to explain the knee structure of cosmic rays , including the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays in supernova explosion shock fronts , leakage from the galaxy , interactions with background particles in the interstellar medium , and new physics of interactions in the atmosphere . \n some models are likely to be excluded , however , such as the leaky box model , interactions with background particles and new types of interactions in the atmosphere . \n the leakage from the galaxy does not give a distinct change of the spectral slope at the knee . \n the scenario of interactions with background particles yields a very light mean logarithmic mass , while the measurements indicate an increase of mass with energy . for new types of interactions in the atmosphere , \n there are no inconsistencies between the different air shower components by the simultaneous observations from kascade , and the measurements of different air shower components can be interpreted with standard particle physics @xcite . \n we propose two scenarios to reconcile the light components and all - particle energy spectra by phenomenological models . in the first scenario \n , we use a simple broken power - law model to fit the combined energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei measured by argo - ybj and the all - particle spectrum measured by tibet-@xmath0 , but the all - particle spectrum can not be fitted by this model . hence , the simple broken power - law fails to explain the knee structure . in the second scenario , \n a non - linear modification term is added to the broken power - law . \n this modified broken power - law model with non - linear acceleration effects can describe the sharp knee structure . \n the mechanism of non - linear effects at shock fronts of snrs has been explained in earlier works @xcite . \n particles with higher energies can scatter farther ahead of the shock , which results in an effectively higher compression ratio , so a more locally hard spectrum is produced , and a concave - up curvature to the accelerated - particle distribution is expected . \n in addition , this modified model predicts that heavy elements dominate at the knee . based on this model , some models holding the viewpoints of weak knee structure or protons dominating the knee are likely to be excluded . \n precise measurements of energy spectra of individual elements in the knee region will test our model .", "StartTimeOffset": 984307007689, "RequestID": "43d9f51470474e29a975d0d4fee2fbf6", "TotalTokens": 3846}

like particles can not penetrate into the volume occupied by atoms and molecules . \n this leads to a correction in the description of the ideal gas of the charged component  @xcite so that the ideal free energy of protons and electrons @xmath12 is dependent on the reduced volume @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ratio of the volume which can not be penetrated by point - like particles to the total volume . \n it is derived from hard sphere diameters obtained within the fvt self - consistently . the free energy density @xmath16 is given by fermi integrals which take into account quantum effects . \n in order to avoid an intersection of pressure isotherms , which is important for modelling planetary interiors , a minimum diameter @xmath17 has been introduced . \n it was determined starting at low temperatures where it remains almost constant up to 15.000  k , then it increases up to 20.000  k and remains constant again for higher temperatures , see fig . \n [ fig : dmin ] . \n these values are in the range of the results for the diameter of the hydrogen atom derived from the confined atom model  @xcite . \n consequently , the reduced volume concept changes the chemical potential of each component drastically at higher densities and results in pressure ionization . \n this is due to the fact that additional terms appear in the chemical potential , which is the particle number derivative of the free energy , and thermodynamic functions of degenerate plasmas are very sensitive to changes in density . \n this current model fvt@xmath18 includes all interaction contributions to the chemical potentials , thus being a generalization of earlier work  @xcite where only ideal plasma contributions have been treated ( fvt@xmath19 ) .    in fig . \n [ fig : compo ] the composition of hydrogen derived from the present approach is shown for two temperatures . \n hydrogen is an atomic gas at low temperatures ( left ) and low densities . with increasing densities molecules \n are formed due to the mass action law . \n pressure dissociation and ionization can be observed in the high - density region . \n the nonideality corrections to the free energy force a transition from a molecular fluid to a fully ionized plasma . at higher temperatures \n ( right ) the formation of molecules is suppressed and pressure ionization becomes the dominating process . at low densities and high temperatures a fully ionized plasma \n is produced due to thermal ionization . \n we show pressure isotherms over a wide range of temperatures and densities in fig . \n [ fig : piso ] . at low densities \n the system behaves like a neutral fluid . between densities of 10@xmath20 g/@xmath21 and 10@xmath22 g/@xmath21 nonideality corrections to the free energy of atoms and molecules \n lead to a nonlinear behavior of the isotherms . for still higher densities \n a phase transition occurs which is treated by a maxwell construction . \n the thermodynamic instability vanishes with increasing temperatures , and the critical point is located at 16.800  k , 0.35  g/@xmath21 , and 45  gpa .    the critical point and the related coexistence line are shown in fig . \n [ fig : pt ] and compared with results of other eos . \n the critical point itself lies within the range of other predictions , whereas the coexistence line is lower than most of the other results . for a comparison of data concerning the ppt , \n see table  [ tab : cp ] . \n new shock -

to - metal transition ( pressure ionization ) . \n we calculate the electrical conductivity as well as the reflectivity by applying the comptra04 program package  @xcite in order to locate this transition in the density - temperature plane . \n optical properties are calculated within the drude model . \n the reflectivity @xmath23 is given in the long - wavelength limit via the dielectric function @xmath24 which is determined by a dynamic collision frequency @xmath25 or , alternatively , by the dynamic conductivity @xmath26  @xcite : @xmath27 }   = 1+\\frac{\\text{i}}{\\varepsilon_0\\omega}\\sigma(\\omega ) , \\\\ \n \\sigma(\\omega)&= & \\sigma(0)\\left [   1-\\frac{\\text{i}\\omega}{\\varepsilon_0\\omega_{\\text{pl}}^2 }   \\sigma(0 ) \\right]^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath28 is the plasma frequency of the electrons . \n the reflectivity was determined along the hugoniot curve and is compared with experimental results  @xcite and those of the earlier model fvt@xmath19  @xcite in fig . \n [ fig : reflex ] . \n the results of the current model show a much better agreement with the experiment . \n the characteristic and abrupt rise with increasing pressure was reproduced more accurately . \n this drastic increase appears due to pressure ionization in the vicinity of the criotical point of the ppt . as a result \n , the reflectivity advances from very low values to metallic - like ones almost instantly . \n modelling the interiors of giant planets and comparison with their observational parameters offers an alternative tool besides laboratory experiments of probing the eos of the components the planets are predominantly made of . \n giant planets such as jupiter and saturn consist mainly of hydrogen and , in decreasing order , of helium , water and rocks , covering a wide range of pressures and temperatures . independently from the h - eos used for modelling , the simplest interior structure that is compatible with the observational constraints requires at least three homogenous layers with a transition from a cold molecular fluid in the outer envelope to a pressure ionized plasma in the deep interior and a dense solid core of ices and rocks . \n a solid core may be explained as a result of the formation process and the seperation into two fluid envelopes with different particle abundances by an existence of a ppt as provided by the fvt@xmath18 eos . \n the constraining observational parameters are the total mass of the planet @xmath29 , its equatorial radius @xmath30 , the temperature @xmath31 at the outer boundary , the average helium content @xmath32 , the period of rotation @xmath33 and the gravitational moments @xmath34 . from measurements of the luminosity \n it has been argued @xcite that the temperature profile should be adiabatic . for a given eos , \n the interior profiles of pressure @xmath35 and density @xmath36 are calculated by integration of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath37 along an isentrope defined by the outer boundary . \n the first term on the right hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq_hydrostatgg ] ) is the gravitational potential and the second term the centrifugal potential assuming axialsymmetric rotation . \n we apply the _ theory of figures _ \n @xcite up to third order to solve this equation and to calculate the gravitational moments . \n they are defined as the coefficients of the expansion of the gravitational potential into legendre polynomials , taken at the outer boundary . \n being integrals of the density distribution weighted by some power of the radius , they are very sensitive with respect to the amount and distribution of helium and heavier elements within the planet .    in accordance with previous calculations @xcite , mixtures of hydrogen with helium and heavier elements have been derived from the eos of the pure materials via the additive volume rule . \n it states that the entropy of mixing can be neglected .    assuming a three - layer structure , we present results for jupiter for the profiles of temperature , density , and pressure along the radius in fig . \n [ fig - profilejup ] using two different h - eos , the standard sesame table 5251 for hydrogen  @xcite and the fvt@xmath18 model presented above . \n the profiles of temperature appear very similar , meaning a small uncertainty about the real profiles . \n contrary , the density and pressure profiles exhibit more differences and require some explanation . in the fluid part of jupiter , the presence of a ppt leads to a jump in density between the envelopes . since the gravitational moments as integrals over the density have to be the same for both h - eos , the density profile of a h - eos with ppt has to be smaller in the outer envelope and larger in the inner envelope . the different size and composition of the core for these specific h - eos \n are a consequence of their different compressibility in the regime of pressure ionization at about 1  mbar , where the gravitational moments are most sensitive to the density distribution .    in case of a stiff h - eos like sesame \n , a larger amount of heavy elements is needed in the two fluid envelopes to compensate for the smaller hydrogen density at a given pressure . as a result \n , this material is added to the well - known density - pressure relation of degenerate electrons in the deep interior , leaving less material for the core . \n thus , in case of the sesame - eos , the amount of heavy elements becomes with 10% very large and an unlikely solution with a very small core of light material ( e.g.  water ) can be found .    in case of the fvt@xmath18 eos which is more compressible than the sesame eos at about 1  mbar \n , the helium content is below the value of 27.5% for the protosolar cloud in order to reproduce the lowest gravitational moment @xmath38 . \n furthermore , the next gravitational moment @xmath39 can not be reproduced correctly because the transition to the metallic envelope occurs already at about 90% of the radius and , thus , at too low densities . for opposite reasons , \n both the sesame and fvt@xmath18 eos applied in a three - layer model of jupiter are not compatible with _ all _ of the observational constraints . \n while sesame is probably too stiff , the fvt@xmath18 model is likely too soft in the wdm region at about 1  mbar . \n in this paper , we have extended the earlier chemical model fvt@xmath40 to calculate the eos of dense hydrogen . \n the current model fvt@xmath18 includes nonideality corrections to the free energy of each commponent of the partially ionized plasma . \n we have shown results for the composition and the thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen . \n the ppt was located in the phase diagram , its critical point coincides with earlier results . \n furthermore , we have determined optical properties such as reflectivity and conductivity , within linear response theory using the program package comptra04 . \n the calculated reflectivity along the experimental hugoniot curve shows a good agreement with the experiments . \n however , application of the fvt@xmath18 eos to the interior structure of jupiter indicates that the behavior at about 1  mbar is probably too soft . \n the same conclusion can be drawn from a comparison with shock - wave experiments that indicate the existence of a ppt  @xcite . \n fvt@xmath18 predicts the ppt at too low pressures as well as at too low densities . \n further efforts to solve this problem , especially concerning the reduced volume concept , are necessary . \n we thank p.  m.  celliers , w.  ebeling , v.  e.  fortov , v.  k.  gryaznov , w .- d . \n kraeft , and g.  rpke for stimulating discussions . \n this work was supported by the dfg within the sfb 652 strongly correlated matter in radiation fields and the grk 567 strongly correlated many particle systems .", "StartTimeOffset": 991848714856, "RequestID": "5be780f446d248d7a22ad856f1b9efb4", "TotalTokens": 3917}
{"ContextTokens": 1393, "GeneratedTokens": 256, "SynthesizedBody": "-0.1 in    dynamically cold , large galaxy disks seen today appear to have formed early or gradually ; they are easily destroyed through strong interactions or mergers . \n for example , wyse ( these proceedings ) argues the milky way has not suffered a major merger in the last 10 gyr . \n the nearly constant co - moving number of large disks out to @xmath1 ( e.g. lilly et al . \n 1998 ) and the subtle changes with redshift in the scaling relations for large , field spirals corroborate a picture of early formation or slow , quiescent growth , but infrequent death . \n the mass accretion rate onto disks is not known directly , however , at any epoch . \n direct measurements of disk mass as a function of time , e.g. , from measurement of disk scale - heights and stellar velocity dispersions , are desirable , but currently unavailable  except for a handful of local systems . \n photometric estimates of disk mass based on colors are uncertain and incomplete . \n another approach is to use the evolution of the zeropoint and scatter in disk scaling - relations as a diagnostic of _ changes _ in mass accretion rates . \n here we focus on the correlations with , and cause of the scatter in the tully - fisher relation .    for gradual formation , we assume that discrete , but small accretion events perturb otherwise axisymmetric systems . were we to obtain a complete census of galaxies at difference epochs , the relative number of perturbed systems should then reflect changes in the minor - merger rate . \n zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) estimated the minor - merger rate for nearby galaxies by comparing the amplitude of photometric @xmath2 modes to @xmath3 and offsets in luminosity from a fiducial tf relation . \n kinematic measures of disturbance would be preferred , however , since the long - term morphological perturbation may be subtle ( haynes 2000 ) , and photometric effects may evolve with look back - time due to changing gas fractions and star - formation rates ( mihos , these proceedings ) . here \n we give two examples of how spatially resolved kinematics can directly link disk asymmetries to scatter in the tf relation . \n this , in turn , points to a tractable method for measuring the growth rate of spiral disks . \n 0.15 in    -0.15 in    -0.35 in \n -0.1 in    using high signal - to - noise , integral - field , echelle spectroscopy and surface photometry of seven apparently face - on spirals , we have been able to construct h@xmath4 velocity fields out to 3 scale lengths , and compare kinematic to photometric position angles , and kinematic inclinations to photometric axis - ratios ( andersen et al . \n 2000 , and these proceedings ) . from mismatches between these quantities \n , we find that normal , non - barred , intermediate - type spiral disks are non - circular , with a model - dependent estimate of mean ellipticity at the 6% level . considering the effects of our observed distribution of intrinsic ellipticity only on the inferred photometric inclination , we estimate this accounts for @xmath5 mag of scatter in the tf - relation for samples selected within @xmath6 ( figure 1a ) , consistent with franx & de zeeuw s expectations ( 1992 ) . \n evidence that intrinsic ellipticity predominantly effects photometric but not kinematic measures of inclination is shown in figure 1b . \n we establish a tight , @xmath7-band tf relation for galaxies with @xmath8 by using kinematic inclinations . not only is our zeropoint in agreement with courteau ( 1997 ) , but our scatter is smaller ( albeit with a much smaller sample ) . \n hence , it is now possible to study the tf relation for nearly face - on samples , where photometric projection effects and internal extinction are minimized , and the perpendicular component of the disk velocity dispersion can be measured to estimate disk mass . \n -0.1 in    an outstanding question is whether local disk non - circularity is caused primarily by small amounts of lopsided matter accretion , triaxial halos , or other dynamical processes . in principle \n one might hope to determine this from a detailed analysis of disk velocity fields . alternatively \n , we look here to higher - redshift systems to see if greater ellipticity or asymmetry is evident , as we might expect if minor mergers are the dominant source of this perturbation . \n we recently acquired high - resolution , wiyn telescope images of a representative sample of luminous , field spirals at intermediate redshifts for which we have h@xmath4 rotation - curves ( e.g. , bershady et al . 1999 ) . \n we find that significantly over - luminous galaxies in the @xmath9 @xmath10-band tf relation tend to appear optically distorted in the wiyn images  something we were unable to determine during the selection process based on lower - resolution images . \n our definition of `` over - luminous '' accounts for the well - exhibited correlation of tf offsets with color ( figure 2b ) . \n some of the most extreme outliers exhibiting pronounced optical distortions are even accompanied by clear signatures of kinematic asymmetry . \n a representative sequence is shown in figure 3 . \n the physical connection arising here is between bluer colors and higher luminosity ( i.e. enhanced star - formation ) , which is accompanied by increased asymmetry at extreme offsets from a fiducial tf relation . the next step is to establish a statistical trend with redshift of increased asymmetry and tf offsets above and beyond changes in stellar m / l . \n to do so requires further observations . at intermediate redshifts , \n higher angular resolution is needed to detect and quantify the asymmetry in less extreme systems ; precision bi - dimensional spectroscopy is needed to determine reliable inclinations . \n locally , representative kinematic surveys are needed to understand the link between tf scatter and asymmetry .", "StartTimeOffset": 1000835925026, "RequestID": "3cccc1f0bd964845bac7d682bd511cf9", "TotalTokens": 1649}

rich molecular opacities . \n the @xmath3n(p,@xmath4)@xmath5o reaction rate , that sets the overall efficiency of the cno - cycle , was taken from @xcite . \n convective mixing is treated within mixing length theory ( mlt ) and a diffusive convective picture , including an exponentially decaying velocity field outside formal convective boundaries ( with a free parameter @xmath6 , see for details ) . from the calibration of the solar model with diffusion \n we obtain @xmath7 . \n the value of @xmath6 in convective cores is set to @xmath8 from the calibration of the width of the upper main sequence . \n this equivalent to an overshooting extension of 0.2 times the pressure scale height . \n the values of @xmath6 in the pulse driven convection zone ( pdcz ) during the thermal pulses in the agb is set to @xmath9 which allows to reproduce the range of he , c and o ratios observed in pg1159 type stars @xcite . \n the @xmath6-value at the bottom of the convective envelope is taken to be @xmath10 . \n winds are a decisive aspect of agb evolution since they determine when the tp -

dusty winds we included the @xcite which seems to reproduce some rgb and agb observables better than the standard reimers prescription @xcite . \n finally , for the hot radiative driven winds we adopted a mass loss prescription , @xmath14 , which is based on the results of and similar to the one adopted by . between the the hot and cold wind regime , @xmath15 , \n there are no available prescriptions and we had to rely on interpolations . \n -diagram of the computed sequences for z=0.01 . ]    ) from different sources as compared with our results for h -

agb remnant form @xmath24 to the point of maximum effective temperature ( `` knee '' , see fig . \n [ fig : kiel ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is well known that the computation of the very end of the tp - agb is riddled with convergence problems . \n this implies that a lot of human time ( baby - sitting ) is required to compute the transition from the tp - agb to the cspne phase . \n even when codes converge , convergence happens at the expense of a prohibitively small timesteps ( even down to @xmath26 hour ) . despite all numerical improvements our computations are not the exception \n consequently , the number of complete simulations presented in this work is rather small . in fig . \n [ fig : kiel ] we show the @xmath27-diagram ( `` kiel diagram '' ) for our @xmath28 sequences . \n table [ tab : grid ] shows the most relevant quantities of our tp - agb and post - agb stellar models . \n a comparison of the @xmath17-@xmath18 relationship of our models ( table [ tab : grid ] ) with semiempirical determinations from stellar clusters @xcite , common proper motion pairs or the galactic bulge suggest that our values of @xmath18 may me somewhat low . \n this is very likely the consequence of too strong third dredge up during the tp - agb @xcite . \n in fact , this causes the formation of c - rich stars already at the first thermal pulse in our low metallicity sequences ( z=0.001 and @xmath29 and 2.5 m@xmath30 ) . \n this might lead to disagreements with the carbon star luminosity function and thus to a need to re - calibrate the overshooting parameters during the tp - agb . \n however , it should be notice that the value of @xmath31 is required to reproduce the abundances of pg1159 type post - agb stars , leaving only @xmath32 as a possible free parameter .    a comparison of our timescales with those of previous models and semiempirical determinations ( see fig . [ \n fig : crossing ] ) allow us for some very interesting preliminary conclusions . \n on one hand , in the range of remnant masses where our models overlap with those of the agreement is quite good . \n this is particularly interesting in the light of the different numerical codes and wind prescriptions adopted . \n this suggests that the details of mass loss might not play a crucial role in the determination of post - agb timescales . \n given the uncertainties behind this ingredient of stellar evolution computations , this might be a good news . \n on the other hand , our models predict much shorter ( up to a factor of @xmath33 ! ) \n post - agb timescales than those of @xcite and . in the light of the agreement between our timescales and \n those of this suggests that stellar evolution computations based on old microphysics might have significantly overestimated the length of the cspne phase . \n interestingly enough our much shorter timescales are in agreement with the results from studies of pne that suggests that cspne should evolve several times faster than predicted by old stellar evolution models . \n last , but not least , our models do not predict a strong dependence of the post - agb timescales with metallicity . \n in addition , the post - agb mass - luminosity relation of modern models is different from that of old grids . \n all these results , if confirmed , will have an impact in the predictions of models for the formations of pne in different stellar populations . \n in particular , the impact of modern post - agb computations in the formation of the pnlf needs to be assessed .", "StartTimeOffset": 1023427314395, "RequestID": "6574ffe3689d4c308d109f9e133cdad9", "TotalTokens": 2570}

{"ContextTokens": 2878, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "the bright ap star @xmath0  cvn has been the subject of many observations over the past century , to name but a few ; babcock & burd ( 1952 ) ; pyper ( 1969 ) ; borra & landstreet ( 1977 ) , borra & vaughan ( 1978 ) and one of the most heavily studied magnetic chemically peculiar stars , with the first period determination as early as farnsworth ( 1932 ) . \n it was not until kochukhov et al . \n ( 2002 ) employed a new magnetic doppler imaging technique ( mdi ) ( described by piskunov & kochukhov ( 2002 ) and kochukhov & piskunov ( 2002 ) ) that the first high resolution maps of the surface vector magnetic field using stokes @xmath2 observations were made for @xmath0  cvn . \n these maps were later refined by using linear polarisation profiles ( stokes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) in combination with stokes @xmath2 ( kochukhov & wade 2010 ) . these maps ( along with maps of 53 cam , kochukhov et al . \n 2004 ) were distinguished from earlier models in that they were computed directly from the observed polarised line profiles , making no _ a priori _ assumptions regarding the large - scale or small - scale topology of the field . \n the mdi surface magnetic field maps of both stars revealed that their magnetic topologies depart significantly from low - order multipoles . \n these original maps were limited by the observational data : with musicos being a relatively inefficient medium - resolution spectropolarimeter mounted on a two - metre telescope , only a very small number of lines could be studied . with the new observations of ap stars in all four stokes parameters ( stokes @xmath1 ) using espadons and narval as described by silvester et al . \n ( 2012 ) it is possible to not only study a larger sample of ap stars , this new higher quality data allows the study of @xmath0  cvn at a resolution not previously possible . \n new higher resolution , higher signal to noise data allows us to probe more subtle spectral features which have been unresolved or buried in the noise in the musicos observations . \n @xmath0  cvn made an ideal candidate as the first star to map the magnetic topology using the new espadons and narval data and the invers10 code , because of the existence of the magnetic topology maps produced using musicos data . \n having this previous map set allows us to confirm that the new data are compatible with the old data and that newly modelled magnetic field is consistent with the field derived from the musicos maps . \n as is discussed by silvester et al . \n ( 2012 ) , the new observations obtained with espadons and narval were of much superior quality . \n the espadons and narval spectra offer a higher resolution than the musicos spectra ( with @xmath5 ) , and a larger wavelength coverage from 369 - 1048 nm ( with gaps at 922.4 to 923.4 nm , 960.8 to 963.6 nm and 1002.6 to 1007.4 nm ) and a much higher signal - to - noise ratio . \n ( the median signal - to - noise ratio of the reduced observations is over 700 per 1.8  kms@xmath6  pixel ) . \n an illustration of the improvement in data quality is given in fig . \n 1 which shows a comparison between the stokes @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles of hd 32633 in the fe ii 5018   line between espadons / narval and musicos , with the new data showing much clearer signatures and greatly reduced noise . at the same time \n silvester et al . \n ( 2012 ) showed that the new data were consistent with the musicos data of wade et al . \n to allow direct comparison with the original musicos maps of kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) , we reconstructed the magnetic field topology of @xmath0  cvn using the strong iron lines of fe ii 4923    and fe ii 5018   using the new espadons / narval data . \n the mdi mapping is performed using the invers10 code ( as described by piskunov & kochukhov ( 2002 ) , kochukhov & piskunov ( 2002 ) and kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) ) . \n invers10 constructs model line profiles based on an assumed initial surface distribution of free parameters ( element abundance and magnetic field geometry ) and then iteratively adjusts the parameters until the computed line profiles are in agreement with the observations . a direct comparison of the radial , meridional and azimuthal fields between the two data sets is shown in fig . \n [ field - maps - rec ] in a rectangular representation . \n good agreement can be seen between the maps reconstructed from the two data sets for all three field components , with the difference plot showing little structure . \n this indicates that the two maps are consistent and that the magnetic field is stable over this time period of 10 years spanned by the two data sets . \n as has been found in previous mapping of @xmath0  cvn ( kochukhov & wade 2010 ) , the magnetic field topology show complex substructure which could not be described by a dipolar or quadrupolar geometries . with these new data \n it is important to investigate whether that this is still the case and confirm that the observed profiles can not be correctly fitted with a more simple field topology . to confirm that this is indeed the case , \n the profiles for a set of 5 strong and weak iron lines were compared to model profiles one would obtain for a dipolar and dipolar plus quadrupolar geometry . to accomplish this comparison we have fitted four stokes parameter observations with a modified version of invers10 in which a direct description of the three field components was substituted with a multipolar parameterization similar to the one described by donati et al . \n further details about our implementation of mdi with multipolar expansion are provided by kochukhov et al . \n ( 2013 ) .    as illustrated in fig . \n [ othergeofit ] , it can be seen that neither model is in good agreement with the profiles , in particular with the stokes @xmath7 profiles . \n we can therefore conclude even with the new data , that a simple field topology can not describe the field structure of @xmath0 cvn . \n we have also started to investigate which chemical elements are suitable for use in the reconstruction of surface abundance structures in @xmath0 cvn . \n the basis of line selection was to start with the lines used in the mapping by kochukhov et al . \n ( 2002 ) and then to expand the list using the line list of pyper ( 1969 ) , cohen ( 1970 ) and to a lesser extent roby and lambert ( 1990 ) . \n this was combined with a visual inspection to eliminate lines from the list which were not clearly present in the spectrum , did not show variability or were heavily blended with other lines . in addition lines which suffered from non -

hamada and salpeter , 1961 ) . \n hamada and salpeter ( 1961 ) mentioned that for massive wds ( @xmath0 @xmath4 0.7 ) non degenerate envelope is rather insignificant . \n benvenuto and althaus ( 1998 ) in their recent studies also concluded that thick h envelopes increase the radii especially in the case of low mass wds . \n the recent studies on the relation of m - r for the wds are those of wood ( 1990 ) , vennes et al . \n ( 1995 ) and althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 , 1998 ) . \n vennes et al . \n ( 1995 ) computed static m - r relation for masses between 0.4 @xmath0 and 0.7 @xmath0 assuming non zero temperature effects . \n they assumed the luminosity is proportional to the mass which works for cool wds but their results are in the range of high effective temperatures . \n as althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 ) mentioned , luminosity is not proportional to a constant for hot wd interiors because of neutrino emission . \n one must include neutrino cooling which causes larger radii for wds . \n neutrino losses are important especially for masses greater than 0.4 @xmath0 ( see fig.11 of althaus and benvenuto , 1997 ) . \n the purpose of this study is to present the effect of neutrino emission at finite temperatures . \n we considered fully degenerate configuration for wds with pure helium composition to obtain m - r relation for masses greater than 0.4 @xmath0 with neutrino emission taken into account as well . in section 2 \n we describe the procedure that we follow . in section 3 \n we present and discuss the results and compare the obtained m - r relation with the other results . \n our stellar wd models are calculated on the assumption that the wd is spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium . \n then , four stellar structure equations that must be satisfied by this structure are integrated outward with runga - kutta iteration tecnique . for the equation of state , we followed the procedure given by althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 ) for a dense plasma in which the electrons are strongly degenerate at a finite temperature , that is we included in the equation of state coulomb interaction , thomas - fermi deviation from uniform charge distribution of the electrons and the exchange contribution to the free energy at finite temperature . \n as far as neutrino losses are concerned we considered photo neutrino process ( itoh et al . , 1989 ) , \n plasma neutrino process ( itoh et al . , 1989 ; itoh et al . , 1992 ) and neutrino bremstrahlung for the liquid phase ( itoh and kohyama , 1983 ) . \n for the conductive opacities we used the analytic fits given by itoh et al . \n ( 1983 ) for high densities . \n in this paper , we give the first results of our white dwarf models including neutrino emission , that is m - r relations of the fully degenerate helium wds for masses greater than 0.4 @xmath0 are presented . \n figure 1 . shows the m - r relations for helium wds calculated by hamada and salpeter ( 1961 ) , althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 ) , vennes et al . \n ( 1995 ) and our results . in this figure , plus sign shows our results obtained at the temperature @xmath5= @xmath6 k using the density values given in table 1a of hamada and salpeter ( 1961 ) for helium core ( cross sign shows the results of hamada and salpeter ) . \n the difference in mass and radius is about 1% . \n as seen from the figure the static mass - radius relations are modified by thermal effects and neutrino emission particularly for wds of low mass . \n these thermal effects and neutrino emission can cause deviations from the zero temperature m - r curve which are almost of the same order as hamada - salpeter corrections to the standard chandrasekhar m - r curve . \n we repeated the calculations for a different central temperature @xmath5= 5x@xmath6 k. the resulting data is also shown ( circle sign ) in the figure . \n the increase in @xmath5 causes the curve to shift upward for the masses smaller than 0.7 @xmath0 . \n we plot on the same figure also the results of althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 ) for zero temperature ( star sign ) and for @xmath5= 5x@xmath6 k helium wd models ( full box sign ) . \n the models of vennes et al . \n ( 1995 ) for masses smaller than 0.7 @xmath0 are shown by open box sign . \n their models have larger radii than the other models plotted in the same figure due to the high effective temperature ( 49000 k ) they used which means higher central temperature .    in our calculations with internal temperature of 5x@xmath6 k , we found r=0.015 @xmath7 for 0.5 @xmath0 wd . the effective temperature of 0.5 @xmath0 wd star can be assigned to be in the range 17x@xmath8 - 17.5x@xmath8 k using the results of atweh and eryurt - ezer ( 1991 ) for the lower boundary of convection zone of helium wds in the case of strong convection . \n they give the depth of convection zone for this effective temperature range between 30 and 60 km . \n therefore , about 7% difference in the radii of 0.5 @xmath0 wds at the mentioned interior temperature , between our study and the study of althaus and benvenuto , is not due only to the absence of helium atmosphere in our study but also due to neglecting star s thermal history . \n detailed evolutionary models are necessary for better interpretation of observations of wds . \n we would like to thank prof . \n d. eryurt - ezer for her suggestions in this study . \n 99    althaus l.g . , and benvenuto o.g . \n : 1997 , astrophys . \n j. 477 , 313 atweh z.m . , and eryurt - ezer d.:1991 , astrophys . \n space sci . \n 187 , 27 benvenuto o.g . , and \n althaus l.g . : 1998 , mnras 293 , 177 chandrasekhar , s. : 1939 , an introduction to the study of stellar structure ( chicago : univ . \n chicago press ) hamada t. , and salpeter e.e . : 1961 , astrophys . \n j. 134 , 683 itoh n. , and kohyama y.:1983 , astrophys . \n j. 275 , 858 itoh n. , mitake s. , iyetomi h. , and ichimaru s.:1983 , astrophys . \n j. 273 , 774 itoh n. , adachi t. , nakagawa m. , kohyama y. , and munataka h.:1989 , astrophys . \n j. 339 , 354 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3765, "GeneratedTokens": 245, "SynthesizedBody": "the elemental abundance in galaxies is an essential parameter for understanding how galaxies evolve , and provides important constraints on current models for their formation \n . it also constrains models for stellar evolution and for primordial nucleosynthesis .    the elemental abundance in spiral galaxies was first thought to depend essentially on local properties of the interstellar medium , such as the density of gas . \n recent studies have shown that it depends predominantly on global properties of the galaxies , such as mass or hubble type , but the situation is still rather confused . \n garnett & shields ( 1987 ) find evidence for a correlation between mean metal abundance and total luminosity . \n oey & kennicutt ( 1993 ) find no such correlation for early - type ( sa to sb ) galaxies , but note that early - type galaxies have higher metal abundances than late - type ones . using a different sample of galaxies , zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra ( 1994 ; hereafter zkh ) confirm that the abundance is correlated with total luminosity ; they also state that stochastic events , such as starbursts and external accretion of matter , could only contribute to the scatter in the abundance values .    a first evidence that starbursts are in fact a driving mechanism in the chemical evolution of spiral galaxies has been presented by coziol ( 1996b ) . \n he finds that the starburst nucleus galaxies ( hereafter sbngs ) are less chemically evolved than galaxies with similar morphologies and comparable luminosities , and that the sbngs seem to follow the same luminosity \n metallicity linear relation as the irregular and elliptical galaxies .    in this _ letter _ \n , we use new spectroscopic data on a large sample of markarian sbngs ( contini 1996 ) to establish coziol s claim on firmer observational ground . in other words \n , we compare the global chemical characteristics of early- and late - type sbngs with those of normal giant galaxies , of hii galaxies , of irregular and elliptical galaxies . \n our sample of sbngs is composed of 62 markarian barred galaxies from the study of contini ( 1996 ) , of a sample of 40 compact kiso galaxies ( comte et al . \n 1994 ) and of a sample of 20 sbngs from the mbg survey ( coziol et al . \n 1994 , 1996 ) . \n the starburst nature of all these galaxies was established by the different authors in the original articles using standard diagnostic diagrams of emission line ratios ( baldwin et al . \n 1981 , hereafter bpt ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 , hereafter vo ) . \n the comparison samples were taken from the literature . \n we used the sample of normal spiral galaxies of zkh , to which we added the sample of early  type spirals observed by oey & kennicutt ( 1993 ) . \n the sample of irregular galaxies is from skillman et al . \n ( 1989 ) . as samples of hii galaxies ( see coziol 1996a , for a definition of the two main types of starburst galaxies ) , we used those of the caln - tololo survey ( pea et al . \n 1991 ) and those of the catalogue of terlevich et al . \n finally , we also included a sample of luminous arp interacting galaxies ( keel et al . \n 1985 ) . \n since we are using various sources for our samples of galaxies , we must verify the consistency of the derived abundances . \n those of the giant spiral galaxies are average values ; they were estimated by measuring the mean values , normalized to a mean radius , of the abundances of at least 10 disk hii regions . \n for the starburst galaxies , the measures were done with long slits centered on the nucleus ( sbngs ) or on the most luminous part of the galaxy ( hii galaxies ) . because the hii galaxies have small angular dimensions \n , the slit aperture usually covers the entire galaxy and the measured metallicities are therefore good estimates of their mean metallicities . in the case of the sbngs , which have higher angular dimensions than the hii galaxies , \n the abundances are mostly those of the nuclei . in normal spirals \n , the metallicities usually increase toward the center of the galaxies ( zkh ) ; preliminary results indicate that this is probably also true for the sbngs ( considre et al . in preparation ) . \n the abundances of the sbngs represent therefore upper limits of their mean metallicities . \n the metallicities ( [ o / h ] ) of the hii galaxies were estimated by determining the electron temperature using [ oiii]@xmath04363 . for the sbngs \n this line is usually not observed and we used the metallicity index r@xmath1 ( pagel et al . \n 1979 ) , or some comparable methods based on r@xmath1 . \n we verified that all these methods give similar results . \n one of the methods ( coziol et al . 1994 ) is based on the calibration of a diagnostic diagram using hii region samples where the electron temperature is determined using [ oiii]@xmath04363 and covering metallicities between -0.9 and 0.3 dex . \n the differences between the metallicities obtained by this method and the others are generally much lower than the typical uncertainty of 0.2 dex associated to each of these methods . \n the redshifts and the adopted morphologies for all the galaxies are as given in the original papers or were found in ned or in leda . \n for some galaxies , the b magnitudes were not given in the original papers and were found in ned . \n no internal extinction correction was applied . \n all the absolute magnitudes were determined or corrected for the value h@xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . \n table 1 gives the mean absolute magnitudes and metallicities for the different samples of galaxies . \n the early  type sbngs are poorer in metals on average by 0.2 dex with respect to the late  type sbngs and by nearly 0.3 dex with respect to the giant spirals . \n on the other hand , both types of sbngs share the same distribution in luminosities . \n this is a strong indication that the differences between the two types of sbngs are real , and not a selection effect . \n moreover , the low abundance can not be an artefact caused by the small aperture used in our spectroscopic setup , since this tends to raise , rather than lower , the measured abundance .    in figure 1 \n , we compare the behavior of the abundance with respect to morphology for the sbngs and the normal and hii galaxies . \n as expected , the normal galaxies show a morphology  metallicity trend : the metallicity increases from the late  type spirals to the early  type ones . \n this trend is not observed for the hii galaxies , which have lower mean abundances than normal galaxies ; this is not new and is related to the low luminosities and small masses of these galaxies . \n but our luminous sbngs do not follow the morphology  metallicity trend either . \n although chemically richer than the hii galaxies , the sbngs are nonetheless significantly deficient in metals as compared to normal galaxies . in figure 1 , this phenomenon is most evident for the early - type sbngs ( t @xmath4 ) . \n our results are based on the assumption that the main source of ionization of the gas in the sbngs is ob stars , like in normal hii regions . \n this is implicit in the definition of starbursts based on diagnostic diagrams of emission line ratios . \n but the spectra of the sbngs show one important difference with respect to those of disk hii regions : their ratios [ nii]/h@xmath5 are on average 0.2 dex higher \n ( coziol et al . 1996 ) . \n if this excess emission corresponds to a supplementary nonthermal ionizing source , like a hidden agn or shock  heated gas , such as embedded supernova remnants , this could indeed produce a false effect of lower metallicity .    to verify this hypothesis \n , we compare in figure 2 the ratios [ sii]/h@xmath5 with the ratios [ nii]/h@xmath5 . \n both ratios would increase in the presence of a nonthermal ionizing source . \n we find no relation between the ratios of these two lines . \n we also verified that there is no relation between [ sii]/h@xmath5 or [ nii]/h@xmath5 and the metallicity . in figure 2 , \n the dot  dashed line corresponds to the lower limit predicted by shock models ( see vo and ho et al . \n the values for the sbngs are well below this value . \n in fact , the majority of sbngs have [ sii]/h@xmath5 ratios within 0.2 dex of the mean ratios observed in normal hii regions ( greenawalt & walterbos 1996 ) . in figure 2 \n , we also see that very few sbngs have nitrogen emission above the lower limit proposed by ho et al . \n ( 1993 ) for transition galaxies ( that is galaxies with agn @xmath6 hii region spectra ) . \n vron et al . ( \n 1996 ) also found very few transition galaxies . \n the presence of a hidden agn in the sbngs is also ruled out because of the weakness of [ oi]@xmath06300 : only @xmath7 40% of our galaxies show this line and their ratios log([oi]/h@xmath5 ) @xmath8 are similar to those of normal hii regions ( bpt , vo ) . \n we conclude that there is nothing in the spectra of the sbngs to prevent us from applying normal hii region models to sbngs , and the low metallicity of the sbngs is therefore real .    a first assumption that comes to mind for explaining the low metal abundance in sbngs is massive accretion of unprocessed gas during gravitational interaction with another galaxy ( coziol 1996b ) , which would explain both the reduced elemental abundance and the starburst . \n but most sbngs are isolated ( contini 1996 ; coziol et al . 1996 ) and there is no evidence of lower abundances in the sample of luminous arp interacting galaxies . \n this suggests that the low \n metallicity is a characteristic of the sbngs , which depends on their particular history of formation .    in figure 3 , we show the diagram of metallicity as a function of luminosity for the galaxies of our samples . \n the solid line is the linear relation for the irregular and elliptical galaxies reported by zkh . \n it appears that the early  type sbngs scatter around this relation more closely than do the other galaxy types . to test this hypothesis , we calculated the differences between the abundances predicted by the linear relation and the observed abundances for each of the galaxies . \n the distributions of these differences are shown in figure 4 . \n the early - type sbngs have the same distribution as the irregulars , whereas the late  type sbngs show the same type of deviation as the giant spirals . the hypothesis that the distributions for the early and late  type sbngs come from the same parent population \n is rejected at a confidence level of 99% with a kolmogorov \n smirnov test . \n the deviation of the hii galaxies from the linear relation in figure 3 and 4 is a consequence of the starbursts , because their luminosity is more affected by starbursts than that of massive galaxies , and they are therefore more luminous than their metallicity suggests . \n our new data on sbngs allow us to confirm the phenomenon discovered by coziol ( 1996b ) : the sbngs are less chemically evolved than normal galaxies . \n this is inconsistent with the current hypothesis that sbngs are evolved galaxies which were rejuvenated by interactions . \n the difference between the early and late  type sbngs is also very meaningful , because , among the mechanisms considered by coziol ( 1996b ) for explaining the metal deficiency of sbngs , only one predicts such a difference . \n this is the model of hierarchical formation of galaxies ( tinsley & larson 1979 ) , according to which ellipticals and bulges of spiral galaxies are formed by a sequence of mergers of stellar and gaseous systems . therefore , bulge - dominated sbngs must follow the same luminosity \n metallicity relation as ellipticals . \n this implies that bulges of spirals are similar to elliptical galaxies , which is now supported by observations ( see jablonka et al . \n 1996 ) . \n if a sufficiently large fraction of gas is left from the initial merger , it will collapse to form a disk . struck  marcell ( 1981 ) showed that when the gas fraction of matter accreted increases , the successive generations of star have higher abundances than in the merger case . during galaxy formation \n , the metallicity of the gas will therefore increase faster in the disk  dominated sbngs than in the bulge  forming sbngs . \n it is very interesting to find that the disk  dominated sbngs share the same position in the luminosity  metallicity diagram as the giant spirals . indeed , \n following kennicutt ( 1983 ) , one explanation for the nearly constant star formation rates of the giant spiral galaxies over the last few gyrs is that they have accreted extra gas in their disk . \n we confirm coziol s ( 1996b ) claim that luminous sbngs are less chemically evolved than normal spiral galaxies . \n this is a strong indication that luminous sbngs are in fact galaxies still in the process of formation . \n we have also found a difference between the abundances of the early and late  type sbngs . \n this difference is consistent with the predictions of the model of hierarchical formation of galaxies . \n our results suggest that galaxy formation is a continuing process and that the starburst phenomenon is a normal phase in the formation of all galaxies . \n this scenario has some important implications for the observation of galaxies in formation at high redshifts . \n it predicts that the fraction of interacting and merging objects should be higher in the past ; at high redshifts the number of early  type galaxies should be lower and the grand \n design late \n type spirals should appear later . \n these predictions may already have been verified by observations ( kauffman et al . 1996 ; van den bergh et al . 1996 ) . \n r. coziol acknowledges the financial support of the fapesp under contract 94/3005 - 0 and of the cnpq , under contracts 360715/96 - 6 ( nv ) . \n this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , and of the lyon meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , supplied by the leda team at cral - observatoire de lyon ( france ) . \n we thank sylvain blaize for his contribution to this project . \n lccc giant spirals&53&20.28 @xmath9 1.43&0.03 @xmath9 0.05 sbng ( early ) & 76&19.68 @xmath9 1.28&0.25 @xmath9 0.04sbng ( late ) & 46&19.74 @xmath9 1.66&0.05 @xmath9 0.08 irregulars & 20&15.20 @xmath9 5.09&1.06 @xmath9 0.13 hii galaxies & 44&17.64 @xmath9 2.93&0.86 @xmath9 0.07", "StartTimeOffset": 1072014758637, "RequestID": "0f25bca018ec4cb48804b57b0aabd9b7", "TotalTokens": 4010}

stable circular orbit ( isco ) out to @xmath4 . \n several configurations have been proposed for the disk and the continuum x \n ray  source : the hot and radiatively compact spherical corona with radius between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite ; the slab geometry @xcite ; the patchy structure @xcite ; and the jet base interpretation @xcite , just to mention some of them . \n we adhere to the slab geometry : in the following , the corona is a parallel plane at a negligible distance above the disk . \n the inner radius of the corona is forced to be coincidental with the isco , while its outer radius is only a few @xmath1 . \n for the reprocessed component , we assume it to arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk , between the isco and an outer limit determined by the disk s emissivity index which is constrained to satisfy that at least @xmath7 of the reprocessed emission comes from the innermost @xmath8@xmath9@xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath10 . \n the eclipsing cloud is assumed to be co  rotating with the disk at a velocity of 3000kms@xmath11 , typical of the blr of the system . since these kind of obscuration events are more likely to be detected in unobscured sources , we disregard the torus of the unification models within the framework of this work . \n we build our model within @xcite , as a power law accounting for the x  ray  continuum , plus the x  ray  reflection code xillver @xcite accounting for the reflection component . \n these two components are multiplied by the kynconv relativistic convolution model @xcite , which adds all relativistic effects due to strong gravity and fast motions close to the smbh , allowing to obscure part of the emission with a circular cloud whose size and position can be determined . \n we model the accretion disk to cover at least one half of the sky as seen from the central engine , with a typical ionization of @xmath12ergcms@xmath11 and solar abundances . \n the energy cutoff is frozen to 300kev . \n the main parameters that can be tuned are : the inclination @xmath13 of the system with respect to our los ; the black hole spin @xmath14 ; the emissivity index @xmath15 ; the cloud position ; and the cloud size . \n the column density @xmath16 and ionization log@xmath17 of the cloud are set by the ionized absorption code @xcite . \n we model the galactic absorption as a neutral absorption component . \n we build this model as an upgrade of our previous gr - model @xcite . \n below we explain the role of every parameter involved in it . \n absorption due to material in our galaxy is modelled by means of the photoelectric absorption component in . \n we choose an intermediate arbitrary intermediate value of @xmath18 . \n absorption due to partially ionized material in the host galaxy is modelled with . \n the equivalent column density ranges from @xmath19 ( compton  thin ) to @xmath20 ( compton  thick ) , typical for clouds in the blr . its ionization takes values between @xmath21 ( neutral ) and @xmath22 ( highly ionized material ) . \n the radius and position of the cloud are determined by a set of parameters of the relativistic code , all in terms of gravitational radii . \n the primary continuum emission from the corona is modelled with a simple power law component with photon index set to a typical value of @xmath23 . \n the continuum normalization is chosen so that the unabsorbed @xmath24kev  x  ray  flux is @xmath25erg@xmath26s@xmath11 , typical for bright , local agn . \n an exponential high  energy cutoff of @xmath27kev  is set . \n the reprocessed emission is modelled by means of the x \n ray  reflection code @xcite . \n the photon index is the same as for the continuum . \n the iron abundance is set to solar and the disk ionization is fixed to a typical value of log@xmath28 in order to allow the existence of enough reflection features . \n we set the same cutoff as for the power law . \n finally , the reflection normalization is fixed in order to get a reflection fraction between 1 and 2 , i.e.  the disk to cover at least one half of the sky as seen from the central engine , in agreement with observations . \n lightcurves created by a circular cloud eclipsing a plane \n parallel annular source inclined @xmath29 . \n the cloud radius is @xmath30@xmath1 and the annular source has inner and outer radii of @xmath31@xmath1 and @xmath32@xmath1 respectively . \n the solid grey line is the monte carlo simulated flux during an eclipse involving a newtonian isotropically  emitting disk , and the dashed black line represents the fit to two gaussians . \n the solid green line is the flux simulated from the kynconv relativistic model , emitted from a disk around a rotating black hole with spin @xmath33 ( isco = @xmath34@xmath1 ) . \n the dotted green line is the fit to two gaussians . \n , scaledwidth=61.8% ]    the inclination of the system , defined as the angle between the normal to the disk and our los , directly determines how asymmetric the flux - lightcurves are during an eclipse with respect to the position of the black hole . when the system is observed face  on , doppler boosting is undetectable from our point of view : there are no approaching nor receding regions in the disk , since its orbital plane is perpendicular to our los . \n therefore the flux - profiles observed are symmetric . \n the larger the inclination is , the greater is the doppler boosting effect , so that the more noticeable is the asymmetry of these profiles , independently of every other parameter . \n an example of a lightcurve produced during an eclipse of a plane \n parallel annular x \n ray  source inclined @xmath29 is shown in fig . \n [ comparison_newton_rel ] . the newtonian case is included in the figure in order to ease comparison with the gr one . \n notice that the flux from the approaching side of the disk ( left wing ) is several times greater than that from the receding side ( right wing ) in the gr - dominated scenario . \n different values of the isco , and hence the smbh spin , imprint the eclipse lightcurves too . in the cases where the cloud size is comparable to the isco , it is possible to measure the isco with great precision in an unprecedented manner when the size of the cloud is known , by simply measuring the distance between the peak preceding and following the smbh position in the lightcurves \n when larger clouds are involved in the eclipse , gr effects are still detectable , although measurement of the isco becomes infeasible . \n it is important to mention that the secondary peaks of the lightcurves obtained in some of the configurations described here are beyond the limits of detectability of available instruments . \n however , detectability by future x \n ray  observatories such as the athena mission must be further investigated . yet , most of the actual physical situations still represent interesting cases that we can discern by using current technology . \n the singular shapes of the light curves described in section[model ] can explain the second rise observed in some other light curves detected in actual observations taken during blr clouds eclipses . \n variable partial covering in the time  resolved spectral analysis of the seyfert galaxy ngc1365 is well explained by a model consisting of a constant continuum absorbed by a constant column density , plus a variable partial  covering component @xcite . \n the covering fraction variations are highly significant and clearly show the signature of a complete transit of an eclipsing cloud . \n the same behaviour is shown by swiftj2127.4 + 5654  @xcite . \n this inspires us to dig into the analysis of these relativistic effects by means of fits to real spectra . in the following paragraphs \n , we describe our study of gr effects in the eclipse detected in our  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 . \n first we fix some parameters based in previous unabsorbed observations . \n the inclination angle is fixed to the common value of @xmath35 @xcite . \n also , we fix the smbh spin to @xmath36 @xcite . \n the photon index is fixed to @xmath23 @xcite . \n the emissivity index of the disk is fixed to @xmath37 @xcite . \n metal abundances are consistently set to solar @xcite . \n the ionization of the reflector is fixed to @xmath38ergcms@xmath11 @xcite . \n we adopt the high  energy cutoff @xmath39kev  @xcite . \n we fix the column density of the neutral eclipsing cloud to @xmath40@xmath26 @xcite . \n finally , we assume that the cloud follows a keplerian orbit co  rotating with the smbh and the accretion disk , moving at velocity @xmath41kms@xmath11  @xcite . for a black hole mass of @xmath42@xmath43 , \n this is @xmath44@xmath1ks@xmath11 . \n the occultation event characterised in swiftj2127.4 + 5654  lasts @xmath45ks , so that considering the upper limit in the velocity as the correct value , the cloud would travel a distance of @xmath9@xmath1 within this lapse @xcite . \n we divide the spectra in 24 equal sub \n spectra , consequently each one of these sub  spectra covers @xmath46@xmath1 in the cloud s orbit . \n we force the position @xmath47@xmath1 to coincide with the lowest flux observations , so that our observation starts when the cloud is at @xmath48@xmath1 and ends when it reaches @xmath49@xmath1 . \n the only parameters that are not frozen are the normalizations of the power law and the reflection component , and the radii of the obscuring cloud and the corona . \n these four parameters are free to vary . \n the normalization of the reflection component , as well as the cloud and source radii are constrained to be the same for all of the 24 spectra . \n the normalizations of the power law are allowed to vary independently for every spectrum . \n we performed fits with all the 24 spectra extracted from the  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 . \n the results of the fit are poorly constrained ( @xmath50/dof@xmath8@xmath51 , see left column of table[tab : swift_fit ] ) . \n we further investigate any possible improvement by allowing the column density of the cloud to vary . \n the fit gets much better ( @xmath50/dof@xmath52 , see right column of table[tab : swift_fit ] ) . \n absorption is negligible in all spectra above @xmath53kev , becoming important in the soft and intermediate x  rays . \n c c c parameter & @xmath54 fix & @xmath54 free + @xmath55@xmath26 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + nors . \n pl & @xmath64 & @xmath65

@xmath72@xmath1 . \n the cloud s radius is @xmath73@xmath1 , i.e.  the cloud represents around @xmath8@xmath74 of the source in size ( @xmath8@xmath75 in projected surface ) . \n the cloud is only a few times ( less than one order of magnitude ) thicker than when @xmath54 was fixed , with column density of @xmath76@xmath26 , in stead of the originally fixed value of @xmath77@xmath26 . \n these results on the geometry of the system are complementary to those obtained when the gr eclipsing cloud code was not used ( see @xcite ) , with cloud and source sizes @xmath78@xmath79@xmath80@xmath1 , and @xmath81@xmath79@xmath82@xmath1 , respectively : both the cloud and the source are slightly larger , most likely in order to account for the larger column density ( @xmath8@xmath83@xmath26 in stead of @xmath8@xmath84@xmath26 ) . \n we have introduced a new relativistic x  ray  spectral model for characterising x \n ray  occultation events , involving key parameters such as the size of the x  ray  emitting regions ( the innermost accretion disk and/or the corona ) , the disk s emissivity index , the column density , ionization state , linear size and velocity of the obscuring cloud , the black hole spin , and the inclination of the system with respect to our los . tests on  simulated data show that our instruments detect anisotropic emission from the disk : gr effects enhance the emission from the side of the disk approaching towards the observer , while emission from the receding parts decreases . \n we show how an eclipse of the x  ray  emitting regions by a cloud in the blr of the system can be used to probe the close environments of the central smbh . \n since the tests carried out have been satisfactory , we fit our relativistic model to real data from a long  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 . \n we define an annulus - like x  ray  source , parallel and close to the accretion disk , whose inner radius is fixed to @xmath71@xmath1 from previous unabsorbed observations . \n we compute its outer radius to be @xmath72@xmath1 . \n the radius of the eclipsing cloud is @xmath73@xmath1 , and its column density is @xmath76@xmath26 . as compared to our previous , non - relativistic work , \n the sizes of the cloud and the source are lightly larger , probably in order to balance the larger column density calculated in the gr scenario . \n financial support

{"ContextTokens": 3553, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "distributed storage systems ( dss ) are widely used today for storing data reliably over long periods of time using a distributed collection of storage nodes , which may be individually unreliable . \n application scenarios include large data centers such as total recall @xcite , oceanstore @xcite and peer - to - peer storage systems such as wuala @xcite , that use nodes across the internet for distributed file storage . \n one of the challenges for dss is the _ repair problem _ : if a node storing a coded piece fails or leaves the system , in order to maintain the same level of reliability , we need to create a new encoded piece and store it at a new node with the minimum repair bandwidth . to solve this problem , dimakis _ et al . \n _ introduced a generic framework based on _ regenerating codes _ ( rc ) in @xcite . \n rc use ideas from network coding to define a new family of erasure codes that can achieve different trade - offs in the optimization of storage capacity and communication costs . \n the optimal tradeoff curve for achievable codes has two extremal points which are of particular interest : the minimum storage regenerating ( msr ) codes with minimum possible storage size for a given repair capability , and the minimum bandwidth regenerating ( mbr ) codes with minimum possible repair bandwidth . \n consider a minimum storage system , where a source file of size @xmath3 units is split into @xmath4 parts , defined over a finite field @xmath5 and stored across @xmath6 nodes in the dss . while the economy in storage is highly desirable \n , issues may arise when the system tries to repair failure at the optimal repair bandwidth . specifically , \n if @xmath7 or @xmath3 grows to be arbitrarily large , then the system may become inefficient and impractical due to the high computational complexity or the fast growing storage consumption . \n another challenge for dss is data availability , which is of critical importance to a peer - to - peer ( p2p ) storage / backup system that relies on a swarm of distributed and independent nodes for file storage . as the nodes not only differ in their storage capacity and traffic bandwidth , but they may not be online or available at all times . hence , there is a pressing need to increase the data availability , such that infomation is available with a probability approaching 1 . \n clearly , p2p enrironments are heterogeneous by nature , and code design for such systems must explicitly account for this heterogeneity . \n the primary interest of this paper is to study a _ \n non - homogeneous dss _ , where one _ super node _ has a larger storage size and higher reliability and availability than the other storage nodes . \n we study a class of high - rate @xmath8 mds storage codes , and show that with mds code such non - homogeneous dss can achieve the optimal bound in @xcite when repairing single or double - node failures , but require smaller @xmath3 and @xmath7 than the traditional homogeneous model in @xcite . another proposed scheme based on non - mds codes \n is shown to repair 1-node failure below the optimal repair bandwidth bound in @xcite . \n moreover , we show that our proposed non - homogeneous dss schemes can achieve a higher data availability than the traditional homogeneous dss scheme . \n this paper is organized as follows . \n section ii shows the definition of non - homogeneous dss . \n section iii shows three proposed schemes of exact repair with @xmath8 storing codes in non - homogeneous dss . \n section iv shows the numerical results of our schemes and the comparison with previous methods . \n finally , the paper is concluded in section v.    ] \n in this section , we present a brief review of the traditional homogeneous dss proposed in @xcite . \n then , a new model of non - homogeneous dss is proposed to realize the practical dss . \n we follow the definition of traditional homogeneous dss using @xmath9 regenerating codes over finite field @xmath5 . \n this network has @xmath6 storage nodes and every @xmath4 nodes suffice to reconstruct all the data . \n the size of the file to be stored is @xmath3 units and partitioned into @xmath4 equal parts @xmath10 where @xmath11 . after encoding them into @xmath6 coded parts using an @xmath12 maximum distance separable ( mds ) code , we store them at @xmath6 nodes . \n we define here the mds property of a storage code using the notion of data collectors as presented in @xcite . \n a storage code where each node contains @xmath13 worth of storage , has the mds property if a data collector can reconstruct the all the @xmath3 units by connecting to any @xmath4 out of @xmath6 storage nodes . \n when a node fails , the data stored therein is recovered by downloading @xmath14 packets each from any @xmath15 of the remaining @xmath16 nodes ;

homogeneous dss schemes achieve a higher data availability than the traditional homogeneous dss . \n the gap between the two becomes larger when the online availability of the super node increases , e.g. when @xmath86 is greater than 25% of @xmath87 , the data availability of the proposed non - homogenous over homogenous dss is increased by 10% .    ] \n we proposed three distributed storage schemes for _ non - homogeneous dss _ with high rate @xmath8 codes . \n two of the schemes make use of mds code , and can achieve optimal repair bandwidth of @xmath1 at smaller finite field @xmath7 and 75% smaller fragment @xmath3 than @xcite . \n small @xmath3 and @xmath7 are desirable , because they reduce the update bandwidth and complexity . \n another scheme based on non - mds code can achieve a smaller repair bandwidth than the optimal bandwidth based on mds code by @xmath2 for 1-node failure . \n we further demonstrate that in such non - homogeneous dss , if we can ensure one super node with a higher online probability than the other nodes , we can achieve a higher data availability than the homogeneous dss . \n this research is partly supported by the international design center ( grant no . \n idg31100102 & idd11100101 ) . \n li s work is supported in part by the national science foundation under grants no . \n ccf-0829888 , cmmi-0928092 , and eager-1133027 . \n papailiopoulos , a.g . \n dimakis , v.r . \n cadambe , `` repair optimal erasure codes through hadamard designs , '' _ the 49th annual allerton conference on communication , control and computation _ , pp.1382 -

{"ContextTokens": 1700, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "the mathematical model of quantum computation has appeared in the 1980-th with the works of david deutsch [ 1 ] and others [ 2 - 4 ] . in 1994 \n peter shor [ 5 ] proposed an effective quantum algorithm for solving the npi - candidate task  factorisation of big composite numbers . \n this breakthrough allowed to expect , that any task from np could have an effective solution on a quantum computer . \n this hope was weakened after the lov grover s work [ 6 ] in 1996 , which proposed the general quantum algorithm for solving any task from np . \n the algorithm was designed to search the particular point in the unsorted database of size n with only @xmath0 oracle queries . \n grover has shown that under the considered assumptions the algorithm is optimal , so only quadratic speedup can be achived by the quantum computer compared to the classical one , if we do nt have additional information about the oracle functioning . \n this paper describes the improvement of the quantum database search algorithm , exhibiting the exponential speedup over the classical search , by changing some preliminary assumptions about the model of computation . \n the reasoning goes as follows . in section 2 \n we recall the grover s database search algorithm . \n section 3 describes the new quantum computation model with von neumann architecture applied , and the new algorithm for the unsorted database search is proposed along with its complexity estimation . \n section 4 glues everything together thus serving as a conclusion . \n first , let us recall the algorithm proposed by lov grover . let s consider the function f :    @xmath1 @xmath2    which is some decision function over the set of n - bit strings . \n @xmath3  is the number of all possible n - bit strings , thus the number of all possible inputs to f. function f is implemented as a black box . \n our purpose is to find the n - bit string @xmath4 on which f returns 1 . \n grover defines the quantum oracle @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where x is n - bit string , and y is one bit . \n on the first n qubits @xmath5 acts as follows :    @xmath7    @xmath5 acts identically on any vector orthogonal to @xmath8 , while changes the sign of @xmath8 itself , thus it can be considered as the reflection of any vector over the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath8 \n .    then the vector @xmath9 and operator @xmath10 are introduced as follows :    @xmath11 @xmath12    where h is n - qubit hadamard transform . \n operator @xmath10 reflects any vector over the vector @xmath9 . \n the grover iteration is    @xmath13    the @xmath14 operator rotates the initial vector @xmath9 towards the desired vector @xmath8 by the angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16 . \n the action of the first two grover iterations is shown on the figures [ grov_1 ] and [ grov_2 ] . \n [ grov_1 ]     [ grov_2 ] \n the von neumann architecture was introduced by john von neumann [ 7 ] in 1945 . \n one of its most famous concepts is the idea of representing algorithms as a special type of data , which can be stored in computer memory along with the information they process . \n the computer hardware may then become universal and not depending on the solved tasks . \n this idea is considered to be very common and natural for the classical computing model . \n however , the quantum computing model still distinguish data ( quantum system state ) from a program ( sequence of unitary transforms in the system state space ) . \n some of these unitary tranforms have the natural mapping on the system states . \n for example , the state @xmath9 defines the transform @xmath17 in the previous section . \n if we assume , that the state of one quantum system can be used as a reflection tranform in another quantum system , then we can introduce a much simplier and effective algorithm for the unsorted database search .    following grover \n , we will denote :    @xmath18 @xmath6 @xmath19    we still consider the case of searching of the special input @xmath4 among all n - bit strings . \n the number of grover s iterations needed to get the result with high probability after measurement is estimated by @xmath20 . \n for example , if n equals to 8 ( each input is one byte ) , then the number of grover s iterations must be close to 12 . \n let s suppose that we already have performed a half of these 12 iterations in one system , while in another system we ve prepared the initial state @xmath9 ( figure [ new_alg_1 ] ) . \n [ new_alg_1 ]   with 6 grover s iterations.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    if the vector @xmath21 can be used as the operator @xmath22 in the left system with the initial state @xmath9 , then we need only one iteration to get close to @xmath4 instead of the remained 6 grover s iterations ( figure [ new_alg_2 ] ) . \n [ new_alg_2 ]   applied.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    again , the vector @xmath21 itself can be constructed from the vector @xmath23 with the same process , thus omitting 3 grover s iterations ( figure [ new_alg_3 ] ) . continuously applying this trick we can reduce the number of all grover s iterations to @xmath24 . \n each such reflection divides the number of nesessary grover s iterations by 2 . \n [ new_alg_3 ]   applied.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    this means that for solving the unsorted database search problem we need to :    1 . \n perform one grover s iteration to get vector @xmath25 . \n 2 .   prepare the state @xmath9 on another system . \n apply the vector from the first system as a reflection to the second system . \n 4 .   repeat @xmath26 times the steps 2 - 3 . \n the implementation of @xmath27 operator , which depends on some quantum state @xmath28 and acts on another quantum system is an open question in the scope of this work . \n the proposed quantum algorithm allows us to solve the unsorted database search problem exponentialy faster than that described by grover . \n however , the assumption of possibility of applying states as operators to other systems does nt correspond to the classical quantum computation model , developed to these days . \n note that with the new algorithm we need only one call to the @xmath5 oracle to get the direction . \n after that all the remained iterations do not call the oracle directly . to implement the new algorithm \n we need only two quantum systems , which will change their roles on each iteration . the `` algorithm '' system ( which is used as an operator ) on the next iteration must prepare the initial state @xmath9 and become a `` data '' system and vice versa . \n w.  shor , _ algorithms for quantum computation : discrete logarithms and factoring_.1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emproceedings of the 35th ieeesymposium on foundations of computer science . \n pp . 124  134 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1108615259862, "RequestID": "8d8f4c5ef41f44bb8d0e2c477aca3bae", "TotalTokens": 1833}

down power of @xmath1erg s@xmath2 and a surface magnetic field of @xmath3 g @xcite .    within the corotating magnetosphere , charged particles \n are accelerated to relativistic energies and emit non - thermal radiation from radio waves through gamma rays . in general , gamma - ray pulsars exhibit a break in the spectrum between a few hundred mev and a few gev . \n mapping the cut - off can help to constrain the geometry of the acceleration region , the gamma - ray radiation mechanisms and the attenuation of gamma - rays . \n although past measurements of the crab pulsar spectrum are consistent with a power law with exponential cut - off , flux measurements above 10gev are systematically above the best - fit model , suggesting that the spectrum is indeed harder than a power law with exponential cut - off @xcite . however , the statistical uncertainty of the previous data was insufficient to allow a definite conclusion about the spectral shape . \n in this paper we summarise the recent detection of the crab pulsar above 100gev with veritas . \n veritas , the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system , is an array of four 12 m diameter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located in southern arizona , usa @xcite . \n after evidence for pulsed emission was seen in 45 hours of data from the crab pulsar that were recorded between 2007 and 2010 , a deep 62-hour observation was carried out on the crab pulsar between september 2010 and march 2011 . \n the observations were made in `` wobble '' mode with an 0.5 degree offset . after eliminating data taken under variable or poor sky conditions or affected by technical problems , the total analysed data set comprises 107 hours of observations ( 97 hours dead - time corrected ) carried out with all four telescopes . \n the data were taken with the standard veritas trigger setting , and analysed with the standard veritas analysis tools . \n details about the analysis can be found in @xcite . \n the phase - folded event distribution , hereafter pulse profile , of the selected veritas events is shown in figure [ profile ] . \n the most significant structures are two pulses with peak amplitudes at phase 0.0 and phase 0.4 . these coincide with the locations of the main pulse and interpulse , hereafter p1 and p2 , which are the two main features in the pulse profile of the crab pulsar throughout the electromagnetic spectrum . in order to assess the significance of the pulsed emission , we use the h - test @xcite . \n the test result is 50 , which translates into a statistical significance of 6.0 standard deviations that pulsed emission is present in the data . \n the pulse profile has been characterised by an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit ; see the solid black line in figures [ zoomp1 ] and [ zoomp2 ] . in the fit \n , the pulses are modeled with gaussian functions , and the background is determined from the events that fall between phases 0.5 and 0.9 in the pulse profile ( referred to as the off - pulse region ) . \n the positions of p1 and p2 in the veritas data are thus determined to lie at the phase values @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and are shown by the vertical lines figure 1 . \n the full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the fitted pulses are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . \n the pulses are narrower than those measured by fermi - lat at 100 mev by a factor of two to three . \n the energy - dependent narrowing of the pulses is a strong probe of the nature of the magnetospheric particle acceleration region and can be used to shed some light on its geometry , electric field , and gamma - ray emission properties . \n the gamma - ray spectrum above 100gev was measured by combining the signal regions around p1 ( phase -0.013 to 0.009 ) and p2 ( phase 0.375 to 0.421 ) . \n this can be considered a good approximation of the phase - averaged spectrum . \n however , the existence of a flux component that originates in the magnetosphere and is uniformly distributed in phase can not be excluded and would be indistinguishable from the gamma - ray flux from the nebula . \n figure [ sed ] shows the veritas phase - averaged spectrum together with measurements made with fermi - lat and magic . in the energy range between 100gev and 400gev measured by veritas , \n the energy spectrum is well described by a power law @xmath8 , with @xmath9 tev@xmath2 @xmath10 s@xmath2 and @xmath11 . \n the detection of pulsed gamma - ray emission between 200gev and 400gev , the highest energy flux point , is only possible if the emission region is at least 10 stellar radii from the star s \n surface @xcite .    combining the veritas data with the fermi - lat data \n we can place a stringent constraint on the shape of the spectral turnover . \n the previously favoured spectral shape of the crab pulsar above 1gev was an exponential cut - off @xmath12 , which is a good parametrisation of the fermi - lat @xcite and magic @xcite data . \n we note that the fermi - lat and magic data can be equally well parametrised by a broken power law but those data are not sufficient to distinguish significantly between a broken power law and an exponential cut - off . \n the veritas data , on the other hand , clearly favour a broken power law as a parametrisation of the spectral shape . \n the fit of the veritas and fermi - lat data with a broken power law of the form @xmath13 $ ] results in a @xmath14 value of 13.5 for 15 degrees of freedom with the fit parameters @xmath15 tev@xmath2 @xmath10 s@xmath2 , @xmath16gev , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see solid black line in figure 2 ) . \n a corresponding fit with a power law and an exponential cut - off yields a @xmath14 value of 66.8 for 16 degrees of freedom . \n the fit probability of @xmath19 derived from the @xmath14 value excludes the exponential cut - off as a viable parametrisation of the crab pulsar spectrum . \n the conclusions do not change if systematic uncertainties in the energy scale of both experiments are taken into account . \n the detection of pulsed gamma - ray emission above 100 gev provides strong constraints on the gamma - ray radiation mechanisms and the location of the acceleration regions . for example \n , the shape of the spectrum above the break can not be attributed to curvature radiation because that would require an exponentially shaped cut - off . \n in addition , assuming a balance between acceleration gains and radiative losses by curvature radiation , the break in the gamma - ray spectrum is expected to be at @xmath20gev @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the acceleration efficiency ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the radius of curvature in units of the light - cylinder radius @xcite . though @xmath24 can be larger than one , only with an extremely large radius of curvature would it be possible to produce gamma - ray emission above 100gev with curvature radiation . \n it is , therefore , unlikely that curvature radiation is the dominant production mechanism of the observed gamma - ray emission above 100gev . \n two possible interpretations are that either the entire gamma - ray production is dominated by one emission mechanism different from curvature radiation or that a second mechanism becomes dominant above the spectral break energy .    this research is supported by grants from the u.s . \n department of energy office of science , the u.s . national science foundation and the smithsonian institution , by nserc in canada , by science foundation ireland ( sfi 10/rfp / ast2748 ) and by stfc in the u.k . \n we acknowledge the excellent work of the technical support staff at the fred lawrence whipple observatory and at the collaborating institutions in the construction and operation of the instrument . \n a.  n.  otte was in part supported by a feodor lynen fellowship from the alexander von humboldt foundation . \n 99 e.  aliu et al . \n ( veritas collaboration ) , _ science _ , 2011 , 734 vol . \n 69 -

response ) @xmath16 as : @xmath17 and the readback signal @xmath18 is simply the convolution of @xmath2 and @xmath16 plus some noise : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the overall noise in the recording system which consists of media , jitter and electronic noise , i.e. @xmath21 .    the media noise , @xmath22 originates from the imperfections of the media and its effect is significant in the magnetic transition regions . \n typically , media noise is approximately four times the electronic noise at transition regions . in our system model \n , we consider the media noise as additive - white - gaussian - noise ( awgn ) with mean of @xmath23 and variance of @xmath24 , which exists in the transition region only . as \n shown in fig . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] , the media saturation noise depends on the saturation level and it is evaluated as @xmath25 . unlike media noise which is media dependent , the jitter noise @xmath26 is due to timing imperfection only . to model the sampling jitter noise , @xmath26 , the @xmath27th order taylor approximation is used . the jitter estimation block shown in fig . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] is done with @xmath28th order taylor series expansion of @xmath7 . \n the jitter probability density function is assumed to be uniform , limited by a maximum value . \n the electronic noise , @xmath29 is awgn with mean of @xmath23 and variance of @xmath30 . \n the recording system in fig . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] caters for many different simulation cases with varying degree of electronics , media and sampling jitter noise . \n we define the channel snr as : @xmath31    the noisy readback signal is equalised to @xmath32 pr target which is only optimal for electronic noise at the considered @xmath10  @xcite . \n it serves for comparison purposes only . \n the maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) decoder of the pr channel exchanges extrinsic with the ecc decoder to deliver solution which is used for performance evaluation . \n it has been shown that the rvcm algorithm provides considerable coding gain for parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes  @xcite,@xcite and ldpc codes  @xcite . \n the algorithm can be applied directly to perpendicular recording and is described briefly below . \n let @xmath33 denote an @xmath34tuple vector at the output of the map decoder , that is the a - posteriori probability ( app ) of the map decoder . \n let @xmath35 denote the reliability sequence of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . \n assume that @xmath38 is an integer where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a vector of length @xmath38 . \n * step 1 . * : :    store the vector @xmath41 , let the integer    @xmath42 be initialised to @xmath23 . \n * step 2a . * : :    set @xmath43 and    @xmath44 . \n restart the iterative    decoder , store the decoded vector    ( @xmath45 ) . * \n * : :    set @xmath46 . \n restart the iterative    decoder , store the decoded vector    ( @xmath47 ) and restore    @xmath48 , i.e.    @xmath49 \n . * step 3 . * : :    if @xmath50 then set @xmath51 and    continue to * step 2*. otherwise , stop the algorithm and from the list    of all decoded vectors    @xmath52 ,    @xmath53 , choose a    decoded vector that has the minimum euclidean distance . \n it is assumed    that the iterative decoder always outputs a codeword .    from the steps above , \n it is clear that the complexity of the algorithm depends on @xmath38 . \n one of the major obstacles concerning the rvcm algorithm is the difficulty in finding the symbol(s ) that , if modified , can converge the iterative decoder to the maximum - likelihood solution  @xcite,@xcite . \n these symbols are referred as the critical symbols and their distribution is uniform with no sign of vulnerable or favourite symbol positions . \n on the other hand , due to their uniform distribution , it is likely that we can find one of the critical symbols if we confine our search to a small group , i.e. keeping the value of @xmath38 low . in this way \n , we can reduce the computational complexity for the price of sub - optimum performance . as we will show later that \n , the gain obtained by confining @xmath38 to a small value is still significant compared to the performance of the standard iterative decoder . \n there are various methods for selecting the critical symbols , see  @xcite for details . in this paper \n , we restrict the selection to one method only , that is the reliability of the app at the output of the map decoder . \n we evaluate the performance of the rvcm algorithm on some short - block length turbo and ldpc codes . fig . \n [ fig : turbo - sm0 ] and  [ fig : turbo - sm4 ] show the error rate performance of the turbo code under the standard iterative and rvcm decoders . \n the turbo code considered is the @xmath54 tail - biting turbo code , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58interleaver . \n significant improvement is noticed and the increase in performance gets better as snr increases . \n it is worth noting that the results in fig . \n [ fig : turbo - sm4 ] were obtained using snr mismatch technique . with this technique , \n the improvement in performance over standard iterative decoder is even greater as snr increases . in the presence of media noise , \n snr mismatch methods do not provide the same performance as observed with electronics noise only  @xcite , however better targets for media noise are being investigated by the authors . \n error performance of rvcm decoder on the turbo code in the presence of electronic noise only , width=220 ]    error performance of rvcm decoder on the turbo code in the presence of electronic and media noise , width=220 ]    error performance of rvcm decoder on the @xmath59 cyclic ldpc code in the presence of electronic and media noise , width=220 ]    performance of the @xmath60 cyclic and @xmath61 codes in the presence of electronic and media noise , width=220 ]    similar performance improvement is observed for the ldpc codes , see fig . \n [ fig : gf2 - 127 - 84 ] . \n the @xmath59 cyclic ldpc code , which has minimum - distance of @xmath62 , was constructed using a method described in  @xcite . as mentioned earlier , the rvcm algorithm allows one to trade off the performance against the computational complexity . from fig . \n [ fig : gf2 - 127 - 84 ] , despite the performance obtained by setting @xmath63 is approximately @xmath64db inferior to that by setting @xmath65 , the coding gain from the standard iterative decoding is significant . for the case of @xmath63 , we select the critical symbols based on the reliability measure at the output of the map decoder . from the vector @xmath41 , we construct a vector @xmath66 of length @xmath38 such that @xmath67 . in fig . \n [ fig : gf2 - 255 - 175 ] , we compare the performance of the @xmath60 cyclic code and that of the @xmath68 quasi - cyclic code . \n we can see that the rvcm algorithm provides significant gain , within one order of magnitude improvement , over the bp algorithm . at approximately @xmath69 ber , \n the performance of the cyclic code with rvcm is within @xmath70db away from the longer code under bp decoding . \n we have shown that the application of the rvcm algorithm to perpendicular magnetic recording shows promising results . \n simulation results show that improvement of within one order of magnitude is possible . \n short block length offers an attractive error - correction scheme in which rvcm algorithm can be fully exploited by setting @xmath65 . \n a bank consisting of @xmath71 parallel rvcm decoders can be built on chips and the decoding of short - block length data has low latency . \n the performance of longer block - length codes , up to a certain error - rate , can be outperformed by the application of rvcm algorithm to shorter codes . \n the exact point , at which the longer codes start to perform better , depends on the code structure . \n we also extended our investigations on using some non binary cyclic ldpc codes  @xcite and we observe similar improvement as in the binary cases . \n further investigations in identifying the critical symbols will allow the application of rvcm algorithm to long powerful codes . \n the authors would like to thank prof . \n barry k. middleton of university of manchester for the channel noise discussion . \n e.  papagiannis , m.  a. ambroze , and m.  tomlinson , `` analysis of non convergence blocks at low and moderate snr in scc turbo schemes , '' _ spsc 2003 8^th^ international worksop on signal processing for space communications , catania , italy _ , pp .  121128 , sep . \n e.  papagiannis , m.  a. ambroze , and m.  tomlinson , `` approaching the ml performance with iterative decoding , '' _ international zurich seminar on communications , zurich , switzerland _ , pp .  220223 , feb . \n c.  j. tjhai , e.  papagiannis , m.  tomlinson , m.  a. ambroze , and m.  z. ahmed , `` improved iterative decoder for ldpc codes with performance approximating to a maximum likelihood decoder .

based transit surveys @xcite , and corot@xcite and kepler@xcite have performed space - based transit surveys . moreover , the second epoch mission of kepler , namely k2@xcite , is now ongoing , and next generation space missions tess@xcite and plato@xcite have been approved to be launched around 2017 and 2024 , respectively . \n the biggest problem for transit surveys , especially for ground - based ones , is commingling of false positives with candidates of transiting planets . \n the cause of false positives of transiting planets are eclipsing binaries , as they mimic planetary transits by grazing or by being mixed in another bright star s brightness . \n thus it is important to conduct follow - up observations after transit surveys in order to validate candidates as true planets by eliminating false positives . \n high precision multi - color transit photometry is known to be useful for such follow - up observations to discriminate whether transit - like dimming is caused by a true planet or by an eclipsing binary @xcite . \n this is because a true planet is almost dark in all wavelength , while an intervening body of an eclipsing binary is bright itself and its brightness changes significantly with wavelength . \n thus false positives caused by eclipsing binaries can be spotted by observing significant wavelength dependence in transit depths . \n on the other hand , transit depths of a true planet also have wavelength dependence . \n most of the wavelength dependence comes from the stellar limb - darkening , but the apparent planetary radius also has weak wavelength dependence which reflects the nature of its planetary atmosphere . \n high precision multi - color transit photometry is known to be useful to measure the weak wavelength dependence in transit depths to study atmospheres of transiting planets . \n this kind of study is known as transmission spectroscopy , and numbers of multi - color transit observations for this purpose have been reported so far . \n multi - color simultaneous cameras are very fruitful for the studies described above for two reasons . \n first , multi - color simultaneous cameras provide not only higher efficiency but also more feasibility to accomplish aimed studies than single - color cameras , since observable transits from a specific ground site are very limited . \n second , simultaneity of multi - color transit photometry is important to avoid systematic differences of transit depths due to luminosity change in host stars possibly caused by existence of starspots , plages , stellar activity , and so on . \n for the reasons , multi - color simultaneous cameras such as grond , busca@xcite , ultracam@xcite , sirius@xcite , and mitsume@xcite have been actively used for transit observations . \n considering the fact that more interesting transiting planets will be discovered in the near future by advanced ground - based surveys , and also space - based surveys , like k2 , tess , and plato , developments of new multi - color simultaneous cameras are highly desired . \n we here report a development of such an astronomical instrument named muscat ( multi - color simultaneous camera for studying atmospheres of transiting planets ) , which is now installed on the 188 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) in japan . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows . \n we first describe designs of the optical system of muscat and its components ( sec . \n [ sect : design ] ) , and introduce the control system of muscat ( sec . \n [ sect : control ] ) . \n we then report characteristics and performances of muscat shown in engineering observations ( sec . \n [ sect : test ] ) . \n we discuss on some capabilities for future upgrade of muscat ( sec . \n [ sect : discussions ] ) , and finally summarize this paper ( sec . \n [ sect : summary ] ) . \n we have designed muscat considering the following conditions . as we plan to use muscat for validations of transiting planets discovered by transit surveys , at least 2 colors are necessary to discriminate eclipsing binaries from transiting planets . \n considering the cost and available research grants , we adopt a design for a 3-color simultaneous camera with the 3 colors in optical wavelength where ccds are sensitive . for transit observations , it is important to obtain good comparison stars in the field of view ( fov ) to achieve high precision transit photometry . for the reason , we have designed the muscat fov as wide as possible for the 188 cm telescope . \n we have also took care of the throughput ( tp ) of the instrument to achieve high photometric precision . to achieve higher sensitivity to the utmost extent , \n we have carefully selected and designed the muscat optical system including astronomical bandpass filters , dichroic mirrors , and ccds .", "StartTimeOffset": 1128358630510, "RequestID": "d1f3f6290396407d8b0287c970c101f3", "TotalTokens": 1666}

branch stars , white dwarfs and neutron stars , and in globular cluster age determinations from population  ii turnoff stars . \n furthermore , in order to solve the outstanding discrepancy of the atmospheric li abundance in old stars with that predicted in big - bang nucleosynthesis , @xcite have proposed li sinking deep into the star due to diffusion . \n this hypothesis has been recently confirmed in the observations by @xcite . \n the opcd_2.1 release includes data and codes to compute the radiative accelerations required for studies of diffusion processes . \n it should be noted that the radiative accelerations are summed over ionization stages and that data for the calculation of diffusion coefficients are calculated assuming that the distribution over ionization stages of the diffusing ions is the same as that in the ambient plasma . \n the validity of this approximation is discussed by @xcite .    in some cases , \n particularly when element stratification depends on stellar depth , calculations of mean opacities and radiative accelerations must be repeated at each depth point of the model and at each time step of the evolution , and thus the use of codes more efficient than those in opcd_2.1 may be necessary . \n this becomes critical in the new distributed computing grid environments where the network transfer of large volumes of data is a key issue . in the present work we have looked into these problems , and , as a solution , report on the implementation of a general purpose , interactive server for astrophysical opacities referred to as opserver . \n it has been installed at the ohio supercomputer center , columbus , ohio , usa , from where it can be accessed through a web page or a linkable subroutine library . \n it can also be downloaded locally to be run on a stand - alone basis but it will demand greater computational facilities . in section  2 \n we discuss the computational strategy of the codes in opcd_2.1 followed by a description of opserver in section  3 . in section  4 \n we include some tests as an indication of its performance with a final summary in section  5 . \n we highlight here some of the key features of the codes in opcd_2.1 . for a chemical mixture specified by abundance fractions @xmath0 \n , they essentially compute two types of data : rosseland mean opacities ( rmo ) and radiative accelerations ( ra ) .      for the frequency variable @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant , rmo \n are given by the harmonic mean of the opacity cross section @xmath3 of the mixture @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean atomic weight . \n the @xmath3 is a weighted sum of the monochromatic opacity cross sections for each of the chemical constituents @xmath6 and is conveniently tabulated on the @xmath7-mesh @xmath8 where @xmath9 ^ 2}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 . \n the rationale behind the @xmath7-mesh is that it enhances frequency resolution where @xmath11 is large @xcite . \n similarly , the ra for a selected @xmath12 element can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is its atomic weight and @xmath15 the speed of light . the function @xmath16 is given in terms of the effective temperature @xmath17 and fractional depth @xmath18 of the star by @xmath19 with @xmath20 the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 depends on the cross section for momentum transfer to the @xmath12 element @xmath22 - a_k(u)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a correction to remove the contributions of electron scattering and momentum transfer to the electrons . both @xmath24 and @xmath23 , which are hereafter referred to as the mono data set ( @xmath251  gb ) , \n are tabulated in equally spaced @xmath7 intervals to facilitate accurate interpolation schemes . \n the computational strategy adopted in the opcd_2.1 release is depicted in the flowcharts of figure  1 where it may be seen that calculations of rmo and ra are carried in two stages . in a time consuming stage  1 , rmo and ra are computed with the mixv and accv codes , respectively , on a representative tabulation of the complete temperature  electron - density @xmath26 plane . in mixv \n the chemical mixture is specified in the input file mixv.in as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the hydrogen and metal mass - fractions , @xmath30 the number of elements , and @xmath31 and @xmath0 are the metal nuclear charges and fractional abundances . in accv , \n the input data ( accv.in ) are @xmath32 where now @xmath12 runs over the @xmath30 elements of the mixture , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the nuclear charge and @xmath35 abundance multipliers of the test @xmath36 element . \n input data formats in either mixv.in or accv.in give the user flexible control over chemical mixture specifications .    as shown in figure  1 , the intermediate output files mixv.xx ( @xmath2585 kb ) containing @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass - density , and acc.xx ( @xmath25470 kb ) with @xmath39 are written to disk . \n they are then respectively read by the codes opfit and accfit in stage  2 for fast bicubic interpolations of rmo and ra on stellar depth profiles @xmath40 specified by the user in the opfit.in and accfit.in input files . \n the final output files are opfit.xx containing @xmath41 and accfit.xx with @xmath42    in this computational approach , performance is mainly limited by the summation in equation  ( [ sum ] ) which implies disk reading the mono data set ; for instance , in mixv it takes up to @xmath2590% of the total elapsed time . \n opcd_2.1 also includes other codes such as mx and ax which respectively compute rmo and ra for a star depth profile . \n the chemical mixture can be fully varied at each depth point using the specifications in equations ( [ mix1][mix2 ] ) , the rmo and ra being obtained in a one - step process using bicubic interpolations without splines . \n these methods are thus suitable for cases with multi - mixture depth profiles @xcite . further details of all the opcd codes are contained in the reference manual . \n in opserver the computational capabilities of the codes in opcd_2.1 are greatly enhanced by the following innovative adaptations .    1 . \n the codes are restructured within a client  server network architecture whereby the time consuming stage  1 is performed on a powerful processor while the fast stage  2 is moved to the client , e.g. a web server or a user workstation . in this arrangement performance \n could be affected by the client  server transfer of the mixv.xx and acc.xx intermediate files , but since they are never larger than 0.5 mb , it is not expected to be a deterrent with present - day bandwidths . in a local installation where both the client and server reside on the same machine \n , communication is managed through shared buffers in main memory ; \n i.e. the corresponding data in mixv.xx and acc.xx are not written to disk . \n the codes are transcribed as a subroutine library  to be referred to hereafter as the oplibrary  which can be linked by the user stellar modelling code for recurrent subroutine calls that avoid data writing on disk . \n that is , the input data in the mixv.in , accv.in , opfit.in and accfit.in files and the output tables in the opfit.xx and accfit.xx files ( see figure  1 ) are now handled as subroutine parameters while the intermediate mixv.xx and acc.xx files are passed via shared main - memory buffers . \n chemical mixtures are again specified with the formats of equations ( [ mix1][mix2 ] ) which allow full variation at each depth point in a single subroutine call . \n rmo / ra are computed with the complete mono data set always loaded in main memory thus avoiding lengthy and repeated disk readings . \n this is achieved by implementing opserver on a dedicated server where mono is permanently resident in ram , or in the case of a local installation , by disk - reading it once at the outset of a modelling calculation . \n when accessing the remote server , client data requests are addressed through the http protocol , i.e. in terms of a uniform resource locator ( url ) . \n this allows data fetching from the central facility through an interactive web page or a network access subroutine , the latter being particularly suitable for a stellar model code that is to be run in a distributed grid environment . \n the do - loop that computes the summation of equation  ( [ sum ] ) has been parallelized in openmp which provides a simple , scalable and portable scheme for shared - memory platforms . \n as shown in figure  2 , the current opserver enterprise is implemented as a client  server model at the ohio supercomputer center ( osc ) . \n the web server communicates with the supercomputer via a socket interface . \n earlier versions were developed on an sgi origin2000 server with the powerfortran parallelizing compiler . \n the current version runs on a linux system with fortran openmp directives . \n opserver offers three user modes with full functionality except when otherwise indicated in the following description . \n * mode  a * : :    in this mode opserver is set up locally on a stand - alone basis ( see    figure  2 ) . \n the facilities of the osc are not used . \n a new opcd release    ( opcd_3.3 ) is    downloaded , followed by ( i ) installation of both the oplibrary and the    mono data set and ( ii ) linking of the oplibrary to the user modelling    code . \n computations of rmo / ra are preceded by the reading of the    complete mono data set from disk and therefore requires at least 1  gb    of ram . \n * mode  b * : :    in this mode , the oplibrary is downloaded , installed and linked to the    user code , but stage  1 is performed remotely at the osc ( see    figure  2 ) . \n this option has been customized for stellar modelling in a    distributed grid environment that would otherwise imply ( i.e. mode  a )    the network transfer , installation and disk - reading of the mono data    set at runtime . \n it is also practical when local computer capabilities    ( ram and/or disk space ) are limited . \n the functions provided by the mx    and ax codes have not been implemented . \n * mode  c * : :    in this mode rmo / ra computations at the osc are requested through an    interactive web page which allows    both stage  1 and stage  2 to be carried out remotely or , alternatively ,    stage  2 locally by downloading the mixv.xx/acc.xx intermediate files    ( see figure . \n 1 ) with the browser for further processing with local    opfit / accfit executables . \n opserver benchmarks were initially carried out on an sgi origin2000 multiprocessor at the osc with an earlier release of opcd . \n for the standard s92 mixture @xcite , the mixv code took up to 140  s to compute the mixv.xx file , of which 126  s were dedicated to disk - reading and 14  s to the actual computing of the mean opacities . \n opserver took on average @xmath43  s to compute mixv.xx which was not written to disk unless requested . in figure \n 3 we show the acceleration obtained on the origin2000 through parallelization where the calculation of mean opacities is reduced to 2  s with 8 processors . \n further significant acceleration is prevented by data transfer overheads . \n on more recent workstations , the local performances of the codes in opcd_2.1 and opserver depend on processor speed and ram and cache sizes . \n for instance , on a powermac g5 ( powerpc 970fx processor at 2.0 ghz , 1 gb of ram and l2 cache of 512 kb ) the first time mixv is run it takes for a single s92 mixture 103.8  s to compute the rmo , but on subsequent runs the elapsed time is reduced to an average of @xmath44  s. similarly , opserver takes 103.3  s which is then reduced to @xmath45  s on subsequent runs . \n once the mono data set is loaded in ram by opserver ( mode a ) , calculations of rmo for a single s92 mixture only take @xmath46  s and @xmath47  s for ra for the test element ar . in mode \n b , where stage 1 is carried out remotely at the osc and the mixv.xx and accv.xx files are transferred at the relatively low rate of 1.88 kb / s , computations of rmo and ra take @xmath48  s and @xmath49  s , respectively . \n the noticeable longer time taken for the latter is due to the transfer time taken for the larger accv.xx file . \n rosseland mean opacities and radiative accelerations can be computed from op data in any one of the following ways . \n ( i ) download the original opcd_2.1 package as described by @xcite and perform all calculations locally . \n \\(ii ) mode a , download the upgraded opcd_3.3 package , install opserver and perform all calculations locally by linking the subroutines in the oplibrary \n . calculations with opserver are more efficient but require large local computer memory . \n \\(iii ) mode b , as mode a but with stage 1 performed remotely at the osc . \n mode b is convenient if fast calculations are required but local computer memory is limited or when stellar modelling is to be carried out in a grid environment . \n \\(iv ) mode c , perform all calculations remotely at the osc through an interactive web page whereby files are downloaded locally with the browser . \n we acknowledge the invaluable assistance of juan luis chaves and gilberto daz of cecalcula during the initial stages of opserver . \n we are also much indebted to the ohio supercomputer center , columbus , ohio , usa , for hosting opserver and for technical assistance ; to the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg , france , for hosting the opcd releases ; and to drs josslen aray , manuel bautista , juan murgich and fernando ruette of ivic for allowing us to test the opserver installation on different platforms . \n fd would like to thank s.  rouchy for technical support . \n akp and fd have been partly supported by a grant from the us national science foundation . \n asplund m. , grevesse n. , sauval a. j. , 2005 , in barnes t. g. , bash f. n. , eds , asp conference series vol . \n 336 , cosmic abundances as records of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis . astronomical society of the pacific , san francisco , p.25 badnell n. r. , bautista , m. a. , butler , k. , delahaye f. , mendoza c. , palmeri p. , zeippen c. j. , seaton , m. j. , 2005 , mnras , 360 , 458", "StartTimeOffset": 1142799049852, "RequestID": "d76b91eede52431d890f4816ea06ef3b", "TotalTokens": 4168}
{"ContextTokens": 2943, "GeneratedTokens": 247, "SynthesizedBody": "discovered by the bepposax gamma - ray burst monitor [ 3 ] , grb 970508 is the second gamma - ray burst ( grb ) for which an optical afterglow has been detected ( e.g. , [ 4 ] ) . \n transient x - ray , near - infrared , millimeter , and radio emission have also been detected . \n grb 970508 is the first grb for which a distance scale has been determined : metzger et al . \n [ 1,2 ] report the existence of absorption and emission features in spectra of the optical afterglow taken with the keck ii 10-m telescope @xmath7 2 days and @xmath7 26 days after the grb event . \n their identification of these features places grb 970508 at a redshift of @xmath0 . \n the lack of a lyman-@xmath1 forest in these spectra further constrains this redshift to be less than @xmath8 2.1 . \n consequently , grb 970508 is almost certainly cosmological in origin . \n a host galaxy for grb 970508 has not yet been observed . \n however , metzger et al . [ 1 ] report that the line emission observed in the keck ii spectra is consistent with constancy between their may 11 and june 5 observations . over this same period \n , the continuum emission has faded . \n this suggests that a host galaxy of relatively weak continuum emission may be present at the observed redshift of @xmath4 [ 2 ] . \n grb afterglows are believed to be described by the relativistic blast - wave model [ 5 - 13 ] . \n furthermore , the afterglow of grb 970228 , the only other grb for which sufficient afterglow information is available , has been shown to be compatible with this model [ 14,11,15 - 17,13 ] . \n a basic prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model is that after an initial period of increasing optical flux , lasting hours to days , the optical flux of the afterglow will decrease as a power - law of index @xmath9 . during this period of declining optical flux , \n the optical spectrum will be described by a power - law of index @xmath10 ( e.g. , [ 15 ] ) . however , in the case of grb 970508 , @xmath11 [ 18 ] , which is inconsistent with the relativistic blast - wave model .    in  2 , \n i show that the reported grb 970508 optical afterglow measurements , once corrected for galactic absorption , are inconsistent with this prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model unless a second , redshifted source of extinction is introduced . \n this second source of extinction may be the yet unobserved host galaxy . \n i determine its redshift and i estimate its hydrogen column density along the line of sight . \n an observing strategy for future optical afterglow observations is recommended in  3 . \n as of 1997 november 3 , @xmath12 70 optical and near - infrared measurements of the grb 970508 afterglow have been reported . \n these measurements span @xmath12 80 days , the earliest of which was taken @xmath7 4 hours after the grb event . \n although the photometry is generally quite good , with quoted errors that are often less than 0.1 mag , zero - point errors are evident between different observing groups in various bands . \n consequently , i consider only the largest self - consistent subset of these data : sokolov et al . \n [ 18 ] report 22 optical measurements ( b , v , r@xmath13 , and i@xmath13 bands ) taken with a 6-m telescope between @xmath7 2 days and @xmath7 31 days after the grb event . \n all of these measurements were taken after the optical flux had peaked (  1 ) , also @xmath7 2 days after the grb event . \n i have corrected these measurements for galactic absorption using the iras 100 @xmath14 m v - band absorption measure of rowan - robinson et al . [ \n 19 ] and the interstellar absorption curve [ 20,21 ] . \n the v - band correction is @xmath15 mag . \n i use the absorption measure of rowan - robinson et al . , which measures the dust directly , instead of measures of the hydrogen column density , i.e. [ 22 - 24 ] , since the iras 100 @xmath14 m flux about the location of grb 970508 varies significantly on angular scales that are smaller than the scales over which these measures of the hydrogen column density are averaged . \n the corrected measurements are plotted in figure 1 . \n psfig    the following model is now @xmath16-fitted to these corrected measurements : @xmath17 the first term is the extinction - free prediction of the relativistic blast - wave model (  1 ) . \n the second term is the correction that a second , redshifted source of extinction introduces . \n it is given by redshifting the interstellar absorption curve and by specifying the magnitude of the extinction , which i parameterize as the v - band absorption magnitude _ at the redshift of the source _ \n . a constant error of @xmath7 0.07 mag must be added in quadrature to the quoted errors of sokolov et al . [ 18 ] for the model to fit the data ( @xmath19 ) . \n this suggests that either the quoted errors are underestimated by a factor @xmath20 , or that the flux is varying by @xmath7 6% on timescales of days . \n reichart [ 16 ] noticed possibly related temporal behavior in the light - curve of grb 970228 .    the best fit is : @xmath21 cgs , @xmath22 , @xmath23 mag , and @xmath24 . \n the quoted uncertainties are 1 @xmath6 confidence intervals for one interesting parameter . \n the best - fit redshift is consistent with the observed redshift of @xmath4 . \n furthermore , redshifts greater than @xmath5 are ruled out at the 3 @xmath6 confidence level . \n the best - fit v - band absorption magnitude corresponds to a hydrogen column density of @xmath7 4.5 x 10@xmath25 @xmath26 . \n the possibility that there is no second source of absorption , i.e. , @xmath27 , is ruled out at the 3.8 @xmath6 confidence level . \n using equation ( 1 ) and the best - fit temporal decline power - law index , i have scaled each of the measurements that were fitted to in  2 to its corresponding value for may 11 , just shortly after the optical peak . \n these points define the post - peak , time - independent optical spectrum and are plotted in figure 2 . \n the best - fit spectrum , as well as the extinction - free , relativistic blast - wave component of this spectrum ( the first term of equation ( 1 ) ) , are also plotted in figure 2 . \n a broad absorption feature is apparent in the best - fit spectrum . \n this is the ultraviolet absorption feature of the interstellar absorption curve , redshifted into the b band . \n had the redshift of grb 970508 been less than @xmath4 , u - band measurements would also have been necessary for this , the only strong feature of the interstellar absorption curve , to have been detected . \n consequently , in this type of analysis , different bands most sensitively probe different redshift ranges , depending on whether or not this absorption feature has been redshifted into the band in question . since grbs are generally believed to have redshifts of @xmath28 , self - consistent sets of u- , b- , and v - band measurements should be a goal of future optical afterglow observations .    in this letter , \n i present a method by which redshifts can be determined for grbs that are associated with host galaxies , even if absorption or emission lines are not observable or if spectra of sufficient quality are unattainable . \n this method also yields hydrogen column densities along the line of site , which provides valuable information about the distribution of grbs within galaxies . for grb 970508 \n , i find that the redshift of its host galaxy , or possibly that of an intermediate galaxy , is @xmath3 , which is consistent with the observed redshift of metzger et al . \n : @xmath4 . \n redshifts greater than @xmath5 are ruled out at the 3 @xmath6 confidence level . \n metzger , m. r. , et al . \n , _ iau circ . \n _ , 6676 ( 1997 ) . \n m. r. , et al . \n , _ nature _ , * 387 * , 879 ( 1997 ) . \n costa , e. , et al . \n , _ iau circ . \n _ , 6649 ( 1997 ) . \n bond , h. e. , _ iau circ . \n _ , 6654 ( 1997 ) . \n paczyski , b. , & rhoads , j. , _ apj _ , * 418 * , l5 ( 1993 ) . \n katz , j. , _ apj _ , * 422 * , 248 ( 1994 ) \n . katz , j. , _ apj _ , * 432 * , l107 ( 1994 ) . \n mszros , p. & rees , m. j. , _ apj _ , * 476 * , 232 ( 1997 ) . \n sari , r. , & piran , t. , _ apj _ , * 485 * , 270 ( 1997 ) . \n vietri , m. , _ apj _ , * 478 * , l9 ( 1997 ) . \n waxman , e. , _ apj _ , * 485 * , l5 ( 1997 ) . \n sari , r. , _ apj _ , * 489 * , l37 ( 1997 ) . \n katz , j. , & piran , t. _ apj _ , in press ( 1997 ) . \n katz , j. , piran , t. , & sari , r. , preprint ( 1997 ) . \n wijers , r. a. m. j. , rees , m . \n j. , & mszros , p. , _ mnras _ , * 288 * , l51 ( 1997 ) . \n reichart , d. e. , _ apj _ , * 485 * , l57 ( 1997 ) . \n sahu , k. , et al . \n , _ nature _ , * 387 * , 476 ( 1997 ) . \n sokolov , v. v. , et al . \n , preprint ( 1997 ) . \n rowan - robinson , m. , et al . \n , _ mnras _ , * 249 * , 729 ( 1991 ) . \n johnson , h. l. , _ apj _ , * 141 * , 923 ( 1965 ) . \n bless , r. c. , & savage , b. d. , _ apj _ , * 171 * , 293 ( 1972 ) . \n hartmann , d. , & burton , w. b. , _ atlas of galactic neutral hydrogen _ \n , cambridge : cambridge university press , 1978 . \n stark , a. a. , et al . \n , _ apj supp . \n _ , * 79 * , 77 ( 1992 ) . \n burstein , d. , & heiles , c. , _ aj _ , * 87 * , 1165 ( 1982 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1150907961460, "RequestID": "b2e508c1361e4bcfb55d579ac4e4bd62", "TotalTokens": 3190}
{"ContextTokens": 3570, "GeneratedTokens": 332, "SynthesizedBody": "collisions in orbit pose a threat to spacecraft , to astronauts and to the global commons of near - earth space . \n several collisions have already occurred between spacecraft and debris , while the iridium 33/cosmos 2251 collision of january 2009 represented the first documented satellite - satellite collision . \n unfortunately , the cumulative number of collisions thus far is consistent with the prescient predictions of a runaway chain reaction @xcite .    reducing debris from current and future space missions ( debris mitigation ) \n is an important measure . \n however , even the unrealistic case of  no new launches \" is inadequate to curb runaway growth @xcite . \n there are two remaining ways to alleviate the problem : debris removal and collision avoidance . for the latter \n , one needs prediction precision to be sufficiently accurate so as not to imply an unwieldy number of collision avoidance maneuvers . \n in addition , one needs a means of doing debris - debris collision avoidance since applying collision avoidance only to the subset of conjunctions involving maneuverable spacecraft does not suffice to curb the growth . \n this paper describes a method to increase the orbit prediction accuracy based on publicly available tles . \n many satellite owner operations have inadequate ( if any ) processes for conjunction assessment and collision avoidance , since they would have to screen their asset(s ) against all other space objects . \n the only source of knowledge at their disposal for the majority of other objects is the publicly available two - line element ( tle ) sets . but \n predictions based on tles using the associated analytic propagator ( sgp4 ) are not sufficiently accurate to warrant maneuvering to avoid potential collisions : they imply an unacceptably large number of potential collisions per space object , each of which has very low probability . \n the problem is similar for debris - debris conjunctions except then both objects , not just one , are subject to these imprecisions .    to address this tle / sgp4 accuracy problem \n , we investigated several methods to improve the propagation errors for non - maneuvering orbital objects whilst using only tles as input data . \n the following research target was set : `` increase the predictive accuracy for orbital objects , using only historical tle data , such that it enables operational conjunction assessment for collision avoidance '' .    in the following sections , we describe one approach to this target , assess its accuracy , and discuss the requirements for extension to the entire space object catalog . \n finally , we propose a new method of debris - debris collision avoidance enabled by long - term high - accuracy conjunction assessment . \n esa uses tles from the publicly available catalog to initially screen their sun - synchronous orbit ( sso ) spacecraft ers2 and envisat for conjunctions @xcite . \n telemetry from their operational spacecraft provide precision orbital ephemeredes ( poes ) for those spacecraft . for screening against all other potentially conjuncting objects , \n only tles are used . \n @xcite describe a method to estimate error covariances of tles in order to quantify collision probability assessments . \n their method provided inspiration for the present work . here \n we extend and adapt their approach : based solely on the object s historical tles , we improve the accuracy of the object s predicted position , as opposed to quantifying the accuracy of the object s sgp4 propagation errors . \n our method is essentially to use tle data as `` pseudo - observations '' and to fit an orbit to these pseudo - observations using a high - precision special perturbations propagator and traditional batch least - squares differential correction . \n the fitted orbit is then propagated into the future using the same high - precision orbit propagator . \n the prediction accuracy is assessed by comparison with precision orbital ephemeris ( poe ) data from the international laser ranging service @xcite .    for each object \n we wish to analyze we choose a time window with two sections : a fitting period and a subsequent prediction period . \n the fitting period is initially set to ten days , typical of the period over which u.s . \n space surveillance network observations are fitted when generating tles for leo objects @xcite . \n section @xmath0 details a more principled approach to determining the fitting period . \n the prediction period is 30 days .    for a given object , \n all tles with epochs within its entire window are obtained . \n however , only tles with epochs within the fitting period are used for the fitting process ; those in the prediction period are only used for validation and test .    using all tles from the fitting period and interpolating using sgp4 \n , we generate a series of order @xmath1 state vectors ( `` pseudo - observations '' ) equally spaced in time within the fitting period . \n we initialize the differential correction with a state vector derived from the first tle in the fitting period , and then propagate that using a high precision propagator . \n we apply batch least - squares differential correction to minimize the rms error in the radial , in track and cross track ( ric ) components of relative positions between the fitted orbit and the pseudo - observations . \n the trajectory obtained from the converged differential corrector is our fit . \n the high precision propagator incorporates a @xmath2 egm2008 gravity field including solid earth tides , point masses for the solar and lunar gravity fields and a nrl - msise @xmath3 atmospheric drag model . \n we assume constant values for solar f@xmath4 and ap equal to their averages over the fitting period . \n solar radiation pressure is modelled using a simple the biconic approximation with earth and moon as eclipsing bodies . \n [ figure1 ]     days . \n the fitting period is @xmath5 days for stella and @xmath6 days for etalon-@xmath7 . \n all fitting uses only publicly available tles . \n truth data are only used for plotting . \n selection of the length of the fitting period is discussed in section 4 . \n also shown are the updated tles ( no prediction ) in blue . \n , width=529 ]    we applied our method to four non - manoeuvring spacecraft for which poe data were readily available @xcite : stella , starlette , ajisai and etalon-@xmath7 . \n the summary of basic orbital and physical properties for these spacecraft are shown in table @xmath8 . \n they were picked in part for their range of orbital altitudes . \n .key parameters of geodesic spacecraft used [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ] \n [ figure4 ]     runs corresponding to @xmath9 random starting dates in @xmath10 . \n , width=377 ]    the majority of tracked space objects ( i.e debris ) do not have precision orbital ephemerides  they are not tracked by the ilrs and they transmit nothing . many are , however , tracked by the united states space surveillance network ( ssn ) . \n unfortunately , the only publicly available source of data derived from these ssn observations are , at present , the tles accessible at space-track.org ( and archived e.g. at celestrak.com ) . \n while there is currently no publicly available source of high - accuracy trajectory for debris objects , we believe the method described above could be applied to refine the predictions of debris objects future positions based only upon comparatively inaccurate tles , facilitating conjunction assessment and collision avoidance . \n however , there are several issues which complicate the application of our procedure to debris :    the first set of issues arise when tles are the _ only _ source of data - we have no `` truth '' in order to perform validation and test . \n this is solved by the use of tles from beyond the fitting period as a proxy for truth data . \n our initial manual experiments suggested that different fitting periods were optimal for different orbit categories . \n these results are consistent with @xcite . \n we made a more principled investigation , utilizing cross - validation , to optimize the length of the fitting interval on a per - object basis using only tles for both fitting and validation . \n figure 4 shows how a fitting period of @xmath11 days was determined to be optimal for satellite ajisai . \n the important point shown in the figure is that a @xmath11 day fitting period is optimal both when validating predictions with truth data _ and _ when validating predictions with future tles . and \n the @xmath11 day fitting period is optimal whether predicting @xmath12 , @xmath11 or @xmath13 days into the future . \n thus it appears `` future '' tles can be used as a proxy for truth data when optimizing the length of the fitting period on a per object basis . \n the second set of issues is that for debris objects one must also solve for area to mass ratio ( drag ) and validate this as well using only future tles . \n we are currently performing these experiments . \n further accuracy improvements could come from a principled analysis of the number of fitting points and their weighting as a function of location within the fitting period , the removal of outlier data ( i.e. filtering ) and other techniques from statistical orbit determination , treating tles as observations . also , recent work @xcite suggests that there may be simple global transformations of tle data that can improve tle / sgp@xmath0 accuracy . \n these systematic corrections might also be further refined on the basis of orbital parameters , resulting in a look - up - table used to correct tles as a function of their orbital regimes . \n in addition , the scheme could be tested on actual known conjunctions in order to analyse its efficiency for conjunction assessment . \n these issues will be the subject of a future paper . \n as an initial assessment of the computational requirements needed to perform conjunction analysis for all space objects in the publicly available catalog , a simple conjunction analysis system was parallelized on the pleiades supercomputer at nasa ames research center . using approximately @xmath14 cpu cores , checking all objects against all objects for conjunctions @xmath15 days into the future takes about a minute . \n the conjunctions involving spacecraft precisely match the results from socrates @xcite . \n the same system takes about @xmath16 minutes to perform 7 days of all - on - all conjunction assessment of a `` simulated s - band fence '' catalog ( obtained from the nasa orbital debris office ) containing `` pseudo - tles '' for approximately @xmath17 million objects of size @xmath18 cm . \n this demonstrates the feasibility of doing all - on - all conjunction assessment on the present and expected near - future catalogs . \n scaling the fitting method discussed above to the future catalog will be the subject of a later paper . \n an along track @xmath19 of @xmath8 cm / s provides of order 1 km displacement per day . \n since error growth for our method is @xmath20 m per day , such small manoeuvres might suffice for collision avoidance . for manoeuvres this small one could use radiation pressure to impart the necessary momentum . to verify the conjecture \n , we increased the flux of radiation by a factor of 10x the solar radiation constant for 10 minutes on a typical debris object ( area to mass ratio @xmath21 m@xmath22/kg ) in sso . \n we then propagated that for a further 5 days . \n the displacement was @xmath23 km / day along track compared to a reference object that was not so irradiated . \n two cumulative such events , if one ensured appropriate geometry , would thus lead to the necessary along - track displacement . \n a factor of 10x the solar rational constant could conceivably be applied from the ground . \n for example , a 10kw class laser attached to a 1 m class telescope with appropriate tracking , could , ( considering diffraction limits only ) provide the necessary radiation pressure for a debris object of area @xmath241m@xmath22 in sso . \n one would need to perform a detailed engineering analysis of the feasibility of such a device , particularly the viability of maintaining small beam divergence and tracking . \n debris - debris collision avoidance could eliminate the need for an active debris removal program . \n the results of @xcite imply , to first order , that performing debris - debris collision avoidance for 5 additional carefully selected objects per annum would curb debris field growth . \n furthermore , any additional debris - debris collision avoidance would start reducing the net debris density , eventually to below a critical level , because debris creating collisions are being nulled whereas atmospheric drag continues to cause objects re - entry . \n thus this method could provide not just a stop gap measure , but a permanent solution . \n this fitting and propagation method , based solely on tles , could potentially provide initial conjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable collision avoidance system . \n if similar improvements are possible for debris objects , as we expect , then it could be used for all - on - all conjunction assessment . however , to ensure that the scheme works in an operational setting , it would be necessary to have additional data : the so - called `` uncorrelated objects '' ( a.k.a . \n analysts set ) which account for approximately 30 percent of potential conjunctions in leo @xcite . \n further , we show that all - on - all conjunction assessment is possible with moderate computer infrastructure , even with the large increase in size of the catalog of tracked objects that is expected in the next few years .    finally , given accurate predictions \n , we claim _ debris - debris collision avoidance may be possible _ by externally inducing small manoeuvres using radiation pressure from @xmath11 kw class power density ground - based lasers . if feasible , this could negate the need for a large scale debris removal program . \n k.  alfriend , s.  paik , v.  boikov , z.  khutorovsky , & a.  testov . \n comparison of the russian & us algorithms for catalog maintenance for geosynchronous satellites . \n adv . astronaut . \n , 112(2):11571176 , 2002 . \n j.  boers , s.  coffey , w.  barnds , d.  johns , m.  davis , & j.  seago . accuracy assessment of the naval space command special perturbations cataloging system . \n spaceflight mechanics 2000 , volume 105 of adv . astronaut . \n , pages 12911304 , 2000 . \n s.  coffey , h.  neal , c.  visel , & p.  conolty . \n demonstration of a special -

{"ContextTokens": 1257, "GeneratedTokens": 213, "SynthesizedBody": "in order to develop a practical natural language processing ( nlp ) system , it is essential to deal with ill - formed sentences that can not be parsed correctly according to the grammar rules in the system . in this paper , \n an `` ill - formed sentence '' means one that can not be parsed as a unified structure . \n a syntactic parser with general grammar rules is often unable to analyze not only sentences with grammatical errors and ellipses , but also long sentences , owing to their complexity . \n thus , ill - formed sentences include not only ungrammatical sentences , but also some grammatical sentences that can not be parsed as unified structures owing to the presence of unknown words or to a lack of completeness in the syntactic parser . in texts from a restricted domain , such as computer manuals , \n most sentences are grammatically correct \n . however , even a well - established syntactic parser usually fails to generate a unified parsed structure for about 10 to 20 percent of all the sentences in such texts , and the failure to generate a unified parsed structure in syntactic analysis leads to a failure in the output of a nlp system . \n thus , it is indispensable to establish a correct analysis for such a sentence .    to handle such sentences , \n most previous approaches apply various heuristic rules @xcite , including    * relaxing constraints in the condition part of a grammatical rule , such as number and gender constraints * joining partial parses by using meta rules .    either way , the output reflects the general plausibility of an analysis that can be obtained from information in the sentence ; however , the interpretation of a sentence depends on its discourse , and inconsistency with recovered parses that contain different analyses of the same phrase in other sentences in the discourse often results in odd outputs of the natural language processing system . \n starting from the viewpoint that an interpretation of a sentence must be consistent in its discourse , we worked on completing incomplete parses by using information extracted from complete parses in the discourse . \n the results were encouraging . \n since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in other sentences in the discourse , the complete parses of well - formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in the same discourse . \n thus , rather than trying to enhance a syntactic parser s grammar rules in order to support ill - formed sentences , which seems to be an endless task after the parser has obtained enough coverage to parse general grammatical sentences , we treat the syntactic parser as a black box and complete incomplete parses , in the form of partially parsed chunks that a bottom - up parser outputs for ill - formed sentences , by using information extracted from the discourse .    in the next section , the effectiveness of using information extracted from the discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill - formed sentences . after that \n , we propose an algorithm for completing incomplete parses by using discourse information , and give the results of an experiment on completing incomplete parses in technical documents . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n we have proposed a method for completing partial parses of ill - formed sentences on the basis of information extracted from complete parses of well - formed sentences in the discourse . \n our approach to handling ill - formed sentences is fundamentally different from previous ones in that it reanalyzes the part of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships of each word in an ill - formed sentence by using information extracted from analyses of other sentences in the same text , thus , attempting to generate the analysis most appropriate to the discourse . \n the results of our experiments show the effectiveness of this method ; moreover , implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved the accuracy of its translation . since this method has a simple framework that does not require any extra knowledge resources or inference mechanisms , it is robust and suitable for a practical natural language processing system . furthermore , in terms of the turn - around time ( tat ) of the whole translation procedure , the improvement in the parses achieved by using this method along with other disambiguation methods involving discourse information , as shown in another paper @xcite , shortened the tat in the late stages of the translation procedure , and compensated for the extra tat required as a result of using the discourse information , provided the size of the discourse was kept to between 100 and 300 sentences .    in this paper , \n the term `` discourse '' is used as a set of words in a text together with the usage of each of those words in that text  namely , a part of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships with other words . the basic idea of our method is to improve the accuracy of sentence analysis simply by maintaining consistency in the usage of morphologically identical words within the same text . \n thus , the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the source text , since it presupposes that morphologically identical words are likely to be repeated in the same text . \n however , the results have been encouraging at least with technical documents such as computer manuals , where words with the same lemma are frequently repeated in a small area of text . \n moreover , our method improves the translation accuracy , especially for frequently repeated phrases , which are usually considered to be important , and leads to an improvement in the overall accuracy of the natural language processing system . \n i would like to thank michael mcdonald for invaluable help in proofreading this paper . \n i would also like to thank taijiro tsutsumi , masayuki morohashi , koichi takeda , hiroshi maruyama , hiroshi nomiyama , hideo watanabe , shiho ogino , naohiko uramoto , and the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions .", "StartTimeOffset": 1167460833744, "RequestID": "134ba8e9a808465c8051e360ce8ceb41", "TotalTokens": 1470}
{"ContextTokens": 3802, "GeneratedTokens": 387, "SynthesizedBody": "there is a common recognition today that electrochemical activity of a wide class of non - magnetic colloids of technical and biomedical interest is primarily determined by the electrostatics of internal nano - structures of an extremely involved molecular composition . \n this complexity calls for the development of admittedly idealized models of such nano - complexes providing a comprehensive insight into in - medium electrostatics of both conducting and dielectric nanosolutions . \n a well - known example is the macroscopic treatment of spherical nano - structures in globular polyelectrolytic biosolutions borrowing the idea of quasi - particles from the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory of weak electrolytes . \n as is known , the standard dh - theory ( and set of its modifications , e.g. [ 1,2 ] ) deals with completely ionized ( highly conducting ) solutions in which the ions are regarded as non - polarized free spherical charges . \n the basic explanatory device of dh - theory is the in - medium quasiparticle composed of a massive macro - ion surrounded by an atmosphere of light counterions . \n the central to this theory is the approximation of particle density in ionic atmosphere by boltzmann function with the energy factor depending on the potential of mean electrostatic field . \n the most striking outcome the dh - approach to electrostatics of electrolytes , relying on the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation for the potential of exterior coulomb ( electrostatic ) field of above quasiparticles , is that the solution of this latter equation provides proper account for the in - medium effect of electric field shielding [ 2 ] .    on the other hand , \n the situation is not so clear for nanosolutions possessing properties of dielectric ( non - conducting ) liquids the sources of internal electric field in which are bound charges rather than free ones as is the case of electrolytes . \n the electrodynamics of continuous dielectric media teaches us that the local density of bound charges @xmath3 owe its origin to gradients of dielectric permittivity @xmath4 in the direction of local electric field @xmath5 , but the interrelation between this field and micro - composition of dielectric media remains less studied . in this paper \n we investigate this issue in the model of dielectric nanosolution whose micro - composition is dominated by spherically symmetric nano - complexes composed of massive counterions coagulated by cloud of polarized dipoles of solvent molecules . in what follows \n such nano - structures are dubbed by _ \n dipolarions_. in so doing we focus on computing exterior fields for two kinds of such nano- complexes , namely ( i ) permanent dipolarion composed of macro - ion coated by atmosphere of polarized dipoles of polar molecules with constant ( field - independent ) intrinsic dipole moments , and ( ii ) field - induced dipolarion the atmosphere of which consists of molecules whose dipole moments are induced by field of macro - ion . before embarking on mathematical details of in - medium electrostatics of such nanosolution , it seems worth emphasizing that dipolarion is the electrically charged nano - complex , as is illustrated in fig . \n 1 showing internal constitution of permanent dipolarions with a positive and a negative charges of central macro - ions . \n the effect of polarization of solvent molecules along the lines of central symmetric field of micro - ion consists in an effective shift of charge from center to the surface of the dipolarion with no change of the original sign of charge of micro - ion . \n thus , the physical nature of electric field shielding in dielectric nanosolutions with the above dipolarion micro - constitution is substantially different from that for dh - quasiparticles of electrolytes . \n this observation motivates the main purpose of this work which is to compute to exterior electric fields of dipolarions in dielectric nanosolution carrying information about the in - medium effect of electric field shielding . in the below presented calculations this effect \n is highlighted by difference between obtained analytic expressions for exterior fields of dipolarions and canonical formula for coulomb field of charged sphere immersed in a dielctric liquid composed of electrically passive , unpolarizable , molecules . \n the electrostatic state of an isotropic dielectric continuous medium is described by equations ( e.g. , [ 3 ] ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field of electric displacement , @xmath8 is the density of electric polarization - electric dipole moment per unit volume and @xmath9 stands for the electric permittivity of free space . \n the rightmost of ( [ e2.1 ] ) is the maxwell equation for the electrostatic field @xmath5 ( differential form of coulomb law ) and @xmath10 is the total density of electric charge which is a sum of the free charge density , @xmath11 , and bound charge density , @xmath3 . by definition \n these are @xmath12 as was mentioned , the main difference between dielectric liquids and electrolytes is that the former can be usually thought of as a non - conducting suspension composed of bound charges dissolved in a fluid matrix of electrically polarized molecules , whereas electrolyte is an electrically conducting solution ( of second type ) whose conductivity is attributed to the mobility of ions which are regarded as free ( non - bounded ) charges . taking this into account and putting @xmath13 , one has @xmath14 here @xmath5 stands for the internal electric mean field whose source is the bound - charge density charges which is formed from charges of both counterions and poles of molecular dipoles . in this work , \n as was stated , we focus on a dielectric nanosolution whose internal electrification is determined by dipolarions - nano - structures composed of monopole charge of counterions surrounded by a cloud of radially polarized molecular dipoles forming dipolar atmospheres , having some features in common with ionic atmosphere of dh - qiasiparticle . bearing this mind \n we represent the macroscopic bound - charge density of dielectric nanosolution in the form @xmath15 where index @xmath16 labels counterions carrying the charge @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the effective particle density of bound charges associated with the ion of @xmath16-th type which takes into account polarization of molecular dipoles by field of given ion . \n the contribution of bound - charges of dipole - polarized molecules to the macroscopic bound - charge density of nanosolution can be incorporated in the above parametrization of @xmath3 by using of boltzmann function for @xmath18 with the energy factor describing polarization effect of ionic fields on dipole moment of molecules of solvent . \n namely , @xmath19 where @xmath4 is electric permittivity of solvent , @xmath20 is the number of dipole - polarized molecules of @xmath21-type having a dipole moment @xmath22 , which form the dipolar atmosphere surrounding the ion . in the last equation , by @xmath23 \n is understood the effective particle density of ions in the the absence of dipolar polarization of solvent molecules , as it would be the case of dielectric liquid composed of ions dissolved in fluid matrix of electrically passive , unpolarizable , molecules ( i.e. , molecules which are non - polar and insensitive to fields of ions ) . equation ( [ e2.4 ] ) means , in fact , that dipolar atmospheres of counterions are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath24 which is high enough to approximate the average particle density of bound charges of dielectric solution in above fashion . with account of this \n we arrive at a highly non - linear equation of in - medium electrostatics @xmath25 describing electric field in dielectric nanosolution with account its dipolarion micro - composition . in this equation by @xmath26 \n is understood the bound - charged density which would be in case of ions suspended in the solvent of unpolarizable molecules . \n adhering to the spirit of debye - hckel theory , we make the following approximation @xmath27 as a result , the equation of in - medium electrostatics of dipolarionic nanosolution takes the form @xmath28 this equation constitutes mathematical basis for below presented analysis of the electric field shielding in the dielectric nanosolution with the dipolarion micro - constitution . \n in the reminder , we focus on application of the equation ( [ e2.6 ] ) to electrostatics of in - medium dipolarions having a shape of sphere of radius @xmath29 in accord with the standard approach to the problem of electrostatic field inside and outside sphere , the interior , @xmath30 , and exterior , @xmath31 , fields should be computed from two equations @xmath32 supplemented by boundary conditions on the surface of dipolarion of radius @xmath29 . in the above equations @xmath33 is the in - medium parameter which accounts for the dipole polarization of solvent molecules from dipolar atmosphere by field of monopole charge of central micro - ion . as was noted in introduction \n , we are considering the two kinds of dipolarions distinguishing by type of solvent molecules forming its dipolar atmosphere . \n the first model belongs to aqua and aqua - like solutions composed of polar molecules of solvent , that is , molecules endowed with permanent dipole moments of constant magnitude , @xmath34 . \n the nano - complex of this type is referred to as a permanent dipolarion . \n the second model belongs to a case of dipolar atmosphere consisting of @xmath20 non - polar molecules whose dipole electric moments @xmath22 are induced by local fields @xmath5 of macro - ions : @xmath35 , where constant parameter @xmath36 is the molecular polarizability of solvent molecule of @xmath21-sort . \n the in - medium dipolarion of this type is referred to as a field - induced dipolarion . since \n our prime goal is the in - medium effect of electric field shielding , in what follows we focus on exterior fields of above dipolarions whose central symmetric shape suggests that the local fields have only one radial component @xmath37 . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      taking into account the last remark presuming that @xmath38 , one finds that the radial component of exterior field of permanent dipolarion obey the liner equation @xmath39 with the help of substitution @xmath40 we arrive at equation for @xmath41 permitting the general solution @xmath42 as a result , for the radial component of external electrostatic field of permanent dipolarion we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total charge of dipolarion whose density accounts for the internal polarization of polar molecules by fields of central ion . \n the potential of this field is given by equations @xmath45 , \\quad { \\rm ei}(n , x)=\\int\\limits_1^{\\infty } \\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^n}\\,dt . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the exponential integral ( e.g. , [ 4 ] ) . \n special comment should be made regarding the obtained expression ( [ e3.6 ] ) for electric field of dipolarion whose exponential factor exhibits the in - medium effect of electric field shielding . \n this effect is controlled by parameter @xmath47 depending on characteristics of both counterions and molecules of solvent : the larger @xmath47 the smaller effect of shielding . \n also , it worth emphasizing that the magnitude of the shielding length @xmath47 is the in - medium parameter carrying information about all constituents of dielectric nanosolution , since depends upon bound - charged density of all counterions @xmath48 , electric permittivity @xmath4 and dipole moments of solvent molecules @xmath49 . \n the shielding of exterior field of permanent dipolarion is clearly demonstrated in fig.1 where we plot exterior field and potential as functions of distance from the dipolarion surface ( normalized to its radius ) computed at pointed out values of the shielding length @xmath47 . \n consider a model of field - induced dipolarion which might be appropriate to dielectric nanosolutions composed of non - polar molecules of solvent which are easily polarized , however , by fields of counterions : under the action of ionic field the molecules of dipolar atmospheres acquire a dipole electric moments which are proportional to the field of ion : @xmath50 , where @xmath21 labels the dipolar type of molecule . \n interestingly enough that the exterior electrostatic field of field - induced dipolarion is described by non - linear equation @xmath51 which can be solved analytically . \n however to avoid destructing attention to mathematical details of fairly tedious analytic computations ( which will be reported in separable paper ) , we present here the final result @xmath52 which can easily be verified by simple computation @xmath53 the exterior field and its potential can be represented in the form @xmath54 highlighting the effect of the field shielding which is regulated by parameter @xmath55 depending upon charges of macro - ions and electric polarizability of solvent molecules . here by @xmath44 is understood the total charge of field - induced dipolarion . \n it is seen that , unlike the exponential shielding of electric field of the permanent dipolarion , the dipolar atmosphere of field - induced dipolarion leads to the electric field shielding which is described by @xmath56 factor . \n the above characteristics can be conveniently represented via dimensionless parameter of the field shielding @xmath47 and distance ( normalized to the dipolarion radius ) @xmath57 which is measured from the surface of dipolarion @xmath58 in terms of these quantities , the radial component of external field @xmath59 and potential @xmath60 take the form @xmath61 the case of @xmath62 corresponds to the surface values of these quantities . in fig.2 \n , we plot the radial component of exterior electric field and potential of the field - induced dipolarion as functions of @xmath63 computed at different values of parameter of shielding length @xmath47 . \n one sees , the smaller @xmath47 the less in - medium effect of the field shielding . \n the limiting case of @xmath64 corresponds to coulomb law for the potential and field of uniformly charged sphere . \n an understanding of macroscopic electrodynamics of non - conducting nanomaterials possessing dielectric and/or ferroelectric properties is important for their practical applications in current industrial and biomedical nanotechnologies . \n for example , in ref . \n [ 5 ] , an optical response of ferroelectric nanoparticles by resonant vibrations has been studied in the context of their potential utilization as biolabels . \n continuing this line of research , the purpose of this work was to find out theoretical framework providing meaningful discussion of electrochemical properties of dielectric nanosolution originating from dipolarions  positively and negatively charged nano - complexes composed of counterions coagulated by clouds of electric dipoles of solvent molecules . employing the standard equation of electrostatics for dielectric continuous media and using boltzmann distribution for the particle density of bound charges , we found that in - medium electrostatics of such nanosolutions can be conveniently described by equation for the intensity of internal field , rather than rather poisson - boltzmann equation for electrostatic potential lying at the base of the debye - hckel theory of electrolytes . \n the introduced equations are interesting in their own right and , first of all , due to their capability of consistent mathematical description and physical treatment of the in - medium effect of electric field shielding which is caused by the polarization of molecular dipoles of solvent by fields of counterions \n . this capability has been demonstrated by numerical analysis of obtained analytic solutions for exterior fields of two kinds of dipolarions . from current investigations of technical and biolectrolytes we know that the electrostatic fields and potentials of in - medium quasiparticles serve as the basic ingredients in computations of coefficients of electrochemical activity of these conducting liquids . in the meantime , this issue has not , to the best of our knowledge , been properly discussed in the context of dielectric liquids and nanosolutions and will be the subject of our forthcoming paper relying on the results presented in this work . \n the authors are indebted to wei -

long track segment . \n however , the dominant contribution to the spatial resolution uncertainty comes from the electron diffusion that is described and measured in the next section . \n we measure the energy resolution at 5.9  kev for the charge readout using a fe-55 source . \n a background - subtracted spectrum of pulse heights is fitted with a narrow gaussian for the full - absorption peak plus a wide gaussian for the escape peak . \n the resolution is extracted from the narrower gaussian and is found to be 10% ; a result which is consistent with fano factor of one  @xcite . \n we infer the energy resolution for the ccd readout from the amount of light that alpha particles deposit in track segments of different lengths . \n the energy deposited into ionization is estimated from the energy loss and calculated by srim  @xcite . \n we find that the resolution at 55  kev is approximately 15% , as shown in figure  [ fg::e reso ] . \n fe peak from charge readout , and the remaining points are from the optical readout of tracks from the @xmath4am sources . \n [ fg::e reso],width=453 ] \n electrons propagating through cf@xmath0 gas experience a spread in transverse direction @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion constant and @xmath3 is the mobility of electrons , i.e. a constant of proportionality between the drift velocity and the electric field . \n the @xmath9 parameter is a measure of the average electron energy , @xmath12 .    in previous measurements of @xmath9 , the spread of electron current \n was determined with annular anodes that integrate the swarm current  @xcite or with a small - area proportional counter that scans the swarm profile  @xcite . \n these approaches yield @xmath9 values that differ by more than an order of magnitude at electric field to number density ratio @xmath13 . \n the large data samples of these measurements suggests that the discrepancy is due to an unknown systematic offset , which motivates a new measurement with a different approach . \n in this work , we extract @xmath9 from the width of alpha tracks ( @xmath4am ) that are placed at different drift distances inside the drift cage . a 500  ms ccd exposure with alpha tracks emerging from the five sources \n is shown in figure  [ fg::imageoffivesources ] . \n the gaps in the tracks are the result of missing light due to the resistive separators which are used to maintain the amplification gap separation . \n images are taken without a shutter , so it is possible that some alpha tracks appear during the ccd readout . since the ccd is read out in a horizontal direction , these tracks appear shifted to the left or right . \n most of such tracks fall out of the fitting range of interest or appear at wrong @xmath14-positions and can be excluded by requiring that the mean of the light distribution of the track segment agrees with the position of the source . \n vertical lines depict a 1.2  mm wide region of interest approximately 3  cm from the sources for measurement of track widths . \n the kink in the second track from the top is likely due to a large -

{"ContextTokens": 4005, "GeneratedTokens": 226, "SynthesizedBody": "there is an ongoing theoretical debate about the dominant formation mechanism for giant planets . \n two opposite extremes exist : core accretion and disk instability . in core accretion , a solid core forms first by the collisional accumulation of planetesimals and planetary embryos , and then accretes a gaseous envelope from the protoplanetary disk gas ( mizuno 1980 ) . in the disk instability mechanism , a gaseous protoplanet forms first in a gravitationally unstable , gaseous disk ( boss 1997 ) , and then a solid core forms by the settling and coagulation of dust grains within the protoplanet . \n while core accretion is generally assumed to be the dominant formation mechanism for giant planets , considerable theoretical uncertainty remains about both formation mechanisms ( e.g. , durisen et  al . 2007 ) . \n given this murky situation , observational constraints are likely to be crucial for deciding which mechanism , if either , dominates ( boss 2006 ) . \n millimeter wave telescopes should be able probe the planet - forming midplanes of optically - thick disks . \n the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) may be able to directly image gaseous protoplanets formed by disk instability , or to detect the strong self - absorption of hco@xmath0 emission lines caused by these dense clumps of molecular gas ( narayanan et  al . \n . the latter type of detections might also be achieved by the submillimeter array ( sma ) . \n here we consider the observational appearance of light scattered by the irregular surfaces of a marginally gravitationally unstable disk that is in the process of forming gaseous protoplanets by the disk instability mechanism . \n the disk model studied here ( from boss 2001 ) is the same as the one investigated by narayanan et  al . \n ( 2006 ) , and this work thus provides an important comparision between what can be accomplished at optical and at millimeter wavelengths in terms of constraining giant planet formation mechanisms . \n many others have studied the observable properties of ysos ( young stellar objects ) . \n this includes the spectral energy distributions of unresolved sources ( e.g.   yorke , bodenheimer , & laughlin 1993 ; boss & yorke 1995 , 1996 ; wood et  al . \n 1998 , 2002 ; robitaille et  al . 2006 ) and imaging of smooth axisymmetric disk models ( e.g.   whitney & hartmann 1992 , 1993 ; yorke et  al . 1993 ; sonnhalter , preibisch , & yorke 1995 ; kessel , yorke , & richling 1998 ; yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ; lucas et  al . 2004 ) . in this paper \n , we discuss high - resolution imaging of a disk undergoing a dynamical process . \n the basis for our modeling is a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation rather than an analytic disk model since we are interested in the perturbations that indicate activity in the disk rather than the overall emission . \n the disk model we adopt was calculated by boss ( 2001 ) , and is described in detail in that paper . \n the hydrodynamics of the disk were calculated three - dimensionally in spherical coordinates , with @xmath1 as the distance from the central star , @xmath2 as the angle with respect to the axis of the disk s rotation , and @xmath3 as the azimuthal or longitudinal angle . \n pressures and temperatures were calculated on a grid with @xmath4 uniformly spaced intervals in @xmath1 between 4 and 20 au and @xmath5 uniformly spaced intervals in @xmath3 between 0 and @xmath6 . in @xmath2 , \n @xmath7 values were sampled , with @xmath8 . \n the system consists of a 1 @xmath9 central protostar , surrounded by a gaseous disk of mass @xmath10 between 4 and 20 au . from an initially smooth disk , \n the system was evolved several hundred years , until a gravitationally bound clump began to form . in this study \n , we will examine snapshots of the simulation at 335 , 339 , and 346 years . \n simulated scattered light images are generated by treating the surface of the disk as an isotropic scatterer , with half the incident flux being absorbed and remainder scattered isotropically . \n the surface of the disk is defined to be where the disk becomes optically thick to stellar irradiation . \n that is , if we define @xmath11 to be the optical depth , the surface is where @xmath12 . \n we assume the dust is well - mixed with the gas , using opacities calculated by dalessio , calvet , & hartmann ( 2001 ) for a grain size distribution with maximum grain size @xmath13 mm , power - law index of @xmath14 , with a dust temperature of 100k . \n they calculate the planck opacity integrated over a stellar blackbody spectrum at 4000 k as @xmath15 g@xmath16 @xmath17 . \n the peak wavelength for this spectrum is 0.73 @xmath18 m , corresponding to r - band . \n we treat the star as a blackbody of radius @xmath19 radiating at a temperature of @xmath20 k.    the surface is defined to be where the line - of - sight optical depth to the star is @xmath21 . \n this is done numerically by calculating along lines of sight from the star . to avoid numerical artifacts at the inner boundary , we skip the innermost 5 radial grid values , so that @xmath22 we assume that the density interior to @xmath23 is constant ( @xmath24 ) , so @xmath25 for a line - of - sight along a given direction @xmath26 , we calculate where the optical depth reaches 2/3 and define that to be the location of the disk surface , sampling it with a resolution of @xmath27 or @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30/n_r = 0.016 $ ] . \n the flux of stellar irradiation incident on the disk at a distance @xmath1 is @xmath31 the angle of incidence of stellar irradiation on the disk surface is @xmath32 where @xmath33 points from the surface to the star , and @xmath34 is normal to the surface . \n the finite size of the star is the reason for including the @xmath35 term . to calculate the scattered flux , \n we assume that surface acts like an isotropic scatterer so that half the flux is absorbed into the disk and reprocessed into thermal radiation and the other half is scattered back out isotropically . \n if we define @xmath36 to be the flux emitted by the star , then we can express the scattered light emission relative to the stellar flux : @xmath37 \n in figure [ dencompare]a , we show the simulated scattered light image of the disk as calculated above , at a time of 339 years . \n the flux is normalized to the stellar emission , and is displayed in the logarithm as indicated by the color bar . \n note that the brightest intensity is at best @xmath38 of the stellar emission , and the minimum intensity shown is @xmath39 of the stellar emission . \n the dark radial streaks seen in the simulated image are shadows of dense clumps at the inner boundary of the simulation , at 4 au . at the distances and scales involved in the simulation , \n it is appropriate to treat the star as a point source , which is why the shadows diverge . \n the area interior to 4 au has been blacked out to ignore numerical artifacts at the inner boundary of the simulation . \n the planet - forming clump is located at the position of the white asterisk . \n there is no apparent correlation between the position of the forming planet and structure in the scattered light image .    in figure [ dencompare]b \n , we show the density structure at the disk midplane of the simulation . the density enhancement corresponding to the position of the forming planet can be clearly seen . \n however , the density structure at the disk s midplane bears no resemblance to the scattered light image . in figure [ dencompare]c \n , we show the density structure of the disk at @xmath40 , in projection . \n this is close to the height of the scattering surface of the disk . comparing figures [ dencompare]a and [ dencompare]b , it is readily apparent that the scattered light emission traces the density structure in these tenuous surface layers of the disk rather than probing the overall density structure in the disk . \n the densities displayed in figures [ dencompare]b and [ dencompare]c cover completely different ranges , demonstrating this fact . \n the structures seen in scattered light are corrugations created in the initially smooth surfaces of the disk from the highly dynamical evolution of a marginally gravitationally unstable disk ( boss 2001 ) . \n the corrugations indicate activity within the disk , even though they are not directly correlated spatially .    in figure [ psfconv ] \n , we demonstrate the time evolution of the scattered light image . from top to bottom , we show simulated images of the disk at 335 , 339 , and 346 years . for scale \n , the central blackout region has a diameter of 8 au . \n the intensity scale is the same as in figure [ dencompare]a and can be inferred from the contours , which indicate flux relative to the stellar emission of @xmath41 ( solid ) , @xmath42 ( dashed ) , and @xmath43 ( dotted ) . \n the left column shows the theoretical scattered light image , with perfect resolution , with the location of the forming planet indicated by the white asterisk . \n these simulated images show that the corrugations evolve on time scales of only a few years , short enough to be easily observationally detectable . \n such surface irregularities are seen in other disk instability simulations as well ( e.g. , boley & durisen 2006 ) and can be attributed to spiral shock fronts breaking on the disk surface . \n observations of features indicative of disk instability would be a major advance for planet formation theory . an 8-m class telescope with adaptive optics \n would be diffraction limited at @xmath44 at 1 @xmath18 m . a 30-m class telescope such as the gmt ( giant magellan telescope ) or tmt ( thirty meter telescope ) , which are expected to have first light in the next decade , would have diffraction limits of less than @xmath45 at 1 @xmath18 m . \n to illustrate what actual observations of our theoretical disks might look like , we have convolved the images in the left column of figure [ psfconv ] with gaussian psfs ( point spread functions ) with fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of @xmath45 ( center column ) and @xmath44 ( right column ) . \n we assume that the disk is face - on to the observer at 140 pc , the approximate distance of taurus . \n a resolution of @xmath45 is just sufficient to begin resolving the corrugations in the scattered light image , while a resolution of @xmath44 reveals only some indistinct hints of structure . \n the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) adaptive optics coronograph at the gemini observatory should be diffraction - limited at 1 micron with an 8-m aperture . however , its estimated performance is a contrast ratio of 13 mags , or @xmath46 at @xmath47 from the star , with decreasing performance closer to the star . \n this suggests that the spatial features we have modeled may not be observable with current 8-m class telescopes , and would have to wait until a 30-m class telescope such as the gmt comes online . \n high - contrast imaging on the gmt , which is being developed for imaging exoplanets , should be able to achieve a contrast ratio of @xmath42 at @xmath48 at 1.65@xmath18 m ( angel et  al . \n 2006 ) . in comparison \n , the inner edge of the simulated disk at 4 au would be at @xmath49 from the central star . \n this dashed contours in figure [ psfconv ] indicate a contrast ratio of @xmath42 , so the variability in the scattered light patterns from disk instability should be observable by the gmt \n . optical or infrared interferometry might also be good ways to observe disk instability . \n this method has already been used to detect structure in the inner 1 au of some t tauri disks ( e.g.   akeson et  al . \n .    the temporal variations may be observable if the disk is revisited over several years . \n observing this phenomenon requires finding a class i yso with the right orientation and without too much obscuration by an envelope . \n bipolar outflows that are common to many ysos may clear away envelope material along the poles , allowing a clear view to the inner regions of the disk that are of interest .    since the contrast between the disk to the star is @xmath38 at best , temporal variations in overall brightness of the unresolved source are more likely due to stellar activity than to disk activity . if the disk is resolved , then disk activity should be readily distinguished from stellar activity since the scattered light should scale with stellar brightness . \n stellar activity that affects the luminosity of the star isotropically should not affect the contrast ratio between star and disk . \n anisotropic variations , such as cold or hot star spots , can be distinguished from disk activity because these variations will have the same period as the rotation period of the star , which is on the order of days for typical young stars . \n for example , hh30 is an edge - on disk system whose periodic fluctuations in brightness are caused by illumination from a hot spot on the star sweeping across the surface of the disk as the star rotates , similar to a lighthouse ( wood et  al . \n 1998 ; wood & whitney 1998 ; cotera et  al . 2001 ) . \n this variability occurs on time scales of days and is periodic . \n in contrast , the features we have modeled vary over years and are irregular . by monitoring an object over a series of several nights \n , short - term effects can be filtered out and the year - to - year variations can be studied to determine if activity characteristic of disk instability is occuring . \n in contrast to the variability characteristic of disk instability , planet formation by core accretion should be more quiescent , resulting in a distinct shadow at the position of the forming planet core ( jang - condell 2005a , 2005b ) . \n the mechanisms are also separated in pre - main sequence evolutionary epochs : disk instability is expected to occur during the class i phase of star / planet formation , where there is substantial disk and envelope material infalling toward the star . \n core formation has a much longer expected time scale , so those signatures are detectable during the class ii phase , after the envelope has cleared but the disk still remains . \n since scattered light images of optically thick disks give information about the tenuous upper layers of the disk rather than the overall large - scale structure , one should be cautious when trying to infer disk structure from scattered light images . \n for example , the outer disk of ab aurigae ( fukagawa et  al . 2004 ) extends out to hundreds of au , and over that path length , even a small amount of material can easily block stellar illumination . \n this effect should be considered before drawing strong conclusions about the underlying disk structure . \n although scattered light emission is not directly correlated to the planet forming in the disk , the presence of structure in the scattered light emission coupled with high time variability can be an indicator of planet forming activity . \n we can at least identify disks where planets are forming even if we can not say exactly where in the disk it is taking place . \n the gmt might well be able to detect these rapid variations in scattered light on spatial scales of interest ( @xmath50 5 to 10 au ) for giant planet formation , and thus shed light on the processes occuring deep inside optically thick protoplanetary disks . \n emission from the disk itself at longer wavelengths should be a better probe of the overall disk structure both because the optical depth is smaller at longer wavelength and because direct emission from the disk has better contrast with respect to the star than scattered light . \n observations of gravitationally unstable disks in the millimeter and sub -

dark - matteror simply quartessence @xcite has attracted a lot of interest recently . a prototype of this model is given by the quartessence chaplygin model ( qcm ) @xcite .    both the background and linear fluctuations were extensively studied for qcm , and were compared to observational data . \n the generalized chaplygin gas ( as quartessence ) appears to be compatible with all available data regarding the expansion history ( see e.g. ref . \n @xcite and refs . \n therein ) . for adiabatic perturbations , \n a linear analysis was done for the cmb @xcite  and lss @xcite . in this case , only qcm models close to the `` @xmath0cdm limit '' are allowed . \n recently , it was shown that problems ( pointed out in @xcite ) , such as the existence of instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum of qcm , can be avoided if a specific type of intrinsic entropy perturbation is considered . \n such non -

adiabatic quartessence from concordance models like @xmath1cdm and quintessence using the previously considered observables . \n however , as we shall see , measurable differences in the predictions of these models appear clearly in the nonlinear regime , in particular in the skewness of the matter distribution in large scales . in our investigation \n we specifically consider three different quartessence models . \n all of them have the @xmath1cdm model as a limiting case for the background solution . \n the analysis of these three cases indicates that our result should be applicable to more generic quartessence models .    while most studies of the nonlinear regime deal with the clumping of pressureless fluid ( dm ) , in the case of quartessence it is imperative that one includes the effects of pressure . \n accordingly , we apply , and somewhat extend to include relativistic pressure , a method for the computation of density cumulants developed in refs . @xcite . \n in our approach we consider the following newtonian -

order equation . \n if we start with gaussian initial conditions , it is associated with the emergence of non - gaussian features in the matter density field . \n further , @xmath31 can be related to the skewness of the cosmic field @xcite . in this case , \n the unsmoothed skewness is given by @xmath34 . \n we now consider the following quartessence models : @xmath35 when @xmath36 , all the models above have @xmath0cdm as a limiting case for the background . at first and \n higher order in perturbation theory , however , these quartessence models with @xmath36 , have distinct behavior as compared to that of dark - matter in @xmath0cdm .    in figs . \n @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 we show contours of constant skewness values at present time for the above models . in our numerical computation , we consider that at @xmath40 , the growing modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 assume the einstein - de sitter behavior : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and such that @xmath43 at that time . \n we also include in the figures two curves with constant effective matter density parameter ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . here , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the present value of the background energy density . \n we should expect the region between these two curves to be , roughly , the one allowed by current observational data . \n for instance , in @xcite it was shown that , for qcm , constraints from cluster x - ray data ( that are the most restrictive ones ) , essentially correspond to these curves . \n the same holds for the other quartessence models . from the figures it is clear that , for all the considered models , the skewness in these regions assumes values between @xmath48 \n this strongly contrasts with what is expected in @xmath0cdm and quintessence , where one obtains @xmath49 , weakly sensitive to the cosmological parameters @xcite .    at first sight \n this difference could be interpreted as an indication that quartessence models are inconsistent with large - scale skewness measurements @xcite . \n however , care should be taken when analyzing this issue . \n whereas in the discussion above baryons were neglected , measurements of skewness from large - scale galaxy distribution , are based on counting luminous objects , not the dark component . eqs . \n ( 1)-(5 ) can be easily generalized to include baryons @xcite . \n the main outcome is that the quartessence skewness is not substantially affected by the presence of a small amount ( @xmath50 ) of baryons , but on the other hand , the baryonic skewness ( @xmath51 ) is nearly constant with redshift , i.e. @xmath52 . \n therefore , again baryons behave differently from the dark component as in the adiabatic quartessence power - spectrum case @xcite . \n we remark that this holds even for @xmath53 . \n further investigation is necessary to clarify to what extent do skewness measurements from galaxy distribution constrain quartessence models . although more challenging to observe , a potentially powerful probe is the lensing ( convergence ) skewness @xcite , that is sensitive to both baryons and quartessence . according to @xcite \n current lensing observations are still too noisy to allow strong constraints on cosmological parameters . on the other hand , as discussed above , quartessence predictions for the skewness are quite different from @xmath0cdm models and its variants . \n thus , we expect that present and upcoming data might discriminate among these two classes of models .    in the present work , we have not quantitatively compared quartessence predictions with observations . \n our goal here is more modest ; we essentially use figs . \n @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 to stress out the important fact that non - adiabatic quartessence and concordance models like @xmath0cdm and quintessence could be observationally distinguished by skewness measurements . \n we leave this investigation for a future work @xcite . \n finally , we remark that our results do not apply straightforwardly to quartessence models with a scalar field with , for instance , a non - canonical kinetic term @xcite , but these models have yet to be tested against background and power spectrum data . \n a. kamenshchik , u. moschella , and v. pasquier , phys . lett . \n b * 511 * , 265 ( 2001 ) ; m. makler , _ gravitational dynamics of structure formation in the universe _ , phd thesis , brazilian center for research in physics ( 2001 ) ; n. bili , g.b . \n tupper , and r.d . \n viollier , phys . lett . \n b * 535 * , 17 ( 2002 ) ; m.c . \n bento , o. bertolami , and a.a . sen , \n d * 66 * , 043507 ( 2002 ) . \n l. amendola , f. finelli , c. burigana , and d. carturan , jcap * 07 * , 005 ( 2003 ) . \n see also d. carturan , f. finelli , phys.rev . \n d * 68 * , 103501 ( 2003 ) and r. bean and o. dore , phys.rev . \n d * 68 * , 023515 ( 2003 ) for the case of the chaplygin fluid as only dark energy . \n e. gaztaaga and j.a . \n frieman , astrophys . \n j. * 437 * , l13 ( 1994 ) ; f. hoyle , i. szapudi , and c.m . \n baugh , mon . not . \n * 317 * , l51 ( 2000 ) ; i. szapudi , m. postman , t.r . \n lauer , and w. oegerle , astrophys . j. * 548 * , 114 ( 2001 ) ; i. szapudi _ et . \n _ , astrophys . \n j. * 570 * , 75 ( 2002 ) ; for review see f. bernardeau , s. colombi , e. gaztaaga , and r. scoccimarro , phys . rep . * 367 * , 1 ( 2002 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1245370926669, "RequestID": "fd100d156e1b429899085f1251ab548a", "TotalTokens": 3941}

{"ContextTokens": 2932, "GeneratedTokens": 146, "SynthesizedBody": "we are given a subroutine which for every one of @xmath0 possible inputs gives us a @xmath1 or a @xmath2 as output . \n the subroutine is in a `` black box '' , so we are not allowed to see what algorithm it uses . \n the problem is to find an input for which the subroutine gives @xmath2 ( a `` marked '' input or `` element '' ) or to say that there is no such input . \n classically there is no other way than to try out many inputs on the subroutine . on the other hand , \n if the subroutine also works for superpositions of inputs    @xmath3    we can use grover s quantum searching algorithm @xcite to find a `` marked element '' ( an input that yields @xmath2 ) which gives us a quadratic speedup relative to the classical method . \n in particular when we know the number @xmath4 of marked elements , grover s algorithm will find one of these elements with high probability using only about @xmath5 queries to the subroutine . \n a slight modification of this algorithm can actually increase the success probability to @xmath2 while using at most one more query ( see below ) . \n all this also works when we are only told that the number of marked elements is either @xmath4 or @xmath1 . \n on the other hand , when we do nt know the number of marked elements , grover s algorithm does nt perform that well . in particular to get a certainly correct answer any algorithm will use on the order of @xmath0 queries as for the classical case @xcite . \n if we allow for some error probability , a grover type quantum search still helps . note that when the quantum algorithm outputs a candidate marked element \n , we can check it with just one more query . \n thus the only error that can happen , is that the algorithm wrongly says that there are no marked elements . \n thus the error is so - called one sided and we have not only a quantum monte carlo algorithm ( bqp ) but actually a quantum - rp algorithm . \n so the problem now is : given @xmath0 and some upper bound on the error probability @xmath6 , find an algorithm that uses as few queries to the black box as possible . \n note that by error probability we mean the error probability for the worst case , which here in particular means the number of marked elements for which the algorithm performs worst . \n a simple , but not optimal , solution to this problem is to run grover s algorithm many times for some random number of iterations (= number of queries ) between @xmath1 and @xmath7 , which is about the optimum for just one marked element . \n we choose the number of iterations of each run uniformly at random from the given range . from the evolution of the state vector ( of the qc ) in grover \n s algorithm ( see below ) it is easy to see that in each such run and for any number of marked elements ( except @xmath1 ) the probability of finding a marked element is about @xmath8 . \n actually a careful analysis ( see below ) shows that for the worst - case number of marked elements @xmath4 , it s about @xmath9 . by repeating this \n many times we get asymptotically at most about the following number of queries :    @xmath10      the proposed algorithm again basically consists of many runs of grover s algorithm , each for some numbers of iterations ( = number of queries ) . \n it consists of 2 parts plus possibly a third one to improve it a bit . \n the first part checks for all numbers of marked elements from @xmath2 to some maximum @xmath11 , each time running grover s algorithm for the appropriate number of iterations , which is about @xmath5 for @xmath4 marked elements . \n if the maximal error probability @xmath6 which we allow is below about @xmath12 we have to use the exact version of grover which is guaranteed to work for a given known number of marked elements . \n the total number of queries of this first step is about :    @xmath13    which i ve obtained by approximating the sum with an integral . \n the second part consists of a number of grover runs for a random number of iterations smaller than the last grover run of the first part . \n thus we choose the number of iterations uniformly at random from the range @xmath14 . \n this i propose to do @xmath15 times . \n thus the second part consists of at most the following number of queries :    @xmath16    it turns out that this choice of the number of grover runs in the second part which gives equal number of queries for the first and second parts is optimal .    in the second part we have probability about @xmath8 to find a marked element in every run , \n provided the number of marked elements is larger than @xmath11 . \n say the actual ( worst case ) probability is some @xmath17 ( which is a bit smaller than 1/2 and which we will determine below ) , then @xmath18 and we get the following number of queries for the total algorithm as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath6 :    @xmath19    note the ( admittedly small ) improvement relative to the simpler algorithm described above . \n note also that @xmath6 as a function of @xmath20 for a fixed @xmath0 goes as    @xmath21    which is of course better than the exponential we could achieve by just running the same probabilistic algorithm over and over . \n it turns out that the worst case detection probability @xmath17 actually occurs for a number of marked elements @xmath4 close to @xmath0 . \n so if we want we can add a third part to the algorithm where we take care of this worst case by just classically checking a number of random inputs to the black box . to achieve the maximum allowed error probability @xmath6 \n this only takes a number of queries that is of a smaller order than the number of queries used in the first two parts , thus we can neglect the cost of this third part .    in the remainder of the paper \n i will determine the maximal error probability @xmath17 for a grover run with a random number of iterations and i will also give a simple argument that an exact version of grover s algorithm can be constructed for a known number @xmath4 of marked elements , which has been known before ( i think it s by peter hoyer , but ca nt find a reference ) . \n first we have to review grover s algorithm :      each iteration of grover s algorithm consists of the following four steps :    @xmath22    the initial state is the uniform amplitude superposition of all possible @xmath0 inputs to the black box . \n the first step involves querying the oracle , while the second and fourth steps involve hadamard transforming each of the @xmath23 qubits ( thus here we have @xmath24 ) . \n we can write the initial state as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the set of marked elements while @xmath27 and @xmath28 . \n it turns out ( and is easy to see ) that after any number of applications of the 4 steps of grover s algorithm the state remains of the above form , thus a superposition with real coefficients of the uniform amplitude superposition of all unmarked ( basis- ) states and of the uniform amplitude superposition of all marked states . \n the actual calculation consists simply of applying the 4 above steps to each of these 2 states . in every iteration \n the state vector gets rotated by some angle @xmath29 , so after @xmath30 iterations we have :    @xmath31    where @xmath29 is given by    @xmath32    it is easy to check that @xmath33 which will facilitate the subsequent calculations . \n the probability of finding a marked element after @xmath30 steps is @xmath34 . if we choose the number of iterations uniformly at random from the range @xmath35 we get the success probability    @xmath36    where the summation is easily accomplished because we can write the trigonometric functions in terms of exponentials @xmath37 which gives us geometric series . \n also we used @xmath33 . note that , as stated above , @xmath38 . \n now we have to look for the minimum of @xmath17 ( = worst case ) over the range @xmath39 of marked elements . \n the lower end of this range corresponds to @xmath40 . \n the following plot shows @xmath17 as a function of @xmath29 ( here for @xmath41 ) \n . note that @xmath42 while @xmath43 . \n the point @xmath44 is where @xmath45 first reaches @xmath8 . \n significant for us is the next local minimum @xmath46 and the last local minimum @xmath47 , where i have taken the limit @xmath48 to get these values . \n these two values are the absolute minimum ( in our range ) and the next larger local minimum . if we include the third part of the algorithm ( classical checking ) we do nt have to worry about @xmath49 , thus @xmath50 . then asymptotically the number of queries becomes ( from equation [ res ] ) : \n @xmath51    the second graph above shows how the success probability evolves in grover s algorithm for 3 cases of interest . \n the range shown in the plot is the range which we use in the second part of the algorithm , thus from 0 to about @xmath52 iterations . \n the thick solid line is for @xmath11 marked elements , for which the average probability over this range is @xmath8 . \n the dashed graph corresponds to the first local minimum in the first plot , whereas the dotted graph gives the last local minimum which occurs for only few unmarked elements . \n here i give a simple argument why grover s algorithm can easily be modified to give a correct answer for a known number @xmath4 of marked elements . the problem with standard \n grover is that @xmath53 never exactly becomes @xmath2 . \n our task now is to modify the 4 steps in grover s algorithm so that we get a smaller rotation angle @xmath54 . \n imagine we apply these ( modified ) 4 steps to the initial ( uniform amplitude ) state . \n usually in the 1 . \n step we change the phase of the marked states by @xmath55 which allows us to increase the amplitude of the marked states to @xmath56 . if we do nt change the phase it is easy to see that the 4 steps of grover s algorithm do nt change the initial state at all , thus the amplitude of the marked states remains @xmath57 . by continuity \n it is now clear that we can adjust the absolute value of the amplitude of the marked states to any value between these extremes . to get the amplitude back to real and positive \n we then call the black box once more to rotate the phase of the marked elements by the right amount \n .    actually one can avoid this last ( additional ) call to the black box by also choosing a different phase change in step 3 , but this is not so easy to explain . \n of course there are also various other ways to make grover s algorithm exact . \n the algorithm we have constructed is clearly not optimal . \n it s order _ is _ optimal , as stated in corollary 3 on page 6 of @xcite , but the performance can obviously still be improved by a multiplicative constant . \n my guess is that the number of queries can be reduced by at least a factor of @xmath58 , but probably by a factor of @xmath59 or more . \n unfortunately no bound on the multiplicative constant is specified in @xcite .    in the second part of the algorithm we choose the number of iterations of grover at random . \n this is not very elegant and certainly not optimal , but it makes the algorithm and the assessment of its performance easy . \n a general observation is that zero error algorithms are a rather academic and unphysical concept . \n any computer has some failure probability , this is especially true for quantum computers . \n fortunately fault tolerant techniques allow us to greatly increase the reliability . \n essentially the error probability can be reduced exponentially in the resources we invest into fault tolerance which allows us to attain a reliability that is good enough for all practical purposes . \n so what about my use of the exact variant of grover s algorithm ? \n actually we do nt really need the exact version , we

zero neutrino masses ( see @xcite for a review ) . \n oscillation experiments do not give us any information on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos , only on the mass differences between the different mass eigenstates and mixing angles . \n the current best upper bounds on the neutrino mass from particle experiments come from the troitsk @xcite and mainz @xcite tritium beta decay experiments that found upper bounds on @xmath0 of @xmath8ev ( 95% c.l . ) . \n the katrin experiment @xcite that will start taking data in 2010 , is expected to lower this limit on @xmath0 by an order of magnitude to @xmath9ev ( in the case of no detection ) after three years of running . \n effects of neutrino masses can also be seen in cosmological observables , and the best upper limits on the absolute scale of the neutrino mass today come from cosmology . \n both cmb and the large scale structures ( lss ) of the galaxy distribution are probes that are sensitive to the neutrino mass , the observable quantity being the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath10 . \n the upper bounds on @xmath11 from cosmology range from @xmath12ev @xcite to @xmath13ev @xcite ( 95% c.l . ) , depending on the data @xcite and cosmological model @xcite used .    on the experimental side \n there is a claim of detection of the absolute scale of the neutrino mass from the heidelberg - moscow neutrinoless double beta decay experiment , with an effective electron neutrino mass of @xmath14ev ( 99.73% c.l . ) \n @xcite . however , these results are regarded somewhat controversial . \n the cosmological implications of this result are discussed in @xcite . \n we know that neutrinos are massive , and since we have no current priors on the neutrino mass in the allowed cosmological range , one should always marginalize over @xmath11 when constraining other cosmological parameters . \n @xmath11 turns out to be partially degenerate with several of the standard cosmological parameters , such that this marginalization over @xmath11 weakens the bounds on the other parameters in our model . \n thus , any prior knowledge of @xmath11 from non - cosmological experiments will serve to break degeneracies and improve the constraints on other cosmological parameters . \n the katrin experiment will provide us with such a prior on @xmath11 in a range that is relevant for cosmology . in this paper \n we investigate how the results from katrin will affect our estimates of other cosmological parameters . \n limits on the neutrino mass when combining results from katrin and wmap have been studied in a recent paper by that hst et al . \n our emphasis in this paper is on how other cosmological parameters are affected when the results from katrin are used as an external prior . \n section [ sec : cosmology ] contains a short review on the effect of massive neutrinos in cosmology . in section [ sec : data ] we will present the data and methods that we will use in our analysis , including the assumed priors from the katrin experiment . then we will present our results in section [ sec : results ] . \n a comparison of @xmath15 values found when introducing the katrin priors is presented in section [ sec : chisq ] . \n finally we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] . \n all our results are derived within the standard cosmological paradigm of a flat @xmath16cdm model , using the following free parameters : @xmath17 . \n here @xmath18 denotes the energy density of energy component @xmath19 ( m = matter , b = baryons , @xmath16=cosmological constant , cdm = cold dark matter ) relative to the total energy density of a spatially flat universe . \n the matter density , @xmath20 , is the sum of all non - relativistic components , such that @xmath21 . \n the parameter @xmath22 is the dimensionless hubble parameter , defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations , while @xmath25 gives the tilt of the primordial power spectrum . finally , @xmath26 is the optical depth at reionization . for more details on the parameter definitions , \n see the description of the cosmomc code @xcite . \n the effect of massive neutrinos on cosmological observables is parameterized by @xmath27 , the sum of the neutrino masses , and is related to the neutrino energy density by the simple relation @xcite @xmath28 . \n we will also extend the parameter space by including @xmath29 , the equation of state parameter of dark energy , as a free parameter . \n we will assume @xmath29 to be constant . \n this parameter may be interesting to study , as it is fundamental in the understanding of the nature of dark energy , and since it is known to be slightly correlated with @xmath11 @xcite . \n it should be stressed that this analysis rests on the assumption of a standard thermal background of 3 weakly interacting neutrino species . \n alternatives to this picture are studied in e.g. @xcite and @xcite . \n recent reviews of the role of massive neutrinos in cosmology can be found in @xcite . in this section \n we will only give a brief description of the most important effects of @xmath11 on relevant cosmological observables . \n we will throughout this work assume that the neutrino mass eigenstates are degenerate , such that @xmath30 . \n in the mass range that we will operating in , it has been shown that this is a valid simplification when it comes to cosmological observables @xcite . \n effects on the cmb from massive neutrinos manifest themselves mainly on the level of background evolution . in the neutrino mass \n ranges relevant to us , the neutrinos will still be relativistic at the time of matter - radiation equality , and must be regarded as a radiation component when it comes to the background evolution of the universe . increasing @xmath11 ( and thus also @xmath31 ) , keeping @xmath20 constant , will thus postpone the time of matter - radiation equality . this will enhance the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum and give a small horizontal shift of the peaks to larger scales . \n this effect is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : p ] . to compensate for this effect , one can increase @xmath20 and decrease @xmath32 . \n it is already obvious that @xmath11 will be correlated with both @xmath32 and @xmath20 ( and thus also @xmath4 when we stick to the assumption of spatial flatness ) . \n another effect comes from neutrino free - streaming , which will smoothen out gravitational wells on scales below an @xmath27- dependent neutrino free streaming scale @xcite . on scales smaller than this , \n the acoustic oscillations will be enhanced , increasing the height of the peaks in the cmb power spectrum . \n neutrino masses affect the lss power spectrum in an even more distinct way . again \n , massive neutrinos will suppress structure growth on scales below a free streaming scale given by @xcite @xmath33 the smaller @xmath11 , the larger scales will be affected , and the larger @xmath11 , the more suppression of power on the scales affected . \n the effect of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum can be seen in figure [ fig : p ] . \n again , @xmath20 is kept constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated for by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly . \n cmb ( left panel ) and lss ( right panel ) power spectra with different values of @xmath11 . here \n @xmath20 is held constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   cmb ( left panel ) and lss ( right panel ) power spectra with different values of @xmath11 . here \n @xmath20 is held constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] \n our analysis include both observations of cmb , lss , sn1a , information about baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum and constraints from the cluster mass function from weak gravitational lensing . \n we have also applied priors on @xmath32 and @xmath35 . \n the cmb data used in our analysis , comes from the temperature @xcite and polarization @xcite data from the 3-year data release from the wmap team . \n the wmap experiment is a satellite based full - sky survey of the cmb temperature anisotropies and polarization . in our analysis of the wmap data we have used the fortran 90 likelihood code provided with the data release . \n we have used lss data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite . as sn1a data we have used the sample from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite . \n other probes of the matter distribution that we have applied come from the measurement of the baryonic acoustic peak ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum and the cluster mass function ( cmf ) from weak gravitational lensing . \n the bao constraint comes from the sdss - lrg sample @xcite , and we have adopted the fit function from @xcite , a _ = 0.469 ( ) ^-0.35 ( 1 + 0.94 f _ ) 0.017 , where a _ \n ^1/3 , and @xmath36 is the comoving angular diameter distance at redshift @xmath37 \n .    handles on parameters governing the clustering of matter are also provided by the cluster mass function . the cluster mass function from weak gravitational lensing , as measured in @xcite , gives constraints on a combination of @xmath20 and @xmath38 ( the root -

hat prior on the age @xmath44 of the universe : @xmath45 .      the katrin @xcite experiment measures the energy distribution of electrons from tritium beta decay . \n the exact shape of the end of this spectrum will depend on how much of the energy that is bound in the outgoing electron neutrinos , and thus also be a probe of the electron neutrino mass . \n if katrin does not detect @xmath0 , they are expected to place an upper limit on @xmath9ev ( 90% c.l . ) . \n they expect to reach an uncertainty of @xmath46 .    here \n we have adopted this uncertainty for two cases , one assuming @xmath1ev ( i.e. , no detection by katrin ) , and one assuming @xmath2ev ( giving @xmath47ev ) . \n further we have assumed the gaussian distribution of @xmath48 around these values @xcite , and used this as a prior in our cosmological parameter analysis .      employing the publicly available markov chain monte carlo code cosmomc@xcite \n we have studied our seven - parameter model for two combinations of datasets ; first using only wmap data , and then adding lss , sn1a data and priors from hst , bbn , bao and cmf . in both cases \n we have compared the results from using only cosmological data , and from adding priors from katrin in the case of @xmath1ev and @xmath2ev . \n first we will assume @xmath49 ( cosmological constant ) . \n yet more freedom in the cosmological model might be added by including @xmath29 as a free parameter , yielding a more general form of the dark energy component . \n we will also include @xmath29 in our analysis , assuming it to be constant . \n starting out , we considered the simplest case using only the standard 7 parameter universe model , as explained in section [ sec : cosmology ] , and wmap data only . \n then we added the assumed katrin priors for @xmath1ev and @xmath2ev as explained in section [ sec : katrin ] . \n the results are summarized in figure [ fig:1 ] and table [ tab:1 ] . \n marginalized parameter distributions when using wmap data ( black solid lines ) , compared to the resulting distributions when adding katrin data with @xmath1ev ( red dashed lines ) and @xmath2ev ( blue dotted lines).,width=529 ]    .[tab:1]limits on cosmological parameters with different priors on the neutrino mass when using wmap data only . in the left column \n are the results from having no priors on @xmath11 ( black solid lines in figure [ fig:1 ] ) , the middle column shows the results when using the assumed katrin prior in the case of @xmath1ev ( red dashed lines in figure [ fig:1 ] ) , and the rightmost column gives the results with an assumed katrin prior for @xmath2ev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in this paper we have investigated whether constraints on @xmath0 from the katrin experiment will affect our knowledge on cosmological parameters . \n this has been done for two scenarios , one where @xmath1ev , and one where @xmath2ev . \n we have carried out the analysis both with a simple 7-parameter model with a cosmological constant , and extending the parameter space to include the equation of state for dark energy , @xmath29 , as a free parameter .    when using wmap data only , we find that knowledge from the katrin experiment will contribute significantly to constrain a wide range of cosmological parameters , regardless of which of the @xmath0 scenarios we use . \n for instance will the significance of @xmath3 depend on what katrin tells us about @xmath0 . \n other parameters that are sensitive to the value of @xmath0 are @xmath20 , @xmath4 , @xmath38 and @xmath32 .    adding more cosmological data sets , both from sn1a , galaxy catalogues and other priors , the situation changes a bit . in this case \n @xmath11 is strongly constrained from above by cosmology alone , such that an additional katrin prior in the case of @xmath1ev has little effect on our cosmological parameter constraints . however , \n if katrin measures a neutrino mass of @xmath2ev , there will be significant shifts in several of the parameter distributions . \n one should also note that several of the extra cosmological data sets added here may be affected by uncontrolled systematics ( see @xcite ) . \n therefore , having cosmological constraints from wmap+katrin without any additional cosmological data sets will be interesting regardless of the possibility to add other cosmological data sets to obtain similar results .    in the case of @xmath29 \n the most interesting result occurs in the scenario of a katrin defection of @xmath2ev and using the full range of data sets . in this case \n , @xmath50 is favored at a @xmath51 level . \n it should also be mentioned that there are degeneracies between parameters from different cosmological inflation models and neutrino masses ( see @xcite ) . \n this means that a katrin prior on @xmath11 will be important also for constraining inflationary models .    to conclude , we find that the expected limits on @xmath0 from katrin , will be a useful input to constrain cosmological models , regardless of the value of @xmath0 . \n if katrin detects a non - zero value of @xmath0 , this would be especially interesting . \n we wish to thank ole hst , klaus eitel and hans kristian eriksen for useful comments and suggestions . \n the work of e is supported by the research council of norway , project number 162830 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1276234385060, "RequestID": "8f5ecaf5ed634f8098804a627ede7a44", "TotalTokens": 4247}
{"ContextTokens": 2513, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "the principal way to trace molecular gas in galaxies is with the rotational lines of the co molecule , due to co s relatively high abundance ( about @xmath4 of h@xmath3 ) and low excitation requirements ( @xmath5 k ) . \n the high abundance of co generally makes it optically thick , especially in the lowest ( @xmath6 ) transition , with the result that the _ effective _ critical density is quite low , @xmath7 @xmath8 , and the excitation temperature @xmath9 approaches the kinetic temperature in most molecule - rich regions . unlike co , h@xmath3 itself has no permitted rotational transitions , and can only be observed in infrared ( quadrupolar or rovibrational ) lines that require more extreme ( @xmath10 k ) excitation conditions . \n the main disadvantage of co is that its high opacity makes it a poor tracer of column density . \n indeed , the theoretical basis for using co as a column density tracer is the _ virial hypothesis _ : the co emission comes from an ensemble of virialised clouds that do not shield each other in position - velocity space . for a virialised cloud , \n the size @xmath11 , density @xmath12 , and linewidth @xmath13 are related by : @xmath14 then the co luminosity is proportional to the h@xmath3 mass , assuming roughly constant density and temperature : @xmath15 however , the assumption of virial equilibrium in molecular clouds has been questioned ( e.g.  ballesteros - paredes & mac low 2002 ) , and in regions where co comes predominantly from a diffuse intercloud medium  as has been suggested for starburst galaxies ( solomon et al.1997 , downes & solomon 1998)the linearity between co emission and h@xmath3 column density is likely to break down . \n co is also not as self - shielding at h@xmath3 , and might be dissociated even in regions where h@xmath3 is present . \n finally , its abundance relative to h@xmath3 will vary according to the metallicity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and so it is unlikely to be detectable in very low metallicity regions . \n other methods to trace molecular gas include observations of far - infrared and submillimetre emission from dust , and ultraviolet ( uv ) h@xmath3 absorption towards continuum sources . \n dust emission is usually optically thin and depends only linearly on temperature in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum , although there are additional uncertainties arising from the adopted grain size distribution and gas - to - dust ratio . \n alton et al .  ( 2002 ) show that the 850@xmath16 m dust emission from the disk on ngc 6946 matches the co emission very well . \n the uv absorption technique is biased against high gas columns because of extinction , but does provide a powerful tool to study _ diffuse _ h@xmath3 . \n tumlinson et al .  ( \n 2002 ) find that the diffuse h@xmath3 fraction in the magellanic clouds is very low , @xmath11% compared to @xmath110% in the galaxy .    for the remainder of this paper , \n we assume that co can be used as a quantitative tracer of h@xmath3 within the disks of normal spiral galaxies . \n our general knowledge of the co distribution in galaxies is still based on the single - dish survey of some 300 galaxies conducted with the fcrao 14-m telescope ( young et al . \n 1995 ) . using multiple - pointing observations for 193 of the galaxies , \n young et al.concluded that co is usually peaked toward galaxy centres : only in 28 galaxies was there an indication of a molecular ring or off - centre co peak . at higher resolution , however , the picture is not so simple . \n the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ) , which imaged the distribution of co emission in 44 nearby spirals at 69  resolution and included single - dish data for full flux recovery , finds that the co distribution in spiral galaxies is generally very heterogeneous ( regan et al . \n 2001 , helfer et al . \n even when azimuthally averaged , large departures from a smooth exponential profile are seen , due to the very clumpy distribution of molecular gas ( which responds strongly to spiral arms , bar perturbations , etc . ) . in addition , only 20 of the 44 song galaxies exhibit their maximum co surface brightness within the central beamwidth , with six galaxies showing no detectable co emission at all in this region ( helfer et al . \n 2003 ) .    with the higher resolution imaging , the distributions of molecular gas and stars can be compared on scales relevant for studying the effects of internal dynamical processes . \n even though many galaxies in bima song do not show central co peaks , the majority do display a co excess in the inner @xmath120  above the exponential profile , where the stellar bulge contributes a similar excess to the stellar light profile ( regan et al . \n 2001 , thornley et al . \n representative profiles are shown in figure 1 . \n concentrating on the 27 bima song galaxies with the most extended co detections , thornley et al . \n ( 2003 ) have found that such co excesses occur in both early and late - type galaxies , and are nearly universal in galaxies with some bar contribution ( type sab or sb ) . \n this suggests that at least some of the central excesses are due to bar - driven inflow of molecular gas ( sakamoto et al .  1999 , \n sheth et al . \n however , roughly half of the selected galaxies without significant bar contributions also show such central excesses , suggesting that significant bars are not required to produce gas inflow . \n it is notable that the hi radial distribution is almost always much flatter than the co , and often shows a central depression , as if the atomic gas has undergone a phase transition to form h@xmath3 . \n recent comparisons of single - dish co maps and vla hi imaging by crosthwaite et al . \n ( 2001 , 2002 ) highlight this dichotomy . \n wong & blitz ( 2002 ) found that for seven galaxies with high - resolution co and hi data , the hi / co ratio increases with radius as roughly @xmath17 , consistent with being determined largely by the hydrostatic pressure of the ism , as predicted by elmegreen ( 1993 ) . in this interpretation \n , star formation is rarely found in low - pressure regions such as the halo or outer disk because the dominant phase of neutral gas there is atomic . \n the fcrao survey indicated that co emission scales roughly linearly with star formation tracers ( e.g. rownd & young 1999 ) except in merging or interacting galaxies ( young et al . \n 1996 ) , which show enhanced star formation rates . \n kennicutt ( 1998 ) , averaging co , hi , and h@xmath18 fluxes within the optical disks of 61 galaxies , found a strong correlation between the sfr and the total gas content , consistent with a schmidt ( 1959 ) law : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the surface densities of the star formation rate ( in @xmath22 ) and total gas mass ( in @xmath23 ) respectively . \n the correlation of sfr with hi or co individually was much poorer , suggesting that the gas involved in star formation can quickly cycle between atomic and molecular phases . \n how does the star formation law behave on smaller scales ? \n wong & blitz ( 2002 ) compared co , hi , and h@xmath18 emission in seven galaxies from the bima song sample , and found that the schmidt law continues to hold for azimuthally averaged rings spaced by @xmath11 kpc . \n the exact slope of the power law depends on how one chooses to correct for h@xmath18 extinction ; an extinction - free sfr indicator , such as the total ir emission ( kewley et al . \n 2002 ) might yield a more accurate slope than h@xmath18 . \n regardless , the correlation of sfr with co is considerably stronger than that with hi , as the hi profile is often declining or flat in the inner regions , whereas star formation is generally centrally peaked ( figure 2 ) . \n it is unclear whether the poor correlation of sfr with co found by kennicutt ( 1998 ) may be due to differences in galaxy selection , as the galaxies studied by wong & blitz ( 2002 ) are relatively strong co emitters . \n if sfr generally correlates with molecular rather than atomic gas , then the schmidt law index of @xmath21.5 may derive from a roughly linear relation between sfr and h@xmath3 coupled with a weak dependence of the molecular fraction @xmath24 on @xmath25 : @xmath26 this implies that star formation is a two - step process involving molecular cloud formation , and contrasts with the conventional interpretation that the index results from the free - fall ( dynamical ) time being the natural timescale for star formation : @xmath27 indeed , it has long been known that the star formation timescale is much longer than the free - fall time ; this inefficiency of star formation is reflected in the numerical factor in eq . \n [ obeqn ] and @xmath28 in eq . \n [ theqn ] . \n recently , two studies have tried to explain the observed schmidt law using the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) that results from interstellar turbulence , as revealed in simulations by ( e.g. ) wada & norman ( 2001 ) . \n elmegreen ( 2002 ) hypothesises that only that part of the density pdf above @xmath29 @xmath8 proceeds to form stars on a dynamical timescale , whereas kravtsov ( 2003 ) assumes a much lower critical density of 50 @xmath8 but a much longer star formation timescale of 4 gyr . in both cases , \n the presence of a critical density ensures that only a small fraction of the galactic gas is involved in star formation at a given time . \n detailed case studies of nearby galaxies such as m33 and the lmc may be able to shed further light on this issue . \n we thank eva schinnerer for providing the iram pdb image of ngc 4736 used in the talk , and leo blitz for extensive discussions over the past few years on many of the topics covered here . \n this work was supported by a bolton fellowship awarded to t.w . by the csiro atnf .", "StartTimeOffset": 1278280975859, "RequestID": "fd77efc09dc64c6dbcad61891a2df1a1", "TotalTokens": 2741}

tri ] and  [ band - tri ] , we also observe that the position of the gap in the transmission spectra , which are obtained for plane electromagnetic waves incident normally on the phc , agree very well with the position of the gaps in the frequency band structure of the corresponding infinite crystal along the @xmath4 direction ( denoted by red regions ) . \n when increasing the refractive index of the liquid [ going from panel ( a ) toward panel ( f ) ] , the high - frequency band - gap edge is significantly downward shifted , while the low - frequency band - gap edge slightly decreases . \n we emphasize that all results obtained from band structures are consistent with those from the transmission spectra . \n the sensitivity of this structure is mainly attributed to the strong dispersion of the phc mode . \n figures  [ field](a ) and  [ field](b ) show the first and second phc bloch modes at the band - gap edge ( @xmath21 point , @xmath22 ) , where air holes in the phc are filled by the liquid with a refractive index of @xmath7 , @xmath23,and @xmath24 , respectively . as seen \n , the low - frequency band - edge bloch mode hardly changes with varying refractive index of the liquid . \n however , for the high - frequency band - edge mode , the ratio of the energy in holes becomes lager as the refractive index of the liquid increases , i.e. , this mode distribution is strongly dependent on the refractive index of the liquid , which is in agreement with the results in figs . \n [ trans - tri]-[band - tri ] . \n a somewhat similar structure has been realized experimentally by okamoto _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite , but in this paper we have studied the shift for the band - gap edges in details an offered a physical explanation for the shifts . besides , compared to the device in ref . \n @xcite , our proposed device offers a better resolution . \n let us next consider a square phc with dielectric rods in air , as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - squ ] . \n the permittivity of the rods is @xmath1 , and the radius of the rods is r=0.2a . \n transmission spectra are shown in fig . \n [ trans - squ ] , where the background of the phc is filled by different liquids . \n the band - gap edge as a function of the refractive index of the liquid is shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - squ ] . \n similar to the result shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - tri ] , the low - frequency band - gap edge hardly changes as the refractive index of the liquid increases , while the high - frequency band - gap edge is strongly dependent on the liquid . \n compared with the result for the high - frequency band - gap edge shown in fig . \n [ bandedge - tri ] , the results in fig . \n [ bandedge - squ ] illustrate a higher sensitivity . \n the high - frequency band - gap edge shifts @xmath25 when the air holes are filled by a liquid of index @xmath12 . for comparison \n we have @xmath10 for the structure shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - tri ] . \n band structures are shown in fig . \n [ band - squ ] , where red regions represent the band gap for @xmath26 direction . from fig . \n [ trans - squ ] and fig . \n [ band - squ ] , we find that the position of the gap in the transmission spectra agree very well with the position of the gaps for the phc along the @xmath4 direction . when increasing the refractive index of the liquid [ going from panel ( a ) toward panel ( f ) ] , \n the high - frequency band - gap edge is significantly downward shifted , while the low - frequency band - gap edge slightly decreases . \n again we consider a commercial silicone fluid with a calibrated refractive - index accuracy of @xmath14 . for the working wavelength around @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the mode - gap edge shifts up to 1.60  nm for @xmath0 . \n the proposed biosensor relies strongly on the dispersion of the phc band - edge mode and the presence of a band gap . \n to further improve the sensitivity , we optimize the phc structure by varying the radius of the rods . by a careful design of the structure shown in the inset of fig . \n [ trans - squ ] , we have been able to improve the design further . for the working wavelength around @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the band - gap edge shifts about 1.8  nm for @xmath0 , when @xmath27 is tuned to @xmath28 . \n compared to the biosensor we proposed before  @xcite , this structure not only shows much better sensitivity but it also seems relatively easy to realize experimentally , since the design involves no cavities or waveguide structures . \n finally , this device , with a size of @xmath29 , is sufficiently compact for most applications . \n to conclude , we have theoretically studied optofluidic biosensors based on highly dispersive 2d photonic crystal . \n our study shows that these structures are strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the liquid , which is used to tune dispersion of photonic crystal . for the working wavelength around @xmath30 , \n we predict shifts in the band - gap edge up to 1.8  nm for @xmath0 . \n although our study is based on 2d photonic crystals , it can be extended to the case of a 2d photonic crystal slab . for a 2d photonic crystal slab \n , the field will attenuate due to out - of - plane loss , but the shift of the high - frequency mode - gap edge at x / m point ( when tuning by liquid ) is unaffected by the out - of - plane radiation . \n the high sensitivity makes such devices interesting for biochemical sensing applications . \n this work is financially supported by the _ danish council for strategic research _ through the _ strategic program for young researchers _ ( grant no : 2117 -

{"ContextTokens": 3846, "GeneratedTokens": 151, "SynthesizedBody": "how many data points can be missed off ( set to zero ) from a 1-d discrete , regularly spaced time series record and still be recoverable ? \n such a question is prompted by many situations , often associated to the automated collection of data . \n we are motivated to address this question by our experimental field work to record the behaviour of the strength of optical turbulence parameter , @xmath0 , over time intervals of several weeks , under different climate conditions @xcite . \n the data of interest to us are path integrated measures of @xmath0 measured across the visible to near infrared region . \n the measurement path is a 600 m stretch of free space , approximately 1.5 m altitude above sea water in the caribbean . \n the probe beam originated from an led centered on 0.9 @xmath1 m ; the instrumentation are two identical optical scientific inc . \n loa-004 systems , which employ aperture averaging to estimate the value of @xmath0 . \n the loa-004s are generally left unattended over the course of up to a few days during field operation , which mean that they are susceptible to spurious events which result in gaps in the data record . \n although for some types of data analysis techniques , data gaps of a limited size can be tolerated , this is not universal . \n moreover , there exists a new class of very powerful techniques based on empirical mode decomposition @xcite that are exceedingly sensitive to lossy datasets . \n it is for this reason we are exploring different methodologies to synthetically fill the data holes ; we describe the results from our studies using principal component analysis in this paper . \n the principal components of any ensemble can be used to identify the members of that ensemble . \n this idea forms the foundation of face recognition and tracking through _ eigenfaces _ ( see , for example , turk and pentland 1991 @xcite ) . we may extend this method to reconstruct the missing data for any data record under given restrictions . \n the key point is that the gappy data record must have the same , or similar , salient features as all the members of the ensemble . \n the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data and represent the features of the dataset . provided that a reference library can be created \n , each member of the library will contribute to each eigenvector , more or less . \n as such , each member can be exactly represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors . \n any similar data record external to the library will also be represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors , within a margin of error . \n the first step for the filling procedure must therefore be to define the reference library . \n we may do so by collecting a family of turbulence data series that share certain specific characteristics ; a difficult task since the definition of such is an open question . \n moreover , since the mean value of the family of reference data plays a key part , all the members of the library would require normalisation . again how to do this is an open question . \n alternatively we may use the neighbouring record around a data hole , sectioning this information to provide the ensemble members . \n we opt for the latter technique since the record pre and post the data hole ( within a certain time interval ) ought to be similar in nature to the missing data . \n the mean value of this type of library would probably not differ greatly from the mean of the missing data , so normalisation would not be so crucial . \n how does one determine the principal components of a reference library ? \n following sirovich and kirby @xcite , let the @xmath2 members ( each of length @xmath3 ) of the reference ensemble be @xmath4 . \n thus , the average data record of this ensemble will be @xmath5 it is very reasonable to assume that departures from the mean record will provide an efficient procedure for extracting the primary features of the data . \n therefore , we define @xmath6 now , if we consider the dyadic matrix @xmath7 where each term of the sum signifies a second rank tensor product , we can recognize this as the ensemble average of the two point correlation of the deviations from the mean . here , @xmath8 is the transpose of @xmath9 . \n we require eigenvectors @xmath10 of the matrix @xmath11 . for ensembles \n whose members have a large number of points @xmath12 , matrix @xmath11 issingular and its order can not exceed @xmath2 . \n to find those eigenvectors of @xmath11 corresponding to nonzero eigen values , turk and pentland used a standard singular value decomposition technique , as described below . \n @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the eigenvalues . \n this deduction can be equated to @xmath15 where @xmath16 . \n thus @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the same eigenvalues and their eigenvectors are related through @xmath16 , provided that @xmath19 . \n the treatment described is recognizable as the karhunen \n love ( kl ) method @xcite . \n the implication is that a dataset @xmath20 can be obtained from a limited summation @xmath21 where the coefficients @xmath22 are obtained through the inner product @xmath23 we emphasise that @xmath20 is not considered to be part of the @xmath24 , although it is similar in features . \n to demonstrate the validity of the assertion of the previous section , we take a perfect data record of @xmath0 measurements over a 7 hour period starting from midnight , smoothed by a forward moving rolling average of 5 minutes interval ( 60 data points ) . \n the data contain 2492 points in total . \n the test data , split into 21 sections . \n the data are padded before division with a set of points taken from the tail of the time series and mirrored outward . ] \n we split up the test data into 21 sections , where all but 1 are members of the reference library , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : cn2data ] . \n the exclusive section is set to zero , and the algorithm described in sec . [ \n sect : pca ] is employed on the 20 library elements . \n the reconstructions are created from the kl coeffiecients of the eigenvectors equivalent to the sections adjacent to the missing data . \n hence we will talk of a prior and posterior reconstruction meaning e.g. for omitted section 5 , we use for the prior the kl coefficient equivalent to section 4 and for the posterior reconstruction we use the coefficient equivalent to section 6 of the test data set . \n note that this does not reconstruct those sections , since the eigenvectors are generated from the entire reference library . \n the reconstructions shown in the left hand set of fig . \n [ fig : klresult ] represent the best level of error , while the right hand set shows the worst . \n it is clear that the greater the difference between the ( masked off ) original data section and its neighbours , the poorer the reconstruction will be . \n nevertheless , the reconstruction errors for the full set of test data are all 1 order of magnitude less than the mean value of the reconstruction and the original data segment . \n evidently the end points have not been synthesised to be continuous with the adjacent segments of the reference library signal , as can be seen from the error . \n a continuity condition in terms of the both the function and its derivative has to be imposed on both ends of the reconstructed segment in order to achieve smoothness . \n the most effective way to do so is currently being investigated . \n \\(a )   best and worst reconstruction result using pca for ( a ) section 5 and ( b ) section 13 respectively . \n the layout in each set is : ( top left ) segment prior to the selection . \n ( top middle ) the original selected data . \n ( top right ) segment after selection . \n ( centre left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient of eigenvector related to the prior segment and the original . \n the value shown is the mean absolute difference per pixel . \n ( centre right ) the ( prior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient related to the posterior segment and the original . \n ( bottom middle ) the ( posterior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom right ) the eigenvalue spectrum.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( b )   best and worst reconstruction result using pca for ( a ) section 5 and ( b ) section 13 respectively . \n the layout in each set is : ( top left ) segment prior to the selection . \n ( top middle ) the original selected data . \n ( top right ) segment after selection . \n ( centre left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient of eigenvector related to the prior segment and the original . \n the value shown is the mean absolute difference per pixel . \n ( centre right ) the ( prior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom left ) the difference between the reconstruction using the coefficient related to the posterior segment and the original . \n ( bottom middle ) the ( posterior ) reconstruction . \n ( bottom right ) the eigenvalue spectrum.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the eigenvalues determined through this method show a similar distribution in both cases , with minor variations only at the upper end of the spectrum , implying that the kl differences between best and worst section for reconstruction is not very large .      in the absence of a workable continuity condition \n , we present here the effects of crudely patching the data hole with reconstructions determined from the prior and posterior terms with respect to the gap . \n we apply the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) algorithm @xcite to the reconstructions . \n emd is a novel adaptive method for separating a nonlinear time series into components based on instantaneous frequency . \n basically it acts as a dyadic filter bank @xcite ; the set for the best reconstruction case are illustrated in figs . \n [ fig : emd ] . \n we refer to these sets as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n the original data s intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) and residuals ( set @xmath27 ) are also shown and for comparison , we present the effect of a simple minded linear interpolation between the endpoints of the known data on the imfs .    upon visual inspection , we see that the original data generates 9 components : 8 intrinsic modes and 1 residual ( the stopping criterion for our emd implementation is the same as in huang _ \n et al _ @xcite ) . \n on the other hand , the interpolated data have only 8 components . numbering the imfs from highest instantaneous frequency to lowest , \n starting from imf 1 , we can see by inspection that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are strongly similar to @xmath27 in imfs 4,5,6 and 7 . \n the differences appear in the higher frequency components , due to the discontinuity between the inserted segment and the unadulterated data . \n the endpoint discontinuities evidently modify the variances of imfs 1,2 and 3 , although it seems that they are only affected in the area local to the discontinuity , per imf .    by way of comparison , \n a linear interpolant between the edges of the known data show that there is contamination all through the imfs . \n it is so strong that imf 7 , which in the other sets clearly distinguishes the baseline rise and fall of the turbulence over the interval under study , is unable to pick out a clean pedestal .    [ \n cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we applied an arima(0,@xmath28,0 ) model to predict the behaviour of the final section of the split test data . \n the length of each section is 119 points long ; by basing the data behaviour on the previous 2373 points and by setting the difference operator to be @xmath29 we generated the imf results shown in fig . \n [ fig : emdarima ] .    as can be seen \n , the effect of the arima(@xmath30 ) extrapolation is to fill in the higher order imfs in a smooth fashion ( apparently , by visual inspection , imfs 5 to 8 are smoothly filled at the tail ) . \n it is only untrustworthy when considering the higher frequency components , because arima considers only the conditional first moment . \n note that the number of imfs and residual are the same as the unadulterated signal @xmath27 . \n we have discussed a data hole filling method for stochastic data , a necessary step to be able to use the new technique of empirical mode decomposition upon a time series record . \n the karhunen \n love eigenvectors from an ensemble of neighbouring sections of complete data around a data hole can be used to reconstruct the missing segment to a reasonable degree of accuracy , at least for the purposes of applying emd . \n we have shown that the edge continuity is important , although the effect of discontinuities is not universal through all the intrinsic modes of the data . \n the quality of the reconstruction is much better using pca than a simplistic linear interpolant ( or merely ignoring the data gap ) . \n we compared this to a simplified arima(0,@xmath28,0 ) model , which performed better than the linear interpolant but less effectively than the kl algorithm , disregarding edge effects .    in summary , \n when a data hole is present , merely ignoring the data hole or filling it with a linear interpolant is a poor technique from the point of view of emd . \n the result of doing so leads to leakage of spurious effects both laterally in time ( per imf ) and longitudinally across all the imfs . by reconstructing the datagap with arima(@xmath31 ) \n one can limit the leakage laterally and longitudinally , although the lowest imfs remain strongly contaminated with artificial structure . \n kl reconstruction limits the leakage best , and even without considering the continuity between the adjacent sections and the reconstructed datagap , it promises to provide the best reconstruction of the three methods described in this paper . \n f.  santiago , m.  p.  j.  l. chang , c.  o. font , e.  a. roura , c.  wilcox , and s.  r. restaino , `` low altitude horizontal scintillation measurements of atmospheric turbulence over the sea : experimental results , '' _ proc . \n spie _ * 6014 * , 2005 . \n c.  o. font , m.  p. j.  l. chang , e.  oh , and g.  c. gilbreath , `` humidity contribution to the refractive index structure function @xmath0 , '' in _ atmospheric propagation iii _ , c.  y. young and g.  c. gilbreath , eds . \n spie _ * 6215 * , 2006 . \n m.  p. j.  l. chang , c.  o. font , g.  c. gilbreath , and e.  oh , `` humidity s influence on visible region refractive index structure parameter @xmath0 , '' _ applied optics ( accepted ) , arxiv physics e - prints _ * physics/0606075 * , june 2006 . \n n.  e. huang , z.  shen , s.  r. long , m.  c. wu , h.  h. shih , q.  zheng , n .- c . \n yen , c.  c. tung , and h.  h. liu , `` the empirical mode decomposition and the hilbert spectrum for nonlinear and non - stationary time series analysis , '' _ proc . \n ser . a _ * 454 * , pp . \n 903995 , 1998 . \n h.  e. stanley , l.  a.  n. amaral , a.  l. goldberger , s.  havlin , p.  c. ivanov , and c .- k . \n peng , `` statistical physics and physiology : monofractal and multifractal approaches , '' _ physica a _ * 270 * , pp .  309324 , 1999 . \n m.  p. j.  l. chang , e.  a. roura , c.  o. font , e.  oh , and c.  gilbreath , `` applying the hilbert - huang decomposition to horizontal light propagation @xmath0 data , '' in _ advances in stellar interferometry , _ these proceedings _ _ , _ proc . \n spie _ * 6268 * , 2006 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1290446531333, "RequestID": "00c029b1259a4fc490f9e821bced0cc9", "TotalTokens": 3997}

{"ContextTokens": 3951, "GeneratedTokens": 211, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most prevalent methods for testing the fatigue properties of a material is to construct a constant amplitude strain - life curve . in this method , a sample \n is strained cyclically between two strain levels until failure . \n this test is performed on a number of identical samples at different strain magnitudes , and the results are plotted as a strain - life curve . \n this `` @xmath0 '' curve can be fitted to the basquin - manson - coffin , @xcite ( bmc ) equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is half of the strain range , @xmath3 is the elastic strain , @xmath4 is the plastic strain , @xmath5 is the fatigue strength coefficient , @xmath6 is the elastic modulus , @xmath7 is the fatigue strength exponent , @xmath8 is the fatigue ductility coefficient , @xmath9 is the fatigue ductility exponent , and @xmath10 is the number of reversals until failure . the low cycle fatigue regime is considered a product of plastic deformation , and the high cycle portion is related primarily to elastic deformation . \n this approach gives a reasonably accurate prediction of sample life at constant amplitude cyclic strains . \n however , parts in service are rarely subjected to idealized constant amplitude cyclic strains and instead undergo variable amplitude loading . the palmgren - miner ( pm ) \n rule is a widely used approach for predicting part lifetime under variable amplitude loading . \n this method hypothesizes that the damage caused by each stress state in a variable amplitude load history is a function of the number of times that the particular cyclic stress state occurs and the number of cycles it would take for the sample to fail from a constant amplitude history at that stress state .  @xcite mathematically the palmgren - miner rule is written , @xmath11 where the sum is taken over all stress states with @xmath12 denoting a particular state , @xmath13 is the number of cycles at the @xmath12th stress state , @xmath14 is the number of cycles to failure if the sample is cycled under constant amplitude loading at the @xmath12th stress state , and @xmath15 is a constant . \n based on the assumptions made by the model , @xmath15 should be @xmath16 ; experimentally it is found to range between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n this variability is evidence of the failure of the palmgren - miner rule to accurately predict fatigue lifetimes . \n although it is well known that the palmgren - miner rule is inaccurate , its conceptual simplicity and the minimal amount of data necessary for implementation makes it a popular method for estimating fatigue life . \n improving upon the palmgren - miner rule has been a major focus of researchers studying variable amplitude fatigue . \n a good review of cumulative damage and life prediction theories through the end of the last century is presented by fatemi and yang . \n @xcite . in recent years models \n have been developed based on a variety of techniques that couple theories of fracture mechanics and empirical observations . \n @xcite other methods take into account the residual stresses caused by the plasticity of the material at the crack tip , and crack tip closing phenomena . \n @xcite although these modeling methods are more accurate than the palmgren - miner rule , they require substantially more experimental data to fit the necessary parameters .    in this paper \n a new method , free of fitting parameters , is demonstrated for estimating strain life under variable amplitude loading . \n it is unique from other models in that the only data used for input is the constant amplitude strain - life curve and the cyclic stress - strain response . using this model it is possible to accurately predict the variable amplitude strain life of specimens using a relatively small amount of experimental data that can easily be generated . in the section following this introduction the analytical details of the model \n are presented . \n next the experimental procedure and model implementation are explained . in the results and discussion section the measured and predicted strain lifetimes \n are presented and compared . \n the theoretical lifetimes predicted from this model are compared to lifetime predictions presented in the literature . in the final section \n the paper is succinctly summarized . \n in this model the total damage , @xmath19 , is the sum of the damage of all reversals , @xmath20 , ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , @xmath23 in this definition @xmath20 is the normalized damage caused by the @xmath12th reversal and failure occurs when @xmath24 . \n the damage caused by each reversal is determined using the well - known constant amplitude strain - life relation . using this approach , \n the strain history is incorporated as damage accumulation . the damage accrued in each step \n is calculated using a relatively simple algorithm and constant amplitude strain - life data . \n following examples from ref . \n @xcite , the damage during fatigue is assumed to be due to a single critical crack propagating across the width of the specimen . a good description of the crack growth per reversal , for a constant amplitude strain , is given by the hyperbolic sine function . \n for a crack size , @xmath25 , the rate of crack tip advance , after @xmath26 reversals , can be written @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the total number of reversals to failure for the given strain amplitude , and @xmath28 is a scaling factor , which will be discussed in more detail later . eq . \n ( [ dadn ] ) is a natural expression of damage per reversal , and has the same functional form as has been used to describe changes in crack growth rates previously . \n @xcite it accurately reflects the phenomena in that during the initial stages of damage the rate of crack propagation is low and as damage is accrued the rate of crack growth increases . \n other expressions for the rate of crack tip advance , which are phenomenologically similar , are presented elsewhere and will not be discussed here . \n @xcite    using eq . \n ( [ dadn ] ) for damage , the normalized damage due to the @xmath12th reversal is expressed , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of reversals required to achieve the accumulated damage , @xmath19 , were the damage due to a constant amplitude strain range , @xmath31 . \n the number of reversals to failure at this constant strain range is @xmath10 . \n the denominator normalizes the damage per reversal such that at failure the total damage is 1 . \n the current state of damage , @xmath19 , is known and is expressed as the sum of incremental damage , @xmath20 , from eq . \n ( [ di ] ) , @xmath32 where @xmath30 is the number of damaging reversals to cause the damage @xmath19 at the constant amplitude strain @xmath2 . \n the summations in eqs . \n ( [ di ] ) and  ( [ dt ] ) can be approximated as integrals , which allows eq . \n ( [ dt ] ) to be solved to find @xmath33    the general approach for calculating a specimen life under variable amplitude loading goes as follows . \n begin by determining the initial total damage . \n this is typically near zero , if the part begins pristine and the strain - life curve is well defined at all strains of interest . \n a case for non - zero starting damage will be discussed later in section [ modelimplementation ] . \n the strain range for the first tensile reversal is @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is calculated using eq . \n ( [ di ] ) and the bmc relation , eq . \n ( [ bmc ] ) , which is fit to constant amplitude strain life data . \n the value of @xmath35 is added to @xmath19 . \n the next tensile strain is @xmath36 . \n the lifetime at this strain range along with @xmath19 , are used to calculate @xmath30 from eq . \n ( [ nt ] ) , which is used in eq . \n ( [ di ] ) to calculate @xmath37 , which is again added to @xmath19 . \n this process continues until @xmath24 , at which point failure is predicted . \n an algorithm for implementing this model is demonstrated in section [ modelimplementation ] . \n published experimental data are used to validate the model . \n @xcite pereira et al .  tested p355nl1 steel and compared their experimental results to an effective strain damage model based on the work of duquesnay . \n @xcite colin and fatemi published experimental data for 304l stainless steel and 7075 t6 aluminum . \n @xcite    the load histories used in the calculations were recreated from the descriptions detailed by pereira et al . , and colin and fatemi . \n @xcite the p355nl1 specimens were subjected to a variety of load blocks , including a high to low scheme , a low to high scheme , a low to high to low scheme , and random loading , examples of which are shown in figs . \n [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] . \n the 304l stainless steel fatigue - life results were prepared for periodic , fully - reversed overloads , shown in fig . \n [ fig5 ] , and random loading . \n the 7075 t6 aluminum samples were subjected to random loading . unlike the shaped loading blocks , the random load history was not reproduced from the literature , but instead a strain history file was created using a random number generator , filtering the random number stream to ensure that each iteration reversed the strain . a representative sample of the random reversal data is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] \n the model described in section [ model ] above was implemented using the algorithm detailed in this section and applied to the strain history data discussed in section [ experiment ] . \n to begin , the first two strains from the strain history were converted to stresses using the ramberg - osgood stress - strain relationship , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 were fit from the cyclic stress - strain behavior . \n the morrow mean stress correction @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean stress , was used to calculate @xmath43 . \n the value of @xmath43 was used with @xmath44 to calculate @xmath30 from eq . \n ( [ nt ] ) . \n finally , the damage from this reversal , @xmath20 , was determined from eq . \n ( [ di ] ) . \n the damage was added to the total damage , @xmath19 . \n if the total damage was greater than @xmath16 , then the specimen was deemed to have failed due to this reversal , otherwise the procedure was continued using the new value of @xmath19 and the next strain taken from the strain history . \n this was repeated until failure occurs , when @xmath45 . \n the constant @xmath28 , in eq .  ( [ dadn ] ) , appropriately scales the incremental damage . for this implementation \n it was selected to be @xmath46 , where @xmath47 was from the bmc equation and @xmath48 was taken as @xmath49 . in this way , @xmath28 scales with the applied strains and the incremental damage , @xmath50 , has the correct functional relationship to the strain amplitude .    the integrated @xmath50 curve , which expresses total damage as a function of the number of cycles , has a general shape that is well known . \n @xcite careful inspection of experimental data of damage as a function of number of cycles reveals that a smooth well fitting curve does not always intercept the damage axis at @xmath51 . in many experiments \n , damage has been observed to accumulate rapidly to around 5 to 10% early in the specimen s life , and then slow to the @xmath50 crack propagation model that is well known . \n @xcite to account for the rapid damage accumulation that occurs during the initial cycling , the starting damage was assigned to be @xmath52 for all of the variable amplitude lifetime prediction data presented here . \n a comparison of the published experimental data and the predictions of this work can be seen in figs . \n [ fig6][fig10 ] . in figs .  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] the experimental data for p355nl1 steel , from pereira et al . , is shown for a maximum strain of 1.05% and 2.10% for the loading blocks discussed in section [ experiment ] above . \n @xcite the experimental results are compared to those predicted from the present model in addition to the model of pereira and duquesnay . \n the current model is in good agreement with both the experimental and theoretical results from peirera et al . \n the experimental results from colin and fatemi for 304l stainless steel are shown in figs . \n [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] for the loading blocks discussed above at various strain ranges . \n @xcite the results for 7075 t6 aluminum are shown in fig . \n [ fig10 ] . \n the accuracy of the present model is compared to the predictions of the palmgren - miner rule both with and without the smith - watson - topper correction . \n the current model is again in good agreement with the experimental results . \n it is worth noting that the model presented here agrees with the experimental data both when the palmgren - miner results are non - conservative by an order of 2 or 3 and when they agree well with experiment . \n this is evidence that the results form the current work are more profound than a simple lifetime reduction from the palmgren - miner rule . \n the strength of the present model is due to the natural inclusion of the strain history when determining the inflicted damage caused by a strain reversal . \n both the effect of the immediately preceding strain and the effect of the relative age of a specimen are included . to calculate @xmath53 a strain and the immediately preceding strain \n must be known to determine the applied strain range and the mean stress correction . \n the damage inflicted by a particular strain reversal depends not only on the amplitude , but also on the total state of damage at the instant of the reversal . \n take the example of a periodic , fully - reversed , overload . \n if one considers the integrated @xmath50 curve for a constant amplitude cyclic strain , applying a fully reversed overload would advance the position of the subsequent constant amplitude reversals on this curve substantially . from the shape of the curve \n , it is apparent that an overload early in the specimen s life that increments the damage will have a more substantial impact on the specimen s total life , compared to an overload applied later . \n the more recent models , such as those of @xcite , include residual strains and crack - tip plasticity or crack tip closure phenomena . \n these models account for the cumulative damage through localized plasticity near the crack tip , or a change in the effective stresses due to crack tip closure . \n they are more accurate than the palmgren - miner model and other simple models because they account for the ordering of the applied strains and localized damage near the crack tip ; however , they require substantial experimental support . by comparison , \n the present model only includes materials information from the cyclic stress - strain curve and the constant amplitude strain life curve . \n it should be noted that for some analysis involving extreme load cases , a more sophisticated model than the one presented here may be necessary . in particular , cases where residual plasticity will play a dominant role in crack growth rates through strain hardening and residual stresses will likely require a model that explicitly deals with plasticity near the crack tip . \n one of the greatest engineering challenges of the last @xmath54 years is that of predicting the strain - life relationships of mechanical components undergoing variable amplitude loading . in spite of extensive studies , \n no conclusive model has been determined . \n although many useful models have been developed , many require cumbersome amounts of experimental data . here \n we report a new method , free of fitting parameters , for making an accurate variable amplitude strain - life prediction using basic constant amplitude fatigue data . \n the method is validated using data from experiments performed on p355nl1 steel , 304l stainless steel , and 7075 t6 aluminum . \n @xcite the present model fits the experimental data well for a variety of load spectra and materials and the algorithm is simple to implement . \n the authors gratefully acknowledge funding from john deere & company . \n 22 natexlab#1#1[2]#2 , , , , . , , , . \n , , . , , ( ) . \n , , , ( ) . , , , , ( ) . \n , , , ( ) . , , , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) . \n , , , , ( ) . , , , , , , ( ) . , , , , ( ) . \n , , , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) . \n , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) . \n , , , ( ) . \n , , , , , . \n , , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1313875369353, "RequestID": "c86322811150425f9820977852d5bf49", "TotalTokens": 4162}
{"ContextTokens": 2394, "GeneratedTokens": 63, "SynthesizedBody": "in the era of the lhc and in preparation for the ilc there is need for multi - loop calculations to match the precision of these experiments from the theory side . \n the classes of problems currently accessible reach from multi - leg multi - scale problems at one - loop up to no - scale propagator , and tadpole diagrams at four - loop level . \n many problems fall into these categories directly while others can be cast into the required form by appropriate expansions in small parameters . \n a typical multi - loop calculation proceeds as follows : the needed diagrams are generated and if necessary expanded to decrease the difficulty of the problem . \n the resulting feynman integrals are then reduced to a small set of simpler integrals , which have to be calculated in a further step . while the reduction of the integrals can be automatized completely and \n is mostly independent of the problem at hand , the calculation of the remaining integrals must still be done manually for every calculation . in the following we give a brief review of the current status of the reduction to master integrals which with recent developments is now in a good shape such that the calculation of the master integrals now again poses the most difficulties in multi - loop calculations . \n one of the main ingredients of many multi - loop calculations are the so - called integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities @xcite @xmath0 which hold in dimensional regularization . here \n we consider typical feynman integrals , where @xmath1 are loop and @xmath2 are external momenta . \n these identities can be used to relate different integrals . using these relations the full set of needed integrals , which can be of the order of @xmath3 integrals , \n can be reduced to a small set of so - called master integrals . in a typical calculation there \n appear @xmath4 master integrals , which remain to be calculated directly . \n another main advantage of the reduction to master integrals is that many properties like gauge invariance can be checked on the level of master integrals , since these are linearly independent .    to make use of the ibp identities the laporta algorithm @xcite , a gauss - elimination - like algorithm , is frequently used . in order to use the laporta algorithm \n , one has to choose an ordering to ensure that more difficult integrals are expressed through simpler ones . \n once this ordering has been chosen the algorithm proceeds as follows : choose a set of integrals , which you like to solve ; pick an integral from the set and generate an ibp ; solve for the most difficult integral in the equation and continue with the next ibp or integral . \n the system of equations will become overdetermined if one chooses a sufficiently large set of integrals , since there are @xmath5 ibp identities generated by a given integral , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number of loops and legs , respectively . \n although this method has been successfully applied in many calculations it has some drawbacks . \n the complexity of the laporta algorithm is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of equations . in combination with the combinatorial properties of the problem \n this leads to fast growth of the size of the problem to be solved . furthermore in typical applications \n the system of equations is overdetermined by a factor 3 - 5 , so quite some time is spent just checking that the system of equations is consistent . \n a different approach for solving the set of ibp identities is provided by groebner bases . \n groebner bases arose in the context of ideals of rings over multivariate polynomials . \n more precisely , they were introduced while trying to solve the problem , how to decide if a certain polynomial belongs to an ideal of a ring of polynomials . \n an ideal @xmath10 is a subset of the ring @xmath11 such that for every @xmath12 , the product is an element of @xmath10 , @xmath13 . \n an ideal can be generated by a set of polynomials @xmath14 using @xmath15 . given these generating polynomials , \n the question whether a given polynomial @xmath16 is an element of the ideal , can easily be answered in the case of univariate polynomials , where the operation of polynomial division is unambiguous . \n if the polynomial division by the generating polynomials leaves no remainder , @xmath17 is an element of the ideal . \n this statement does no longer hold , when dealing with multivariate polynomials . here \n the remainder of multivariate divisions by multiple polynomials depends on the chosen ordering of the polynomials . \n therefore if the remainder of such divisions is not zero one may not conclude that the polynomial is not an element of the ideal .    at this point \n groebner bases prove very useful since a multivariate division with respect to elements of a groebner basis is again unambiguous . \n this leads to one of the definitions of a groebner basis : a set @xmath18 is a groebner basis if the reduction , i.e. multivariate division , of any @xmath19 with respect to the elements of @xmath20 yields the same remainder independent of the chosen order . using the buchberger algorithm a groebner basis \n can be constructed from any set of polynomials generating the ideal . \n this knowledge can be used for the solution of the ibp - identities . for this purpose \n the ibp identities have to be written in terms of shift operators @xcite or differential operators @xcite . \n the ibp relations then form a left - ideal in the now non - commutative ring of shift operators for which a groebner basis has to be constructed . \n every integral can be obtained by applying shift operators to a basis integral , i.e. , @xmath21 . since every element @xmath17 of the ring can be expressed in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 the integral can be reduced via @xmath24 , since @xmath25 and therefore @xmath26 . \n although this procedure does , in principle , generate a reduction of any integral there are still some problems . the buchberger algorithm is guaranteed to generate a basis but it might need a very long time and a lot of resources . in practice \n there is no implementation of the buchberger algorithm which succeeds in constructing a basis for non - trivial problems . \n furthermore , as can be checked in simple cases , the application of groebner bases to the reduction problem does not yield the minimal number of master integrals that can be reached using a laporta - like kind of reduction method .    to circumvent the problematic issues of the groebner basis approach , \n a modification of the buchberger algorithm has been introduced to construct so - called s - bases . unfortunately in this approach \n the construction of a basis is no longer guaranteed to succeed and is highly dependent on the chosen ordering . \n for certain topologies a basis can not be found and therefore the method can not be applied . in this cases a conventional laporta approach still has to be used in the sectors where no basis can be found . \n as an example for the power of the methods outlined in the previous section we present the calculation of the second moment of the vector correlator at @xmath27 and its application to the determination of the charm and bottom quark masses from experimental data .    the charm and bottom masses can be extracted from the @xmath11-ratio @xmath28 @xcite . \n the extraction of the quark masses can be done by considering the moments @xmath29 of the ratio defined by @xmath30 these moments are related to the taylor coefficients @xmath31 of the low energy expansion of the heavy quark current correlator @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vacuum polarization function of the photon @xmath34 with the heavy quark current @xmath35 . \n these theoretical moments can be calculated in an expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath36 in perturbative qcd @xmath37 to perform the calculation the initially present propagator - type diagrams are expanded in @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the external photon momentum and @xmath40 the mass of the heavy quark . \n this expansion leads to tadpole diagrams to which the techniques presented in the previous section can be applied . \n the taylor coefficients have been calculated at @xmath41 , i.e. three - loop order , in @xcite . at four loops the first moment has been calculated in @xcite and the second moment in @xcite , see @xcite for higher moments for purely fermionic contributions . using the second moment the analysis presented in @xcite , see also @xcite , can be upgraded to include the now complete knowledge of the second moment . using this newly available information the error of the bottom quark mass can be reduced to obtain @xmath42 which has to be compared with old value of @xmath43 in the case of the charm quark one finds @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 even though the shift in the absolute value is quite small the error gets reduced by around 25% .    since the different moment weights the experimental input differently precise knowledge of the second moment allows for a consistency check of the method used for the extraction of the quark masses . especially in the case of the bottom quark the second moment \n is favored over the first one since it is more sensitive to the threshold region and the narrow resonances . \n we presented a short review of the current status of an integral part of multi - loop calculations , namely the reduction to master integrals . using recent groebner basis inspired methods in combination with laporta - like approaches \n most reduction problems can be solved in an efficient way and the most problematic part is again the calculation of the master integrals . as an example we presented the calculation of the second moment of the heavy quark current correlator at four - loop order and its application to the extraction of the charm- and bottom - quark masses from experimental data . \n a.  v.  smirnov , arxiv:0807.3243 [ hep - ph ] . \n o.  v.  tarasov , acta phys . \n b * 29 * ( 1998 ) 2655 [ arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3077, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "the production of lepton pairs in hadron collisions @xmath3 proceeds through an intermediate virtual photon and its subsequent leptonic decay . \n traditionally , interest in this drell - yan process has concentrated on lepton pairs with large mass @xmath0 which allows for the application of perturbative qcd and the extraction of the antiquark density in the proton @xcite . \n prompt photon production @xmath4 can be calculated in perturbative qcd if the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the photon is sufficiently large . \n this process then provides essential information on the gluon density in the proton at large @xmath5 @xcite . \n unfortunately , it suffers from considerable fragmentation , isolation , and intrinsic transverse momentum uncertainties . \n alternatively , the gluon density can be constrained from the production of jets with large transverse momentum at hadron colliders @xcite , which however suffers from ambiguous information coming from different experiments and colliders .    in this paper \n we demonstrate that , like prompt photon production , lepton pair production is dominated by quark - gluon scattering in the region @xmath2 . \n this leads to sensitivity to the gluon density in kinematical regimes that are accessible both at collider and fixed target experiments while eliminating the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .    in sec . \n [ sec:2 ] , we briefly discuss the relationship between virtual and real photon production in hadron collisions in next - to - leading order qcd . in sec . \n [ sec:3 ] we present our numerical results , and sec .  [ sec:4 ] contains a summary . \n in leading order ( lo ) qcd , two partonic subprocesses contribute to the production of virtual and real photons with non - zero transverse momentum : @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n the cross section for lepton pair production is related to the cross section for virtual photon production through the leptonic branching ratio of the virtual photon @xmath8 . \n the virtual photon cross section reduces to the real photon cross section in the limit @xmath9 . \n the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections arise from virtual one - loop diagrams interfering with the lo diagrams and from real emission diagrams . at this order \n processes with incident gluon pairs @xmath10 , quark pairs @xmath11 , and non - factorizable quark - antiquark @xmath12 processes contribute also . \n singular contributions are regulated in @xmath13 dimensions and removed through @xmath14 renormalization , factorization , or cancellation between virtual and real contributions . \n an important difference between virtual and real photon production arises when a quark emits a collinear photon . \n whereas the collinear emission of a real photon leads to a @xmath15 singularity that has to be factorized into a fragmentation function , the collinear emission of a virtual photon gives a finite logarithmic contribution since it is regulated naturally by the photon virtuality @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath9 the nlo virtual photon cross section reduces to the real photon cross section if this logarithm is replaced by a @xmath15 pole . \n a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite . \n the situation is completely analogous to hard photoproduction where the photon participates in the scattering in the initial state instead of the final state . for real photons , \n one encounters an initial - state singularity that is factorized into a photon structure function . for virtual photons , \n this singularity is replaced by a logarithmic dependence on the photon virtuality @xmath0 @xcite . \n in this section we present numerical results for the production of lepton pairs in @xmath16 collisions at the tevatron with center - of mass energy @xmath17 and 2.0 tev and in @xmath18 collisions at fixed target experiments with @xmath19 gev . \n we analyze the invariant cross section @xmath20 averaged over the rapidity interval -1.0 @xmath21 1.0 at the tevatron and averaged over the scaled longitudinal momentum interval 0.1 @xmath22 0.3 at fixed target experiments . \n we integrate the cross section over various intervals of @xmath0 and plot it as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath1 . \n our predictions are based on a nlo qcd calculation @xcite and are evaluated in the @xmath14 renormalization scheme . \n the renormalization and factorization scales are set to @xmath23 . \n if not stated otherwise , we use the cteq4 m parton distributions @xcite and the corresponding value of @xmath24 in the two -

gluon resummation formalism and is shown in the dashed curve in fig . \n [ fig:3 ] @xcite . \n the resummed result can be expanded in a power series in @xmath25 asymptotically around @xmath42 . \n its nlo component ( dotted curve ) can then be matched to the perturbative result ( dot - dashed curve ) @xcite . from fig . \n [ fig:3 ] it becomes clear that resummation is not needed and fixed order perturbation theory can be trusted when @xmath2 . \n unfortunately , the data from e772 do not extend into this region . \n however , the cross section should be measurable in forthcoming experiments down to @xmath31 pb / gev@xmath32 , _ \n i.e. _ out to at least @xmath43 gev or @xmath44 where the gluon density is poorly constrained now .    in fig . \n [ fig:4 ] we demonstrate that in fixed target experiments also the    ( 7.6,10.5 )    lepton pair cross section is dominated by quark - gluon scattering at the level of 80 % once @xmath45 . the results in fig . \n [ fig:4 ] also prove that subprocesses other than those initiated by the @xmath38 and @xmath46 initial channels are of negligible import . \n we will now turn to a previously unpublished study of the sensitivity of collider and fixed target experiments to the gluon density in the proton . \n the full uncertainty in the gluon density is not known . here \n we estimate this uncertainty from the variation of different recent parametrizations . \n we choose the latest global fit by the cteq collaboration ( 5 m ) as our point of reference @xcite and compare it to their preceding analysis ( 4 m @xcite ) and to a fit with a higher gluon density ( 5hj ) intended to describe the cdf ( and d0 ) jet data at large transverse momentum . \n we also compare to global fits by mrst @xcite , who provide three different sets with a central , higher , and lower gluon density , and to grv98 @xcite . for this study \n we update the tevatron center - of - mass energy to run ii conditions ( @xmath47 tev ) which increases the invariant cross section for the production of lepton pairs with mass 5 gev @xmath48 6 gev by 5 % at low @xmath49 gev and 20 % at high @xmath50 gev .    in fig . \n [ fig:5 ] we plot the cross section for lepton pairs between the    ( 7.6,10.5 )    @xmath28 and @xmath29 resonances at run ii of the tevatron which should be measurable up to at least @xmath33 gev ( @xmath51 ) . for the cteq parametrizations \n we find that the cross section increases from 4 m to 5 m by 2.5 % ( @xmath52 gev ) to 5 % ( @xmath53 gev ) and from 5 m to 5hj by 1 % in the whole @xmath1-range . \n the largest differences to cteq5 m are obtained with grv98 at low @xmath1 ( minus 10 % ) and with mrst(g@xmath54 ) at large @xmath1 ( minus 7% ) .    a similar analysis for conditions as in fermilab s e772 experiment is shown in fig . \n [ fig:6 ] . \n ( 7.6,10.5 )    in fixed target experiments one probes substantially larger regions of @xmath55 than in collider experiments . \n therefore one expects a much larger sensitivity to the gluon distribution in the proton . \n indeed we find that cteq5hj increases the cross section by 7 % ( 26 % ) w.r.t . \n cteq5 m at @xmath56 gev ( @xmath57 gev ) and even by 134 % at @xmath53 gev . for mrst(g@xmath58 ) \n the cteq5 m cross section drops by 17 % , 40 % , and 59 % at these three values of @xmath1 . \n in summary , we have demonstrated that the production of drell - yan pairs with low mass and large transverse momentum is dominated by gluon initiated subprocesses . in contrast to prompt photon production , uncertainties coming from fragmentation , isolation , and intrinsic transverse momentum are absent . \n the hadroproduction of low mass lepton pairs is therefore an advantageous source of information on the gluon density in the proton at large @xmath5 in collider experiments and even more in fixed target experiments . \n massive lepton pair production data could provide new insights into the parametrization and size of the gluon density . \n it is a pleasure to thank l.e . \n gordon for his collaboration . \n mcgaughey _ et al . _ \n [ e772 collaboration ] , phys . rev . * \n d50 * ( 1994 ) 3038 . \n the normalization of the published data seems incorrect . \n we have multiplied the published cross sections by a factor 3.7 , consistent with information provided to us by j.  moss ( private communication ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1327558808545, "RequestID": "5cd1c7e87ce745218e060a759ea389a4", "TotalTokens": 3219}

mcdermid et al . \n 2004 ; emsellem et al . 2004 \n ; see also r. mcdermid s contribution in this workshop ) .    here \n we focus on the distribution and kinematics of the ionised gas of a subset of galaxies to illustrate the diversity of structures and ionisation processes present in the ` sauron `  representative sample of 48 elliptical and lenticular galaxies . \n the sample contains an equal fraction of elliptical and lenticular galaxies , with equal number of field and cluster galaxies in each morphological group . \n we will make use of the two - dimensional information delivered by ` sauron `  to compare the distribution and kinematics of the stars and gas and to study the nature and origin of the ionised gas in these systems . \n a more extended analysis of the properties of the ionised gas for the entire sample is presented in sarzi et al . \n furthermore , the study of the stellar and gas properties of the 24 sa bulges in the ` sauron `  sample is addressed in falcn - barroso et al . \n early - type galaxies were traditionally thought to be uniform stellar systems with little or no gas and dust . however , a considerable number of imaging and spectroscopy studies have changed this view ( sadler & gerhard 1985 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ; goudfrooij 1999 ; tran et al 2001 ) . in the spectral range delivered by ` sauron `  there are three potential emission lines that can be measured ( i.e. , @xmath04959 , 5007 , @xmath05198,5200 ) . \n given that the stellar contribution to the overall spectrum in our sample of galaxies remains significant , it is important to perform an accurate continuum subtraction in order to determine reliably the fluxes and kinematics of the emission lines . \n we investigated several methods to perform this task and settled on a procedure that _ simultaneously _ fits both the stellar and gaseous contributions to derive the fluxes , velocities and velocity dispersions of the emission lines.-1    traditional methods to separate the stars and gas consisted of the subtraction of the best matching stellar template , in the regions free of emission , to the full spectrum of the galaxy . \n as described in sarzi et al . \n ( 2005 ) , this methodology can significantly overestimate the flux and velocity dispersion of the measured emission lines . \n extensive simulations show that the new procedure is much more accurate and appears to be superior to previous ones , allowing us to detect emission down to an equivalent width of 0.1  . \n the distribution of the ionised gas in our sample shows diverse morphologies . in general \n the distribution follows that of the stars , although there are several cases where the situation is much more complex ( i.e. filaments , rings , spiral arms , lanes ) . \n the incidence of ionised - gas emission in our sample is 75% . \n seven galaxies show only weak traces of emission , and there are five cases with no detection . by morphological type \n , lenticular galaxies display a slightly higher content of ionised gas than elliptical galaxies ( 83% versus 66% ) . \n similar percentages were found when the sample was divided according to environment ( 83% field , 66% cluster ) . \n one important remark is that the fraction of galaxies with clearly detected emission in the virgo cluster drops to only 55% ( 10/18 ) , with just 3/9 ellipticals showing the presence of gas . \n the incidence of ionised - gas shows no correlation with either luminosity or the presence of a bar in the galaxy . \n the detection rates found for our sample are in good agreement with those of macchetto et al . \n ( 1996 ) , who found emission in 85% of the lenticular and 68% of the ellipticals in their sample .    in figure  [ fig2 ] \n , we present maps of the stellar and ionised - gas distribution and kinematics for four of the 48 galaxies in our sample . \n ngc2974 reveals a fast rotating gas disk co - rotating with respect to the stars . despite the regular appearance of the ionised - gas distribution , the equivalent width ( ew ) map of the  line \n ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) highlights the presence of an inner ring and two spiral arms that extend all the way out to the limits of our field - of - view ( see krajnovi ' c et al . \n 2005a for a detailed analysis of this galaxy using ` sauron `  data ) . \n a similarly regular case is that of ngc4526 , although in this case the ionised gas is confined to a well defined , fast rotating disk in the central kpc of the galaxy . \n ngc2768 is a well - known galaxy where the distribution of the ionised - gas appears to be perpendicular to that of its stellar counterpart ( i.e. polar - ring , fried & illingworth 1994 ; bertola et al . \n the ` sauron `  ew map shows that the gas distribution has a filamentary morphology along the galaxy minor axis . \n the gas distribution in ngc4278 displays a peculiar integral - sign pattern that is closely followed by the gas velocity field . \n the stellar and gas kinematics appear to be misaligned by increasingly wider angles , as they twist in opposite directions towards the outer parts of the field - of - view . \n diagnostic diagrams of /  vs /  ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; kauffmann et al . \n 2003 ) have been used extensively in the past to investigate the trigger of the ionisation of the gas ( i.e. agn , star - formation ) . \n many scenarios have been invoked to explain the presence of ionised gas in early - type galaxies : central agn , hot ( @xmath1k ) gas ( sparks et al . \n 1989 ; de jong et al . 1990 ) , young stars ( shields 1992 ) , post - agb stars ( binette et al . 1994 ) , or shocks ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) . within the wavelength range delivered by ` sauron `  only the  and  lines can be used for this purpose . despite this limitation \n , the /  ratio serves as a good indicator to locate regions where emission is due to young stars and also to trace variations of the ionisation mechanisms within a single galaxy . \n regions displaying low /  ratios ( i.e. @xmath21 ) are usually interpreted as indicative of star - formation ( ho et al . 1997 ) . \n however , higher ratios ( i.e. @xmath31 ) could still indicate star - formation if the metallicity of the gas is sufficiently high ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . additionally other mechanisms can lead to high ratios . since it is unlikely that the metallicity of the ionised gas varies abruptly within galaxies ( unless there has been some recent accretion of material ) , large variations across maps of the /  ratio are more likely to be produced by changes in the ionisation mechanism rather than changes in the metallicity . \n figure  [ fig2 ] shows the /  ratios for the galaxies discussed in section  [ sec : distrib ] . \n the /  ratio maps clearly reveal the presence of radial gradients and substructures in the ionisation properties of the gas in the four galaxies . \n the ratio is moderately high in ngc2768 , ngc2974 , and ngc4278 , while it is very low in ngc4526 . in this last galaxy \n , the location of the low /  values corresponds to the location of a prominent dust disk ( as shown in the unsharp - masked image ) , and suggests ongoing star formation . in this respect , there seems to be a clear link between the ionised structures found in the /  maps with those seen in the  equivalent width and kinematic maps ( i.e. ring in ngc2974 , or integral - sign pattern in ngc4278 ) . \n the remaining sample of 44 galaxies also displays a great diversity of /  ratios within galaxies , but also across the sample . \n this suggests that either there are many mechanisms at play in the ionisation of the gas , that the metallicity of the ionised gas is very heterogeneous in those galaxies , or both . \n in order to study the dust distribution and compare it with that of the ionised gas we have generated unsharp - masked images using archival _ hubble space telescope \n we found that , consistent with previous results , dust generally follows the ionised - gas distribution ( goudfrooij et al . \n 1994 ; tomita et el . \n 2000 ; tran et al . 2001 ) . \n the opposite situation is not always true , as we have found galaxies with clear presence of emission with no traces of dust in the unsharp - masked images . as found by previous authors ( ho et al . \n 2002 ) , regular dust distributions generally are associated with smooth velocity fields , however the lack of regular dust lanes does not imply the presence of irregular kinematics .    the four cases presented in figure  [ fig2 ] display a wide range of dust morphologies that correlate in different degrees with the structures seen in the distribution of the ionised gas . \n the prominent dust disk in ngc4526 traces closely the distribution of the gas . the ring - like structure and spiral arms in ngc2974 \n are also followed by dusty structures at the same locations . \n the dust morphology is less defined in ngc2768 and ngc4278 , but still suggests an orientation for the dust that is similar to that of the gas distribution . \n the measurement of misalignments between the kinematics of the gaseous and stellar components in early - type galaxies has often been used to determine the relative importance of accretion events and the internal production of gas through stellar mass - loss ( e.g. bertola et al . 1992 ) . \n the orientation of the dust relative to that of the stars has also served this purpose ( e.g. van dokkum & franx 1995 ) . in order to quantify the presence of decoupled gaseous components in our sample and to investigate their dependence on environment , \n we have measured the mean misalignment between the stellar and ionised gas using _ kinemetry _ , a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher - order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution of galaxies ( krajnovi ' c et al . \n 2005b ) .    in figure  [ fig2 ] ( solid line ) \n we show the distribution of the average misalignments for the galaxies in our sample of 48 galaxies with sufficiently extended emission . \n the distribution of values appears to be skewed towards small misalignments . \n however , the fact that there is still a significant fraction of galaxies showing mild to strong misalignments suggests that the ionised gas has not a purely internal origin ( in which only small misalignments are expected ) . \n the overall shape of the distribution remains unchanged when the sample is divided into elliptical and lenticular galaxies . \n no dependency is found on neither environment nor galaxy luminosity . \n we do , however , find a strong dependence on apparent flattening of the galaxy ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) . \n it appears that the distribution of misalignments of the most flattened objects accounts for the observed excess of co - rotating over counter - rotating gas and stellar systems in the whole sample . \n the roundest objects ( @xmath40.2 ) display a more uniform distribution . \n this result suggests that rotational support might be important to explain the observed dependence . \n we have presented some examples of the morphological and kinematical state of the ionised gas in a representative sample of early - type galaxies using data from the ` sauron `  spectrograph at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope . \n the results of our analysis reveal a wide range of morphological , but also kinematical structures . \n it also shows that there must be several mechanisms responsible for the ionisation of the gas , not only across galaxies , but also within galaxies . \n the presence of dust is common in our sample and is usually accompanied by gas emission . \n finally , we studied the distribution of misalignments between the stars and gas in our sample , and conclude that the origin of the ionised gas can not be purely internal or external . \n jfb acknowledges support from the euro3d research training network , funded by the ec under contract hprn - ct-2002 - 00305 . \n this work is based on observations obtained at the wht on the island of la palma , operated by the isaac newton group at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .", "StartTimeOffset": 1334323217258, "RequestID": "c4e94fd5ac18420f9f15c8cdfed8520a", "TotalTokens": 3711}

similar . \n the idea of self - similarity has been offered by kadanoff  @xcite and further advanced by wilson to the renormalization method  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . \n concepts of universality and scaling near the critical point and a renormalization group ( rg ) method have been transferred to nonlinear dynamics by feigenbaum  @xcite . \n the analogy between transition to chaos and phase transitions consist in increase of temporal scales with approach to a critical point , self - similarity , an opportunity of application of rg analysis , and in existence of universal critical indexes and scaling factors , which are determined by the most general requirements to the type of system  @xcite .    in 1952 \n lee and yang advanced an approach in the phase transition theory based on consideration of analytical properties of some thermodynamic values , such as partition function and free energy , depending on the temperature considered formally as a complex variable  @xcite . \n the partition function is defined as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a total energy of a configuration of the system , @xmath10 is an external magnetic field , @xmath2 is a temperature , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 - is the spin variable , taking place at @xmath13-th cell of the lattice . \n spins interact via magnetic field with the nearest neighbours ( @xmath14 corresponds to ferromagnetic interaction , @xmath15  antiferromagnetic ) . \n partition function can be transformed to @xmath16 by the variable change @xmath17 . \n it is known , that at the phase transition the divergence of the thermodynamic potential ( free energy ) @xmath18 takes place . \n obviously , zeros of the partition function ( roots of the algebraic equation @xmath19 ) are the candidates for the phase transition points \n . however , these roots should be positive and real , which is impossible as all factors @xmath20 . in yang - lee theory , \n the temperature and the magnetic field are considered as complex variables  @xcite . \n complex zeros of the partition function ( called the yang - lee zeros ) , gather near the real axis . \n it becomes possible only in the thermodynamic limit , the asymptotics of infinite number of atoms . \n when the number of atoms is finite , there is a finite number of zeros in the complex plane . with increase of number of atoms , \n the set of zeros becomes dense and nestles to the real axis more and more . in the thermodynamic limit \n the yang - lee zeroes form a fractal set , that cross the real temperature axis at the point of the phase transition . to find the yang - lee zeros it is appropriate to apply the wilson renormalization method , which corresponds to a consecutive decrease of the number of degrees of freedom of the partition function . \n it is necessary to find the transformation of the @xmath21-particle partition function to the @xmath0-particle one ( @xmath22 ) . \n this transformation is not reversible . \n thus , to get zeros of @xmath23 it is necessary to have zeros of @xmath24 , and then to construct their backward images using the rg transformation . \n having repeated this procedure many times one comes finally to the trivial two - atom partition function . \n if zeros of @xmath25 belong to a basin of attraction of a fixed point of the rg transformation , then zeros of @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit will coincide to the boundary of the basin of attraction in the complex plane . as shown by derrida \n @xcite , this boundary , which is the julia set of the rg transformation , is identical to the set of yang - lee zeros . \n unfortunately , the renormalization transformation may be performed analytically only for simple class of models  the hierarchical lattices ( for example , one and two - dimensional model with ising spins  @xcite , hierarchical lattices with potts spins  @xcite ) . \n yang - lee theory appears to be fruitful for understanding the phase transitions . \n it seems that a similar approach to the analysis of transition to chaos in dynamical systems would be useful for deeper understanding of the analogy with the phase transitions , and for development of the new criteria describing complexity of behavior of nonlinear systems . in the present paper \n we develop such approach basing on the approximate rg analysis of transition to chaos through the period multiplication bifurcations . \n in 1978 feigenbaum discovered universality of cascade of the period - doubling bifurcations and described it on a basis of the rg method . \n the simplest example representing the feigenbaum universality class is quadratic map @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a real dynamical variable , and @xmath28 is a real parameter . \n this map has fixed points , which can be found as roots of the equation @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , a cycle of period @xmath31 ( that is the fixed point ) loses its stability . \n this @xmath32 is the parameter , at which the first period - doubling bifurcation occurs ( the multiplier of the fixed point is @xmath33 ) . \n values of @xmath28 for sequent bifurcations can be found by means of approximate rg method  @xcite . \n let s apply the map ( 4 ) two times : @xmath34 and neglect the last term , the fourth power of @xmath35 . \n then , by the scale transformation @xmath36 this map can be rewritten in the form @xmath37 , which differs from ( 4 ) only by renormalization of @xmath28 @xmath38 thus , the operator of evolution for the double interval of discrete time can be reduced to the original operator by the renormalization transformation  ( 7 ) . \n repeating this procedure with scale factors @xmath39 , one can obtain a sequence of the same form @xmath40    fixed points of these maps correspond to the @xmath41-cycles of the original map ( @xmath42 ) . \n it is easy to see , that all these cycles , as well as the fixed point of the map  ( 4 ) , become unstable at @xmath43 . \n solving a chain of the equations @xmath44 we get the corresponding sequence of bifurcation values of parameter @xmath28 ( with @xmath45 the @xmath41-cycle of  ( 4 ) arises ) . from iteration diagram of fig.1 \n it is evident , that this sequence converges with @xmath46 to a definite limit @xmath47 , the fixed point of the rg transformation . \n it satisfies the equation @xmath48 , thus @xmath49 . \n the scaling factors also converge to the limit : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . \n the multipliers ( floquet eigenvalues of the @xmath41-cycles ) converge to the universal value @xmath52 .    from transformation ( 8) it is possible to obtain the law of convergence of the bifurcation sequence : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant , characterizing the convergence to the critical point .    in table  1 \n we summarize the values of critical indexes ( critical point , scale factor , parameter scaling constant and universal multiplier ) obtained by means of the exact and approximate rg analysis . \n the correspondence between them is well enough . \n .rigorous and approximate values of feigenbaum critical indexes [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us generalize the approximate rg analysis to the period @xmath0-tupling bifurcations cascades for an arbitrary @xmath0 . by induction , the expression for the scaling factor and the parameter renormalization transformation look as follows : @xmath55 @xmath56 obviously , the critical julia sets of the rg transformations  ( [ 24 ] ) with increasing @xmath0 approximate the fractal properties of the mandelbrot set more and more precisely . \n for example , one of the fixed points of the rg transformation of period - quadrupling takes place on the real axes at @xmath57 . \n this point corresponds to the feigenbaum critical point @xmath58 and is approximated in this renormalization scheme more precisely than previous estimate @xmath59 . \n it is worth noting that for the better approximation of the mandelbrot set by julia sets of the rg transformation , for a large period multiplication the factor @xmath0 ( increasing to infinity ) must be a composite number , that is @xmath60 then the considered rg transformation will describe a number of different bifurcations cascades ( see figure  8) . \n let us construct a map , which allows an rg transformation of order @xmath61 using rg transformations of low orders . \n it yields @xmath62 dynamics of such a map with @xmath63 includes description of all period @xmath0-tuplings cascades . \n figure  10 shows the plane of initial values of @xmath64 . \n one can see that it precisely corresponds to the mandelbrot set . \n in the present paper the complex variable version of approximate rg method for period - doubling bifurcation cascade is considered . \n it is shown , that the julia set of renormalization transformation of parameter of complex logistic map is the approximate version of mandelbrot set of this map . \n this similarity is explained by the fact , that julia set is a set of every possible unstable cycles of rg transformation , and elements of these cycles correspond to accumulation points of various bifurcations of period @xmath65 multiplication ( @xmath66 ) , located on the boundary of mandelbrot set dense everywhere . \n approximate rg analysis is generalized to the case of different cascades of period - multiplication bifurcations ( for example period - tripling , period - quadrupling etc . ) , which is peculiar for the complex analytic maps . \n it is shown that with increase of order of the bifurcation cascade the similarity between mandelbrot set and julia set of renormalization transformation becomes more clear . \n the obtained outcomes are interpreted in a view of analogy with theory of phase transitions , namely the yang - lee theory , based on investigation of properties of thermodynamic values depending on complex temperature . \n it is necessary to note , that the elements of considered unstable cycles of rg transformation which is equivalent to points of julia set of this transformation , in thermodynamic analogy corresponds to so - called yang - lee zeros , defining in a thermodynamic limit the borderline of phase transition . \n it is shown , that at the points of transition to chaos the jump of an electrostatic field of a critical julia set is observed . within the framework of considered analogy , \n the jump of a derivative of a free energy at phase transition points takes place . \n thus , it is possible to define a new criterion of transition to chaos . \n the electrostatic potential can be regarded as order parameter for the transition . \n we conclude that complex generalization of approximate rg method appears to be useful to advance understanding of the critical phenomena at threshold of chaos and for development of analogy with the theory of phase transition , which can give new approaches to investigation of these phenomena . \n the authors acknowledge support from research educational center of nonlinear dynamics and biophysics at saratov state university ( rec-006 ) and rfbr ( grant no . \n 03 -

level systems , only the so - called no - jump trajectory , obtained when no environment is disturbed , is of use . \n in fact , the scheme starts to fail as soon as any single qubit decays , since its particular state is projected to the low energy level and factored out of the rest of the system . in order to solve this problem \n , we introduce the two remaining elements to show that encoding the qubits in three - level systems , combined with feedback on individual systems powers up the scheme to the limiting point of completely suppressing the action of the local environments only through local operations . \n to start with , let us take a look at how environment - monitoring can enhance a simple quantum teleportation scheme for which alice and bob need to share a pair of maximally entangled qubits . \n consider a initial bell state given by @xmath0 where we have considered @xmath1 as the local decay rates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lowering operators for the qubits of alice and bob respectively , and the interaction picture is implied . \n as time goes by , entanglement is lost , which can be evidenced by the entanglement of formation @xmath4 of state @xmath5  @xcite as shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . due to this process , \n the further alice and bob take to perform the teleportation , the largest the amount of resources needed , since they would need more and more copies in order to distill a maximally entangled pair . \n let us now assume that alice and bob can monitor the environments of their respective qubits , _ \n i.e.  _ they can continuously detect if their qubits have lost one excitation . \n it can involve a direct measurement of the reservoir , for example , by detecting an emitted photon , or an indirect probing of the loss of excitation through an auxiliary system  @xcite . under these conditions , \n the time evolution of the system is no longer described by the master equation itself but rather by its so - called quantum - jump unraveling , in which the no - jump operator ( corresponding to no detection in the monitored environment ) is given by @xmath6 $ ] and the one - jump operator is given by @xmath7  @xcite . the same holds for bob . \n first , since a detection in the environment immediately kills the entanglement , only the no - jump trajectory is useful . furthermore , given that @xmath8 , the initial state is preserved under this same evolution , _ \n @xmath9 for any @xmath10 , keeping its original entanglement . \n the effect of the reservoir is to make the no - jump trajectory less and less probable with time , its probability given by @xmath11 . \n provided that alice and bob can classically communicate the absence of jumps in their environments , this method is an alternative to the usual distillation protocol since at any time the two parts share a maximally entangled state . \n the idea of locally monitoring the reservoir can also be used in the problem of converting a partially entangled state @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) into a maximally entangled one ( singlet conversion ) @xcite . following a similar reasoning to the 2-qubit protocol presented before , \n when the subsystems undergo spontaneous decay and no jump is detected in both local reservoirs the initial state @xmath14 evolves into @xmath15 , with probability @xmath16 . \n when @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a maximally entangled state  @xcite . \n this happens with probability @xmath19 , which is exactly the optimal singlet conversion probability found in @xcite . \n this shows that indeed coupling the qubits with independent reservoirs and monitoring their environments provides a physical implementation of the optimal singlet conversion protocol . a setup that implements this conversion \n has recently been done with twin photons @xcite . \n we now proceed to show that using qutrits ( @xmath20 ) instead of qubits in each side improves the previous strategies . \n alice and bob will always share an initial state in the subspace spanned by @xmath21 , which will represent our particular encoding . \n we will also consider , from now on , only cascade decay channels , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of respective rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 and frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath27 . \n this condition is naturally found in many systems such as harmonic oscillators undergoing dissipation , spontaneous emission of spin-1 systems or some three - level atoms . \n we begin by analyzing the most favorable situation : the complete degeneracy between the decaying channels in each qutrit ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , _ i.e. _ if qutrit @xmath30 emits an excitation to its reservoir , by detecting this emission there is no fundamental way to identify the corresponding decay channel ( both are equally probable and generate indistinguishable excitations ) . \n first of all , note that in this case the no - jump evolution does not affect the entire subspace initially used by alice and bob , which mimics a decoherence free subspace for this particular trajectory . \n furthermore , contrary to the previous case , the detection of one jump does not mean entanglement loss . \n for example , if alice and bob share the initial state @xmath31 , and alice detects an excitation in her environment , the state of the system must still be given by @xmath32 . \n but now , the jump operator must include the essential fact that the excitation does not distinguish its _ donor _ , therefore , it is given by @xmath33 . \n this state is still maximally entangled , when interpreted as the state of two logical qubits . \n note that the information that the system has decayed not only allows alice to keep an entangled state with bob but actually gives her the opportunity to locally and deterministically restore @xmath34 through the unitary feedback of her qutrit with one excitation ( @xmath35-party multi - qutrit system in which each part is subjected to dissipation but is also able to monitor the loss of excitations and to locally feedback them . once again , as long as no part loses two excitations in a row ( before the feedback mechanism comes in place ) , an entire subspace spanned by @xmath36 can be protected against local dissipation . \n another possible configuration features emitted excitations that still do not identify the possible decay channel but are more likely the higher the number of excitations in @xmath34 ( @xmath28 and @xmath37 ) . \n for example , in the specific case of dissipative harmonic oscillators , the operators in the studied subspace ( @xmath38 ) are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this case , both possible evolutions would affect the entanglement between alice s and bob s qutrits , since they redistribute population among the levels of each subsystem .    in fig . \n [ fig1]a we plot the time evolution of the entanglement of the non - monitored system , @xmath4 , as well as the average entanglement over different trajectories  @xcite as a function of time for the cases analyzed above , both with and without feedback . \n note that in all situations , even for the usual qubit encoding , monitoring the environments preserves entanglement for a longer time than ignoring it , as should be the case since some information on the system is always recovered . \n when the detection and feedback mechanisms are ideal ( @xmath41 ) , entanglement can be preserved indefinitely . in fig . \n [ fig1]b we plot the entanglement obtained either when there is an @xmath42 delay in the feedback mechanism or when there is an @xmath42 inefficiency in the measurement of the environment . \n since we now deal with mixed states of two qutrits , we use negativity  @xcite to obtain the entanglement in each case . \n we should stress the fact that the use of qutrits is advantageous even in these non - ideal cases when compared to two qubits , as it is clear in fig . \n also note that , as expected , inefficient detection of the environment has a greater effect on entanglement loss than delay in the feedback mechanism . \n let us now describe a cavity qed setup where our ideas can be applied . \n suppose alice and bob want to establish a ( ideally ) perfect quantum channel . \n in the proposal of ref . \n @xcite , alice first prepares an empty cavity ( state @xmath43 ) and then interacts it with a very stable two - level atom ( @xmath44 ) in the exited state @xmath45 , in such a way to get the entangled state @xmath46 . \n afterwards she sends the atom to bob . assuming that the atomic decay rate is much smaller than the cavity field one , _ \n i.e.  _ @xmath47 , the decoherence time of the second would limit the distance achievable by the first . \n in fact , the distance between alice and bob would have to be much smaller than @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the atomic velocity .    as discussed before \n , this strategy can be improved if alice uses three levels of her cavity field . \n the idea is that , instead of being empty , the cavity initially contains a photon ( state @xmath50 ) . \n then , after the atom - cavity interaction the final state will be @xmath51 . \n if no jump happens in the interval @xmath52 then this state evolves to @xmath53 , with probability @xmath54 . \n however , if one jump happens in the cavity field at time @xmath55 , then the new state of the system at time @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 , where the no - jump operator is used for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n note that because @xmath60 , the final state @xmath61 is always the same irrespective of the particular time at which the jump happened . \n we can then treat all one - jump trajectories as the same and compute their joint probability as @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 gives the probability density for the trajectory where a jump happens at @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) . \n the trajectory - averaged entanglement is then given by @xmath66 . \n furthermore , we can choose @xmath56 to maximize the one - jump trajectory and @xmath67 to maximize the entanglement of the state when the atom reaches bob , hence , creating an even longer lasting entanglement . \n [ superficie2 ] compares the protocols as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath67 showing the optimum range in which each strategy is better and also that for all times and initial states , encoding qubits in qutrits is more efficient in the presence of decay and environmental monitoring . \n [ superficie2]d shows entanglement for different temperatures of the reservoir . \n typical microwave cavity qed experiments correspond to the intermediate curve  @xcite . \n note that at such low temperatures , thermal excitations play a minor role in the proposed scheme .     for @xmath68 ; \n b. ( upper right ) one - jump contribution @xmath69 for @xmath70 ; c. @xmath71 ; d. @xmath72 with @xmath73 for different temperatures with the mean environment excitation number given by @xmath74 . decay time @xmath75 as in the experimental setup in  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] + \n the schemes proposed before can be readily incorporated in some previously known communication protocols . \n one of the main ideas of transmitting quantum information in 1-d networks relies on quantum repeaters @xcite . in this case , one wants to transmit entanglement through large distances and uses intermediate stations to recover it from time to time through entanglement distillation . \n once some degree of entanglement is recovered in an intermediate station , this entanglement is teleported to the next station . \n naturally , since using qutrits allows to keep entanglement for longer times between each station , there is a reduction in the total amount of necessary resources .    in higher dimensional networks \n , it was recently shown that the geometry of the graph defining the quantum network plays an important role in the problem of long - distance communication . \n entanglement percolation ideas @xcite were first presented for pure - state based networks . \n the main building block for these strategies is the possibility of performing the optimal singlet conversion . as we discussed before , \n this task can be achieved by reservoir monitoring . \n this fact in turn shows a strategy of realizing classical entanglement percolation in noisy lattices @xcite . \n to conclude , we have shown that for systems undergoing dissipation , encoding qubits in qutrits preserves coherence and entanglement for much longer times if the excitations given to the local reservoirs can be detected by external observers . \n thus , systems with their environments under continuous measurement are not only suitable but advantageous for some quantum information protocols . \n moreover , the monitoring scheme is further improved if the parties are able to locally feedback the recovered information into the system . \n this leads naturally to a reduction in resources for protocols such as quantum repeaters , teleportation , swapping and error correction , as well as an improvement in the coherence time of quantum memories . \n we have also shown a way of using the information leakage to the environment to perform the optimal singlet conversion , the central task in classical entanglement percolation . \n finally , note that experiments already observe quantum jumps in different systems , e.g , harmonic oscillators ( microwave cavity fields )  @xcite , and in single ions  @xcite , which means that the scheme here proposed is clearly within nowadays technology . \n the authors thank a.  acn and a.r.r . \n carvalho for enlightening discussions . \n support from brazilian agencies cnpq and fapemig and the european project qap is warmly acknowledged . \n this work is part of brazilian national institute of science and technology on quantum information .", "StartTimeOffset": 1372554771972, "RequestID": "a0bb3f7f7213492c83ece8e4f333efc7", "TotalTokens": 3982}
{"ContextTokens": 3479, "GeneratedTokens": 109, "SynthesizedBody": "experimental measurement of the doppler peaks positions and heights would fix at least some combinations of cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . ) which are left free in inflationary models @xcite . \n furthermore , as shown by @xcite , the _ absence _ of secondary doppler peaks is a robust prediction for cosmic strings , although this may or may not be the case for textures @xcite . \n therefore it appears that even determining whether or not there are secondary doppler peaks offers an important alternative motivation for measuring the cmbr power spectrum . \n we address this issue by proposing a statistic for detecting secondary oscillations , and studying how it performs for various models , using different experimental strategies . \n the results are encoded in a detection function @xmath3 which indicates to within how many sigmas we can claim a detection of secondary oscillations , given a particular model and experiment . \n we apply the statistic to both the standard cdm scenario and an open cdm model which is tuned to confuse inflation and cosmic strings in all but the existence or otherwise of secondary oscillations . for a wide range of experiments \n we allow the beam size , sky coverage , and detector noise to vary , and use this framework to compute the detection function for secondary peaks . \n there are several factors affecting how well one can measure the cmbr power spectrum from real observations , which we now discuss . \n \\(i ) distortion of the underlying spectrum due to the finite size of the observed field . for ( square ) fields of size @xmath4 degrees ( suitably windowed with a cosine bell or hann window ) \n this is not a severe problem for detecting secondary peak structure . \n \\(ii ) cosmic / sample variance , which places constraints on the minimum sky - coverage necessary to achieve a given accuracy . roughly speaking , if @xmath5 is the fraction of sky observed , then @xmath6 . \n \\(iii ) instrumental noise , which we shall assume is uncorrelated for simplicity , and characterised by @xmath7 , the rms pixel noise , and @xmath8 , the area of a pixel . \n if we consider the most general case where only a fraction @xmath5 of the sky is mapped , then for a detector of fixed sensitivity , and for a fixed total observing time , then by varying @xmath8 and @xmath9 the quantity @xmath10 , remains constant , and is therefore an important qualifier for noise on maps obtained using different scanning strategies . \n \\(iv ) diffuse foreground emission , which can severely hamper the measurement of cmbr anisotropies . \n a discussion of these foreground components , and the regions of frequency / multipole space in which each dominates , is given by @xcite . \n the main components of this foreground are galactic dust , synchrotron and free - free emission . \n algorithms for separating these components from the cmbr signal are discussed by @xcite and @xcite . \n typically the errors associated with the separation process are of a similar magnitude to the average errors on an individual frequency channel due to instrumental noise alone , but details depend on the separation algorithm used . \n \\(v ) point sources , which can not be removed from spectral information alone . \n this requires the identification of the sources by higher - resolution observations at a frequency close to that of the cmbr observations , with sufficient flux sensitivity to indentify all point sources down to some flux limit roughly equal to the instrumental noise of the cmbr observations . \n we note here that although it is generally believed that point source contamination becomes less important as the observing frequency increases above about 100 ghz , there is no direct evidence for this . \n moreover , even the population of radio point sources at frequencies above about 10 ghz is rather uncertain , and it may be inadvisable to rely on low frequency surveys such as the 1.5 ghz vla first survey @xcite to subtract point sources from cmbr maps made at much higher frequencies . \n the idea is to apply to a particular model a statistic sensitive only to the existence or absence of secondary oscillations in the power spectrum . in this section \n we consider the power spectrum predicted by the standard inflation / cdm scenario with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( which we shall call scdm ) .    to this end \n we first compute the average broad band power @xmath14 in each of several equally spaced - bins , denoted by horizontal bars in fig . \n [ mph_fig1 ] . \n we then infer the convexity @xmath15 of the spectrum at each bin position ( apart from the first and last bins ) from @xmath16 . \n these convexities are all negative if there are no secondary peaks , but alternate in sign for scdm . \n if the overall error in @xmath15 is @xmath17 then one can define an oscillation detection function as @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which tells us to within how many sigmas we can claim a detection of secondary peaks . \n the method for computing the estimates @xmath14 of the power spectrum in each bin , and their associated standard errors , taking into account limited sky - coverage and instrumental noise , are discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite .    from fig . \n [ mph_fig1 ] we see that the first dip in the scdm power spectrum is more easily detected than than the second one , a situation only exacerbated by finite resolution and the presence of instrumental noise \n . therefore we shall confine ourselves to considering the detection function @xmath21 , which from now on we refer to simply as @xmath3 . \n the detection function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the linear size of the observed ( square ) field [ the all - sky limit can be recovered by setting @xmath24 sr @xmath25 ( 202 deg)@xmath26 , @xmath27 is fwhm of the observing beam , and @xmath28 is the noise level discussed above . \n this function is plotted in fig . \n [ mph_fig2 ] for the low noise case @xmath29 and the high - noise case @xmath30 .    for any beamsize \n there is a maximum sky coverage beyond which the detection is not improved . if anything the level of the detection decreases , but typically not by much . \n the ideal scanning strategy is then defined by a line @xmath31 which intersects the contours of @xmath3 at the lowest @xmath23-value at which a plateau has been achieved in the detection function . \n the significance of the detection obtained for an ideally scanned experiment depends on the beam size . \n for example , in the low - noise case , if @xmath32 , the ideal coverage is a patch of @xmath33 degrees , which results in a 3-sigma detection . \n if @xmath34 , on the other hand , an 8-sigma detection can be obtained with @xmath35 degrees . \n the detection provided by an optimally scanned experiment increases at first very quickly as the beam is reduced below @xmath32 ( from 3-sigma at @xmath36 to 33-sigma at @xmath37 ) . by reducing @xmath27 from @xmath38 to zero , however , the detection is only increased by 2-sigma ( from 33 to 35 ) . for this level of noise \n the maximal detection is 35 sigma and is achieved with @xmath39 and all - sky coverage . for low noise levels all - sky coverage is never harmful , but it is the beamsize that determines how good a detection can be achieved , and how much sky coverage is actually required for an optimum level of detection .    for noise levels of the order @xmath40 the overall picture is always as in fig . \n [ mph_fig2 ] . \n in particular , there is always a top contour indicating the maximal detection allowed by the given noise level . \n the maximum @xmath3 is always achieved with infinite resolution , but one falls short of this maximum by only a couple of sigmas if @xmath41 . \n if the noise is much smaller than this , however , the summit of @xmath3 is beyond @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , for instance , all - sky coverage becomes ideal for any @xmath44 . \n if , on the other hand , the noise is much larger than @xmath45 then the @xmath3 contours are qualitatively different , as shown in fig . \n [ mph_fig2 ] for @xmath46 . \n the beamsize is now a crucial factor . \n a beamsize of @xmath34 would provide a 3-sigma detection ( with @xmath47 ) , but reducing the beamsize to about @xmath48 improves the detection to 6-sigma ( with @xmath49 ) . \n it is also clear from the figure that , for high noise levels , forcing all - sky coverage dramatically decreases the detection . \n we may repeat the above analysis for different cosmological models . \n we therefore consider the case of maximal confusion between inflation / cdm and cosmic string scenarios by comparing a cosmic strings model with a cdm model for which the main peak in the power spectrum has the same position and shape ( but the latter exhibits secondary peaks ) . for definiteness \n we have chosen a cdm theory with a flat primordial spectrum , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . \n we shall call this theory stcdm , the cdm competitor of cosmic strings . \n as before we simply study the first dip detection function of stcdm , and then take this detection function as a cosmic string rejection function .    in fig . \n [ mph_fig3 ] we show the angular power spectrum of stcdm ( solid line ) and a possible power spectrum for cosmic strings ( dotted line ) . \n we then simply repeat the same exercise as in the previous section to obtain the detection function of the first dip of stcdm . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ mph_fig4 ] for the same noise levels as before . \n overall we see that in signal dominated regions the detection is much better for stcdm than for scdm . \n this is because features at higher @xmath53 have a smaller cosmic / sample variance ( which is proportional to @xmath54 ) . \n it can be checked that the cosmic / sample variance limit , obtained with a single - dish experiment with no noise , is now @xmath55 ( as opposed to @xmath56 for scdm ) . even in the presence of noise , \n wherever the signal dominates , the detection is better for stcdm . \n however , in noise - dominated regions the behaviour of the detection function for stcdm and cdm is very different . \n the signal - dominated region is greatly reduced in stcdm . \n much smaller beamsizes @xmath27 are now required for any meaningful detection . as shown in fig . \n [ mph_fig4 ] , one would now need @xmath44 and @xmath57 , for noises @xmath40 and @xmath46 respectively , in order to obtain a reasonable detection . \n again one can plot an ideal scanning line in the beam / coverage sections defined by a fixed noise @xmath28 . \n the ideal sky coverage is much smaller for stcdm than for scdm . in general the contours of @xmath3 for stcdm \n compared to scdm are squashed to lower @xmath27 , lower @xmath23 , and achieve higher significance levels , with steeper slopes . following an ideal scanning line for any fixed @xmath28 one \n reaches a maximal detection allowed by the given level of noise , which is always better for stcdm than for scdm . \n this maximal detection is normally obtained with a small sky coverage , and infinite resolution . \n nevertheless , one falls short of this maximum by only a few sigma if the resolution is about @xmath58 . from fig . \n [ mph_fig4 ] , for @xmath40 , one may now obtain a maximal 43-sigma detection for an ideal scanning area of @xmath59 degrees . if @xmath60 a 36-sigma detection is still obtained . \n we also see that a beamsize of @xmath61 is required to obtain a 3-sigma detection ( with @xmath62 degrees ) , and a 10-sigma detection can be achieved only with @xmath63 ( and @xmath64 degrees ) . \n all - sky coverage for an experiment targeting stcdm is generally inadvisable , and it would only be optimal for the extremely low level of noise @xmath65 . \n the results obtained here are useful for future cmbr projects in two different ways . \n firstly they allow the choice of an ideal scanning strategy ( choice of resolution and sky coverage ) for detecting secondary doppler peaks , given observational constraints such as the instrumental noise level and the total observing time . \n secondly , one may compute the expected value of the detection , assuming ideal scanning , as a function of these parameters . \n this provides lower bounds on experimental conditions for a meaningful detection as well as an estimate of how fast detections will improve thereafter . \n these results also indicate that in order to study doppler peak features for scdm , depending on the noise levels , a large sky coverage might be desirable , even for a resolution of about @xmath66 . if , however , one is instead to test the high-@xmath67 opposition between low @xmath68 cdm and cosmic strings , then a rather higher resolution is required . \n furthermore , in this context , all - sky scanning is not only unnecessary , but in fact undesirable .    99 jungman g. , kamionkowski m. , kosowsky a. , spergel d. , 1996 , phys . \n lett . , submitted . \n albrecht a. , coulson d. , ferreira p. , magueijo j. , 1996 , phys.rev.lett . , 76 , 1413 magueijo j. , albrecht a. , coulson d. , ferreira p. , 1996 \n , phys.rev.lett . \n , in press crittenden r. , turok n. , 1995 , phys . \n lett . , 75 , 2642 durrer r. , gangui a. , sakellariadou m. , 1996 , phys . \n lett . , 76 , 579 tegmark m. , efstathiou g. , 1996 , _ mnras _ , in press maisinger k. , hobson m. p. , lasenby a. , 1996 , _ mnras _ , submitted becker r. h. , white r. l. , helfand d. j. , 1995 , hobson m. p. , mageuijo j.,1996 , _ mnras _ , submitted magueijo j. , hobson m. p. , 1996 \n , phys.rev.lett . , submitted", "StartTimeOffset": 1380474782404, "RequestID": "adaf66c70f134379951df21263f9f1a0", "TotalTokens": 3588}

defined multiplet structures as well as many consecutive radial orders of the same @xmath2 . \n this allows us immediately to estimate the rotational frequency , @xmath3 , and the mean period spacing , @xmath4 , with the latter quantity putting strong constraints on the mass of the best - fitting model . \n furthermore , the variations from equidistant period spacing , i.e. , `` mode trapping '' , give us information ( at least in the case of gd  358 ) about the radial structure of the star , such as the thickness of its surface he layer .    in a detailed analysis of the frequency distribution in gd  358 \n , @xcite found evidence of a chemical transition zone located at a mass depth of @xmath5 , which they interpreted as the c / he boundary . \n a he layer thickness of @xmath610@xmath7 is thinner than expected on naive evolutionary grounds , as well as thinner than suggested for the da white dwarfs by the asteroseismological work of @xcite . while the fit of bradley & winget explained the trapping features in the neighborhood of 700 sec reasonably well , it did not do as well for periods near 500 sec . \n they found evidence that these periods near 500 sec might be better fit if an additional chemical transition zone at a depth of @xmath610@xmath8 is assumed . \n independent of the above considerations , if the theory of diffusion of chemical species in stars is correct , then at least a partial separation of different isotopes of the same element must occur in white dwarfs , as was pointed out to one of us by clayton ( 1988 , private communication ) . at the time \n , there were no known observational consequences ; this has since changed with the advent of white dwarf asteroseismology . \n while the galactic number ratio of to has been measured to be of order @xmath9 in many astrophysical environments @xcite , this does not necessarily hold for the stellar cores which are presumably the white dwarf progenitors . \n in fact , standard evolutionary theory would suggest quite low levels of in these objects @xcite . \n our view is that given the theoretical uncertainties in the late stages of stellar evolution , we should not rule out any possibilities , and indeed should seek to make as many independent measurements as possible . \n these considerations led to two independent motivations for considering diffusion @xcite . \n first , it is a process which may be a generic feature of white dwarf cooling , and , as such , should be considered as part of our asteroseismological analyses . \n second , it might allow us to place the mode trapping data for gd  358 in a different context : this star could have a c/ transition zone at @xmath10 and a thinner / transition zone at @xmath11 . \n if this is the case , then the dbv s and the dav s would again have the same order of magnitude he layer thicknesses . to determine the plausibility of these hypotheses , we first examine the relevant diffusion timescales , and then the effect which such a layering structure has on our fits of gd  358 . \n the process of diffusion is of major importance , since we are aware of no other effect which could lead to the spatial separation of and . \n we therefore examine the relevant timescales for such diffusive processes , to see if it is plausible for a significant fraction of the to have separated from in the elapsed evolutionary times for these objects . \n fortunately for us , @xcite have already examined the related problem of c diffusion in a background of normal he , i.e. , . in their analysis , they treated c as a trace element . \n this is an excellent approximation for our case as well , since we naively expect that the is only about one part in @xmath12 of the . \n applying their equations for this case for a 0.612 @xmath13 model , we obtain the result shown in figure  [ diffuse ] . \n we see that if we assume a @xmath14 of 25,000  k for a typical dbv , then diffusive equilibrium between and should prevail down to approximately the @xmath15 mass point . \n thus , if the layer is as thick or thicker than this , and the abundance is @xmath16 that of the abundance , we would expect a layer of thickness @xmath17 . \n one clear prediction of this is that the spectra of db s in this temperature range should show more or less pure , at least for layers which are thicker than @xmath18 . \n this is currently in the process of being tested using high - resolution spectroscopic observations ( koester , private communication ) . \n we mention as an aside that the case of may be unique in that it is a trace isotope which is _ lighter _ than the dominant species , so that it can diffuse upwards and produce a thin , but not asteroseismologically negligible layer . for trace isotopes which sink \n , there should be no such signature .      in this preliminary exploration \n , we will only consider / zones with equilibrium profiles , although the profiles could in fact be less sharp than this . \n the treatment of the chemical profiles in the transition zones in our present and previous work is based on the work of @xcite . \n essentially , we use equation ( a6 ) of @xcite , which assumes that an equilibrium distribution has been reached and that one of the elements may be treated as a trace element . \n this is certainly a valid assumption for the initial stages of diffusion , given the expected abundance ratio of to . \n to include the effects of a layer we have made a relatively simple modification to the envelope routines in our evolutionary code . \n since we are interested in modeling a db , we are free to use the array space normally reserved for the h profile and use it for the profile . to this end , we have replaced the h equation of state ( eos ) and opacities with those appropriate for . in doing this , \n we have taken the eos and opacities to be equal to those of at 3/4 the density ( to correct for the isotopic mass ratio ) . \n this approximation should be more than sufficient for our purposes . \n a comparison of the region of period formation for the cases of a /h and a / envelope is given in @xcite . \n we now wish to examine the effect which a layer could have on the pulsation frequencies . \n first , in the top panel of figure  [ fit0.61 ] , we show one of the best - fit models for the star gd  358 from @xcite . \n the filled circles connected by solid lines show the observed mode trapping structure , and the open circles connected by dotted lines show the results from the best - fit model . \n this model has @xmath19 , @xmath20 24,044 k , and @xmath21 . \n the lower 3 panels show the effect a thin layer of has on the mode trapping structure . \n if the layer is as thick as @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 , then we see that the mode trapping structure in the vicinity of 700 sec is significantly altered . \n fits_emu.tab unfortunately , this is the region in which the fit was already quite good , whereas in the region around 500 sec , where the fit was poor , there is very little change . \n however , this analysis clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of a layer can have a measurable effect on the calculated mode trapping structure . \n in an effort to test asteroseismologically the viability of the hypothesis of a layer , we performed an extensive set of calculations . using a genetic algorithm @xcite , \n the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath14 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 were varied to produce pulsational models whose @xmath27 , @xmath28 periods were compared with those inferred from the observations . \n the region of parameter space explored is given by : @xmath29 the best - fit models from these runs are listed in table  [ results ] . the column labeled \n @xmath30 gives the residuals ( standard deviation ) of the calculated and observed periods , and the column labeled @xmath31 gives the residuals of the calculated and observed period _ \n spacings_. for the upper four models we have taken the fitness criterion to be @xmath32 , whereas for the lower two models we took it to be @xmath33 $ ] ; thus , for these last two entries , we are fitting not just the periods but the spacings between consecutive periods . \n we have chosen this criterion for the models with a more realistic core composition based on our suspicion that the period _ spacings _ will be a more sensitive diagnostic of the layer than the periods themselves will be .    as a reference to previous fits , \n the fit of @xcite for a c core model has @xmath34  sec . \n thus , the present best fits , both with and without a layer , having period residuals of @xmath35 and @xmath36  sec , respectively , represent a significant improvement over previous fits . \n we see from table  [ results ] that the fits with o / c cores are significantly better than those with pure carbon cores , independent of whether a layer is present or not , a result previously found by @xcite . in figure \n [ fit ] , we display the mode trapping diagrams for these two fits . \n both fits reproduce the periods quite well , with the model reproducing the period _ spacings _ much better ( @xmath37 sec compared to @xmath38 sec ) . \n this indicates that the period spacing may be a better diagnostic for the fine structure produced by the / transition zone than just the periods themselves . \n we now seek to understand the relative importance of the o / c and / transition zones . in the asymptotic limit of high radial overtones and large periods , \n the frequency of a given mode is given by a simple radial integral of the brunt - visl frequency . \n using a `` period formation '' diagram , we can show the relative weight which a given region has in determining a mode s period .    in figure  [ pform2 ] \n , we show such a diagram for the case of our best - fit model . \n the three peaks which are labeled correspond to the o / c , c/ , and / transition zones . using the equilibrium diffusion coefficients for the / transition zone \n , we see that it is of relatively minor importance in determining the mode frequencies . \n in contrast , the o / c and c/ transition zones are both quite pronounced and should significantly affect the periods of the modes calculated in the models ; this is borne out by the major improvement in the standard deviation of the periods , @xmath30 , with the inclusion of an o / c chemical profile . \n the period _ spacings _ , on the other hand , are a differential quantity , and therefore sensitive to even small deviations in the background structure . \n it is therefore not surprising that the inclusion of a layer results in a major reduction in the resduals of the period spacings . \n we now attempt to quantify the statistical significance of the improvement of the fit when the parameter corresponding to the layer thickness is added . \n following @xcite , we apply the bayes information criterion ( bic ) for @xmath39 data points . \n we find that the addition of a parameter should be accompanied by a decrease in the residuals of at least @xmath610% in order to be considered statistically significant . \n we note that this is a necessary but certainly not sufficient condition for the validity of adding a parameter .    examining the best - fit o / c core models \n , we see that the standard deviation of the fit to the period spacings improved from 1.92  sec to 1.32  sec with the addition of . \n this is a decrease of 30% and should therefore be considered statistically significant . \n finally , we again note that the models with o / c cores yield markedly lower residuals , regardless of which criterion is used ( periods or period _ spacings _ ) . \n this result has recently been obtained by @xcite , who report the results of such fits in an extensive parameter space of white dwarf models . \n from this preliminary analysis , we have shown that diffusion theory applied to white dwarfs predicts that any initially present in the dbv s down to a depth of @xmath610@xmath40 should have diffused upward to produce a surface layer of . \n in addition to being detectable spectroscopically ( koester , private communication ) , such a layer can significantly affect the asteroseismological fits , and therefore needs to be included in such analyses . \n we find that although the inclusion of a layer results in only a marginal improvement to the fits to the periods , the fit to the period _ spacings _ is significantly improved . \n this is because the period spacings are more sensitive to the fine structure which a / transition zone produces than the periods themselves are .    finally , we find that an o / c core ( essentially , the transition in the core from an o / c mixture to pure c ) fits the observed pulsational spectrum of gd  358 _ much _ better than a pure c core , in agreement with @xcite , who first obtained this result . \n this gives us the hope of someday being able to constrain the prior nuclear burning history of gd  358 and other pulsating white dwarfs . \n we would like to thank jim truran , don clayton , and hugh van horn for useful discussions on this topic . \n this work was supported in part by the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenshaftlichen forschung , project number s7304 , by the national science foundation under grant ast-9876730 , and by the national aeronautics and space administration under grant nag5 -

{"ContextTokens": 1934, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) is perhaps the most famous model in the field of game theory . roughly speaking , there are two sorts of pd : one -

efficient . \n as specified by telser ( page 28 , line 2 , @xcite ) , `` _ _ a party to a self - enforcing agreement calculates whether his gain from violating the agreement is greater or less than the loss of future net benefits that he would incur as a result of detection of his violation and the consequent termination of the agreement by the other party . _ _ '' since two channels have been controlled by the computer in stage 1 , in the end @xmath3 is a self - enforcing nash equilibrium and the pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 is the unique nash equilibrium outcome . in this sense , \n the two agents escape the dilemma .    * type-5 pd * : + conditions 1 - 3 are the same as those in type-4 pd . \n + 4 ) the last condition of type-4 pd does not hold . \n + for this case , although the two agents can communicate before moving and agree that collaboration is good for each agent , they will definitely choose ( _ defect _ , _ defect _ ) as if they are separated . \n thus , the agents can not escape the dilemma . \n the algorithmic model revises common understanding on the one - shot pd . here \n we will discuss some possible doubts about it .    _ \n q1 _ : the type-4 pd seems to be a cooperative game because in condition 4 , the algorithmic model constructed by two agents acts as a correlation between agents .    _ \n a1 _ : from the viewpoints of agents , the game is different from the original one - shot pd , since the payoff matrix confronted by the two agents has been changed from table 1 to table 3 . but from the viewpoints of the arbitrator , nothing is changed . \n thus , the so - called correlation between two agents is indeed _ \n unobservable _ to the arbitrator . \n put differently , the arbitrator can not prevent agents from constructing the algorithmic model . \n + on the other hand , since each agent can freely choose not to participate the algorithmic model and send a message to the arbitrator directly in stage 1 , the algorithmic model is self - enforcing and thus still a non - cooperative game .    _ q2 _ : after the algorithmic model is triggered , can it simply send @xmath14 , @xmath15 to the arbitrator instead of running steps 1 - 5 ?    _ a2 _ : the algorithmic model enlarges each agent s strategy space from the original strategy space _ \\{cooperate , defect } _ to a two - dimensional strategy space @xmath16\\times[0,\\pi/2]$ ] , and generates the pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 in nash equilibrium . \n the enlarged strategy space includes the original strategy space of one - shot pd : the strategy ( _ cooperate , cooperate _ ) , ( _ cooperate , defect _ ) , ( _ defect , cooperate _ ) , ( _ defect , defect _ ) in the original pd correspond to the strategy @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the algorithmic model respectively , since @xmath21 , @xmath22 . \n + however , the idea in this question restricts each agent s strategy space from the original strategy space _ \\{cooperate , defect } _ to a single strategy _ \n cooperate_. in this sense , two agents are required to sign a binding contract to do so . \n this is beyond the range of non - cooperative game . \n _ remark 2 _ : the algorithmic model is not suitable for type-1 and type-2 pd , because the computer can not perform actions on behalf of agents . \n the algorithmic model is not applicable for type-3 pd either because two agents are separated , thereby the algorithmic model can not be constructed . for the case of type-5 pd , the algorithmic model is not applicable because condition 4 in type-4 pd is vital and indispensable . \n in this paper , we categorize the well - known one - shot pd into five types and propose an algorithmic model to help two non - cooperative agents self - enforcingly escape a special type of pd , i.e. , the type-4 pd . \n the type-4 pd is justified when the arbitrator communicate with the agents indirectly through some channels , and each agent s strategy is not an action , but a message that can be sent to the arbitrator . with the rapid development of internet , more and more type-4 pd games will be seen . \n one point is important for the novel result : usually people may think the two payoff matrices confronted by agents and the arbitrator are the same ( i.e. , table 1 ) . \n however we argue that for the case of type-4 pd , the two payoff matrices can be different : the arbitrator still faces table 1 , but the agents can self -

and how he should price it later . in the present paper \n we study the interplay of a few strategies . the relative performance of these strategies is quantified by the wealth of agents employing them . \n we organized the paper by first reviewing the  fat cat \" model in section ii . \n the extension of this model to the case of other strategies is described in section iii . \n then , in section iv we discuss how the model could be extended to cases where agents are able to change their strategies according to their performance and give our concluding remarks . \n we picture our model as a cartoon of the trading situations found in a real market . as shown in fig . \n 1 , this minimalistic model consists of a system where agents trade a set of @xmath0 different products . \n each agent @xmath1 is assigned one of three possible strategies selected to be either based on profit ( i.e.   greed \" , which is the strategy adopted in the original  fat cat \" model ) , on the need for a particular product , or on a random selection without regard to the level of profit or need .    other strategies could be explored ; for example , agents could act as  garbage collectors \" , buying whatever product has the lowest possible price . in this paper \n we limit ourselves to the three , probably most basic , strategies outlined in fig . 1 . \n each of the @xmath2 agents starts with @xmath3 units of goods . \n the goods are randomly selected , for each agent , among the @xmath0 different products . \n thereby we form the stock @xmath4 of each agent that together with some initial amount of money , @xmath5 define the initial state of the economy . \n we describe below the dynamics that arises from the interactions among these agents .    during the time evolution of the system \n , each agent @xmath1 has , at each time step , an amount of money @xmath6 , and a stock of the different products @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . \n the prices of the different items in the stock of agent @xmath1 are denoted @xmath9 which initially are taken to be integers uniformly drawn in the interval @xmath10 $ ] . in all cases \n we have verified that the evolution of the system does not depend on this particular choice . \n agents then meet and exchange products and adjust prices . \n price adjustment is such that large differences in pricing between agents are lowered , but also such that price differences are induced by some noise when they are small , as in real markets .    as in our simulations for the original  fat cat \" model , we assume that at each time step the following procedure takes place :    * * 1 * buyer @xmath11 and seller @xmath12 are selected at random among the @xmath2 agents . if the seller has no products to offer , then another seller is chosen . \n * * 2 * the buyer selects a product @xmath13 in the seller s stock according to his strategy @xmath14 . \n + \\i ) if strategy @xmath14 is  profit \" then he selects the product @xmath13 which maximizes @xmath15 , ( i.e. his profit ) . \n + \\ii ) if strategy @xmath14 is  need \" then he selects the product @xmath13 which he has the least in his stock ( minimizes @xmath16 ) . \n + \\iii ) if strategy @xmath14 is  random \" then he selects a random product @xmath13 in the seller s stock for which @xmath17 . + the selected product @xmath13 \n is called @xmath18 ( best buy ) . * * 3a * if the buyer does not have enough money , ( i.e. if @xmath19 , we return to the first step and choose a new pair of agents . * * 3b * if the buyer has enough money we proceed . \n + if @xmath20 , the transaction is performed at the seller s price . \n this means that we adjust : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . * * 3c * if @xmath25 , the transaction is not performed . in this case \n , the seller lowers his price by one unit , @xmath26 , and the buyer raises his price by one unit , + @xmath27 . \n the prices are always non - negative integers . also note that since , as defined in step 3 above , the price offered by the buyer can not be higher than the amount of money it has \n , we are not allowing for the agents to get into debt . in case \n there are several products that fulfill the selection criterion in 2 , a random one of these is chosen . \n one should emphasize that due to the price adjustments performed in unsuccessful encounters , the prices never reach equilibrium , and different agents typically assign different prices to the same product .    to quantify the system , \n we define the total wealth of an agent @xmath1 as the amount of money plus the value of all goods in the agent s possession : @xmath28 the value of product @xmath13 is defined as the average of what all agents consider its value to be : @xmath29 and the value of all of agent @xmath1 s goods , @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 the  fat cat \" model s  profit \" rule was studied extensively in our earlier paper . \n there it was found to lead to persistency and fat tails in the agents wealth fluctuations with time , hence its name . \n we now study the other strategies and their interactions . \n the three strategies given above lead to different wealth of the respective agents . \n we will now study this in some detail . \n our first step is to illustrate how the wealth of the agents gets distributed in a system where all agents employ the same strategy . for that purpose \n we consider a system composed of 50 agents , 50 different products . \n each agent is given 40 units of products and 20 units of money . \n the result , shown in fig . \n 2 , is that there are appreciable differences in the wealth distribution according to the strategy . for a profit - minded system ( the original  fat cat \" model ) , there is a long tail of wealthy agents , which becomes less pronounced when the strategy is based on the stock needs . in this case \n there are no rich agents , but instead a large concentration of middle - wealth agents . if the strategy adopted is to buy a random product , the long tail disappears and the middle - wealth peak is shifted to lower values than in the previous case . \n the situation can change when the economic conditions , as defined by the number of units of products and money in the economy , are changing . \n we will show that there is no best rule for all situations this is shown in fig . \n 3 , where we have changed the number of units of products , while keeping all other model values the same , in markets composed of equal numbers of agents employing two different strategies . in this case , where @xmath32 , each agent has a few of many possible products , thus representing an antique dealer market where there are many special items and no one can have everything . \n we see , in the upper panel , that for this market the  need \" strategy , is better than  profit \" above 10 units . however , below 10 units , the result is unstable , one strategy leading to better results than the other depending on the initial conditions . in the middle panel \n we see that the  random \" agents have a higher average wealth than the  profit \" motivated ones when the number of units is above 45 , the situation is reversed for a number of units below 35 , and there is unpredictability in between these two values . \n finally , the lower panel shows that  need \" works better than a  random \" strategy for all number of units in the range shown . for other parameter values \n , namely when the number of units of products and money is large , the  random \" strategy outperforms  need \" . \n in this last case , namely for @xmath33 , each agent typically has many copies of all products , which represent a mass production market with many copies of few items ; a supermarket world . in this case \n , a pairwise comparison of the three strategies shows an interesting situation , depicted in fig . 4 :  need \" outperforms  profit \" , which outperforms  random \" , which outperforms  need \" . \n so , in this case no strategy is better than both of the other strategies when studied pairwise .    in fig . \n 5 we explore the triple market further , implementing a market where there is only one agent with  need \" strategy among 25 agents with  profit \" and 25 agents with  noise \" as strategies , so that there are all together 51 agents . without the single  need \" strategy ,  random \n \" would outperform  profit \" with a large margin . \n a single  need \" agent in the system will slowly collect a large fraction of all products in the market . \n this is because it has a large competition advantage over the  profit \" , which overcompensates its disadvantage to the  random \" ones . if the number of  profit \" agents were reduced and that of the  random \" agents increased , the  need \" agent would do worse \n this illustrates the fact that the number of agents employing the different strategies is also determinant in the relative success of the agents adopting them . \n as we have seen , one may have different strategies for different agents . an interesting direction to extend \n this model is to let the agents to select the strategies they adopt in order to improve their performance . \n a further extension development would be to allow the strategies themselves to evolve . in the following \n we show a preliminary example of how the agents could choose strategies . \n a simple mechanism consists in updating , at fixed time intervals , the strategy of the poorest agent in the system . \n this agent just changes his present strategy to any of the other two , at random . the resulting time evolution for a system composed of 45 agents initially equally distributed according to their strategies is shown in fig . 6 . \n we see that , after an initial transient , the number of agents following the  need \" and  random \" strategies becomes approximately equal and constant for a considerable period of time , while the  profit \" strategy is followed by a small fraction of the agents . \n an increase in the  profit \" agents leads to a change in the conditions which lead the  random \" strategy to almost disappear from the system , to a dominance of  need \" , and the persistency of  profit \" at a very low level . from the fig . \n 4 we see that were it not for the existence of  profit \"- thinking agents ,  random \" would dominate over  need \" . \n the results shown in fig . \n 6 also demonstrate that the hierarchy  paper  stone  scissors \" illustrated in fig . \n 4 , for the same system , does not seem to lead , in the time interval considered , to alternations in the number of agents employing each strategy \n . there could be several reasons for this . \n one is that these changes take longer and longer time to alter enough the market conditions to significantly modify the performance of the different strategies . \n another is that while in fig . \n 4 one measures the average wealth of the agents using each of the three strategies , the criterium for changing strategies is based on the performance of poor agents , _ \n i.e. _ on the agents wealth distribution in the region close to the origin . as suggested by fig . \n 2 , a strategy yielding a higher average wealth than another , may also have a larger number of poor agents than the other . \n these issues need to be further explored for an appropriate strategy selection procedure and will be discussed in the future . \n compared to earlier models of market dynamics the model presented here has some new and related key features : there is local optimization of utility ( estimated market value ) and all trades are done locally without the equilibrizing effects of a global information pool . \n this gives arbitrage possibility which drives a dynamic and evolving market . \n earlier market models , such as the minority game , have a global information pool , and lack dynamical signals that could be associated with stock market fluctuations . \n the evolving boolean network for minority games of paczuski , bassler and corral @xcite , on the other hand , works with local information exchange , but the reward function is still global . also the frame of minority games makes it difficult to treat a multi - product market , which we believe is important for understanding real stock markets .    the model we propose is for a market composed of agents , goods and money ( or people , prices and products ) . \n we have demonstrated that such a market easily shows persistent fluctuations of wealth with time , and seen that the persistency is closely related to an interplay of having many products that influence each others trade probability . \n a similar result was obtained in the simpler model in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that persistency could arise even without money . \n the setup proposed here with agents and products with individual local prices allows for individual strategies of the agents . \n this opens for evolution of strategy as a part of the financial market , and we have seen that evolving strategies indeed give a dynamics where wealth is often rapidly redistributed .",

{"ContextTokens": 3509, "GeneratedTokens": 399, "SynthesizedBody": "astrophysical models can explain the origin of most nuclei beyond the iron group in a combination of processes involving neutron captures on long ( _ s _ process ) or short ( _ r _ process ) time scales @xcite . \n however , 32 stable , proton -

called @xmath0 or _ \n process , where proton - rich nuclei are made by sequences of photodisintegrations and @xmath11 decays @xcite . in this scenario , \n pre - existing seed nuclei from the _ s _ and _ r _ processes are destroyed by photodisintegration in a high - temperature environment , and proton - rich isotopes are produced by ( @xmath0__,n _ _ ) reactions . \n when ( @xmath0__,p _ _ ) and ( @xmath12 ) reactions become comparable or faster than neutron emission within an isotopic chain , the reaction path branches out and feeds nuclei with lower charge number _ \n z_. the decrease in temperature at later stages of the _ p _ process leads to a freeze - out via neutron captures and mainly @xmath11 decays , resulting in the typical _ \n p_-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath13mo ( _ _ n__=50 ) and @xmath14sm ( _ _ n__=82 ) . \n the currently most favored astrophysical site for the _ p _ process is explosive burning in type ii supernovae . \n the explosive shock front heats the outer o / ne shell of the progenitor star to temperatures of 2 - 3 gk , sufficient for providing the required photodisintegrations . following the nucleosynthesis in such astrophysical models , good agreement with the required _ \n production is found , with exception of the low ( _ _ a__@xmath4100 ) and intermediate ( 150@xmath15__a__@xmath15 165 ) mass range , which are underproduced by factors of 3 - 4 @xcite . \n because of these persisting problems , alternative scenarios ( such as type ia supernovae and x - ray bursters ) have been suggested , each with their own , inherent difficulties @xcite . currently , however , it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are due to a problem with astrophysical models or with the nuclear physics input , i.e. reaction rates . \n thus , a necessary requirement towards a consistent understanding of the _ p _ process is the reduction of uncertainties in nuclear data . by far most of the several hundreds of required photodisintegration rates and their inverses \n need to be inferred from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations @xcite , e.g. the codes non - smoker @xcite and most @xcite . \n experimental data can improve the situation in two ways , either by directly replacing predictions with measured cross sections in the relevant energy range , or by testing the reliability of predictions at other energies when the relevant energy range is not experimentally accessible .    the role of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) reactions in the _ p _ process was underestimated for a long time , although it is obvious that they have an influence on the final _ p_-process abundances . \n neutron captures compete with ( @xmath0,_n _ ) reactions and thus hinder the photodisintegration flux towards light nuclei , especially at lower-_z _ isotopes and even - even isotopes in the vicinity of branching - points . \n the influence of a variation of reaction rates on the final _ p _ abundances has been studied previously @xcite . \n it turned out that the _ p _ abundances are very sensitive to changes of the neutron - induced rates in the entire mass range , whereas the proton - induced and @xmath16-induced reaction rates are important at low and high mass numbers , respectively . \n rayet et al . \n @xcite have also studied the influence of several components in their _ \n p_-process network calculations . \n their nuclear flow schemes show that branching points occur even at light _ \n nuclei , and are shifted deeper into the proton - rich unstable region with increasing mass and temperature . in contradiction to woosley and howard @xcite , who claimed for their network calculations that ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) can be neglected except for the lightest nuclei ( _ _ a__@xmath1590 ) , rayet et al . also examined the influence of neutron reactions for temperatures between _ _ \n t__@xmath17= 2.2 and 3.2 gk by comparing overabundance factors if ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) reactions on _ _ z__@xmath626 nuclides are considered or completely suppressed . as a result , the overabundances were found to change by up to a factor 100 ( for @xmath3sr ) if the ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) channel was artificially suppressed . \n this rather high sensitivity indicates the need for reliable ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates to be used in _ \n p_-process networks . \n although recent efforts are directed to calculation or measurement of photodisintegration cross sections and rates @xcite , astrophysical photodisintegration rates can easily be inferred from capture rates by detailed balance , even in theoretical work @xcite . \n the stellar reaction rate n@xmath18@xmath4@xmath19@xmath6@xmath20@xmath21 for the reaction is related to its inverse rate by @xmath22 with the avogadro number _ n@xmath18 _ , the nuclear spins _ \n j _ and masses _ a _ , the respective temperature - dependent partition functions _ \n g(t ) _ and the reaction _ q _ value in the exponent . \n measuring or calculating a rate in the direction of positive _ q _ value ensures best numerical accuracy and consistency between forward and backward reaction . \n this is important when implementing those rates in reaction networks for nucleosynthesis models .    moreover , stellar cross sections and rates have to be employed for the computation of reverse rates . in a stellar environment \n , nuclei are fully thermalized with the environment , resulting in a thermal excitation of both the target and the final nucleus . \n only stellar cross sections including the excitation in form of a stellar enhancement factor ( sef ) can be used to properly account for all transitions when applying detailed balance . for reactions with positive _ q _ \n values for captures , a laboratory measurement of the capture cross section will encompass by far more of the relevant transitions than a photodisintegration experiment , even with the target being in the ground state @xcite .    for the past decade \n there has been a continuing effort to measure nuclear data for the _ p _ process , both for charged particle reactions @xcite and for neutron induced reactions @xcite . \n the present work comprises the first measurement of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) cross sections for the _ p_-process isotopes @xmath2se and @xmath3sr at _ _ \n kt__= 25 kev , with the aim to improve the _ \n p_-process database and to help testing theoretical predictions . since it is not possible to measure cross sections directly at _ \n p_-process temperatures of _ \n _ kt__= 170 - 260 kev , we have to perform the measurements at _ s_-process ( and freeze - out ) temperatures of _ _ kt__= 25 kev , and then extrapolate theoretically by means of the respective energy dependent cross sections ( see sec .  [ \n theory ] ) . \n the measurement of stellar ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates requires a `` stellar '' neutron source yielding neutrons with a maxwell - boltzmann energy distribution . \n we achieve this by making use of the @xmath1li(_p , n_)@xmath1be reaction . in combination with the activation or time - of - flight technique , \n this offers a unique tool for comprehensive studies of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates and cross sections for astrophysics .    in sec . \n [ exp ] , the experimental technique and sample characteristics are outlined , followed by the description of the data analysis in sec .

cooled cu backing with protons of 1912 kev , 30 kev above the reaction threshold . \n the resulting quasi - stellar neutron spectrum approximates a maxwellian distribution for _ _ \n kt__= @xcite . \n hence , the proper stellar capture cross section can be directly deduced from our measurement .    for the activations natural samples of selenium metal ( 0.89% @xmath2se ) and various strontium compounds ( 0.56% @xmath3sr ) were used . in order to verify the stoichiometry , \n samples of sr(oh)@xmath24 and srf@xmath24 were dried at 300@xmath25c and 800@xmath25c , respectively . \n the powders were pressed to thin pellets , which were enclosed in a 15 @xmath23 m thick aluminium foil and sandwiched between 10 - 30 @xmath23 m thick gold foils of the same diameter . in this way the neutron flux can be determined relative to the well - known capture cross section of @xmath26au @xcite . \n the activation measurements were carried out with the van de graaff accelerator operated in dc mode with a current of @xmath27100  @xmath23a . \n the mean neutron flux over the period of the activations was @xmath271.5@xmath2810@xmath29 _ \n n_/s at the position of the samples , which were placed in close geometry to the li target . throughout the irradiation \n the neutron flux was recorded in intervals of 1  min using a @xmath30li -

[ \n fig : phase_dep ] ) . \n this suggests that these spectral components are physically related . \n we have searched for any _ orbital _ phase dependence of this relation . \n pulse phase resolved spectra were accumulated over orbital phases 0.060.45 and 0.450.72 ( center of eclipse occurs at phase 0.0 ) . \n there is no significant difference in the behavior of the different fit parameters in the two data sets . \n the lecs results are consistent with the illuminated inner part of the accretion disk being the reprocessing site . in a model where the accretion disk intercepts a fraction of the hard x - ray beam ( which is then reprocessed ) a 180@xmath10  phase difference between the hard x - rays and the reprocessed x - rays is expected . if the disk is tilted with respect to the rotation axis of the neutron star the phase difference can be different from 180@xmath10 . since we find a @xmath1250@xmath10  phase difference , this is consistent with a `` tilted '' disk ( for a more detailed discussion see mccray et al . \n @xcite ) . a way to test \n this is to observe  at other @xmath6 . \n if the tilt of the disk varies with @xmath6 , as predicted by the precessing disk models ( _ e.g. _  gerend & boynton 1980 ) , the phase difference should change . \n unfortunately , both the _ bepposax _  observation and that of mccray et al . \n ( 1982 ) were performed at approximately the same @xmath6 . \n we searched for a change in the phase difference using data obtained during the first and last 50  ksec of our observation ( i.e.  a total of @xmath112  ksec exposure time ) . \n we find a decrease of 11@xmath3050@xmath10   which is inconclusive , mainly due to uncertainties in the determination of the peak of the broad soft pulse . \n choi et al . ( 1994 ) find that the intensity of the 6.4  kev fe  k line is modulated in phase with the `` soft '' component reported by mccray et al . \n the lecs data is of insufficient quality to investigate this relation , due to the low count rate and penetration effects in the instrument ( cf . \n parmar et al . \n however , it appears likely that both the fe l and k lines exhibit a similar modulation , and thus have the same origin . \n kallman ( 1995 ) discusses fe l / k emission line ratios and mean line energies in photoionized gases . \n the line ratio depends on the shape of the ionizing continuum , the column density of the emitting material and the ionization parameter @xmath31 ( tarter et al . \n the mean line energies increase with @xmath31 , ranging from 0.750 to 1.29  kev and 6.40 to 6.95  kev for fe l and k , respectively . \n combining the calculations of kallman ( 1995 ) with the line energies and intensities given in table  [ tab : ave_fits ] and assuming a power - law continuum with @xmath2 in the range 0.51.0 allows @xmath31 and  to be constrained to be 10100 and @xmath32  , respectively . \n the blackbody component could be reprocessed emission originating at higher optical depths in the disk . \n if the reprocessing region is located at the magnetospheric radius of 3000  km , then the derived value of @xmath31 and the peak power - law luminosity of @xmath33 gives an  of only @xmath34@xmath35  for a beam opening angle of 0.1 ( @xmath36 ) . \n however , it is likely that the reprocessing region is not a single layer with uniform density , but more complex , such that there are no unique values of  and @xmath31 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1452105092257, "RequestID": "287e1ec22f7b41cab942bf918c8195fe", "TotalTokens": 4025}

{"ContextTokens": 3629, "GeneratedTokens": 176, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the solutions currently discussed in the field of quantum communication @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is a quantum repeater @xcite . \n its construction is not so simple as building classic amplifier because of non - cloning theorem which is one of the most basic and important foundations of quantum mechanics . \n however , the lack of ability of making perfect copies of quantum information may be compensated with use of teleportation and the phenomenon of entanglement . \n the protocol of quantum teleportation may be utilized to amplify the signal i.e. a quantum state during the transfer process . \n this approach may be used , e.g. in a fiber , to improve the quality of transferred information . applying the teleportation protocol and the entanglement to amplify the quantum information results with building of so - called quantum repeater ( qr ) . \n it should be emphasized that the notion of qr is currently in the center of interest of many researchers @xcite , @xcite . \n apart from the theoretical analysis of this subject there are also physical experiments carried out with use of qrs as the elements of quantum networks . \n these experiments are being accomplished for the transmission of quantum states in an optical fiber @xcite and also in the air @xcite . \n therefore , the progress in the field of quantum computing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is strongly connected with the progress of quantum communication because of the need to send information . \n the notion of qr is currently discussed as a potential solution to the problems of quantum communication and cryptography ( especially for quantum key distribution ) . \n the three generations of qr were presented do far . \n the first type utilizes the phenomenon of entanglement and its purification @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n the second generation @xcite is based on the near - perfectly entangled pairs generation ( however , in this approach still the entanglement purification is used ) . \n the third type @xcite , @xcite of qr utilizes the protocol of teleportation . \n the quantum information is transmitted from one point to another , so the communication is organized as a one - way scheme . \n the solution presented in this chapter belongs to the third generation of qr and it uses so - called one - dit teleportation protocol to correct the errors which may appear during the transfer process . the novelty of described solution consists on using only pauli - z gate for error correction . \n more precisely : the result of measurement performed during the teleportation protocol determines the number of pauli - z operations which have to realized as an error correction . \n the reminder of this chapter is organized as follows . in section ( [ lbl : \n sec : single : dit : teleportation : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) there is a quantum teleportation protocol presented and the error correction is performed with use of pauli - z gate . \n section ( [ lbl : sec : protocol : quantum : repeater : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) describes the realization of qr with use of previously mentioned teleportation protocol . \n the interpretation of repeater protocol as a quantum circuit is shown in section ( [ lbl : sec : qc : for : qr : network : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) . \n the summary and the final conclusions are presented in section ( [ lbl : sec : conclusions : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) . \n the protocols presented in this section are defined with notions of dits and qudits . \n a concept of dit is a generalization of classic bit . \n for classic bit there can be distinguished only two states : zero and one . in the case of dit \n more states are possible . \n the number of these values is symbolized by the letter @xmath0 . \n for example , the classic bit is a dit with @xmath1 . \n a unit of quantum information is so - called qubit . \n a definition of qubit may be presented as : @xmath2 where vectors @xmath3 , @xmath4 stand for the computational base ( in this case the standard base is used ) : @xmath5 , \\enspace \\vert 1 \\rangle = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ 1\\\\ \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] these vectors represent the classic states zero and one .    by analogy , \n a generalization of qubit is a qudit . in this case \n more base states are admissible . \n the state of unknown qudit with @xmath0 base states is represented as : @xmath6 the number of base states for a given qudit , expressed as @xmath0 , will be also called a qudit s freedom level . \n standard base for qudits requires more vectors e.g. for so - called qutrits ( qudits with @xmath7 ) standard basis vectors  are : @xmath8,\\enspace { | 1 \\rangle } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right],\\enspace { | 2 \\rangle } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ]    the presented repeater protocol is realized as a single - dit teleportation protocol . \n the described protocol differs from other one - dit protocols @xcite , @xcite in this way that only pauli - z gate is used as a correction gate . \n the pauli - z ( or just @xmath9 ) gate for qudits may be defined as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 stands for the root of unity : @xmath12 more precisely , @xmath13 is a @xmath0-th root number @xmath14 of unity . \n the symbol @xmath15 represents the imaginary unit . \n there are also hadamard gate and cnot gate used . \n definitions of these gates for qudits are : @xmath16 where @xmath17 . in the case of cnot gate \n the @xmath18 gate may be given as well - this gate is obtained as the hermitian conjugate of cnot operation . \n the @xmath18 gate is useful for a quantum teleportation protocol described in this section . \n the exemplary matrix form of cnot gate for qutrits ( @xmath7 ) is : @xmath19 where the zeros were replaced by dots to make the notation more legible . in general , the cnot gate for qudits is constructed in a following way : @xmath20 where the symbol @xmath21 stands for matrix direct sum and @xmath22 means the negation operation for qudit with freedom level @xmath0 . \n the gates , mentioned above , allow to present the teleportation protocol of an unknown quantum state : @xmath23 the 3-qudit state @xmath24 , where @xmath25 belongs to alice and @xmath26 to bob , after performing the hadamard , cnot and @xmath18 operations on it , due to fig . \n [ lbl : fig : circuit : teleporation : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] , may be described as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 . \n the gates cnot and @xmath18 realize the entanglement . \n function @xmath29 is expressed as : @xmath30 a correction gate s form depends on the result of measurement performed on the first qudit by alice ( however , both qudits are measured in the standard base what is a consequence of hadamard gate s use in a quantum cirucit \n see fig . \n [ lbl : fig : one - way - quantum - repeater : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) . \n if alice , after the measurement , obtains one of given states @xmath31 then the bob s qudit is characterized by the proper values of probability amplitudes and there is no additional operations needed to correct the obtained state . \n this also stands with the accordance to the values of function @xmath29 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 - they equal zero . \n if alice , also after the operation of measurement , obtains one of following states @xmath34 then the state of bob \n s qudit is @xmath35 the values of @xmath29 function in this case are following : @xmath36 when the @xmath9 gate is used only once , then the correct values of some amplitudes may be recovered . in general \n , the result of measurement determines the number of operations @xmath9 which should be performed . \n it can be expressed as @xmath37 if @xmath38 stands for the result of measurement performed on the first qudit . \n the above description presents the teleportation protocol for an unknown qudit , where @xmath9 gate is needed to correct the final state and only one measurement decides about the way how the correction is done after the teleportation process .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     although the suggested number of qudits needed to carry a correct simulation is @xmath39 , it should be emphasized that the phenomenon of entanglement occurs inside of repeaters . \n it means that the entanglement is present in a teleportation process and it occurs between three qudits which consist the repeater itself . \n there is no entanglement between particular repeaters . \n this assumption makes easier the implementation of mentioned quantum phenomena with use of classic computers . \n it is also important to know that the repeaters are connected physically ( e.g. optical fiber ) with suitable quantum channel . \n if the numeric or symbolic simulation is to be carried out on a classic machine , then only the three - qudit repeater needs to be simulated . \n the features of communication channel , which transmits a quantum state , may be simulated apart from the simulation of qr .    .... \n -- n : numer of nodes -- i : index of node -- $ \\mket{\\psi_0}$ : initial state -- h : change history of the transmitted state    h $ \\leftarrow$ append(h , $ \\mket{\\psi_0}$ , 0 ) [ $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r ] $ \\leftarrow$ qrepeater ( $ \\mket{\\psi_0}$ ) h $ \\leftarrow$ append(h , $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r ) $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ $ \\leftarrow$ \n $ z^r \\mket{\\psi_t}$ while i < n do begin      [ $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r ] $ \\leftarrow$ qrepeater ( $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r )      ...      other operations \n e.g. noise generation      entanglement level measuring and etc .      ...      h $ \\leftarrow$ append(h , $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r )      $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ $ \\leftarrow$ \n $ z^r \\mket{\\psi_t}$          i $ \\leftarrow$ i + 1 end $ \\mket{\\psi_{final}}$ $ \\leftarrow$ $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ ....    fig . \n [ lbl : fig : classical - sim - of - quantum - repeater : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] presents the pseudo - code illustrating the simulation s algorithm for a given state . \n the changes are saved in a classic variable @xmath40 which collects the quantum states obtained after the calculations in every node . \n the initial state is assigned to variable @xmath41 and the final state to @xmath42 . \n the one - dit teleportation protocol with error correction performed by pauli - z gate allows the realization of qr for transmitting the unknown qudit state . \n two presented strategies for z - type error correction provide the choice to the user who can run the protocol with the error correction at the end of the whole process or the correction may be performed locally on every qr . \n the approach with the correction at the end of transmisssion reduces the use of z gate application . \n we use this gate only at the end of the process to complete the communication protocol by correcting the received information . \n this solution excludes the need of using pauli - x and hadamard gates , which are utilized in other known protocols for qr realization . \n the advantages connected with presented approach are : the influence of possible errors , caused by the imperfect realization of quantum gates , is lower and the construction of qr is easier because only the operation of measurement have to be performed ( the error correction is redundant ) . \n the another interesting problem for further research is using quantum error correcting codes on transmitted state . \n the presented protocol concerns the pure states , so it would be also important to analyze the quality of transmitted information taking into account the quality of utilized quantum gates and the influence of environment . \n we would like to thank for useful discussions with the  _ q -

the quality of fit is much worse than solutions without a ple . \n by contrast , there is no suggestion of a ple at the location reported in purc97 ( @xmath11 = -2@xmath0 , 7@xmath0 ) in either of the positronium continuum maps . shown in figure 2 \n are 1@xmath0 wide cuts cuts through the four maps , taken at 70@xmath0 relative to the negative - longitude galactic plane . \n it is apparent that the four curves are consistent with the same distribution towards negative latitudes , but differ at positive latitudes . \n the lower panel of figure 2 shows the positive latitude cut after subtraction of the mirror negative latitude cut . \n the enhancement at 511 kev has a corresponding _ deficit _ for positronium continuum for both mapping algorithms . \n an enhancement of 511 kev emission that is due to an additional source of positrons ( relative to the galaxy - wide bulge and disk components ) would be expected to feature an enhancement of both annihilation components . for the lowest f@xmath7 value of zero \n , we would expect the positronium continuum emission to be symmetric and the 511 kev line emission to be enhanced . a positronium continuum _ deficit _ at positive latitudes would not be expected . \n if , alternatively , the ple is a region with no excess of positrons but is where the local f@xmath7 varies from the integrated f@xmath7=0.94 ( suggested both by osse analysis@xcite , and by wide fov germanium detectors@xcite ) , then the 511 kev line emission could be enhanced and the positronium continuum emission could be deficient . \n however , variations of the f@xmath7 it do not conserve photon flux . the 1:1 enhancement - to - deficit ratio suggested in figure \n 2b would not be expected . \n a third possibility is that the enhancement is instead due to the influence of gamma - ray sources that corrupt the spectral fitting . \n two possible mechanisms for this biasing could be from observations made while a source is exhibiting a hard x - ray flare , and/or if the source exhibits a previously undetected hard tail . the fact that both the line and positronium continuum components peak at 511 kev combined with the 45 kev fwhm energy resolution of the osse instrument mean that as many as 30% of the counts at that energy are due to positronium continuum photons . \n it is unclear whether flaring gamma - ray sources can bias the the spectral fitting to a large enough extent to entirely account for the apparent asymmetry in the annihilation radiation . \n a few compact sources which produce this type of biasing have been identified . at the present time , it has not been established which of the three explanations is correct . the cgro / batse instrument made observations of these sources which were nearly simultaneous with the osse observations@xcite . \n it is an objective of the current analysis effort to determine whether joint analysis of osse & batse observations of these sources will permit the unambiguous extraction of annihilation radiation from this complex environment . \n fortunately , although other regions of the inner galactic radian may be similarly biased , the majority of the region is not expected to have been affected . \n the wealth of information available both from the complete osse data - set as well as from the expanding data - set of monitoring of compact sources with the batse instrument may permit definitive statements as to the galactic distribution of positron annihilation radiation , particularly of the existence of a ple . \n johnson , w.n . \n , et al . _ \n apjs _ , * 86 * , 693 ( 1993 ) . \n share , g.h . \n , et al . , _ apj _ * 326 * , 717 ( 1988 ) . \n harris , m.j . \n , et al . , _ apj _ * 501 * , l55 ( 1998 ) . \n ore , a. & powell , j.l . \n , _ phys rev _ , * 75 * , 11 ( 1949 ) . gehrels , n. , et al . \n _ apj _ , * 375 * , l13 ( 1991 ) . \n purcell , w.r . , et al . \n , _ apj _ * 491 * , 725 ( 1997 ) . \n cheng , l .- x . , et al . \n , _ apj _ * 481 * , l43 ( 1997 ) . \n dermer , c.d . & \n skibo , j.g . , _ apj _ * 487 * , l57 ( 1997 ) . \n kinzer , r.l . , et al . , _ a & as _ * 120 * , 317 ( 1996 ) . \n kinzer , r.l . , et al . , _ \n apj -submitted _ , ( 2001 ) . \n milne , p.a . \n et al . , _ astro . \n * 38 * , 441 ( 1998 ) . \n milne , p.a . \n et al . , _ in proceedings of the 5th compton symposium _ , 21 ( 1999 ) . \n kinzer , r.l . , \n purcell w.r . , & kurfess , j.d . , \n _ apj _ * 515 * , 215 ( 1999 ) . \n harmon , b.a . \n , et al . _ in proceedings of the 1st compton symposium _ , 69 ( 1992 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1477474768296, "RequestID": "c45e756ca2a7405e9cbf74a7d222cc70", "TotalTokens": 2969}

{"ContextTokens": 3351, "GeneratedTokens": 286, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years the manufacturing of freeform surfaces has become increasingly feasible . \n these freeform surfaces offer an elegant way of simultaneous irradiance and phase control . \n therefore , the development of numerical algorithms for the calculation of continuous freeform surfaces for control of the irradiance and/or the phase of a beam is of great interest . \n + in this work the problem of designing continuous double freeform surfaces in a geometrical optics approximation is considered , in which two collimated beams of arbitrary irradiance are mapped onto each other . \n several methods for phase and irradiance control with double freeform surfaces have been proposed in literature . \n + one of the first design methods for the mapping of two wavefronts by coupled freeform surfaces is the simultaneous multiple surface ( sms ) method , which was developed by benitez and miano @xcite . \n the surfaces are thereby constructed from generalized cartesian ovals and by applying constant optical path length ( opl ) conditions@xcite . \n the design method can be utilized for numerous applications in imaging and nonimaging optics@xcite . + \n zhang et al . \n @xcite and shengqian et al . \n @xcite solve the design problem by describing it in the form of a monge - ampre type pde , discretizing the equation by finite differences and then solving the resulting nonlinear equation system by the newton method . \n the design method can be applied to a variety of wavefront shapes @xcite . \n + an alternative approach to construct freeform surfaces for irradiance and phase control is from ray mapping methods@xcite . \n these methods are based on the seperation of the design process into two separate steps : the calculation of an _ integrable _ ray mapping between the source and the target irradiance and the subsequent construction of the _ continuous _ freeform surfacesfrom the mapping . \n the integrability thereby ensures the continuity of the freeform surfaces and the mapping of the input irradiance onto the ouptut irradiance . since the integrability depends on the physical properties of the optical system it is in general a nontrivial task to find such a mapping . + \n as shown in several publications , there is a strong relation between the inverse problem of nonimaging optics and optimal mass transport ( omt)@xcite . \n the cost function , which has to be applied to a certain optical configuration , is thereby problem - specific . \n for example , the mapping of two collimated beams with arbitrary irradiance onto each other with double freeform _ mirrors _ is described by a quadratic cost function @xcite and can be solved by corresponding numerical schemes@xcite . the same problem statement with double freeform _ lenses _ , which is considered in this work , \n is described by a different cost function , which depends on the opl between the freeform surfaces as it was shown by rubinstein and wolansky@xcite . \n + the investigations presented here are inspired by several publications @xcite , in which the authors applied the quadratic omt cost function to calculate a ray mapping to deal with the lens design problem . with this ray mapping \n , designs have been demonstrated of both single freeform surfaces for irradiance control for collimated input beams and point sources @xcite , and that of double freeform surfaces for irradiance and phase control@xcite . as demonstrated for illumination control with single freeform surfaces in ref . \n @xcite and for collimated beam shaping with double freeform surfaces in ref . \n @xcite the design problems are thereby restricted to a paraxial approximation . \n + here we first investigate the design by ray - mapping methods of double freeform surfaces which map two collimated beams with arbitrary irradiance onto each other _ beyond _ the paraxial approximation . to overcome the restriction to the paraxial regime , which is necessary for the construction of compact systems \n , the design problem will be modeled by two coupled pde s . \n this involves on one hand the jacobian equation , expressing the local energy conservation , and on the other hand a ray mapping pde , enforcing the surface continuity and the constant opl . \n the pdes will then be solved by an optimization scheme with the omt mapping from the quadratic cost function as the intial iterate , leading to a construction approach for the freeform surfaces . \n + to do so , the work is structured as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , by using the law of refraction , the constant opl condition and a surface continuity condition , a pde for an integrable ray mapping , is derived . together with the jacobian equation it builds a system of pdes for the determination of the mapping components . \n it is argued that the pde system is fulfilled within the paraxial approximation by the quadratic cost function omt map . in section [ sec:3 ] , a method for solving the pde system for general lens lens distances is presented . \n it is based on discretizing the pdes with finite differences and solving the resulting system of nonlinear equations by a standard optimization scheme with the quadratic cost function omt map as the initial iterate . \n a summary of the design algorithm and a detailed discussion of the implemenation is presented in section [ sec:4 ] , followed by the application of the presented method to the design of a single - lens and a two - lens system in section [ sec:5 ] . \n finally , in section [ sec:6 ] , a short discussion of the results is presented . \n in ref . @xcite \n a design method was presented for the construction of a single freeform surface for a collimated input beam with irradiance @xmath0 and an arbitrary illumination pattern @xmath1 on a target plane . \n it was shown that in the paraxial approximation the design process can be decoupled into two separate steps . in the first step \n a raymapping @xmath2 is calculated from the theory of optimal mass transport , and in the second step the freeform surface is constructed from the mapping . \n + there are several basic physical principles that a ray mapping needs to fulfill . \n firstly , to map the source irradiance @xmath0 onto the target irradiance @xmath1 , the ray mapping should be energy conserving . \n the local energy conservation is expressed through the jacobian eq . \n @xmath3 secondly , in case of freeform illumination optics , the mapping should allow the calculation of _ continuous _ freeform surfaces . \n as shown in several publications , these so called _ integrable _ ray mappings are related to problem - specific cost functions representing different optical settings , where one has to distinguish between point sources and/or collimated beams , mirrors and/or lenses and so on@xcite . \n the cost function defines a metric between the source distribution @xmath0 and the target illumination pattern @xmath1 and therefore represents an additional constraint to the underdetermined eq . \n ( [ eq:1 ] ) . in the case of a single freeform surface for the redistribution of collimated input beams , the quadratic cost function @xmath4 which is valid in the paraxial approximation , was studied by the authors@xcite . a key property there was the vanishing curl @xmath5 characterizing the quadratic cost function in eq . ( [ eq:2 ] ) @xcite . \n + as shown by rubinstein and wolansky , the cost function for collimated beam shaping with double freeform _ lenses _ takes a different form than eq . \n ( [ eq:2])@xcite . \n the authors propose to minimize the corresponding cost function by a steepest descent algorithm to get the ray mapping@xcite , but unfortunatly a numerically stable implementation is a nontrivial problem . \n + due to its applicability in the paraxial approximation ( see below ) and the availability of numerous published stable numerical schemes for its calculation , the quadratic cost function omt mapping serves as an initial iterate for the optimization scheme presented below . it will therefore build the basis of the design approach presented in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] .      [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the freeform calculation with the initial maps @xmath6 shows strong deviations from the predefined specifications , whereas the optimized maps @xmath7 show high quality illumination patterns and a wavefront uniformity beyond the diffraction limit . \n remaining deviations from the ideal wavefront result ( besides fundamental numerical limitiations ) are from eq . \n ( [ eq:14b ] ) , which is not fulfilled exactly and therefore leads to an error accumulation along the integration path of eqs . \n ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] ) . \n the precision of the illumination pattern on the other hand is mainly limited by the precision of @xmath6 . \n the main deviations from the predefined distribution @xmath1 are resulting from steep gradients , which can be seen especially for the example  iap \" in fig . \n [ fig:6]d ) . \n this is in agreement with fig . [ \n fig:3]b ) and observations which were made in ref . @xcite . \n a design method for the calculation of compact continuous double freeform surfaces for collimated beam shaping with complex irradiance patterns was presented . \n the method is based on the ray mapping condition ( [ eq:14b ] ) , which was derived from the law of refraction and the surface continuity condition in section [ sec:2 ] and builds together with the jacobian eq . \n ( [ eq:14a ] ) a system of nonlinear pdes for the unknown ray mapping @xmath8 . \n + due to the satisfaction of eq . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) for infinite lens distances by the mapping from omt with the quadratic cost function ( [ eq:2 ] ) , this mapping serves as an ideal initial iterate for an optimization approach for solving the system of eq . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) . as it was shown by approximating the eqs . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) by finite differences and using a standard optimization scheme from matlab s optimization toolbox one can ensure a fast convergence to the solution of the eqs . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) . \n this was demonstrated by applying the presented method to two design examples with complex target distributions and validating the results by ray tracing . \n the double freeform surfaces showed thereby high accuracy for the irradiance patterns and the wavefront , which was assessed by the calculation of the corresponding @xmath9 values of the normalized differences . \n + further improvements can be made by using omt methods for more complex boundaries of the source and target distributions , which requires the replacement of sulman s method ( with e.g. @xcite ) and the generalization of eq . \n ( [ eq:16 ] ) to more complex boundary shapes . \n the scalability of the distance of the initial map @xmath6 by @xmath10 to the solution of the eqs . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) suggests the application of e.g. the newton algorithm for a faster optimization . \n + in our future research , we want to generalize the presented approach to double freeform surfaces for wavefronts different from the plane case , like e.g. spherical wavefronts . \n the authors want to thank ralf hambach and mateusz oleszko for valuable discussions , johannes stock for comments on the manuscript and david musick for a grammar and spelling check \n . we also want to acknowledge the federal ministry of education and research germany for financial support through the project fo+ ( fkz : o3wkck1d ) and kosimo ( fkz:031pt609x ) .      p. benitez and j. c. miano , `` simultaneous multiple surface optical design method in three dimensions , '' opt . eng . * \n 43*(7 ) , 14891502 ( 2004 ) . \n j. chaves , `` introduction to nonimaging optics , second edition '' , crc press , 2015 , 321406 .        c. shengqian , r. wu , a. li , and z. zheng , `` design beam shapers with double freeform surfaces to form a desired wavefront with prescribed illumination pattern by solving a monge - ampre type equation , '' j. opt . * \n 18*(12 ) , 125602 ( 2016 ) . t. glimm and v.i . \n oliker , `` optical design of single reflector systems and the monge-kantorovich mass transfer problem , '' j. o. math . sc . * 117*(3 ) , 40964018 ( 2003 ) . \n t. glimm and v.i . \n oliker , `` optical design of two - reflector systems , the monge - kantorovich mass transfer problem and fermat s principle , '' indiana university math . \n j. * 53*(5 ) , 12551277 ( 2004 ) . \n x .- j . wang , `` on the design of a reflector antenna ii , '' calc . var . * 20*(3 ) , 329 - 341 ( 2004 ) . \n j. rubinstein and g. wolansky , `` intensity control with a free - form lens , '' j. opt . \n a * 24*(2 ) , 463469 ( 2007 ) . \n t. glimm , `` a rigorous analysis using optimal transport theory for a two - reflector design problem with a point source , '' inverse problems * 26*(4 ) , p. 16 \n oliker , `` designing freeform lenses for intensity and phase control of coherent light with help from geometry and mass transport , '' arch . \n rational mech . \n 201*(3 ) , 1013 - 1045 ( 2011 ) . \n oliker , j. rubinstein , and g. wolansky , `` ray mapping and illumination control , '' j. photon . energy * \n 3*(1 ) , 035599 ( 2013 ) .                  l.l . \n doskolovich , e.a . \n bezus , m.a . \n moiseev , d.a . \n bykov , and n.l . \n kazanskiy , `` analytical source - target mapping method for the design of freeform mirrors generating prescribed 2d intensity distributions , '' opt . \n express * 24*(10 ) , 1096210971 ( 2016 )", "StartTimeOffset": 1488217030779, "RequestID": "2c09909921624cb8aa796a32c9f83692", "TotalTokens": 3637}

abelian three - gluon - vertex at tree level and thus allows for an measurement of the colour factors @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 of qcd . \n this in turn may be used to put exclusion limits on light gluinos . \n furthermore the qcd process is a background to w - pair production , when both w s decay hadronically and to certain channels of the search of the higgs boson like @xmath6 . \n the one - loop matrix elements required for an nlo study of four - jet production are also an essential input for an nnlo calculation of three - jet production . \n the latter one would be needed to reduce theoretical uncertainties in the extraction of the strong coupling at the z - pole .    in general leading - order calculations in qcd \n give a rough description of the process under consideration , but they suffer from large uncertainties . \n the arbitrary choice of the renormalization scale gives rise to an ambiguity , which is reduced only in an next - to - leading order calculation . \n furthermore the internal structure of a jet and the sensitivity to the merging procedure of the jet algorithm are modelled only in an nlo analysis . \n both uncertainties are related to the appearance of logarithms , ultraviolet in nature in the first case , infrared in the latter , which are calculated explicitly only in an nlo calculation . \n a nlo calculation proceeds in two steps : first , one needs the relevant amplitudes , in our case @xmath7 and @xmath8 at tree level and @xmath7 at one loop . among these , the one - loop amplitudes are the most complicated ones and we will comment on their calculation in the next section . \n the second step requires setting up a numerical monte carlo program which has to deal with infrared divergences . \n we will focus on this point in the third section . in the last section we will give some numerical results . \n we used a variety of modern techniques in order to calculate the one - loop amplitudes efficiently . \n these include colour decomposition , where amplitudes are decomposed into simpler gauge - invariant partial amplitudes with definite colour structure , and the spinor helicity method , which consists in expressing all lorentz four - vectors and dirac spinors in terms of massless two - component weyl - spinors . \n their use divides the task into smaller , more manageable pieces . also a decomposition inspired by supersymmetry proved to be useful , where the particles running around the loop are reexpressed in terms of supermultiplets . in a second step \n the cut technique and factorization in collinear limits are used to constrain the analytic form of the partial amplitudes .    as an example \n we explain in more detail the cut technique @xcite , which is based on unitarity . to obtain the coefficients of the basic box , triangle or bubble integrals \n one considers the cuts in all possible channels . \n each phase - space integral is rewritten with the help of the cutkosky rules as the imaginary part of a loop amplitude . \n the power of this method lies within the fact , that on each side of the cut one has a full tree amplitude and not just a single feynman diagram . \n this method allows one to reconstruct the one - loop amplitude up to terms without an imaginary part . \n the remaining terms were obtained by examining the collinear limits .    for the reduction of tensor pentagon integrals we used a new reduction algorithm @xcite , based on the schouten identity and weyl spinors , which does not introduce artifical gram determinants in the denominator . \n the one - loop amplitudes for the first subprocess @xmath9 were calculated in refs . @xcite and the amplitudes for the second subprocess @xmath1 @xmath10 in refs . @xcite . \n the calculations of the two groups agree with each other . \n the second major part of a general purpose nlo program for four jets is coding the one - loop amplitudes and the five parton tree - level amplitudes in a numerical monte carlo program . at leading order \n the task is relatively simple : one parton corresponds to one jet . at nlo however , a jet can be modeled by two partons . at nlo \n the cross section receives contributions from the virtual corrections and the real emission part . \n only the sum of them is infrared finite , whereas when taken separately , each part gives a divergent contribution . \n several methods to handle this problem exist , such as the phase -

type non - equilibrium model ( groups a , b and empty ) , with spin - exchange dynamics at zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) on a 2-dimensional square lattice . \n although the model describes a segregation by a quench without external reasons , unwanted frozen states may also occur . \n recently it was shown by computer simulations @xcite that there exists a simpler model , namely the glauber - ising model @xcite , which captures the essence of human segregation . \n besides that , the usage of the simple @xmath1 spin - flip dynamics makes it computationally easier and one can avoid the frozen states of the schelling model . in this model \n the temperature plays the role of a global tolerance ; by varying it , the model may or may not evolve into the ordered ( segregated ) state . \n however a constant , global tolerance is rather artificial in a society , it can vary from individual to individual and can change in time as well . by introducing a local , time dependent temperature ( tolerance ) , with a feedback mechanism from the local neighborhood \n the model becomes more realistic . \n the results do not change too much @xcite , a self - organization of the average temperature occurs . \n the parameters of this model are the global rate of forgetting ( of tolerance ) and the response of local tolerances on the neighborhood . \n the sum of these local changes determine the local temperature . \n hereafter this self - organized segregation model will be called so - seg model .    stepping further towards more realistic models \n , one can pose the question what happens to this model if the decision of individuals are affected by an independent external noise as well . \n the external noise can be an artifact of a random environment , housing , moving situation , presence of shopping centers ... etc . \n the external noise introduced here as a second temperature , i.e. individuals are connected to a second heath bath . \n two - temperature two - state voter - type models have been investigated intensively recently and have become the prototypes of non - equilibrium models ( for a review see @xcite ) . \n an important finding of these studies was the discovery of relevant factors affecting the phase transitions of models exhibiting @xmath2 ( up - down ) symmetry @xcite . \n in particular models with general , isotropic spin - flip dynamics maintaining the @xmath2 symmetry can be classified as two temperature models , where one temperature controls the bulk , the other the interface fluctuations . \n the ising model is a special case of these models , where both temperatures are nonzero and the time - reversal symmetry drives the system into an equilibrium state . the transition of these @xmath2 symmetric , two - temperature models has been found to be continuous , ising type unless the bulk temperature is zero . in the latter case \n it is first order , voter model class type @xcite . in this work \n i investigate the effect of a second temperature applied as an external , independent heat - bath to the spins of the so - seg model . \n the model is defined on 2-dimensional square lattice , with periodic boundary conditions and ising spins ( @xmath3 ) distributed initially randomly ( zero initial magnetization = no segregation ) . \n the kinetics follows a glauber spin - flip ( sequential ) update with heath bath acceptance rate ( see ref .  ) , depending on the local temperatures . in the so - seg model \n each individual has four interacting nearest neighbors and a randomized initial local temperature , with an average value @xmath4 . \n this local temperature is lowered by @xmath5 at each update for modeling the loss of tolerance . \n this alone would just make a quench to @xmath6 with domain coarsening . \n to model people s awareness of the dangers of segregation they can increase their own temperature ( tolerance ) by @xmath7 , if all four neighbors of an individual belong to the same group as @xmath8 . \n if all four neighbors belong to the different group the local temperature is decreased by the same amount . \n our external noise is described by a heat bath of a second temperature @xmath9 applied to the decisions \n . the actual spin - flip will be the logical or of internal and external flip decisions . \n the magnetization @xmath10 , the average number of like neighbors minus unlike neighbors @xmath11 , and the average self - organizing internal temperature ( tolerance ) @xmath12 is followed up to @xmath13 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) of the lattice . \n the simulations were performed on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 sized square lattices , up to @xmath13 mcs , with cooling rates : @xmath17 and tolerance steps : @xmath18 . \n the phase transition of the so - seg model is at @xmath19 @xcite , so @xmath20 corresponds to super - critical , @xmath21 to sub - critical situations . \n as figure ( [ fig0 ] ) shows the inclusion of a small second temperature @xmath22 does not change the composition of neighbors and @xmath23 in the steady state ( as @xmath24 ) . \n the same can be seen by plotting @xmath25 ( see fig.([fign ] ) ) and the average internal temperature of individuals ( fig.([figt ] ) ) . for stronger external noise \n the domains are destroyed , but the average tolerance goes to zero too . \n this means that the unsegregated state can be maintained with the help of strong external noise , without worrying about people s local tolerance . \n the same analysis for @xmath21 resulted in similar trends in @xmath26 ( see fig.[figninf ] ) and in the average tolerance @xmath27 . \n note that one observe even a weak increase in the asymptotic values for @xmath28 . \n running the simulations on larger sizes there were no change in this , excluding the possibility of finite size errors .    by increasing the second temperature @xmath9 the transitions of @xmath29 ( see fig.([figninf ] ) ) and \n @xmath30 are very smeared . \n the magnetization density @xmath31 on the other hand shows a sharp fall , indicating a first order phase transition at @xmath32 . a fitting attempt using the form @xmath33 did not result in agreement with the 2d ising class continuous phase transition behavior , characterized by @xmath34 @xcite . \n furthermore a hysteresis cycle can also be found by starting the simulations with different initial conditions ( ordered vs. disordered ) , which is a clear hallmark of a first order phase transition . \n this is in contrast with the results for two - temperature @xmath2 symmetric models exhibiting ising transition in 2d ( the bulk noise in nonzero of course ) . \n one may understand the discontinuous transition here by realizing that this model is effectively a coupled system : ising + temperate field . \n the temperatures can increase if at least four neighbors are in the same state and decrease without condition . in the language of reaction diffusion systems \n it is a quadruple model , where at least for neighbors are needed for a creation but the removal is spontaneous . \n it is well known that in 2d such a quadruple model exhibits a first order transition @xcite . \n simulations with different initial temperatures ( @xmath35 ) , cooling rates ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath7 have not resulted in changes in the transition point @xmath37 . \n a two - temperature , self - organized ising - schelling model has been introduced and investigated by numerical simulations . a low second temperature , which represents the external noise to the decision of individuals for moving does not change the segregation behavior of the model . \n a temperature bigger than @xmath38 randomizes the segregated , ordered domains and results in low average tolerance of individuals . \n while the self - organized tolerance and the average composition of the steady state show continuous variation on @xmath9 the magnetization exhibits a first order phase transition . \n the threshold did not show considerable dependence on the model parameters . \n the author thanks d. stauffer for motivating and discussing his study and providing the code of ref . \n @xcite for simulations . \n support from the hungarian research fund otka ( grant no . \n t-046129 ) during this study is gratefully acknowledged .", "StartTimeOffset": 1498878453040, "RequestID": "77709b6713c0472693666444e1ea8c3f", "TotalTokens": 2074}

squid consists of a superconducting ring with two ordinary josephson junctions on its opposite arms . \n the total current passing through the squid is the sum of the currents crossing each of the josephson junctions . as a result of interference between the two currents , the total current - phase relation depends on the flux @xmath8 threading the ring . \n in particular , the critical current ( the maximum current allowed before going to non - stationary state with finite voltage drop across the junction ) is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is related to the external flux @xmath8 threading the loop through @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the flux quantum , @xmath13 the planck constant , and @xmath14 the charge of electron . here \n we neglect the self - inductance of the loop . \n notice that @xmath10 in eq . \n ( [ ic0 ] ) has period @xmath15 which corresponds to one flux quantum . at small @xmath10 , the relation ( [ ic0 ] ) \n is almost flat ( @xmath16 ) ; consequently , the sensitivity of the measurement of small fluxes is low . \n moreover , the critical current does not depend on the direction of the magnetic field . to avoid this problem \n , one can apply a biasing flux to move the working point of the squid away from the flat region . \n however , this biasing flux increases the noise as well as the complexity of the device and sometimes can have unwanted influence on the measured system . \n therefore , it is desirable to shift the working point of the squid away from the flat region without applying an external magnetic field . \n this is possible by replacing one of the josephson junctions with a junction with non - zero equilibrium phase difference . a dc - squid with a @xmath2-phase difference between the equilibrium phases of the two josephson junctions \n has already been studied @xcite . here \n we propose another type of squid ( we call it a @xmath1-squid ) with the equilibrium phase difference of @xmath1 between the junctions . \n the frustration caused by the two junctions produces the desired shift of the working point . in the next section \n we introduce such a device using high @xmath0 superconducting grain boundary junctions . in section \n iii we study the @xmath1-squid using a simple model . \n section iv is devoted to the quasiclassical calculation of the current in the @xmath17-wave structure and demonstrating agreement with the simple model of section ii . \n finally , we summarize our results in section v. \n in high @xmath0 superconductors , because of the @xmath17-wave symmetry of the order parameter , the current - phase relations are nontrivial and generally depend on the orientations of the order parameters on both sides of the junction @xcite , @xcite . \n if we keep only the first two harmonics , we can write the current - phase relation as @xmath18 when @xmath19 the equilibrium phase will occur at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is neither 0 nor @xmath2 . \n in particular , when the first harmonic vanishes , the equilibrium phase difference happens at @xmath22 . \n these types of junctions , known as @xmath1-junctions , can be realized at the grain boundary junction between two @xmath17-wave superconductors with crystalline orientations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with respect to the grain boundary . \n at such a junction ( known as an asymmetric junction ) , there is an exact cancellation of the first harmonic and the second harmonic dominates the current @xcite , @xcite . \n these junctions have been realized and tested experimentally @xcite . \n a symmetric junction can also be made with @xmath24 misorientation angle by choosing -22.5@xmath25 and @xmath26 crystalline orientations at the two sides . \n this junction is very different from the asymmetric one ; specifically , the exact cancellation of the first harmonic does not occur in this case @xcite . in a realistic junction with non - ideal transparency and roughness at the boundary , the second harmonic gets suppressed by the boundary imperfections more strongly than the first harmonic and , as a result , the latter dominates the current . \n this leads to a conventional junction ( 0-junction ) with the usual current - phase relation of eq . \n ( [ i1 ] ) . \n these junctions have also been studied experimentally @xcite .    by combining symmetric and asymmetric junctions \n , we can have a squid with @xmath1 equilibrium phase difference between the junctions . \n 1 illustrates such an structure . \n first we study this system using a simple model . \n the more realistic numerical simulation of the system using a quasiclassical model will come after that . \n consider a dc - squid , consisting of a conventional and a @xmath1 josephson junction , with current - phase relations @xmath27 respectively . to simplify the calculations \n , we will assume @xmath28 . \n the more general case of arbitrary @xmath29 can also be treated as the solutions are similar . \n we also neglect the self inductance of the ring in our calculations . when there is a flux @xmath8 threading the squid ring , the phases at two junctions are related by @xmath30 . \n the total current passing through the squid is then given by @xmath31 . \n \\label{cpr}\\ ] ] the critical current is the maximum current in this current - phase relation . to find the critical current , one has to find the solutions to the equation @xmath32 . \n these solutions are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being an integer number . substituting into eq . \n ( [ cpr ] ) we find the maximum current to be    @xmath36    here `` max '' means the maximum of the three cases with @xmath37 . \n 2 shows the flux dependence of the critical current using eq . \n ( [ ic ] ) . \n notice that the periodicity of the function is @xmath2 ( half a flux quantum ) although the period of the argument of the sine - functions in eq . \n ( [ ic ] ) is actually @xmath38 . \n the @xmath2-periodicity of eq . \n ( [ ic ] ) is a result of the symmetry @xmath39 in eq.([cpr ] ) . in other words , changing the applied flux by half a flux quantum shifts the current - phase relation by @xmath2 and therefore does not change the critical current . \n this is evidently different from the ordinary squid for which the period is @xmath15 ( one flux quantum ) . \n the important feature here is that the @xmath40 does not coincide with the maximum of the function as it does in usual the dc - squids . \n therefore , an increase in sensitivity for measuring small fluxes is gained . \n moreover , the direction of the flux is also detectable by measuring the critical current . \n as was mentioned , the current - phase relations in @xmath17-wave grain boundary junctions does not usually have the simple forms of eq.([cp ] ) . \n one has to find the realistic current - phase relation using a microscopic theory , taking into account the imperfections of the boundary . \n here we use a quasiclassical model to study this system . \n the equations we solve are the eilenberger equations @xcite    @xmath41=0 ,   \\label{eqa1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the superconducting order parameter and @xmath44 is the matrix green s function , which depends on the electron velocity on the fermi surface @xmath45 , the coordinate @xmath46 , and the matsubara frequency @xmath47 , with @xmath35 being an integer number and @xmath48 the temperature . \n we also need to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath49 in general , @xmath43 depends on the direction of @xmath50 and is determined by the self - consistency equation    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the interaction potential . \n solution of matrix equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) together with ( [ gapeq ] ) determines the current density @xmath53 in the system    @xmath54    in two dimensions , @xmath55 is the 2d density of states and @xmath56 is the averaging over directions of the 2d vector @xmath57 . \n the transparency of the boundary is described by the parameter @xmath58 @xcite , @xcite . to incorporate the roughness , we assume a narrow scattering region of width @xmath17 between the two superconductors @xcite , @xcite . the roughness is therefore parameterized by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mean free path of the quasiparticles in this scattering region . in our calculations \n , we use @xmath61 which are reasonable values for a realistic system . \n different widths , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are chosen for the two arms and the ratio of the widths is denoted by @xmath64 . \n the details of our numerical method for solving these equations is given in @xcite . \n 3 displays the current - phase relation at different values of the external flux @xmath10 for a squid structure with @xmath65 . at @xmath40 , \n the graph has two local maxima , which is the signature of having a mixture of first and second harmonics . \n as @xmath10 is increased , the two maxima become closer and at some value of @xmath10 , they will be equal . at this point , \n the global maximum jumps from one local maximum to another . \n this actually explains the sharp kinks at the minimum positions in fig .  2 ( and also in fig .  4 ) \n 4 shows the critical current as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath66 . \n one can immediately see the similarities between these graphs and the one obtained from our simple model in fig .  2 . \n specifically , the maxima again occur with period of @xmath2 , although the @xmath2-periodicity is not exact here ( the real period is @xmath15 ) . \n the maximum of the critical current is shifted from @xmath40 , as was desired . \n one can also see from fig .  4 that the maximum range of variation of @xmath67 is obtained at @xmath65 . \n this is actually the optimal ratio of the widths for squid design . \n we proposed and studied a dc - squid which has @xmath1 difference between the equilibrium phases at its two junctions . the @xmath1 phase difference is easily obtained using the properties of high @xmath0 grain boundary symmetric and asymmetric junctions . \n the frustration caused by this phase difference moves the working point of the squid to a point at which the maximum critical current is obtained at a non -

{"ContextTokens": 2395, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "here i summarize the central results described in a single long parallel session talk , which was comprised of two distinct studies of lattice qcd . \n the first of these is concerned with the direct lattice calculation of the landua gauge nonperturbative gluon propagator , an understanding of which is central to our understanding of the nature of confinement . \n the second topic is a lattice calculation of the strangeness magnetic moment of the nucleon . \n different confining quark models predict a variety of results for this quantity and so lattice calculations provide a benchmark against which we can test our understanding of hadron structure . \n the infrared behaviour of the gluon propagator is important for an understanding of confinement . \n previous conjectures range from a strong divergence  @xcite to a propagator that vanishes in the infrared  @xcite . \n lattice qcd should in principle be able to resolve this issue by first - principles , model - independent calculations . however , lattice studies have been inconclusive up to now,@xcite since they have not been able to access sufficiently low momenta \n . the lower limit of the available momenta on the lattice is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the length of the lattice . here \n we will report results using a lattice with a length of 3.3  fm in the spatial directions and 6.7  fm in the time direction . \n this gives us access to momenta as small as 400  mev . \n the gluon field @xmath6 can be extracted from the link variables @xmath7 using @xmath8 . \n inverting and fourier transforming this , we obtain a _ ( ) & & _ x e^-i(x+/2 ) a_(x+/2 ) + & = & , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . \n the available momentum values @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of points in the @xmath15 direction . \n the gluon propagator @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 . \n the landau gauge propagator in the continuum has the structure @xmath18d(q^2)$ ] . at tree level \n , @xmath19 will have the form @xmath20 . on the lattice , this becomes d^(0 ) ( ) = 1/_()^2 . \n [ eq : lat - tree ] since qcd is asymptotically free , we expect that up to logarithmic corrections , @xmath21 in the ultraviolet . \n hence we define the new momentum variable @xmath22 by @xmath23 and work with this throughout . \n the ( bare ) lattice gluon propagator is related to the renormalised continuum propagator @xmath24 via @xmath25 . \n the renormalisation constant @xmath26 can be found by imposing a momentum subtraction renormalisation condition @xmath27 . \n the asymptotic behaviour of the renormalised gluon propagator in the continuum is given to one - loop level by @xmath28^{-d_d}$ ] with @xmath29=13/44 $ ] , where both the gauge parameter @xmath30 and the number of fermion flavours @xmath31 are zero in this calculation . \n we have analysed three lattices , with different values for the volume and lattice spacing . \n the details are given in table  [ tab : sim - params ] . in the following , we are particularly interested in the deviation of the gluon propagator from the tree level form . \n we will therefore factor out the tree level behaviour and plot @xmath32 rather than @xmath19 itself . \n .simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have evaluated the gluon propagator on an asymmetric lattice with a large physical volume . by studying the anisotropies in the data , and comparing the data with those from a smaller lattice , we have been able to conclude that finite size effects are under control on the large lattice . \n a clear turnover in the behaviour of @xmath32 has been observed at @xmath33gev , indicating that the gluon propagator diverges less rapidly than @xmath34 in the infrared , and may be infrared finite or vanishing . \n the data are consistent with a functional form @xmath35 , where d_ir = , [ eq : ir - prop ] @xmath36 gev , and @xmath37 is the appropriate asymptotic form . \n a more detailed analysis  @xcite of the asymptotic behaviour reveals that the one - loop formula remains insufficient at @xmath38 . \n issues for future study include the effect of gribov copies and of dynamical fermions . \n we also hope to use improved actions to perform realistic simulations at larger lattice spacings . \n this would enable us to evaluate the gluon propagator on larger physical volumes , giving access to lower momentum values . \n we summarize some recent results @xcite on nucleon electromagentic form factors , including the strangeness electric and magnetic form factors . \n the strangeness content of the nucleon has been a topic of considerable recent interest for a variety of reasons . \n the studies of nucleon spin structure functions in polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments at cern and slac @xcite , combined with neutron and hyperon @xmath39 decays , have turned up a surprisingly large and negative polarization from the strange quark . \n in addition , there is a well - known long - standing discrepancy between the pion - nucleon sigma term extracted from the low energy pion - nucleon scattering  @xcite and that from the octect baryon masses  @xcite . \n this discrepancy can be reconciled if a significant @xmath40 content in the nucleon  @xcite is admitted . to address some of these issues , an experiment to measure the neutral weak magnetic form factor @xmath41 via elastic parity - violating electron scattering at backward angles was recently carried out by the sample collaboration  @xcite . \n the strangeness magnetic form factor is obtained by subtracting out the nucleon magnetic form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 . \n the reported value is @xmath44gev@xmath45 and does not yet provide a strong constraint on the sign . \n theoretical predictions of @xmath46 vary widely . \n the values from various models and analyses range from @xmath47 in a qcd equalities analysis  @xcite to @xmath48 in an @xmath49 chiral bag model  @xcite . \n while a few give positive values  @xcite , most model predictions are negative with a typical range of @xmath50 to @xmath51 . \n summaries of these predictions can be found in refs . \n @xcite a similar situation exists for the strangeness electric mean - square radius @xmath3 . \n a number of the predictions are positive while a few are negative . \n elastic @xmath52 and @xmath53 parity - violation experiments are currently planned at tjnaf  @xcite to measure the asymmetry @xmath54 at forward angles to extract @xmath3 . \n hopefully , they will settle the issue of its sign . \n the lattice formulation of the electromagnetic and other form factors has been given in detail in the past  @xcite . \n here , we shall concentrate on the di contribution , where the strangeness current contributes . in the euclidean formulation \n , the sachs em form factors can be obtained by the combination of two- and three - point functions @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the nucleon interpolating field and @xmath58 the vector current . with large euclidean time separation , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the lattice spacing , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . \n we shall use the conserved current from the wilson action which , being point - split , yields slight variations on the above forms and these are given in ref . \n @xcite our 50 quenched gauge configurations were generated on a @xmath65 lattice at @xmath66 . in the time direction , \n fixed boundary conditions were imposed on the quarks to provide larger time separations than available with periodic boundary conditions . \n we also averaged over the directions of equivalent lattice momenta in each configuration ; this has the desirable effect of reducing error bars . \n numerical details of this procedure are given in refs . \n @xcite the dimensionless nucleon masses @xmath67 for @xmath68 , 0.152 , and 0.148 are 0.738(16 ) , 0.882(12 ) , and 1.15(1 ) respectively . \n the corresponding dimensionless pion masses @xmath69 are 0.376(6 ) , 0.486(5 ) , and 0.679(4 ) . extrapolating the nucleon and pion masses to the chiral limit we determine @xmath70 and @xmath71 . using the nucleon mass to set the scale to study nucleon properties  @xcite , \n the lattice spacing @xmath72 gev is determined . \n the three @xmath73 then correspond to quark masses of about 120 , 200 , and 360 mev respectively . \n the strangeness current @xmath74 contribution appears in the di only . \n the full details of the extraction can be found in ref . \n @xcite and we satisfy ouselves here by simply quoting the results . \n we use a monopole form to extrapolate @xmath75 with nonzero @xmath76 to @xmath77 , giving @xmath78 . \n correlations are taken into account and the error is from jackknifing the fitting procedure . \n a similar analysis is done for the strange sachs electric form factor @xmath79 and we find that @xmath80 is consistent with zero as it should be . \n we find for the electric mean - square radius @xmath81 . \n financial support from the australian research council is gratefully acknowledged .", "StartTimeOffset": 1529663283262, "RequestID": "a5142fd4111a4f639a186a406bbd144b", "TotalTokens": 2545}
{"ContextTokens": 2274, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "edison s invention of direct current ( dc ) preceeded tesla s invention of alternating current ( ac ) . however , once there were two possible modes of power available , an inevitable debate on the merits and demerits of the two started that led to what is called the `` war of currents '' . \n the inventor s became adversaries with edison promoting direct current ( dc ) for electric power distribution over the alternating current ( ac ) . \n the `` war of currents '' got so bitter that both inventors lost a lot of money and rumors have it , their nobel prize @xcite .    today \n the debate is more or less resolved with ac being accepted as the best method for electric power distribution , especially where the power requirement is large . \n it can be appreciated that since direct current can not be trivially stepped up or stepped down , the same voltage level is transmitted as required by the load . \n this resulted in large transmission losses . \n transmission loss takes place due to heat dissipation along the current carrying wires used for delivering power from generation point to consumer . \n the initial transmission networks laid were of copper , which is one of the best conductors with low resistivity . even with low resitivity , since the length of the transmission wires involved are large , they offered finite and non - negligiable resitance . thus introducing power loss during transmission . \n mathematically power dissipated is gien as @xmath0 where i , @xmath1 , l and a are the rms ( root mean square ) current , wire s resistivity , it s length and cross - sectional area respectively . \n thus , for transmitting a given power with minimum power loss , one would have to reduce the current while increasing the voltage . \n this is exactly what a transformer does for ac . \n thus for dc , transmission loss can only be minimised by using thicker copper wires . in turn \n , only fairly low dc power can be transmitted . since , \n ac power can be stepped - up and down easily using transformers , the issue of transmission loss over thinner wires can be economically addressed .    with industrialization and increasing demands for higher levels of power , \n even a ac distribution is not enough . \n hence , today distribution has moved to polyphase ( m ) distribution . \n polyphase voltages are also ac voltages but made up of multiple sinosudial varying voltages . \n of the possible polyphases , the three - phase supply is the most popular . \n it refers to three voltages that differ in phase by @xmath2 degrees from each other . \n the voltages go through their maxima in a regular order , after every @xmath3 . \n the phase sequence are named ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' .    0.5 cm 0.5 cm \n the three phases are generally distributed using three wires . \n the phases are separated or collected at the load side using special transformers , called `` star '' or `` delta '' transformers ( fig  1a ) . \n each wire has the same current carrying capability as in case of single phase supply . \n however , the power delivered at the load can be far greater depending on how the two potential levels are selected . \n consider , in the star transformer the load is connected between point ` a ' and neutral ( fig  1b ) the output waveform would be that of phase a , with the neutral point acting as ` zero potential ' point . \n the power delivered to the load is @xmath4 . \n however , if the load is connected between point ` a ' and ` b ' , the net potential difference can be found ( first in general ) from    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the peak voltage and @xmath7 the phase difference between the two phases . for a 2-phase supply , \n where the phase difference between the two waveforms is @xmath8 , the potential difference would be @xmath9 this mathematics is graphically represented in fig  2 . \n it can be appreciated that the power delivered to the load now would be @xmath10 . \n this example shows how polyphase transmissions delivers more power .    while these are important issues to be appreciated by a physicist setting up a laboratory with instruments that require high power , schools and colleges do not help develop this concept with hand - on experimentation for fear of possible accidents that could even prove fatal . \n while kits are present in engineering colleges for electrical engineering , not much is found in the literature in way of simple experiemnts for physics and electronics students . in this direction , we have designed and tested a simple circuit , where two phases are generated from a sinusodial wave taken from a function generator . \n the proposed circuit requires three opamps , of which the first opamp is assembled in an inverting configuration @xcite . the sinusodial input from a function generator ( shown in fig  3 as ` 1 ' ) is given as an input to this inverting amplifier . \n this signal also acts as one of the 3 phases , namely phase a. the gain of this amplifier is kept as unity with @xmath11 . \n this circuit acts as a buffer preventing any loading by successive circuits and introduces a phase change of @xmath8 between output and input waveforms ( as indicative of the name `` inverting '' amplifier ) . \n the rc circuit is designed to introduce a phase difference of @xmath3 for the selected frequency . however , \n a single combination of rc can at the most introduce a phase difference equal to or less than @xmath12 . \n hence , two sections are used , with each rc section introducing a phase shift of @xmath13 \n . the values of r and c are selected using the formula @xcite @xmath14    _ in our study , for an 5khz wave provided from the function generator , we selected @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n _ hence points ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' of the circuit would be @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively out of phase with respect to the input . \n the impedence networks act as potential dividers and hence the voltage levels at ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' would be lower than that given as input . since the three phases would have the same amplitude , the signals at ` 3 ' and ` \n 4 ' would have to be amplified . \n we use as inverting amplifier again for point ` 4 ' . \n the voltage gain of this amplifier is give by @xmath19 . \n hence , @xmath20 has to be varied till the voltage signals amplitude is identical to the input signal . \n also , this inverting amplifier introduces a phase change of @xmath8 . the net phase difference \n hence would be @xmath21 which is nothing but a phase difference of @xmath22 . \n the output of this op amp circuit would be phase ` b ' . \n similar amplitude correction is required for the wave collected at point ` 3 ' . however , here we select a non - inverting amplifier circuit whose gain is given as @xmath23 and as the name suggests does not introduce any further phase shifts _ ( @xmath20 and @xmath24 used were @xmath25 pots and typically had values greater than @xmath26)_. hence , the net shift at the output remains the same as that at point ` 3 ' at @xmath27 or @xmath28 . \n this is phase c of the simulated 3-phase supply . \n fig  4 shows the waveforms ( phase a and c ) as captured by picoscope ( model 2202 ) . \n since the model only gives dual trace , only two waves can be shown simultaneously . however , the data captured by picoscope shows all three phases simultaneously . \n curve fitting these data points give the phase difference between the various phases to be 1.95radians or @xmath29 . also , the peak voltage ( @xmath6 ) also works out to be 1.58v .    while the circuits achieves the purpose of mimicing a 3-phase supply , \n experiments can be done to further understand applications of 3-phase supply . \n for example , one can study the rectification and advantage of generating dc from 3-phase supply . \n for this , all one needs is 3 diodes and a load resistance ( see fig  5 ) . \n the output waveform is dc and also notice even without any filtering circuit , the output is continuous with little ripple . \n this is because , as seen by the load , the input frequency is three times that of a single phase supply . \n the ripples in a rectified output is inversely proportional to the frequency @xcite , hence the low ripples here can be understood . \n also , this output gives visual idea and helps in easier understanding that each phase in a 3-phase supply is separated by @xmath3 . in this rectifier circuit , only that diode conducts , for which the phase connected to it has the highest instantaneous potential with respect to the neutral . \n fig  4 shows one phase to have highest potential with repect to the other phases for @xmath3 . \n thus , in one cycle ( @xmath30 ) there would be three peaks of the output dc wave . \n this is visiable in fig  5 . \n a simple circuit has been proposed to demonstrate the behaviour of 3-phase power distribution . \n the simple circuit discussed in this article cost rs ( indian rupee ) 20/- to assemble ( less than a dollar ) and can be a very usual experiment in schools and under - graduate laboratorys to learn more about 3-phase supply and it s application . \n the financial support of u.g.c ( india ) in the form of minor research project no.f.6 - 1(25)/2007(mrp / sc / nrcb ) is gratefully acknowledged . \n the authors would like to express their gratitude to the lab technicians of the department of physics and electronics , s.g.t.b . \n khalsa college , for the help rendered in carrying out the experiment .", "StartTimeOffset": 1539926271591, "RequestID": "b1e6dd40d5a146e98efdc28dae39eda2", "TotalTokens": 2395}

{"ContextTokens": 3771, "GeneratedTokens": 78, "SynthesizedBody": "alice  is a general - purpose heavy - ion experiment designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark - gluon plasma in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc . \n the alice  detector  @xcite is designed to deal with large particle multiplicities , dn / dy up to 8000 , well above the multiplicities expected for pbpb collisions at lhc energies . \n the alice  collaboration will also study collisions of lower - mass ions and protons . \n the pp collisions will primarily provide reference data for the nucleus - nucleus collisions but in addition a number of genuine pp physics studies will be done . \n the main components of the alice  detector are a central tracking and particle identification system covering the pseudo rapidity range @xmath0 , a muon spectrometer covering @xmath1 , a forward multiplicity detector and a zero - degree calorimeter . \n an overview of the @xmath2 coverage of the alice  systems is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : properties ] . \n the transverse momentum cut - off is only 0.1  due to the extreme minimisation of the material budget of the inner tracking system . on the other hand the @xmath3  measurement reaches up to 50  with full particle identification capabilities at mid - rapidity . \n the central part is embedded in the large l3 solenoidal magnet which provides a field of 0.5  t. the tracking system is subdivided in the inner tracking system ( its ) using different kinds of silicon detectors and a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) . \n the inner tracking system consists of six concentric cylindrical layers of detectors . from inside out \n the inner tracking system consists of two layers of silicon pixel detectors , two layers of silicon drift detectors and two layers of silicon strip detectors . \n the tpc consists of two 2.5  m long drift volumes separated by a central cathode . \n the inner tracking system determines the vertex resolution of the system while the tpc essentially defines the momentum resolution .    the transition radiation detector and the time of flight ( tof ) array cover the full azimuthal angle . \n additional detectors with partial coverage of the central barrel are the photon spectrometer , the high momentum particle identification detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter . \n an overview of the alice  particle identification capabilities is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : properties ] . \n details of the detector design and the expected performance are described in  @xcite . \n read - out of the muon spectrometer is triggered by the muon trigger chambers . \n the central tracking system is triggered by a combination of dedicated trigger detectors ( t0 , v0 ) and a trigger derived from the silicon pixel detectors ( spd ) in the innermost layer of the tracking system . \n each chip in the spd front - end system outputs a `` fast - or '' signal indicating that at least one pixel has fired . \n these signals are combined in a global multiplicity trigger which can be adjusted to select central events in pbpb collisions . however , since the noise in pixel detectors is intrinsically low , the same system was used to trigger on single cosmic muons for commissioning purposes . \n the hardware triggering system is complemented by the high level trigger ( hlt ) system which uses a large processor farm to select or tag events after read - out of the hardware . \n about 30% of this system was installed during the detector commissionng phase . \n in addition to its event selection capabilities this system provides a data quality monitoring facility . \n the experiment is ready for data taking with both proton and heavy - ion beams . \n partially installed are trd ( 25% , completed 2010 ) , phos ( 60% , completed 2010 ) and emcal ( completed 2011 ) . \n the central tracking system , the time of flight system and the forward muon spectrometer are fully installed . \n also the data acquisition system ( daq ) and the detector control system ( dcs ) are fully installed . \n therefore at start - up alice  has full hadron and muon identification capabilities and partial photon and electron identification capabilities . \n all installed detectors have been tested concurrently for noise performance in the l3 magnetic field . \n cabling , grounding and power supply issues have been resolved . during 2007/2008 \n three cosmic data taking periods with runs involving all detectors 24  hours a day were taken . \n the first run of 12 days in december 2007 was mainly used to debug the global and detector specific data taking systems . \n the second run of five weeks ( february - march 2008 ) was used to verify that all systems could efficiently operate without mutual interference . \n the majority of the commissioning data was collected in the third run which started in may 2008 and lasted until the foreseen start - up of the lhc in october .         using the silicon pixel trigger , adjusted to trigger on single particles , \n a sample of muons crossing the entire tracking system has been collected in 2008 . \n in addition the dedicated cosmic trigger system ( acorde ) was used to collect a large sample of single and multiple cosmic muon events . \n the muon spectrometer was triggered using its own muon trigger system . \n the total read - out rate was about 100  hz during several months , thus testing both the data acquisition system and the offline reconstruction software thoroughly . \n the availability of real data from the detectors has stimulated the implementation of additional features in the online software , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : online ] . \n the code has grown by about 15% with a large increase in the activity near the end of the datataking period . \n in addition valuable experience in operating all systems was gained allowing for efficient datataking when the lhc starts delivering beams . in 515  days of datataking a total of about 3  pb of data \n was read - out of which 350  tb was recorded to tape , see figure  [ fig : online ] . \n the muon spectrometer has collected a small sample of nearly horizontally moving cosmic muons which allowed to check the trigger system and gave a first indication of the internal alignment of the chambers . \n the cosmic data provided an opportunity to align the central tracking systems and partially calibrate them . for the smaller detectors beams \n will be needed to calibrate and align because they are in an unfavourable orientation with respect to cosmic muons or because their area is too small to collect a useful sample in an acceptable time . \n the following paragraphs describe the results obtained for the central tracking systems . for further details on the its commissioning results see also  @xcite .                in case of a single muon crossing the inner layers of the tracking system \n the reconstruction software finds two tracks because it searches for tracks coming from the interaction region . \n the distance between the two tracks provides a measure of the vertex resolution . \n the result before and after alignment of the individual layers of the inner tracking system is show in figure  [ fig : its ] ( upper left panel ) . \n the vertex resolution depends mostly on the alignment of the inner ( pixel ) layers . \n the estimated vertex resolution is 40  , close to the design value . \n the silicon drift detectors measure the  coordinate by measuring the arrival time of the electrons on the anodes . \n however , the drift speed depends strongly on the temperature . \n therefore the alice  silicon drift detectors have integrated electron injection devices which allow to monitor the drift speed continuously . during the cosmic run \n the drift speed was measured as a function of the position on the detectors and of time . \n figure  [ fig : its ] shows the result of the drift speed distribution on a detector ( upper middle panel ) and the speed as a function of time ( upper right panel ) . \n the drift speed is stable during many hours of operation as a consequence of the stable thermal conditions in the inner tracking system . \n this allows an effective reconstruction of the position using the measured drift speed map . \n in addition the drift detectors were aligned and the @xmath4  measurement was calibrated . \n the outer two layers of the its , consisting of silicon strip detectors were aligned using the cosmic muon tracks . \n in addition to the position measurements these detectors provide a @xmath4  measurement . \n an example of the response is shown in figure  [ fig : its ] ( lower left panel ) demonstrating that a signal to noise ratio of about  40 is achieved . \n because the silicon strip detectors in alice  are double sided they provide both the  and z coordinates in a single detector . however , although the stereo angle between the strips on each side is relatively small , ambiguities may arise if two particle cross the detector close to each other . \n a significant fraction of these ambiguities can be resolved because the charge measured on both sides of the detector is the same apart from the noise in the respective channels . \n an example of the correlation of the charge measurements on both sides of the same detector is show in figure  [ fig : its ] ( lower right panel ) . \n the time projection chamber has an integrated laser calibration system in order to measure the drift speed . \n figure  [ fig : tpc ] , upper left panel , shows the measurement of the ionisation trails of the laser beams . in order to calibrate the @xmath4  measurement in the tpc \n a radioactive gas was injected in the drift volume . \n the measured energy spectrum of the kr decays , see the upper middle panel of figure  [ fig : tpc ] , shows the excellent energy resolution of the tpc . \n due to electron attachment and diffusion the measured charge depends on the position of the ionisation in the drift volume . \n the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : tpc ] shows the amplitude as a function of the position . both the @xmath4  measurement and the drift speed \n must be corrected for the gas pressure and temperature which are also continuously monitored . \n the extensive commissioning period provided ample data to verify all necessary corrections . \n due to its large volume the tpc could collect more than 10 m cosmic muon and particle shower events . \n this large sample allowed to test the particle identification capabilities of the tpc as shown in figure  [ fig : tpc ] lower left panel . \n a clear separation of electrons , muons and protons is demonstrated at momenta up to 3  . \n the @xmath4  resolution , without a thorough calibration , is already 5.7% , very close to the design value of 5.5% . \n the momentum resolution was studied by separating the cosmic tracks into two halves and comparing the reconstructed momenta . already after the first attempt to align and calibrate a momentum resolution of 6% at 10  is achieved , reassuringly close to the design value of 4.5%  @xcite .    , i.e. 130  ps.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    for the time of flight ( tof ) system a special purpose cosmic trigger , using the signals from the tof system itself , was developed to collect a sample of cosmic muon events crossing two of the tof modules . \n the time projection chamber was used to measure the momentum of the muon and the track length between the two tof modules . since all muons measured this way are relativistic the time difference between the two modules measured by the tof \n can be compared to the time difference calculated from the track length . \n the time resolution of a single module is then found by dividing the width of the distribution by @xmath5 . \n thus the time resolution of the tof system , even with the current preliminary calibration , was found to be 130  ps , see also figure  [ fig : tof ] , showing that also the tof performs close to its design specifications .         the high momentum particle identification system ( hmpid ) , the transition radiation detector ( trd ) and the photon spectrometer ( phos ) are placed in unfavourable positions for detecting cosmic muons . \n nevertheless small samples of data were collected with which the proper functioning of the detectors could be verified . \n figure  [ fig : other ] , left panel , shows the measurement of the track matching precision between the tpc and the hmpid without a precise alignment  @xcite . \n the right panel of the same figure shows the first observed trd signals  @xcite . \n the phos system is not yet completed but one module was operated at room temperature , instead of -20  as foreseen in the design . nevertheless even at room temperature \n an energy resolution of de / e of 0.24 was obtained , see figure  [ fig : other ] centre panel .        in august and september 2008 \n the first protons were injected into the lhc . while the particles extracted from the sps were dumped at the end of the extraction line or at a collimator in the lhc the relative timing of the alice  trigger detectors could be studied . \n the time differences are sufficiently small to allow equalisation in the central trigger processor so that the individual triggers can be combined into coincident trigger conditions . \n the particle showers emitted from the dump at the end of the extraction line provided excellent test signals to compare the particle densities measured by the forward multiplicity detector ( fmd ) , the silicon pixel detectors , the v0 trigger counters and the muon spectrometer . \n when the first particles were sent through the alice  experiment into the next section of the lhc the first beam interaction was observed in the central tracking system . \n figure  [ fig : first ] shows the reconstructed event containing an interaction between a stray particle from the beam and a silicon pixel detector in the innermost layer of the inner tracking system . \n the lhc accelerator is expected to resume operations in 2009 . at start - up \n some pp  collisions at 900  will be provided , followed by a pp run at the highest possible lhc energy . \n pbpb collisions are expected in 2010 . \n the alice  detector was optimized for the high multiplicity environment resulting from heavy ion collisions , see section  [ sec : introduction ] . \n this also gives it unique capabilities for the measurement of proton - proton collisions . \n the first proton - proton collisions at 900  , expected in 2009 , will allow the experiment to compare reults with previous experiments . during the following high energy pp run alice \n will collect a large sample of minimum bias events providing the multiplicity and @xmath3-distributions as well as important reference data for the heavy - ion programme . \n in addition , the unique capabilities of alice  will allow it to contribute significantly to the measurement of the baryon transport mechanism . \n the measurement of the charm cross section will provide important input to the pp qcd physics . \n the first 10@xmath6 pbpb events , collected in less than 1  day , will provide global event properties such as the multiplicity distribution , the rapidity density and elliptic flow . \n the source characteristics ( particle spectra , resonances , differential flow and interferometry ) can be extracted from the first 10@xmath7 events ( 1 week ) . in the first year of pbpb collisions alice \n will collect 10@xmath8 minimum bias events and an equal number of central collisions ( 5% most central ) , allowing the study of charmonium production , jet quenching and heavy - flavour energy loss in the medium . \n these measurements will provide information on the bulk properties of the medium , such as the energy density , temperature , pressure , heat capacity / entropy , viscosity , speed of sound and opacity .    for a detailed description of the alice  physics capabilities see  @xcite . \n all installed detector systems were debugged and commissioned during 2008 . partially installed \n are the trd ( 25% , to be completed in 2010 ) , the phos ( 60% , to be cpompleted in 2010 ) and the emcal ( to be completed in 2011 ) . \n all other systems are fully installed . \n the central tracking systems have been tested and calibrated using cosmic muons . \n the performance is shown to be close to the design values for the silicon detectors , the time projection chamber and the time of flight system . \n the data acquisition system and the offline software have been tested with more than 350  tb of data from cosmic ray events .", "StartTimeOffset": 1558767422217, "RequestID": "7a22b3dcaa2d45f596c4e4a8f9516749", "TotalTokens": 3849}
{"ContextTokens": 2273, "GeneratedTokens": 202, "SynthesizedBody": "up to the end of 1994 more than 50 extragalactic radio sources have been detected with egret as emitters of high - energy @xmath0-rays . \n the majority of the sources are quasars and optically violent variables ( ovv ) and a number are classified as bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects . \n individual @xmath0-ray spectra in the egret range can generally be well described by power - laws ( von montigny , this volume ) . in case of the bl lac \n mrk421 the spectrum extends up to tev energies ( punch et al . \n 1992 ) . in this paper \n we analyse the class - averaged spectra of agn by summing the observed intensity and the statistic of power - law fits to the observed emission . \n we also derive the spectrum of the average @xmath0-ray agn which is to be compared to the spectrum of the diffuse extragalactic background . \n here we have summed all egret data of phases 1,2 , and 3 . with the standard likelihood techniques we have searched for point sources , \n of which we can identify 44 as agn , 11 bl lac s and 33 quasars and ovv s . \n for all 44 agn we have performed a spectral analysis . \n there is no cut - off visible in the @xmath0-ray spectra with the possible exception of a weak deficiency below 100 mev for the quasars which may be the outer extension of the usual roll - over at a few mev . \n we have also searched for systematical deviations from power - law behaviour in the @xmath0-ray spectra of the 44 agn . for each individual agn \n we have fitted a power - law spectrum to the data . \n the weighted difference between this fit and the measured intensity in the ten energy bands , i.e. @xmath1 , has been summed for all quasars and bl lac s , respectively , to obtain the average deviation . \n no significant deviations from power - law behaviour in the average agn spectrum is observed , neither for quasars and ovv s nor for bl lac s . \n we have summed the observed intensity in ten energy bands to derive the spectrum of the average agn . \n this spectrum is what we would get as contribution to the diffuse extragalactic background if the agn were unresolved . \n the @xmath0-ray intensity of all 44 agn sums up to around 7 % of the diffuse background . \n it is interesting to see that the @xmath0-ray spectrum of the average bl lac is harder than that of the average quasar and ovv ( with formal significance 1.7@xmath2 ) . \n this does not imply that in single viewing periods bl lac s have always harder spectra than quasars . \n in fact we see a remarkable spread of spectral indices for both classes of objects when individual viewing periods are considered . but \n this concerns individual sources . \n the spectrum of the average in both object classes is different , and therefore they contribute with different spectral characteristic to the diffuse @xmath0-ray background . \n the average spectrum of all agn is dominated by that of the quasars and it differs with 2.7@xmath2 significance from that of the observed diffuse extragalactic background ( kniffen et al . \n 1997 ) which is similar to the average bl lac intensity spectrum . \n interestingly , the bl lac s have on average a much smaller redshift with values between 0.031 and 0.94 , while more than 50% of the objects in the quasar and ovv class have redshifts in excess of 1.0 . \n this indicates that in case of quasars we observe a fair range of the luminosity function directly , in contrast to the bl lac case where we see only the tip of the iceberg . in other words , we expect the @xmath0-ray @xmath3 distribution of bl lac s to peak at lower @xmath0-ray fluxes than that of quasars and ovv s . as a result \n the contribution of bl lac s to the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray background may be strong despite the small number of directly observed objects . \n hence it may be that bl lac s provide the bulk of the @xmath0-ray background . \n a large fraction of agn is variable at @xmath0-ray energies . \n any cut - off arising from opacity effects will be more prominent at high flux levels since then the intrinsic photon density of the source is high . \n we have therefore chosen a subsample of agn for which at least a moderate level of variability can be found . in total \n we are left with 26 quasars and ovv s and only 6 bl lac s . \n the analysis is now similar to that described in the previous section except that the spectra are not derived on the basis of the summed data of phases 1 - 3 but only on data of the viewing periods in which the sources showed the highest flux levels . \n there is not very much change compared to the average behaviour in case of bl lac s . \n one has to keep in mind that we are now left with 6 objects and the statistic is not sufficient to distinguish general trends from pathological individuals . \n the behaviour of quasars and ovv s during their peak phase is more interesting . at first \n we see that the flare spectra are harder than the time - average , at least up to a few gev . \n this is a confirmation of a claim by mcke et al . \n ( 1996 ) who found a hardening of the @xmath0-ray spectra with increasing flux level for 8 highly variable @xmath0-ray agn . \n we also see that at energies below 70 mev and at energies above 4 gev the peak spectra show some evidence of a cut - off . to get a better idea of the significance level of the cut - offs \n we have repeated the power - law fits for the peak phases of quasars and ovv s under the constraint that now the fit is based on the energy band of 70 mev to 4 gev and then extrapolated to calculate the true deviations in the outer energy bands . \n the result is shown in fig.1 . at energies below 70 mev \n there is a deficiency of intensity compared to power - law behaviour with total statistical significance of 3.6@xmath2 while at high energies above 4 gev we observe an intensity deficit with 2.5@xmath2 significance . \n this result is stable with respect to the choice of sources . \n we have omitted the sources which have less than 6@xmath2 significance at the time of flare and the outcome remains unchanged . \n we have also included secondary flares , i.e. viewing periods in which the sources have been either within 2@xmath2 of the peak or have been observed with @xmath4 above 100 mev , and again the result is unchanged . \n we have further tested the reliability of our method by monte - carlo simulations . \n these simulations would detect systematic problems in the analysis tools , which may arise from the small photon numbers both at low and at high @xmath0-ray energies . \n we did not detect significant systematic deviations from a gaussian distribution of the variable @xmath5 . even accounting for calibration uncertainties at low @xmath0-ray energies \n the statistical uncertainties are much larger than the systematical uncertainties so that the former are a fair measure of the total uncertainty . \n most quasars show a spectral break at mev energies . \n it is , however , questionable whether such an extended spectra turnover is sufficient to account for the observed deficit below 70 mev , which is a factor 10 higher in energy than the typical break energy . \n we prefer to interprete the result in the sense that the @xmath0-ray spectrum of quasars and ovv s is not a one component spectrum , but rather the superposition of different emission processes . \n simulations show that a low energy cut - off in the injection spectrum of radiating electrons can account for the observed behaviour ( bttcher and schlickeiser 1996 ) . \n the fact that we see this cut - off only at flare states , when photon densities are high , points at opacity effects as cause . in case of backscattered accretion disk photons \n the opacity will sharply increase at a few gev . \n if the efficiency of backscattering is high , which is probably the case for quasars and ovv s , the optical depth will exceed unity and a cut - off will result . \n however , correlations between optical depth and the flux at a few 100 mev will occur only when the @xmath0-ray outburst is caused by an increased flux of target photons . \n one may also think of photon - photon pair production on the high energy end of the self produced synchrotron spectrum . here \n a correlation with the flux level can be naturally explained . \n simulations show that at least in simple geometries the synchrotron -

{"ContextTokens": 3919, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "recent high resolution movies obtained by hinode spacecraft clearly show continuous helical motions of spicule axes @xcite . \n this phenomenon is known for a long time ( beckers 1972 ) , but no satisfactory explanation has been done yet . \n @xcite suggested that these motions are caused by alfvn waves excited in the photosphere by granular motions or acoustic oscillations . \n photospheric magnetic field is concentrated in thin flux tubes and therefore may support the propagation of kink and torsional alfvn waves ( the tubes also support the propagation of sausage waves , but here we consider only transverse waves ) . the kink wave is a tube wave i.e. the whole tube oscillates with one frequency even if the alfvn speed changes across the tube , while the frequency of torsional waves is different at different surfaces @xcite . \n therefore , the excitation of torsional waves in photospheric magnetic tubes is complicated . \n the oscillations of spicule axis have also been explained in terms of kink waves @xcite , but the chromospheric magnetic field has rather expanded structure . \n therefore , @xcite suggested through monte - carlo simulation that spicules are not wave guides for kink waves . \n the problem is currently under debate and more observations are needed to understand the real process .    on the other hand , \n granular buffeting on an anchored magnetic tube may easily excite a transverse kink pulse . \n the pulse propagates through the stratified photosphere with the kink speed , but the oscillating wake is formed behind the wave front . \n the wake oscillates at cut - off frequency of kink waves and decays as time progresses @xcite \n . however , the magnetic tube undergoes continuous buffeting of granular cells from different sides . \n therefore , another pulse polarized in a different plane may quickly follow . \n the second pulse again propagates with the kink speed and form another wake oscillating with the same cut - off frequency . \n therefore , the superposition of the two oscillations may set up the _ helical motion _ of the tube axis in the photosphere \n . the helical motion will have the photospheric kink cut - off period @xmath0 7 - 8 min \n .    however , when the pulse penetrates into the chromosphere , then two possible scenarios can be developed . \n if chromospheric magnetic field has a tube structure , then the pulse continues to propagate as the kink one . \n but if the magnetic field is not concentrated in tubes , then it will be transformed into the alfvnic pulse . yet \n the pulse will have the same main properties in both cases : it will propagate at either the kink or alfvn speed and the wake oscillating at the chromospheric cut - off frequency will be formed behind the pulse . \n the superposition of the wakes corresponding to different pulses may set up helical motions of magnetic field lines just as in the photospheric case . \n these helical motions may be responsible for the oscillations of spicule axes as seen by hinode movies . \n here we study the phenomenon using the klein - gordon equation for wave propagation in the stratified atmosphere . \n kink wave propagation along vertical thin magnetic flux tube embedded in the stratified field - free atmosphere is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the kink speed , @xmath4 is the density scale height and @xmath5 is the gravitational cut - off frequency for isothermal atmosphere ( temperature inside and outside the tube is assumed to be the same and homogeneous ) . here @xmath6 is the transversal displacement of the tube , @xmath7 is the tube magnetic field , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the plasma densities inside and outside the tube respectively ( the magnetic field and densities are functions of @xmath10 , while the kink speed @xmath11 is constant in the isothermal atmosphere ) . \n ( 1 ) yields simple harmonic solutions @xmath12 $ ] with the dispersion relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wave frequency and @xmath15 is the wave number . \n the dispersion relation shows that the waves with higher frequency than @xmath16 may propagate in the tube , while the lower frequency waves are evanescent . \n kink waves cause the transverse displacement of whole tube . \n the displacement of tube in a simple harmonic kink wave is polarized arbitrarily and the polarization plane depends on the excitation source . \n then the superposition of two or more kink waves polarized in different planes may give rise to the complex motion of the tube . \n the process is similar to the superposition of two plane electromagnetic waves , where the waves with the same amplitudes lead to the circular polarization , while the waves with different amplitudes lead to the elliptical polarization . \n consider , for example , two harmonic kink waves with the same frequency but polarized in @xmath17 and @xmath18 planes : @xmath19 and @xmath20 . \n the superposition of these waves sets up the _ helical wave _ with circular polarization if @xmath21 . as a result \n , the tube axis rotates around the vertical , while the displacement remains constant ( fig . \n 1 ) . if @xmath22 then the resulting wave is elliptically polarized . \n the superposition of few harmonics with different frequencies and polarizations may lead to more complex motion of tube axis . \n however , simple harmonic kink waves hardly be excited in the photosphere . \n the more realistic process is the impulsive buffeting of granules on an anchored magnetic flux tube . for the sake of simplicity , we consider the simplest impulsive forcing in both time and coordinate \n . then eq . \n ( 1 ) looks as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is constant and the pulse is set at @xmath27 , @xmath28 . \n the solution of this equation is the green function for the klein - gordon equation , which can be written as @xcite @xmath29h\\left [ \\omega_k \\left \n ( t- { { z}\\over { c_k } } \\right ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bessel and heaviside functions respectively . eq . ( 4 ) shows that the wave front propagates with the kink speed @xmath11 , while the wake oscillating at the cut - off frequency @xmath16 is formed behind the wave front and it decays as time progresses @xcite . fig . \n 2 shows the plot of transverse displacement @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is expressed by eq . \n the rapid propagation of the pulse is seen , which is followed by the oscillating wake ( the time is normalized by the cut - off period @xmath34 ) . \n just after the propagation of the pulse , the tube begins to oscillate with the cut - off period at each height . \n the amplitudes of pulse and wake increase upwards due to the density reduction , but the oscillations at each height decay in time . \n hence , the transverse impulsive action on the magnetic tube at @xmath27 moment near the base of photosphere ( set at @xmath28 ) excites the upward propagating kink pulse , while the tube in the photosphere oscillates at the photospheric kink cut - off frequency , @xmath16 , which depends on the plasma @xmath35 parameter ( @xmath36 ) inside the tube . in the case of temperature balance inside and outside the tube , the kink speed can be expressed as @xmath37^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath38 is the sound speed and @xmath39 is the ratio of specific heats ( @xmath40 for adiabatic process ) . \n then the photospheric sound speed of 7.5 km / s and @xmath41 gives 6.5 km / s for the kink speed . \n consequently , we may estimate the kink cut - off period as @xmath0 8 min using the photospheric scale height of 125 km . \n hence the magnetic tube will oscillate with @xmath0 8 min period in the photosphere . \n if the external pulse is directed along , say , the @xmath42 axis , then the tube will oscillate in the @xmath17 plane . \n however , the anchored magnetic tube undergoes the granular buffeting from different sides . therefore , suppose that after @xmath43 time another granular cell acts on the same tube along the @xmath44 axis . \n the solution governing the pulse propagation is @xmath45h\\left [ \\omega_k \\left ( t - t_0- { { z}\\over { c_k } } \\right ) \\right ] \\exp{(z/4\\lambda)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the rapidly propagating pulse is again excited with the oscillating wake behind the front . \n the wake oscillates with the same cut - off frequency , but the oscillation is polarized in @xmath18 plane . \n hence there are two transverse oscillations with the same frequency , but polarized in perpendicular planes . \n the time interval between consecutive buffeting @xmath43 ( say , granular life time ) is comparable to the photospheric kink cut - off period . \n therefore , these oscillations will be superimposed , because the oscillation excited by the previous pulse still exists in the same tube . \n the superposition will set up the helical motion of the tube axis with photospheric cut - off period @xmath0 8 min . \n figure 3 shows the superposition of the solutions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) at the height of 250 km above the photosphere . the first pulse is imposed along the @xmath42 direction , which is followed by another pulse in the @xmath44 direction . \n the upper panel corresponds to the same amplitudes of both pulses , but the lower panel corresponds to the case when the first pulse is twice stronger than the second . \n we see that the tube rotates along nearly circular spiral in the first case and along elliptical spiral in the second case . \n the displacement gradually decreases with time . \n therefore , the granular buffeting with same amplitudes excites the nearly circular motion of the tube , while the buffeting with different amplitudes excites the elliptical motion . \n the wave length of oscillations @xmath46 km is quiet long comparing to the width of the photosphere . \n therefore , the photospheric magnetic tube will just rotate around the vertical without additional wave nodes . \n the tube displacement increases with height due to the decreasing density ( fig . \n 2 ) . thus the observations should show that the upper part of the tube rotates with larger amplitude than the lower part . \n we believe that the high resolution observations will reveal the similar behavior of photospheric magnetic tubes . \n the situation is changed when the pulse crosses the photosphere and penetrates into the chromosphere . \n photospheric magnetic tubes may expand in the chromosphere giving rather different geometry than thin tubes . \n on the other hand , chromospheric spicules seem to behave like magnetic tubes . but \n recent monte - carlo simulations ( de pontieu et al . 2007 ) suggest that the spicules are not wave guides for tube waves . \n therefore , this question is currently under debate and more observations are needed to clarify the intrinsic process ( erdlyi & fedun 2007 ) . \n the transverse pulse retains its properties in any case . \n it continues to be the kink pulse in structured magnetic field , but probably is transformed into the alfvnic one in the case of smooth transverse profile of the magnetic field . \n the photosphere and the chromosphere can be approximated as two different regions with different isothermal temperatures , densities and other plasma parameters . \n then the propagation of pulse in the chromosphere is governed by eq . \n ( 3 ) , but with different phase speed and scale height ( @xmath28 now corresponds to the base of the chromosphere ) . \n it must be mentioned , however , that the phase speed remains constant only if the magnetic field is expanded with height . \n this necessarily requires the horizontal component of the magnetic field , which is neglected in the equation . \n therefore , the equation ( 3 ) is valid only near the tube axis , where the magnetic field is predominantly vertical . \n then the photospheric solution ( 4 ) can be directly applied here , but with chromospheric phase speed and scale height . \n the chromospheric scale height @xmath47 can be estimated as @xmath0 500 km for 25 000 k temperature . \n the value of phase speed determines the wave cut - off frequency . \n for example , alfvn wave cut - off frequency is @xmath48 @xcite , which gives the cut - off period of @xmath0 250 s for the alfvn speed of 50 km / s . on the other hand \n , a cavity with higher density concentrations ( for example spicules ) may guide kink waves with smaller phase speed . \n this increases the cut - off period . \n for example , the kink speed of 25 km / s yields the cut - off period of 500 s.    therefore , the transverse pulse may set up the oscillating wake in the chromosphere with the period of 250 - 500 s. the two perpendicularly polarized transverse pulses may form the helical motion in the chromosphere as observed by hinode ( de pontieu et al . \n de pontieu et al . \n ( 2007 ) argued that the helical motion is caused by alfvn waves directly excited in the photosphere . \n the estimated energy flux of the waves was enough to power the solar wind and to heat the quiet corona . \n however , if observed oscillations of spicule axes are caused by wakes formed after the transverse pulse propagation , then the energy transported into the chromosphere / corona can be much higher : _ as almost whole energy of initial perturbation is carried by the pulse , while the energy of the wake is much smaller_.    the energy flux stored in initial transverse pulse at the photospheric level is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the granular velocity being 1 - 2 km / s . \n then for photospheric values of electron density and kink speed , the estimated energy flux is @xmath51 erg @xmath52 s@xmath53 . \n almost whole energy is carried by the pulse , therefore even if the filling factor of magnetic tubes is @xmath54 , the energy flux is more than enough to heat the solar chromosphere / corona . \n we suggest that the propagation of consecutive transverse pulses in the stratified atmosphere , which are excited by photospheric granular buffeting , may set up the helical motions of magnetic flux tubes through the superposition of oscillating wakes formed behind the wave fronts . \n this scenario may explain the continuous motions of spicule axes seen in recent hinode movies . \n the pulses carry almost whole energy of initial perturbations , while the energy in wake oscillations is much smaller . \n therefore , the energy carried into corona by transverse pulses can be much higher than it is estimated by observed oscillations . \n more observations and numerical / analytical works need to look further into this problem .                                         as a function of time @xmath55 and height @xmath10 , where @xmath33 is expressed by eq . \n the time is normalized by kink cut - off period and the @xmath10 coordinate is normalized by the photospheric scale height , @xmath56 km . \n the rapid propagation of the pulse is seen , which is followed by the oscillating wake . \n the pulse propagates with the kink speed and the wake oscillates with the cut -

pm  fi - am line generally changes in the point @xmath0 \n . however the magnitude of this change depends strongly on the number of the fermion flavours . \n we show that for given system ( form of the lattice fermion action ) there exists such number @xmath2 ( generally noninteger ) , that for the number of the fermion flavours @xmath3 the slope of this line is continuous , too . \n the qualitative picture for the phase diagrams is shown in fig . \n 1 . by a product \n , we find that in the fi phase in the vicinity of the point @xmath0 the magnetization and the staggered magnetization align orthogonally to each other in the group space . \n we want to emphasize that all the results of @xcite concerning the phase structure of the systems in the regions bordering on the pm phase are not affected . \n the slopes of the critical lines in those regions are determined by the terms in the free energy quadratic in the mean fields . \n such terms has been calculated in the ladder approximation developed in @xcite . for examination of \n the region bordering on the fi phase one needs to know the free energy up to the fourth order in the mean fields @xcite . in this case \n the summation of the ladder diagrams becomes too complicated and the approximation loses its advantages . at the same time , unjustified neglecting the ladder diagrams may lead to obviously incorrect results : for example , in the case of the su(2 ) system with the naive fermions the fi phase gets lost . \n therefore we consider here the u(1 ) systems for which the ladder diagrams do not contribute to the free energy at least up to the terms quadratic in the mean fields . \n we limit ourselves to the consideration of the weak coupling regime ; the examination of the strong coupling regime can be done easily in analogous way . \n our basic point is that the free energy for the u(1 ) systems in four dimensions up to terms quartic in the mean fields has the form ( all the notations as in @xcite ) @xmath4 where coefficients @xmath5 to @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 \n .    the coefficients @xmath5 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 are calculated directly from the eqs . \n ( 8)(15 ) of @xcite and read as @xmath13 + y^4 n_f \n \\int_p k^{2}(p ) k(p ) \\cdot k(p+\\pi ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \n c^{s}(\\kappa , y)&=&- \\frac{3}{4 } + y^2 n_f \\int_p \n \\left[k^{2}(p ) + k(p ) \\cdot k(p+\\pi)\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2 } y^4 n_f \\int_p k^{2}(p ) k^{2}(p+\\pi ) , \\nonumber \\\\ c^{v}(\\kappa , y)&=&- \\frac{1}{2 } y^4 n_f \\int_p k^{2}(p ) k^{2}(p+\\pi ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \n e(\\kappa , y)&=&- \\frac{9}{8 } -

wise integration of the standard weak coupling expansion of the logarithm of the fermion determinant : the integrals of the @xmath19 terms beginning from @xmath20 have infrared divergences , since @xmath21 at @xmath22 . \n this is the reason for appearing the logarithmic term in ( 1 ) . \n it it this term that differs our results from those of ref . \n @xcite .    to estimate the coefficient @xmath6 , note that the contribution of the fermion determinant to the free energy at @xmath23 is given by the expression @xmath24.\\ ] ] \n the integral is finite and certainly depends on the form of the function @xmath25 . \n the point , however , is that the term @xmath26 comes from the infrared region @xmath27 which is not sensitive to the detailed form of the function @xmath25 . \n therefore , to find the coefficient @xmath6 we can consider the integral with the same infrared properties @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an ultraviolet cutoff . from \n ( 4 ) , taking into account the relation @xmath30 , we find @xmath31    since we are interested in the domain of the phase diagram where both @xmath32 and @xmath33 tend to zero , and therefore @xmath34 , one can neglect the term @xmath35 in ( 1 ) . \n the fm -

fm and am - pm lines ( fig . \n 1 ) .    we shall demonstrate now that all the three variants : @xmath63 , @xmath68 , and @xmath66 are realised for the systems considered in @xcite . \n the fm - pm and am - pm lines intersect in three of those systems : in the systems with the slac , weyl , and the mirror fermion actions . in these cases we have : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 for the slac action ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 for the weyl action ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 for the mirror fermion action ( the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given in @xcite ) . \n although @xmath80 depends on the number of flavours @xmath81 , in all these cases @xmath82 for any @xmath81 and therefore the fi phase appears in all of these systems . \n the sign and the value of @xmath53 however depends strongly on @xmath81 : this is due to the fact that the @xmath83 and @xmath84 terms in @xmath53 are independent of @xmath81 , while the @xmath85 terms are @xmath86 . moreover , for given system there exists such number @xmath2 , that @xmath63 if @xmath3 , @xmath87 if @xmath88 , and @xmath66 if @xmath89 . for our systems \n we find : @xmath90 the corresponding phase diagrams are shown qualitatively in fig \n thus , we have demonstrated that in the u(1 ) higgs - yukawa systems with the slac , weyl , or mirror fermion actions the fi phase does appear in the weak coupling regime in the point @xmath0 . in the fi phase , \n at least quite near this point , the magnetization @xmath32 and the staggered magnetization @xmath33 align orthogonally to each other in the group space . \n due to the fact that the free energy involves the logarithmic term , that , in turn , leads to the critical exponents of the magnetization @xmath32 grater than @xmath1 , the @xmath23 critical line ( the am - pm  fi - fm line ) is continuous together with its first derivative in the point @xmath0 . \n the derivative of the @xmath54 critical line ( fm - pm  fi - am line ) is generally discontinuous in the point @xmath0 . \n however the discontinuity depends strongly on the number of the fermion flavours @xmath81 , so that in each system there exist such number @xmath2 , that for @xmath3 the line is smooth , too .    to conclude , \n note that for the systems in which one has @xmath91 ( as it is , for example , for the naive fermions ) , the logarithmic terms in the free energy appear also for the staggered magnetization . \n this means that the critical exponents for both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are grater than @xmath1 . \n therefore , in the cases when the fm - pm and am - pm lines intersect in such systems , the slopes of both critical lines are continuous in the point @xmath0 . \n this may occur , for example , in the case of the su(2 ) system with the naive fermions . \n we admit , however , that to make definite conclusion on the existence of the fi phase in the su(2 ) systems a special investigation is necessary . \n i am grateful to s.  tominaga for the numerical calculations of the integrals @xmath92 to @xmath93 and to j.  l.  alonso for a correspondence . \n the work was partly supported by the russian basic research fund under grant 95 -

the airborne stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia : becklin 1997 ) ; the large millimeter telescope ( lmt / gtm ) , a ground - based 50-m single - antenna telescope ( schloerb 1997 ) that will incorporate the bolocam bolometer array receiver ( mauskopf & bock 1997 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3335, "GeneratedTokens": 245, "SynthesizedBody": "many dwarf irregular galaxies ( dig ) are known to be in a starburst phase , or are believed to have experienced periods of intense star formation in the recent past . \n these galaxies are generally called blue compact dwarfs ( bcd ) . \n energetic events associated with star formation ( stellar winds and supernova explosions ) may sweep the interstellar gas out of the region actively forming stars , thus creating galactic winds . \n observational evidences of outflows have been found recently in many edge - on starburst galaxies , like ngc1705 , ngc1569 and ngc3628 . \n martin ( 1998 ) found that large expanding supershells are common byproducts of massive star formation in dwarf galaxies . \n both dynamical and chemical simulations of these galaxies have suggested the existence of a ` differential galactic wind ' , in the sense that , after a starburst event , these objects would loose mostly metals ( pilyugin 1992 , 1993 ; marconi , matteucci & tosi 1994 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ; dercole & brighenti 1999 ) . however in none of these studies , detailed chemical and dynamical evolution was taken into account at the same time .    among bcd , the galaxy izw18 ( the most metal - poor galaxy locally known ) constitutes the best candidate for a truly `` young '' galaxy . \n however , there is still a debate in literature on whether izw18 is experiencing the first burst of star formation or not . \n evolutionary population synthesis models by mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) show that the present burst is very young ( between 3 and 13 myr ) and the contribution of older stars , if any , is negligible . \n dynamical arguments ( martin 1996 ) suggest a single burst with an age between 15 and 27 myr . recent color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies of izw18 , both in the optical ( aloisi , tosi & greggio 1999 ; hereafter atg ) and in the infrared ( stlin 2000 ) , revealed the presence of an underlying older population , with an age of some 10@xmath0 yr . \n legrand ( 2000 ) and legrand et al . ( 2000 ) proposed instead a low and continuous star formation regime for izw18 . \n we study , through numerical simulations , the dynamical and chemical evolution of a gas - rich dwarf galaxy whose structural parameters resembles izw18 . \n we consider single instantaneous starburst or a couple of starburst separated by a quiescent period . \n we include effects ( both energetical and chemical ) of type ii and type ia sne in a detailed way . \n the aim of this work is to test the ` differential wind ' hypothesis with an hydrodynamical approach and to find constraints for the number and for the age of the starburts in izw18 . \n we consider a gaseous component in hydrostatic isothermal equilibrium with the centrifugal force and a potential well . \n the potential well is the sum of a quasi - isothermal dark halo ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) and an oblate king profile . \n the mass of gas inside the galactic region ( an ellipsoid with dimensions 1 kpc @xmath3 730 pc ) is @xmath4 m@xmath2 .    to describe the evolution of the ism \n , we adopt a 2-d hydrocode , with source terms describing the rate of mass and energy return from the starbursts , taking into account sne of type ii and ia and low and intermediate - mass stars ( ims ) . by using passively evolving tracers \n , we are able to follow the evolution , in space and time , of some chemical elements of particular astrophysical interest . \n the production of these elements are obtained following the nucleosynthesis prescriptions from various authors : woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for sneii , nomoto , thielemann & yokoi for sneia and renzini & voli ( 1981 ) , case r , or van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) , case v , for ims . \n see recchi , matteucci & dercole ( 2001 ) for more details about model prescriptions .    in the single - burst model , the mass of stars formed is @xmath5 m@xmath2 , whereas in the two - burst model we consider a weaker first burst ( the mass of stars is @xmath6 m@xmath2 ) . \n after 300 myr ( model m300 ) or 500 myr ( model m500 ) we consider that 10% of cold gas inside a central region ( a sphere of 200 pc of radius ) is turned into stars . \n the initial abundances of this second stellar generation are simply the metallicity of the cold gas in the central region at the onset of the burst . according to the results of atg , we consider also a flatter imf ( model m300f ) , with a slope @xmath7 . \n more details about these two - burst models are in recchi et al . \n ( 2001b ) . \n the efficiency of sn heating is assumed to be very low for type ii sne . in particular , \n following results of bradamante , matteucci & dercole ( 1998 ) , we consider a thermalization efficiency of @xmath8 for the single - burst model and @xmath9 for the two - burst model , namely only 3% ( or 5% ) of the explosion energy is able to thermalize the ism , while the rest is radiated away . \n type ia sne instead explode in an already heated and diluted medium , thus their thermalization efficiency is assumed to be @xmath10 . \n there is debate in literature about the correct value of thermalization efficiency . \n in particular , strickland & stevens ( 1999 ) assume a value @xmath11 ( see also the contribution of strickland in this volume ) . \n the reason of our choice is that the number of sneii exploding in our model is rather low , thus the time interval between single explosions ( @xmath12 yr ) is larger than the typical cooling time - scale , thus remnant of type ii sne evolve as single snr . \n in addition , we tried to run simulations with an efficiency @xmath11 also for type ii sne and the galaxy is quickly devoided of gas , thus the actual gas content in izw18 rules out the possibility of an high @xmath13 . \n owing to the energy released by type ii sne , a galactic wind develops . \n it expands faster along the z direction , where the ism density gradient is steeper . \n sneii activity lasts for only 29 myr ( the lifetime of a 8 m@xmath2 star ) , then is replaced by a weaker snia wind , not strong enough to sustain the galactic outflow ( fig . \n 1 ) . after @xmath14 300 myr , \n the expanding ism is diluted enough and the hot bubble finally breaks out through a funnel . \n most of the sneii ejecta reamins locked into the cold and dense shell , whereas metals ejected by sneia are easily channelled along the funnel . \n iron , mostly produced by type ia sne , is thus easily lost by the galaxy and the [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios ouside the galaxy are lower than inside ( see section 4 ) . owing to the low evolution of the superbubble , \n the internal cavity becomes soon radiative ( i.e. radiates an energy comparable to the thermal energy content of the shocked wind ) thus after @xmath14 10 myr most of metals are in a cold phase . \n owing to the low luminosity of the first burst , after @xmath14 300 myr a galactic wind still does not develop . \n for the model m300 a cold , dense shell of dimensions 200 @xmath3 100 pc forms and outside this region the ism is almost unperturbed . \n the impact of the second generation of stars on the ism dynamics is rather vigorous . \n already after @xmath14 30 myr after the onset of the second burst a breakout occurs ( see fig . 1 ) and \n the gas produced during this second burst is easily lost along the galactic chimney . \n the hypothesis of a differential wind is substantially confirmed in these simulations : metals are ejected more easily than pristine ism . also for the two - burst model the ejecta of type ia sne are lost more easily , but this effect is less evident compared to single - burst model . \n the consequence of this selective losses of metals is that [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside .      the evolution of oxygen abundance and c / o and n / o ratios for the single - burst model , cases r and v ( left panels ) and for the two - burst models m300 , cases r and v and m300f , case v only ( right panels ) are shown in fig . \n 2 . shaded areas represents the observed values found in literature for izw18    single - burst model reproduces the observed abundances of izw18 only for a very short time , at an age of @xmath14 31 myr . after this time , n / o ratio begins to increase over the permitted range , owing to the n produced by intermediate - mass stars . \n model m300 is able to reproduce observed abundances of izw18 for a wider range of times : between 25 and 40 myr after the onset of the second burst ( case r ) and between 50 and 70 myr ( case v ) . \n the m300f model produces too much oxygen during the first burst of star formation and does not fit the observed abundance ratios , unless the age of the second burst is extremely short ( around 4 myr ) . \n model m500 ( not shown here ) is able to fit abundances found in literature for an evolutionary time between 40 and 80 myr . \n our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * energetic events associated with the starbursts , are able to trigger a galactic wind and the metals produced in the burst leave the galaxy more easily thaan the unprocessed gas . * in particular , \n the ejecta of type ia sne are lost more efficiently than type ii sne , because this kind of explosions occur in a hot and rarefied medium . \n the consequence is that [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside . \n this effect is more evident in the single -

{"ContextTokens": 2861, "GeneratedTokens": 60, "SynthesizedBody": "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are metal poor ( @xmath0 ) and gas - rich extragalactic systems undergoing brief ( @xmath1 yr ) bursts of star formation , separated by long ( @xmath2 gyr ) quiescent phases ( see thuan 1991 for a review ) . \n the detection of an extended and old low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) stellar component underlying the regions of active star formation in the majority of bcds ( loose  &  thuan 1986 , kunth et al . \n 1988 ) implies that such systems are old gas - rich dwarf galaxies undergoing recurrent activity phases . \n this faint , however dynamically important , mass constituent in bcds , together with the -gas and dark matter , determines the gravitational potential within which starbursts occur . \n the physical origin of starbursts in the mostly isolated bcds is not yet understood . \n hypotheses put forward invoke a dynamical perturbation by a nearby -cloud ( taylor et al . \n 1994 ) , interaction / merging with another dwarf galaxy ( comte et al . \n 1996 ) , or inflow and collapse of their massive -halo onto the stellar lsb - component ( loose & fricke 1981 ) . \n the prime intrinsic properties of a bcd controlling the morphology , the spatial extent , and the strength of the burst are still a matter of debate . among the hypotheses proposed \n are a massive , bcd - specific , dark matter halo dominating entirely the mass ( meurer et al . \n 1998 ) . in another scenario \n the mass and the structural properties of the stellar lsb - component , i.e. the shape of the gravitational potential of the underlying old stellar population , are believed to regulate the global star - formation process ( papaderos et al . \n 1996 ) . \n a further issue is related to the evolutionary links between bcds and other classes of galaxies such as dwarf irregulars dis and dwarf ellipticals des . \n papaderos et al . \n ( 1996 ) found that , at equal b - luminosity , the structural properties of the underlying host galaxy of bcds do systematically differ from dis / des : at m@xmath3=16 mag the central surface brightness and the exponential scale length of the lsb - component of bcds are by @xmath4 mag brighter and by factors @xmath5 smaller than dis / des . \n this result , corroborated in the range of more luminous bcds by marlowe et al . \n ( 1997 ) , implies that the commonly accepted evolutionary connection between bcds and dis can not be maintained unless the lsb component of bcds can undergo dynamical changes such as expansion and contraction on time scales of few @xmath6 yr ( papaderos et al . \n 1996 ) . \n recent investigations ( van zee et al . 1998 ) reveal that bcds show , unlike dis , a compact and dense -distribution peaking typically very close to the intensity maximum of the starburst component ( see also taylor et al . \n thus , if bcds are dis seen in active stages , the onset of a starburst must be accompanied by a large scale contraction of the massive gas - halo . \n once a burst is initiated , star formation processes as well as the subsequent dynamical evolution of a bcd may sensitively depend on the formation circumstances of a hot ( few @xmath7 k ) gas phase , a process manifesting itself in the formation of bubbles expanding within the ambient cold gas medium ( marlowe et al . \n 1995 , heckman et al . \n 1995 , bomans et al . 1997 ) . \n although , in terms of its mass , this tenuous hot gas - phase may not be dynamically important , the pressure it exerts on the ambient cold -gas has obvious consequences . \n the gradual increase of the volume filling factor of the hot gas phase within the optical bcd , i.e. the replacement of the -gas by a warm / hot gas phase may lead to a flattening of the gravitational potential , thus initiating an adiabatic expansion of the stellar lsb - component .    understanding the formation characteristics and evolution of this hot \n , x - ray emitting gas - phase in the course of a starburst is , therefore , a basic requirement for gaining insights into the dynamical evolution and the activity status of bcds . \n ( 16.8,5.2 ) ( 6.2,0 ) ( 12.2,0 )    in sect.2 we shall briefly introduce a further paradigm of the formation of a hot gas - phase in a bcd on the basis of x - ray and optical data and in sect.3 we discuss links between the structure of the stellar lsb - component and the activity of a bcd as it imprints its integrated x - ray properties . \n ( 16.8,6.25 ) \n the morphological properties of this wolf - rayet galaxy have prompted different interpretations of its nature and of the origin of its starburst activity . in one of them henize  2 - 10 is regarded a typical bcd ( corwin et al . \n 1993 ) , similar to those discussed in loose & thuan ( 1986 ) . on the other hand , the presence of two star - forming regions ( bergvall 1985 , johansson 1987 ) and the kinematics of its neutral and molecular gas ( kobulnicki et al . \n 1995 ) led to the hypothesis that henize  2 - 10 is a system of two merging dwarf galaxies . \n figure  1 shows that either starburst knot is embedded within a nearly circular stellar envelope dominating the light for @xmath8  b  . \n the average b \n r index of this lsb component of @xmath9 1.3 mag ( fig . \n 1,right ) as well as its smooth morphology suggest an old , dynamically relaxed stellar population . \n its intensity distribution can be approximated by an exponential fitting law with a central surface brightness @xmath10  and a scale length @xmath11=670@xmath120.12 pc , i.e. structural properties which are typical for bcds ( cf . \n papaderos et al . \n 1996 ) . \n ( 16.8,6.4 )    this is also the case for the concentration index ci=0.88 which is close to the expected value for a host galaxy with the absolute luminosity of that of henize  2 - 10 . on the other hand , the disturbed b \n r morphology ( fig . \n 3,left ) and the evidence described above suggest that he  2 - 10 may be a dynamically perturbed bcd . \n a thermal bremsstrahlung fit to the pspc - spectrum of henize  2 - 10 yields an average plasma temperature kt=(0.49@xmath13 ) kev and an intrinsic 0.12.4 kev luminosity of = ( 7.6@xmath14)@xmath15   in agreement with the value log(l@xmath16/)=4041 derived by hensler et al . \n ( 1997 ) and stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) . as hri - maps \n reveal ( fig . \n 2,left ) roughly one half of the x - ray emission is contributed by a compact high surface brightness source , being probably located slightly offset from the most luminous starburst knot , close to the region with low -surface density discovered by kobulnicky et al . \n ( 1995 ; cf . their fig . \n given , however , the positional uncertainty of @xmath17   in hri - maps a further check is required . \n the remaining x - ray emission extends on scales comparable to those of the -emission , the faint outskirt of the latter being visible out to @xmath905 ( 1.3 kpc ) from the nuclear region . \n the -equivalent width map of the central region of henize  2 - 10 ( fig . \n 2,right ) suggests a kinematically perturbed ism on kpc - scales with two marked supershells expanding from either starburst knot roughly perpendicular to the plane of the co - complex . \n the cavity delineated by the eastern supershell coincides with an extended blue region with an average b \n r index @xmath18 mag . \n this feature being centered @xmath19northeast from the eastern starburst knot does not seem to be associated with any conspicuous local enhancement of the stellar background ( cf . \n sauvage et al . \n 1997 , beck et al . \n an analysis in progress ( papaderos et al . \n 1998a ) focusses on the nature of the eastern shell , in particular the question of whether it may be driven by a mixture of warm and hot x - ray emitting gas inflating its interior . the measured b \n r index is consistent with the values between 0.48 and 1.1 mag predicted by krger ( 1992 ) for a photoionized gaseous continuum with metallicities of 1/20@xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . \n + these results show that henize  2 - 10 is a well suited laboratory for studying the interplay between the cold , warm and hot gas phase of a bcd in the course of a violent starburst \n . a continued investigation of this system , in particular with the help of spatially resolved x - ray maps , is apparently of great interest . \n the x - ray emission as a consequence of the starburst phenomenon , in particular the x - ray to b - luminosity ratio , may hold important information on the activity status of starburst galaxies ( cf . \n fricke & papaderos , these proceedings ) . a preliminary analysis of rosat - detected bcds ( papaderos et al . \n 1998b ) indicates that among them the more metal - rich objects follow , similar to colliding starburst galaxies , a trend of increasing  with increasing -ratio . \n thus , in certain evolutionary stages the -ratio may be regarded a measure of the burst strength . \n this , however , may not be the case in a late starburst age , when most of the x - ray emitting gas formed in a bcd inflates the galactic halo where , through adiabatic expansion , it may obtain spectral properties and a surface brightness comparable to those of the diffuse x - ray background . \n ngc  1705 ( hensler et al . 1998 , cf . their figs . \n 1&2 ) may be considered an example of this later starburst phase . \n next we shall comment on one of the questions posed in sect.1 : how the structural properties of the underlying stellar component in a bcd may influence the starburst phenomenon . in fig.4 ( top ) \n the -ratio for a sample of bcds is compared with the exponential scale length @xmath11 of their lsb component . in the lower diagram \n is correlated with the ratio of the central luminosity density of the lsb component of bcds with that of dis , @xmath22 . \n both diagrams show a trend for increasing -ratio with decreasing @xmath11 and increasing @xmath22 . from the latter trends and fig.8 in papaderos et al . \n ( 1996 ) follows that the most compact and most mass - poor bcds show the highest -ratio . \n stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) remarked that a sudden increase in the -ratio is to be expected in an instantaneous burst with age @xmath23 myr . \n by contrast , enduring star - formation is not expected to lead to such a strong increase in . combining all latter lines of evidence with the --trend \n the present results may be interpreted as follows : bursts igniting in compact and less - massive bcds are more violent than in the more massive ones , in the sense that they must be shorter and characterized by a higher burst parameter .", "StartTimeOffset": 1634836015732, "RequestID": "d9c9a7037f4848338bed3da83901e0e4", "TotalTokens": 2921}

{"ContextTokens": 3163, "GeneratedTokens": 165, "SynthesizedBody": "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are extreme extragalactic objects with an observed luminosity outshining their host galaxy . their non - thermal continuum emission extending from radio band to x rays or @xmath0 rays suggest underlying relativistic emission mechanisms . \n agn have been subject to comprehensive studies since their discovery , leading to classification and unification schemes based on multiwavelength observations and polarization measurements  @xcite . in this frame , \n agn are classified as either radio - quiet or radio - loud , and blazars constitute a subclass of the latter , with their jet axis oriented close to the observer s line of sight . \n this particular orientation combined with relativistic beaming gives rise to prominent observational features in blazars , such as anisotropic radiation , rapid variability , high polarization and superluminal motion . \n blazars are divided into two subclasses , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacertae objects ( bl lac ) . \n fsrqs are characterized by a broad line emission region , depicted with strong lines in their optical spectra , that are not present in bl lacs . \n the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars exhibit a two - component structure , with a low - energy component peaking around ir to uv band and a high - energy one around x - ray to @xmath0-ray energies . \n the underlying emission mechanism reponsible for low - energy component is believed to be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the blazar jets . on the other hand , the high - energy component could either have leptonic  @xcite or hadronic  @xcite origin . \n instrumental selection effects brought up two distinct classes for bl lacs as radio - selected ( rbl ) or x - ray - selected ( xbl ) . \n this instrumental classification was later replaced with a more physical one based on radio to optical and optical to x - ray spectral indices , introducing the terminology of _ high- _ and _ low - frequency - cutoff _ bl lac objects ( hbls and lbls )  @xcite . \n another approach based on the peak frequency of the synchrotron component of the sed is also used to define the same classification ( _ high- _ and _ low - frequency - peaked _ bl lacs as hbls and lbls ) . \n detection of intermediate objects ( ibls ) between these two observationally distinct groups has made it more plausible that bl lac objects constitute a continuum rather than a discrete sequence  ( e.g.,@xcite ) . \n mkn 421 was the first blazar and extragalactic object detected as a very high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath1gev ) @xmath0-ray emitter with the whipple telescope in 1992  @xcite . \n since then , different candidate selection methods have been applied to radio , x - ray or high - energy ( he ; @xmath1mev ) @xmath0-ray blazar data in the aim of finding new tev blazars  @xcite . to date , 40 blazars have been detected in the tev sky , with a census consisting of 29 hbls , 4 ibls , 4 lbls and 3 fsrqs . \n our blazar sample contains all blazars with a published vhe spectrum before february 2011 , with a total of 26 sources ( see table  [ sample ] ) . \n this includes 19 hbls , 3 ibls , 2 lbls and 2 fsrqs . \n seven of these blazars were detected with egret and 23 of them are in the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog . \n more than half of the sample have been detected multiple times in the vhe band . \n these multiple detections extending over several years and obtained mostly with different instruments suggest that spectral variability in the vhe band is a common property for vhe blazars . even though no general pattern has been established for vhe variability , several sources \n have been observed to have a flux increase up to a few times their baseline emission  @xcite , occasionally accompanied by a change in spectral index  @xcite and minute - scale flux doubling times  @xcite . \n .vhe blazar sample . \n no secure redshift is available for 3c 66a , pks 1424 + 240 and pg 1553 + 113 . \n the _ fermi _ states `` low '' and `` high '' are as described in the text . in some cases \n simultaneous data were available , and in the remaining cases 27-month time - averaged _ fermi _ data were used . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first 27 month of _ fermi _ data and archival vhe spectra published before february 2011 were used to construct combined gev - tev seds . \n these include six data sets where vhe data overlaps with the _ fermi _ era ( rgb j0710 + 591 , 1es 1218 + 304 , pks 1424 + 240 , pks 2155 - 304 and two different measurements for 3c 66a ) . \n the remainder of the vhe data were taken before the _ fermi _ mission . \n all vhe spectra were corrected for the extragalactic background light absorption using  @xcite . \n the fact that most of the gev and tev data are not contemporaneous introduces caveats for the interpretation of the combined spectra . \n moreover , _ fermi _ data represents an average state over a fairly long period , whereas the vhe spectra consist of day - scale  snapshots \" , mostly taken during flares . as a solution to this problem , for bright - enough sources , \n the _ fermi _ data were split into  low \" and  high \" states as described below . \n thus , non - contemporaneous gev and tev measurements were matched in a more realistic way than directly using all the time - averaged _ fermi _ data . \n _ diffuse class _ events with energy between 300mev100gev from the first 27-month of _ fermi _ data ( from 4 august 2008 to 4 november 2010 ) were used for the analysis . for blazars that were observed during the _ fermi _ era , \n only the time periods of a few months that cover the corresponding vhe observations were selected . \n first , a 27-month light - curve analysis was performed for each source using an aperture photometry technique . \n events from a region of @xmath2 radius from the target location were selected and counts were plotted as a function of time , each time bin containing 49 counts . for sources with high statistics , low- and high- flux states were identified and separated using the average count rate as a threshold ( see figure  [ lc_mrk501 ] and table  [ sample ] ) .        next , a spectral analysis was done for each data set . \n events from a region of interest of @xmath3 were selected and analyzed with fermi science tools v9r18p6 , using instrument response functions p3_v6_diffuse . \n sources from the 1fgl catalog  @xcite , bright spots with test statistics @xmath4 and standard galactic and isotropic diffuse emission background components within the region of interest were included in the source model files . \n spectral points were calculated using an unbinned maximum - likelihood analysis technique  @xcite . \n figure  [ sed_mrk501 ] shows the combined sed for the hbl mrk501 . \n the peak frequency of the inverse - compton ( ic ) component is a salient parameter for describing blazar non - thermal continua and studying population trends . \n systematic studies for measuring the ic peak frequency mostly suffer from the lack of statistics and simultaneous data  @xcite . in this work , \n we focus on finding the ic  peak frequency band \" rather than the  peak frequency \" , using a model independent approach . for each blazar sed , we identify the energy decade in which the largest amount of power is emitted . \n figure  [ ic_peak_dist ] shows the distribution of peak frequency bands . \n we observe that the low - synchrotron - peaked objects ( lsps ) have the maximum of their emission mostly below 1 gev . \n on the other hand , high - synchrotron - peaked objects ( hsps ) tend to peak in the tev range . \n a power - law function often fails to describe the combined seds successfully . for most blazars , \n the fits are significantly improved with a broken power law ( see figure  [ sed_mrk501 ] ) or an absorbed power law . particularly , some lbl objects display absorption - like features in the 10 - 100 gev range . to investigate this feature , we considered the following absorption scenarios from the broad line region ( blr )  @xcite for the blazars s5  0716 + 714 ( lbl ) , w comae ( ibl ) and bl lacertae ( lbl ) :    * h i line ( 13.6 ev ) * he ii line ( 54.4 ev ) * h i & he ii combined * full blr spectrum    in all the cases , absorption from the he ii complex seems to be dominant \n . a double - absorption scenario does not provide an improved fit over the he ii single - line absorption . on the other hand , \n the full blr absorption underproduces the tev emission ( see figure  [ s5_0716_sed ] ) . \n we also modeled a full blr absorption combined with cascade emission from the @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption  @xcite . \n no significant contribution from cascading effects in the fermi band is expected ( see figure  [ wcomae_sed ] ) . \n in this paper we give some results from our ongoing gev - tev blazar population studies . \n we analyzed 27 months of _ fermi _ data and combined it with archival tev data . \n we see absorption - like features mostly in lbl spectra , these features are best described as blr absorption from the he ii complex . in addition , we observe that the peak frequency in the gev - tev region follows the synchrotron peak frequency trend . \n complete results will be discussed in a forthcoming paper . \n 9 urry , c. m. , & padovani , p.  1995 , pasp , 107 , 803 maraschi , l. , ghisellini , g. , & celotti , a.  1992 , apj , 397 , l5 dermer , c.  d. & schlickeiser , r.  1993 , apj , 416 , 458 aharonian , f.  2000 , newa , 5 , 377 mcke , a. , et al . \n 2003 , aph , 18 , 593 padovani , p. & giommi , p.  1995 , apj , 444 , 567 nieppola , e. , valtaoja , e. , tornikoski , m. , hovatta , t. , kotiranta , m.  2008 , a&a , 488 , 867 punch , m. , et al . \n 1992 , nature , 358 , 477 costamante , l. , & ghisellini , g.  2002 , a&a , 384 , 56 de la calle prez , i. , et al . \n 2003 , apj , 599 , 909 behera , b. , & wagner , s.  i.  2009 , arxiv0908.4574b acciari , v. a. , et al . \n 2009 , apj , 707 , 612 albert , j. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 669 , 862 aharonian , f. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 664 , l71 domnguez , a. et al . \n 2011 , mnras , 410 , 2556 abdo , a.  a. , et al . \n 2010 , apj , 715 , 429 cash , w.  1979 , apj , 228 , 939 mattox , j.  r. , et al . \n 1996 , apj , 461 , 396 anderhub , h. et al . \n 2009 , apj , 705 , 1624 zhang , j. , et al . \n 2011 , arxiv:1108.0607v1 [ astro-ph.he ] poutanen , j. et al .  2010 , \n apj , 711 , 118 roustazadeh , p. et al . \n 2010 , apj 717 , 468 anderhub , h. et al . \n 2009 , apjl , 704 , 129 acciari , v. a. et al . \n 2008 , apjl , 684 , 73", "StartTimeOffset": 1647033269845, "RequestID": "b59893f078da420da335bc3b69e0ca6b", "TotalTokens": 3328}
{"ContextTokens": 2881, "GeneratedTokens": 210, "SynthesizedBody": "the dwarf elliptical galaxy class has been a point of much interest in recent years . \n photometric surveys have revealed a whole range of substructures : spiral arms , bars , disks , twists , lenses ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . through the kinematic studies of , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we have learned about the variety of rotation patterns , and stellar populations analyses \n have shown a variety of ages , metallicities , and their gradients ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n thus , des have come a long way from being considered simple low - mass extension of giant ellipticals to having their complicated structure and history unveiled in numerous studies which led to the conclusion that they are most likely environmentally - transformed late - type galaxies ( see e.g. the review in @xcite ) . \n since the effect of such transformation processes depends on the local environment density , we would expect galaxy properties to change with clustrocentric distance . \n indeed , such trends have been found for the shape and the degree of substructure in virgo ( @xcite ) , and for the ages and metallicities of both virgo ( @xcite ) and coma des ( @xcite ) . with our integral - field spectroscopic data for virgo des \n we have now turned to investigating their dynamical properties and the connection thereof to the location in the cluster . \n stellar velocity _ v _ maps of our full sample shown here together to emphasize the kinematic variety . \n the level of rotation is not tied to flattening , we see kinematics twists ( vcc0523 , id0918 ) and kinematically - decoupled components ( id0650 and id0918 ) . \n a full set of maps and profiles ( _ v _ , @xmath0 , and their errors ) can be found in @xcite . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=566 ]    details on data selection , observations and data reduction are presented in @xcite . in short \n , we observed 12 des : 9 in the virgo cluster and 3 in the field . \n our objects span a wide range of ellipticities and distances from the cluster s center . \n the observations were carried out in jan 2010 and apr 2011 ( 8 nights in total ) using the wht / sauron instrument at the roque de los muchachos observatory in la palma , with each galaxy typically exposed for 5h . \n for the extraction and calibration of the data we followed the procedures described in @xcite using the specifically designed xsauron software developed at the centre de recherche astrophysique de lyon ( cral ) . \n the data were spatially binned to achieve the required minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 30 per pixel . \n the stellar absorption - line kinematics were derived for each galaxy by directly fitting the spectra in the pixel space using the penalized pixel - fitting method ( ppxf ) of @xcite . \n these velocity maps shown in figure  [ fig1 ] are the best example of the level of variety we are finding . \n the maps show varying degrees of rotation : from @xmath140 km / s for vcc0523 to virtually no rotation for vcc1261 . \n rotation seems to be uncorrelated with flattening since we see all possible combinations of both . \n in addition to that , in two galaxies ( id0650 and id0918 ) we observe large - scale kinematically - decoupled components , counter - rotating with regard to the main bodies . also , kinematic twists are seen in vcc0523 and id0918 .    to relate this variety to the formation histories of these galaxies , \n we need to tie the results to the transformation mechanisms acting in cluster \n . the combined influence of ram - pressure stripping and harassment is the most likely answer , given that they allow for the random shaping of galaxy properties , based on the variety initial infall parameters ( disk inclination and orbit type ) and the number of encounters with large galaxies . \n since des used to be thought of as a low - luminosity extension of giant ellipticals ( es ) , we present here a comparison of the kinematic properties of our des and early - type giants ( etgs ) of @xcite . to estimate the amount of rotation in our objects we have therefore decided to use the new @xmath2 parameter defined in @xcite ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) . \n @xmath2 is better suited for angular momentum estimate than the traditionally employed v/@xmath0 .    for the most part des \n behave like the members of the fast - rotator family : their integrated @xmath3 values are above or on the line that divides the etg group into slow and fast rotators . \n their @xmath2 profiles also tend to increase for larger r / r@xmath4 or lie in between those of slow- and fast - rotator groups . \n a direct comparison is , however , tricky . \n a range of differences stand behind each type that include photometric , kinematic , dynamic , and x - ray properties ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n thus , the empirical dividing line can not be easily used to accommodate des in the same diagram . moreover , by their very nature the data for des are noisier , which will produce a positive offset in the calculated @xmath2 . \n one , thus , needs to be cautious when devising their analysis approach in such cases as ours . \n _ left _ : radial @xmath2 profiles for the combined sample of des from this study ( thick red lines ) and etgs of @xcite ( thin grey lines ) . \n slow -

type galaxies . \n s0s are believed to be faded spirals ( e.g. @xcite ) , so the fact that our des show a similar level of variety as the sauron survey s fast rotators only strengthens the argument in favor of them being transformed late - type galaxies .      as we have already discussed in @xcite , the analysis of any property trends with clustrocentric distance , should be performed using intrinsic ( i.e. deprojected ) distances in order to minimize the projection bias when dealing with incomplete samples . \n we show this effect in the left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] where a trend of rotational support versus virgocentric distance is shown for both projected and intrinsic distances . \n our results , albeit based on a limited - size sample , tentatively show little if any relation between the two aforementioned quantities . \n we have also investigated the relation between the dark matter fraction and the location in the cluster , motivated by the simulations of @xcite and @xcite who suggest that ( at a fixed radius ) dark matter might be lost more easily due to its different orbital distribution . \n the preliminary results of this analysis are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] . \n the total ( dark+stellar ) masses come from jeans axisymmetric mge models @xcite which we constructed combining our sauron stellar kinematics and sdss r - band imaging . to obtain the stellar mass estimates we used the @xcite sdss g - r colors and the color - mass conversion of @xcite      _ left _ : specific angular momentum @xmath6 virgocentric distance . for all galaxies both intrinsic and projected distances \n are shown . \n no radial trend is found when intrinsic distances are used ( @xcite ) . \n _ right _ : dark -

[ results ] ) . \n shifts and normalizations were all based on gaussian fits to the emission lines . \n line detections reported here in the blue wings of the  lines are at least at the 5-@xmath3 confidence level . most of them are confirmed by the detection of lines at the same velocity for several principal quantum numbers @xmath4 . \n the area observed in orion was the same as the one observed previously ( paper  i ) . \n the slit , oriented north - south , was located 2.5  south of @xmath5  ori  c ( ) at coordinates @xmath605:35:16.7 , @xmath705:25:29 ( j2000 ) . \n the exposure time was 30  min in the red arm and 50  min in the blue arm . \n plots of the  balmer line wings are shown in fig . \n [ m42_fig ] . \n deuterium lines are detected from  to . \n they are redshifted @xmath8  with respect to  ( the isotopic shift between  and  at rest is @xmath9 ) , in good agreement with the previous measurements ( paper  i ) . \n lines seem to be detected up to d16 , but elaborate treatment is required due to low signal - to - noise ratio . \n fwhm are from gaussian fits , after quadratic subtraction of the instrumental point - spread function . \n the fwhm of the  lines is @xmath10 , much less than that of the  recombination lines ( @xmath11 ) . \n widths similar to these were found for the lines detected in m  8 , m  16 , m  20 and dem  s  103 ( see below ) . from fig . \n [ m42_fig ] , it is apparent that  increases relative to  for increasing @xmath4 , at least up to . \n approximate relative fluxes are given in table  [ table_m42 ] . despite lower signal - to - noise ratio \n , a similar trend exists in the data for m  8 and m  16 . \n .preliminary line flux ratios in m  42 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath12 colons indicate low - accuracy values ( from  and  only ) . + @xmath13 \n average shift of  with respect to  ( ) . \n + @xmath14 average fwhm of the  lines ( ) . \n +    the new observations bring confirmatory evidence in favour of the identification of the deuterium balmer lines . \n they complement and add to the results presented in paper  i. the lines are seen with similar characteristics in the five  regions , using different telescopes ( cfht and vlt ) and different spectrographs ( gecko and uves ) . \n instrumental artifacts ( such as grating ghosts or in - order scattered light ) can be definitely ruled out . \n since the lines are seen for many members of the balmer series , they can only be  or blue - shifted  emission . \n emission may arise from h@xmath15 gas ( recombination ) or h@xmath16 gas ( fluorescence ) . \n high - velocity ionized structures will produce  recombination lines with properties like those already listed in the case of m  17 ( width , flux , counterparts ) , not observed in the other  regions described in sect . \n [ results ] . \n a high - velocity neutral structure can not be formally excluded for any one isolated object , but the probability that such a structure could exist and yet be detectable only in  is low . \n no evidence for the existence of such a structure could be found in the case of orion ( paper  i ) . \n considering the present data , it would be extraordinary if such a neutral component could be present in such a systematic manner in five different  regions , always at about the same velocity .    understandably , the  lines are narrow since they arise from a cold material with small thermal velocity . \n nonetheless , considering the prevalence of large velocity fields in  regions , it was not a priori obvious that these lines would appear so systematically narrow ( table  [ lines ] ) . \n the explanation partly lies in the fact that the entrance aperture of uves is relatively small and that observable  regions tend to be incomplete on one side , with the associated molecular cloud and pdr located behind the expanding h@xmath15 region . \n this is consistent with the tendency shown by the  lines to be redshifted with respect to the  lines ( table  [ lines ] ) . \n thus , in practice , a small line width ( at the expected wavelength ! ) turns out to be an important criterion to identify . on the other hand \n ,  regions may exist with pdr s encompassing a large velocity range . \n a fundamental criterion for  identification remains the lack of counterparts in lines from ionized species . \n large variations of the line intensity ratio /  with @xmath4 constitute another useful criterion ( table  [ table_m42 ] ) , since fluorescence will generally not result in the same decrement as the one corresponding to recombination .    as a result of the present high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise observations , \n the identification of deuterium balmer lines is now very safe . \n detection of deuterium balmer emission in five  regions is reported . \n these are first detections in four targets , including an extragalactic one . \n detection was made feasible thanks to the large collecting area of the 8.2 m vlt mirror and the high efficiency of uves . \n fluorescence is confirmed as the probable excitation mechanism of , recombination being excluded . \n spectroscopic criteria leading to virtually certain identification of  in any given  region are now clearly established . \n possible ways to determine d / h from  balmer lines were discussed in paper  i. one method requires a knowledge of the @xmath4 for which the line ratio /  starts decreasing . \n the detection of  up to d9 , and possibly d16 , in orion suggests this as a promising way of investigation . \n comparison of  to  fluorescence lines , present in the uves spectra and also produced in the pdr , may be another way to explore .", "StartTimeOffset": 1676493120143, "RequestID": "7025bae5dd3b4899bfe6bd52813fcb46", "TotalTokens": 2456}

star magnetic interaction model to a relativistic regime . \n when plasma density is low or magnetic field is strong , the alfvn speed can be close to the light speed . \n thus , we need to solve relativistic equations to study the evolution of the magnetosphere . here \n we present numerical results for the magnetosphere dominated by the electromagnetic field , which can be described by time dependent relativistic force -

bell and boily ( 1994 ) . \n ( 170mm,60mm)figure2.eps    figure [ model2 ] shows the time evolution of magnetic field lines ( solid curves ) , twist ( @xmath91 ) , and the poloidal component of the velocity of magnetic field lines ( arrows ) for model 2 . in this model \n , the central star is rotating faster than the equatorial disk . \n similarly to the model 1 , the magnetic loops rapidly expand after @xmath92 and form a long thin current sheet . \n cc    ( 75mm,40mm)figure3.eps    ( 85mm,50mm)figure4.eps    the solid and dotted curves in figure [ data1 ] ( left ) show the maximum distance from @xmath93 to the magnetic field line anchored to the equatorial disk at @xmath94 . \n the expansion speed approaches the light speed ( dashed line ) . \n figure [ data1 ] ( right ) shows the degree of twist ( @xmath91 ) at the same point as that of figure [ data1 ] ( left ) . \n the twist increases with time until @xmath95 . \n subsequently , the magnetic field lines inflate almost keeping the degree of twist .

distance _ between two pentagons is the distance between the corresponding vertices of degree 5 in the dual graph . \n the first fullerene molecule ( i.e.  the @xmath6 `` buckyball '' ) was discovered in 1985 by kroto et al . \n @xcite . among the fullerenes , the _ isolated pentagon rule _ ( ipr ) \n fullerenes are of special interest as they tend to be more stable  @xcite . \n ipr fullerenes are fullerenes where no two pentagons share an edge , i.e.  they have minimum face - distance at least  2 . \n raghavachari  @xcite argued that steric strain will be minimized when the pentagons are distributed as uniformly as possible and therefore proposed the _ uniform curvature rule _ as an extension of the ipr rule . \n also , more recently rodrguez - fortea et al . \n @xcite proposed the maximum pentagon separation rule where they argue that the most suitable carbon cages are those with the largest separations among the 12 pentagons . \n these observations lead us to investigate the maximum separation between pentagons that can be achieved for a given number of atoms , or conversely how many atoms are needed to achieve a given separation . \n we will refer to the least face - distance between pentagons of a fullerene as the _ pentagon separation _ of the fullerene . \n in the next section we determine the smallest fullerenes with a given pentagon separation . \n we also show that the minimum fullerenes for each @xmath1 are unique up to mirror image and that for each @xmath1 there is an @xmath2 such that fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than or equal to @xmath2 exist . \n the latter was already proven for @xmath7 ( i.e. , for all fullerenes ) by grnbaum and motzkin in  @xcite and for @xmath8 ( i.e. , for ipr fullerenes ) by klein and liu in  @xcite . \n finally , we also determine the number of fullerenes of pentagon separation  @xmath1 , for @xmath3 , up to 400 vertices . \n in this section we determine the smallest fullerenes with a given pentagon separation . \n we remind the reader of the icosahedral fullerenes  @xcite . \n these fullerenes are uniquely determined by their coxeter coordinates @xmath9 and are obtained by cutting an equilateral goldberg triangle with coordinates @xmath9 from the hexagon lattice and gluing it to the faces of the icosahedron . as a goldberg triangle with coordinates @xmath9 has @xmath10 vertices , an icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath9 has @xmath11 vertices . also note that an icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath9 has pentagon separation  @xmath12 . \n [ theorem : min_face_distance_nv ] for odd @xmath15 , the smallest fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 are the icosahedral fullerenes with coxeter coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n these are mirror images and have @xmath18 vertices . for even @xmath1 , the unique smallest fullerene with pentagon separation \n at least @xmath1 is the the icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath19 , which has @xmath20 vertices . \n * proof in the case that @xmath15 is odd : * + the _ penta - hexagonal net _ is the regular tiling of the plane where a central pentagon is surrounded by an infinite number of hexagons . \n the number of faces at face - distance @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net is @xmath22 . \n so the number of faces at face - distance at most @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net is @xmath23 . \n figure  [ fig : d=7patch ] shows this situation for @xmath24 .      in a fullerene with pentagon separation at least  @xmath1 , for odd  @xmath1 \n , the sets of faces at face - distance at most @xmath25 from each pentagon are pairwise disjoint . \n consequently the smallest such fullerenes we can hope to find consist of 12 copies of the above patch for @xmath26 , which comes to @xmath18 vertices . \n since the patch boundary has no more than two consecutive vertices of degree  2 , it is impossible to join any number of them into a larger patch with a boundary having more than two consecutive vertices of degree  2 . \n therefore , considering the complement , no union of these patches which is completable to a fullerene has more than two consecutive vertices of degree  3 . \n now , every way to overlap the boundaries of two patches produces three consecutive vertices of degree  3 , such as indicated in the left side of figure  [ fig : d=7patchjoin ] , except for the way shown in the right side of figure  [ fig : d=7patchjoin ] or its mirror image . for each of these two starting points , there is only one way to attach a third patch to those two patches , and so on , leading to a unique completion in each case . \n it is easy to see that these two fullerenes are the icosahedral fullerenes mentioned in the theorem . \n * proof in the case that @xmath1 is even : * + the proof in this case is similar except that we use a different type of patch . in \n @xcite it was proven that the number of vertices at distance @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net is @xmath27 . \n so the total number of vertices at distance at most @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net is @xmath28 . if @xmath21 is even , @xmath29 is equal to @xmath30 . \n so the total number of vertices at distance at most @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net for even @xmath21 is @xmath31 .    in a fullerene with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 , for even @xmath1 , \n the sets of vertices at distance at most @xmath32 from every pentagon are pairwise disjoint . \n the case of @xmath33 is shown in figure  [ fig : d=6patch ] , excluding the ends of the dangling edges . \n therefore , the smallest such fullerene of pentagon separation @xmath1 we can hope to construct consists of 12 of these patches for @xmath34 , joined together by identifying dangling edges . \n this would give us @xmath20 vertices altogether . \n since we are only permitted to create hexagons incident with the dangling edges , dangling edges distance two apart in one patch can only be identified with dangling edges distance two apart in another patch . \n otherwise , a face of the wrong size is created , such as the pentagon indicated in the left side of figure  [ fig : d=6patchjoin ] . \n this allows us to join two adjacent patches in only one way , as shown by the right side of figure  [ fig : d=6patchjoin ] . \n extra patches can then be attached in unique fashion , leading to a single fullerene that is easily seen to be the icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath19 . \n next we will prove that for each @xmath1 there is an @xmath2 such that fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than or equal to @xmath2 exist . to prove this , we need lemmas  [ lemma : boundarylength_plus1 ] and  [ lemma : add_hexagons_same_boundary ] .    a _ \n fullerene patch _ is a connected subgraph of a fullerene where all faces except one exterior face are also faces in the fullerene and all boundary vertices have degree 2 or 3 and all non - boundary vertices have degree 3 . \n the _ boundary sequence _ of a patch is the cyclic sequence of the degrees of the vertices in the boundary of a patch in clockwise or counterclockwise order . \n a _ cap _ is a fullerene patch which contains 6 pentagons and has a boundary sequence of the form @xmath35 . \n such a boundary is represented by the parameters @xmath36 . in the literature , the vector @xmath36 \n is also called the _ chiral vector _ ( see  @xcite ) .        in figure \n [ fig : change_cap_bound ] we show how the @xmath37 cap which contains a boundary pentagon ( see figure  [ fig : change_cap_bound_step1 ] ) can be transformed into a cap with parameters @xmath38 without decreasing the minimum face - distance between the pentagons . \n this is done by changing the boundary pentagon into a hexagon @xmath39 , adding a ring of hexagons ( see figure  [ fig : change_cap_bound_step2 ] ) and changing a hexagon in the boundary which is adjacent to @xmath39 into a pentagon ( see figure  [ fig : change_cap_bound_step3 ] ) . \n [ lemma : add_hexagons_same_boundary ] given a cap @xmath40 with parameters @xmath36 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and which consists of @xmath43 faces . a cap @xmath44 with the same parameters @xmath36 which contains @xmath40 as a subgraph and has @xmath45 , respectively @xmath46 faces can be constructed from @xmath40 by adding @xmath47 or @xmath48 hexagons to c , respectively .    given a cap @xmath40 with parameters @xmath36 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in figure \n [ fig : add_hexagons_same_cap_step ] we show how a cap @xmath44 with the same parameters @xmath36 which contains @xmath40 as a subgraph and has @xmath45 faces can be constructed from @xmath40 by adding @xmath47 hexagons to c.        [ theorem : min_face_distance_existence ] for each @xmath1 there is an @xmath2 such that fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than or equal to @xmath2 exist . \n brinkmann and schein  @xcite have proven that every icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath9 contains a fullerene patch with 6 pentagons which is a subgraph of a cap with parameters @xmath53 . \n so @xmath50 contains a fullerene patch with 6 pentagons which is a subgraph of a cap with parameters @xmath54 . \n it follows from  @xcite that such a fullerene patch can be completed to a cap with parameters @xmath54 by adding hexagons . \n it follows from lemma  [ lemma : boundarylength_plus1 ] that this cap can then be transformed to a cap with parameters @xmath55 without decreasing the minimum face - distance between the pentagons of the cap . \n we form a fullerene @xmath56 with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 by gluing together two copies of the @xmath55 cap and adding @xmath55 rings of hexagons if necessary . \n let @xmath57 denote the number of hexagons of @xmath56 . \n now a fullerene with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than @xmath57 can be obtained by recursively applying lemma  [ lemma : add_hexagons_same_boundary ] to @xmath56 . \n the counts of the number of fullerenes up to 400 vertices with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 , for @xmath3 , can be found in tables  [ table : fuller_counts_1]-[table : fuller_counts_4 ] . \n ( note that @xmath13 gives the set of all fullerenes and @xmath58 gives the set of all ipr fullerenes ) . \n these counts were obtained by using the program _ buckygen _ \n @xcite ( which can be downloaded from http://caagt.ugent.be/buckygen/ ) to generate all non - isomorphic ipr fullerenes and then applying a separate program to compute their pentagon separation . \n note that fullerenes which are mirror images of each other are considered to be in the same isomorphism class and are thus only counted once . \n some of the fullerenes from tables  [ table : fuller_counts_1]-[table : fuller_counts_4 ] can also be downloaded from the _ house of graphs _ \n @xcite at http://hog.grinvin.org/fullerenes  . \n figures [ fig : smallest_d=3]-[fig : smallest_d=5 ] show the smallest fullerenes with pentagon separation @xmath1 , for @xmath59 .          _ \n acknowledgements : _ jan goedgebeur is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship of the research foundation flanders ( fwo ) . \n brendan mckay is supported by the australian research council . \n most computations for this work were carried out using the stevin supercomputer infrastructure at ghent university . \n we also would like to thank gunnar brinkmann , patrick fowler and jack graver for useful suggestions .", "StartTimeOffset": 1686887827182, "RequestID": "9080a8d6f23743dcb876e0c850441e64", "TotalTokens": 3533}

[ \n fig : f4 ] ) . \n this disk is observed in emission in all wavelengths from x - ray to infra - red . \n there are two types of seyfert galaxies : the seyfert 1 and the seyfert 2 , distinguished by their observed visible spectra . \n the seyfert 1 show both broad ( full width at half maximum : fwhm@xmath12200020000kms@xmath13 ) and narrow ( fwhm@xmath14 2000kms@xmath13 ) lines , while seyfert 2 exhibit only narrow lines . \n however , antonucci & miller @xcite , in the ngc 1068 seyfert 2 , detected also broad lines using polarimetry . \n this led to the conjoncture that seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 are the same type of objects but viewed with different angles . \n that is , for seyfert 1 , the observer views the central continuum source which is the `` broad line region '' while , in seyfert 2 , the observer views the external part or the `` narrow line region '' , due to obscuration of the central continuum source by some molecular torus ( see fig . [ \n fig : f3 ] ) . \n this model is supported by the discovery in the x - ray spectrum of a dilute and high ionization medium called the `` warm absorber '' ( discovered by halpern @xcite in mr2251 - 178 ) , mainly observed in absorption in seyfert1 , while only seen in emission in seyfert2 ( e.g. , kinkhabwala et al.@xcite ) . \n wavelengths @xmath15 , oscillator strengths @xmath16 and radiative transition probabilities @xmath17 have been calculated using the superstructure code developed at uc london @xcite , which uses a multi - configuration expansion of the wave functions . \n the atomic hamiltonian includes most of the breit pauli relativistic corrections ( one - body and two - body terms ) . \n the non - relativistic and relativistic eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing the schrdinger and breit pauli hamiltonian respectively . the matrix transformation between both eigen - states \n is then used to transform non - relativistic autoionization transition matrix elements to fine - structure autoionization probabilities @xmath18 , in the autolsj code @xcite . \n the radial parts of the one electron wave - functions are calculated in scaled thomas - fermi - dirac potentials , the scaling parameters , for each @xmath19 orbital , being derived by minimizing the energies of some selected ls terms . \n calculations have been done for 11 ions from fe@xmath20 to fe@xmath21 using the ground state configuration and the excited configurations accessible by absorption ( i.e. , by electric - dipole transitions ) . \n for example :    fe@xmath20 : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28    and    fe@xmath21 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    for fe@xmath20 , \n the excited configurations give bound states . \n whereas for fe@xmath34 to fe@xmath21 , the excited configurations correspond to autoionizing states . as examples we provide in tables [ tab : t2 ] , [ tab : t3 ] , the wavelengths , absorption oscillator strengths , radiative and autoionization \n probabilities for fe@xmath34 , fe@xmath35 and fe@xmath36 . \n one can observe the dramatic increase in the autoionization probabilities from fe@xmath34 to fe@xmath36 . \n moreover , the number of possible autoionizing channels increases also dramatically . \n this , in particular , explains why one does not observe the emission lines in seyfert2 which could correspond to the absorption lines in seyfert1 ( see fig . \n [ fig : f2 ] ) . \n that is , for l - lines , the photo - excited bound states , fe@xmath37 to fe@xmath20 , decay by the reverse radiative transition whereas the photo - excited autoionizing states , fe@xmath34 to fe@xmath21 , decay preferentially by autoionization . \n the optical depth @xmath38 due to an absorption line ( @xmath39 ) can be written as @xmath40 where n@xmath41 is the ionic column density along the line of sight to the source ( in @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the photo - excitation cross - section from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .    the photo - excitation ( or photo - absorption ) cross - section is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath49 is the speed of light , @xmath50 the absorption oscillator strength , and @xmath51 is a normalized line profile .    in fig [ \n fig : f5 ] , the relative photo - absorption cross - sections of fe@xmath20 to fe@xmath21 are presented with the normalization factor being the same for each graph . if instrumental width is the dominant broadening process of the lines , the same gaussian profile can be used for all lines . \n the graph in the lower right is the sum of all the contributions with the assumption that each ion has the same abundance . \n the new generation of x - ray satellites ( _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) provide us with higher resolution spectra than was previously available . for the first time , we have access to high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of non - solar objects . in particular , observations of seyfert 1 galaxies , show very complex spectra with the presence of numerous absorption lines . \n accurate atomic data are crucial to infer most of the physical and geometrical parameters of the `` warm absorber '' . \n we have calculated complete atomic data sets ( wavelength , oscillator strength , auto - ionization rates ) for inner - shell n=2 - 3 and n=2 - 4 ( mainly 2p3d , 2p4d ) photo - excitation for fe ions ( from 10 electrons to 20 electrons ) . observations in uv , visible and infra - red wavelengths , where those fe ions emit the most , are also important to have a realistic plasma modeling . \n .energy ( kev ) and wavelength (  ) ranges , as well as the spectral resolution of the spectrometers aboard the new generation of x - ray satellites : _ chandra _ ( nasa ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( esa ) . \n the _ letg _ and the _ hetg _ are onboard _ chandra _ , and the _ rgs _ is on board _ xmm - newton_.

unpredictability . on the other hand \n , the ekpyrotic cosmology does not have both problems andwith the aid of other ingredients , for example , the galileon cosmology and ghost condensate @xcitemanages to avoid another issue in standard cosmology : the problem of the initial singularity . as we can see , the ekpyrotic cosmology offers us an interesting option to the inflation . \n moreover , the ekpyrotic cosmology may be extended to a cyclic cosmology . in this cyclic scenario @xcite , \n one has a endless sequence where the universe expands and contracts . \n there is no beginning for the timetherefore , the problem of initial conditions is solved in this extended version . \n the ekpyrotic mechanism is able to remove debris generated in a previous cycle , such as black holes ( bhs ) . \n thus the existence of such a mechanism is crucial to build cyclic cosmologies . \n any modern scientific cosmology has the isotropy as a feature . from the beginning of the modernity \n , the cosmology assumes that there is no favourite place or direction in the universe ( contrary to both the plato s cosmology in his _ timaeus _ and the aristotle s view in _ on the heavens _ ) . \n the physics , from this time , describes the universe as isotropic at large scales . \n hence , the current scientific cosmology , an einsteinian cosmology , is assumed to be isotropic .    in this work , by using a determined approach , we intend to show that bhs supported by an isotropic fluid exclude an eos given by the ekpyrotic phase . from the mechanism developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and generalized in @xcite , we study , using the schwarzschild metric as ansatz , the family of deformed bhs with spherical symmetry supported by an isotropic fluid obtained in @xcite . \n we point out that these solutions are forbidden when supported by a stiff fluid ( @xmath3 ) \n . this result may be interpreted as an indirect indication of the ekpyrotic phase as a period that removes inhomogeneities , anisotropies and debris of a previous cosmic phase in cyclic cosmologies that use the ekpyrotic mechanism . \n the structure of this paper is presented in the following : in section 2 we presented the ekpyrotic mechanism and its main features ; in section 3 we show the solutions , supported by a isotropic fluid , constructed by means of deformations in the schwarzschild solution ; in section 4 , the final remarks . \n we adopt the metric signature @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the newtonian constant , and @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum . \n such as the standard big bang cosmology , the ekpyrotic cosmology assumes a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as a solution of the gravitational field equations to describe the spacetime fabric . in the first version @xcite , a brane world model was used . \n but , some years later , a four -

khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) instabilities , before the current expansion phase . \n the authors in @xcite have shown that the ekpyrotic mechanism works even when the initial conditions of this slow contraction phase are highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic .    however , the standard ekpyrotic mechanism with one scalar field is considered tachyonically unstable ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to solve this problem , another scalar field \n is introduced to generate a stable mechanism with nearly scale - invariant perturbations and small non - gaussianity @xcite .    in the next section \n , we will show how to build bh solutions supported by an isotropic fluid . to obtain these bhs , the approach which deforms bhs will be presented . \n contrary to the work @xcite , in this work , we do not study the initial conditions of the ekpyrotic phase and its evolution . in this article , we assume an isotropic fluid ( as a linear constraint in the deformation approach ) and show that an ekpyrotic phase does not support these deformed bhs . \n that is , an isotropic universe with eos @xmath3 , or an ekpyrotic phase where the universe is already isotropic ( close to the bounce ) , does not support the deformed geometries . \n the novel part of this work is the use of the deformation approach to show these results . \n it is possible to build isotropic bh solutions by means of deformations . from the standard singular solutions , such as schwarzschild , \n reissner - nordstrm , schwarzschild-(a)-ds and others @xcite , and regular solutions @xcite , at linear level , deformed bhs are obtained by imposing a linear constraint in the energy - momentum tensor ( the approach was generalized in @xcite , where other constraints were used ) . \n these deformed solutions are close to the standards bhs . \n a linear constraint in the energy -

order expansion coefficient . then \n , we want to obtain deformed solutions until the linear level ( in @xcite there is a discussion on the possibility of generating deformed solutions beyond the linear level ) . according to @xcite , \n the constant @xmath46 fixes basically three kind of solutions : for @xmath47 one has either regular or singular black holes , @xmath48 may determine wormholes , and for @xmath49 , one has extremal black holes . for @xmath50 \n the standard cases are restored .    in the linear regime , \n the function @xmath51 is determined from @xmath52,\\label{blin2}\\ ] ] which is solution of eq . \n ( [ constraint_3 ] ) using the ansatz ( [ a_0])-([b ] ) , where @xmath53 the zeros of @xmath54 are important because may determine the singularities of the spacetime . in this work , @xmath54 has one real root , @xmath55 . using the ansatz ( [ a_0 ] ) in the eqs . \n ( [ blin2])-([h(r ) ] ) , one has @xmath56,\\label{blin3}\\ ] ] and the metric ( [ metric ] ) is completely determined . the zeros of @xmath57 fix the horizons ( when a metric is written in the form ( [ metric ] ) , the localization of horizons is given by the zeros of @xmath58 ) . according to @xcite , bhs are possible only with @xmath47 ( our value of @xmath46 corresponds to the @xmath59 in the cited paper ) .    for @xmath60 \n , the function @xmath40 has two zeros , @xmath61 . \n the largest zero corresponds to the event horizon @xmath62 . \n the metric is singular at @xmath63 . \n then , the spacetime structure reads @xmath64 this case corresponds to a singular bh in a noncompact universe . \n when @xmath65 , the situation is quite different : there are three zeros in @xmath40 ( the third zero is not zero of @xmath66 ) . \n there is a maximum value of @xmath67 @xmath68 . according to @xcite , these values of @xmath46 \n lead to a singular bh in a compact universe . \n the spacetime structure is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 then , these are the two types of solutions when the ansatz is given by eqs . \n ( [ a_0])-([b ] ) assuming isotropy .    with @xmath66 and @xmath40 fixed , the values of the components of the energy - momentum tensor are : @xmath71 with these components in the energy - momentum tensor , an eos is possible : @xmath72 which is almost constant and always negative outside the event horizon ( see fig . \n 1 ) . for large @xmath67 \n , @xmath73 is about @xmath74 . in the case @xmath60 , \n one has the simple limit @xmath75 at the event horizon , one has @xmath76 . in this sense , these deformed metrics may not be supported ( such as the schwarzschild-(a)-ds metric is by a fluid with eos @xmath77 ) by a stiff fluid ( @xmath3 ) , dominant in the ekpyrotic phase . then , at linear level , bhs supported by an isotropic stiff fluid are ruled out . \n but not only a stiff fluid : as we can see , these metrics are not supported by either a fluid with eos @xmath78 ( radiation ) or a phantom - like fluid ( @xmath79 ) . outside the event horizon \n , the eos assumes @xmath80 , which are values corresponding to a quintessence fluid .     obtained from isotropic deformed solutions . as we can see , this eos is pretty much constant outside the event horizon and rules out a stiff fluid @xmath81 , dominant in the ekpyrotic phase . the dashed line indicates the event horizon . in this graphic \n we use @xmath82 . ] \n the ekpyrotic cosmology is an option for the inflationary mechanism to solve the problems of the standard cosmology ( including the initial singularity ) and to generate nearly scale - invariant quantum fluctuations . \n this alternative cosmology is characterized by a slow phase of contraction , where the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter - energy contend in this phase is dominated by a stiff fluid @xmath83 . \n we show that  by means of a procedure of generating deformed isotropic black holes ( bhs ) at linear level in @xmath40 , adopting a linear constraint in the energy - momentum tensor  the metrics with spherical symmetry obtained from the schwarzschild metric are not supported by a stiff fluid . \n these metrics are not supported by a stiff fluid in the same sense that the schwarzschild-(a)-ds metrics may be interpreted as solutions with spherical symmetry supported by a fluid with eos @xmath77 . \n we believe that this result may be seen as an _ indirect _ indication ( it is not a strong proof ) of the ability of the ekpyrotic phase to leave the universe free of inhomogeneities and debris ( and bhs may be interpreted as debris ) in a previous phase before the current phase of cosmic expansion \n . this result may be important for cosmological cyclic models that assume an ekpyrotic phase .", "StartTimeOffset": 1696716581902, "RequestID": "28f6658e610f4f99828f47977a14cc19", "TotalTokens": 3698}

{"ContextTokens": 2428, "GeneratedTokens": 298, "SynthesizedBody": "halo shapes are defined by diagonalizing the moments of inertia from which we derive the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the best ellipsoidal halo fit . \n the principal axes @xmath12 are related to the square root of the eigenvalues such that @xmath13 . our results , in agreement with other studies , indicate that although halos are triaxial they are significantly more prolate than oblate . \n this is quantified by using the so called triaxiality index @xcite defined as @xmath14 , which has limiting values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the case of a pure prolate and oblate spheroid , respectively . \n our results show that the fraction of halos with pronounced prolatness ( ie . , large @xmath17s ) is significantly higher than that of oblate - like halos . \n overall we obtain from our simulated halos that @xmath18 . \n an interesting question , especially for observational studies , is whether the 3d halo shape distribution can be inferred from the projected ( 2d ) shapes . \n this is an inversion problem for which , under the assumption of random halo orientation with respect to the line of sight and purely oblate or prolate spheroidal halos , there is a unique relation between the projected and intrinsic axial ratio distributions . \n this is described by a set of integral equations , first investigated by @xcite and given by @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 representing the intrinsic axial ratio while @xmath21 and @xmath22 the intrinsic prolate and oblate axial ratio distributions , respectively . \n the continuous function @xmath23 is derived from the discrete axial ratios frequency distribution using the so - called kernel estimators ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) . \n inverting then the above equations gives us the distribution of true axial ratios as a function of @xmath23 ( eg . \n @xcite ) . nevertheless , if halos are a mixture of the two spheroidal populations or they have triaxial configurations there is no unique inversion @xcite . \n however , all may not be lost and although the exact shape distribution may not be recovered accurately one could possibly infer whether the 3d halo shapes are predominantly more prolate or oblate - like . \n let us see this in more detail using our simulated intrinsically triaxial ellipsoidal halos which are however dominated by prolate - like shapes ( @xmath24 ) . \n the important point here is that in order for the inverted distribution to be physically meaningful it should be positive for all @xmath20 s . \n negative values indicate that the assumed model for the intrinsic halo shape is unacceptable . \n in fig.1 ( left panel ) we present the discrete and continuous - @xmath23 - distributions of the projected in 2d axial ratios for halos of two mass ranges ( indicated in the plot ) . in the middle and right panels we present the inverted 3d axial ratio distributions ( continuous lines ) for the prolate and oblate models , respectively . \n it is evident that the inverted oblate - model distribution has many negative values which is an important indication that this model is unacceptable , while the opposite is true for the prolate - model distribution . \n furthermore , we plot as histograms the intrinsic axial ratio distribution of the `` average '' prolate or oblate spheroidal fit to the 3d halo . \n these fits are realized by estimating the corresponding axial ratios by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n it is evident that the purely oblate model fails miserably to even come close to the inverted distribution while the prolate model fits relatively well the corresponding inverted 3d prolate - model distribution . \n this agrees with the higher prolatness of the 3d halo shapes . \n we therefore conclude that applying the previously discussed inversion method to observational data ( eg . \n @xcite , @xcite ) we can infer , even in the event of triaxial ellipsoidal halo shapes , the dominance of prolate or oblate - like 3d shapes . \n another interesting fact , shown in recent high - resolution simulations of the concordance model , is the correlation between halo mass and halo flattening , with more massive halos being flatter ( eg . @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n this is counter - intuitive in the sense that the massive halos should collapse faster than lower mass halos of roughly the same formation age and thus they should have more time to dynamically evolve and virialize , a process that should reduce their initial ellipsoidal configuration . \n however , halo formation ages vary and secondary infall , which if important it could affect the halo outskirts , can produce such elongated halo geometry . however , even in such a case the inner parts of the most massive halos should be virialized and thus nearly spherical , which however does not seem to be the case ( eg . \n @xcite their figure 7 ) . \n note that these results are based on dissipationless simulations while baryonic dissipation has been shown to affect halo shapes , producing significantly rounder halos ( eg . \n @xcite ) . also one may expect that halos in low - density regions , where tidal effects , accretion and merging are minimal to be less elongated , as indeed has been found ( eg . \n in order to define the dynamical state of a halo we use the @xmath27-deviation substructure statistic @xcite , which looks for deviations of the local velocity mean and dispersion around their overall halo values . for each halo particle \n we find its @xmath28 nearest neighbors from which we calculate their local velocity mean and dispersion which we then compare with their overall halo values . \n the local deviations are defined by : @xmath29 $ ] while the individual halo @xmath27-statistic is given by the sum @xmath30 . \n it has been found that a robust measure of the substructure index is given when using @xmath31 @xcite , which is the value that we use . in figure 2 \n we show the velocity dispersion ( right panel ) and @xmath32 axial ratio ( left panel ) distributions for halos in the mass range @xmath33 . \n those that have a substructure index @xmath34 are shown as hatched histograms while the overall halo distributions as dashed - line histograms . \n _ it is evident that dynamically young halos ( ie . \n , those with significant substructure ) are more elongated and have a higher velocity dispersion than the overall halo population . _ \n furthermore , we investigate the correlation between halo velocity dispersion and halo mass . from our halo identification procedure \n we expect that most halos should be nearly virialized and thus their velocity dispersion should be strongly correlated with their mass via the virial theorem . indeed , there is a strong correlation between the velocity dispersion and the halo mass , measured by summing the member dm particles masses , with a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath35 . \n we find however , that this strong correlation breaks down in the vicinity of large halo hosts . in figure 3 \n we show with open points the correlation coefficient between halo @xmath36 and mass as a function of distance to their nearest massive ( @xmath37 ) host neighbor . \n the monotonic drop of the correlation coefficient with decreasing halo - host separation is evident . \n we also find that there is a significant although weaker correlation between @xmath36 and the substructure index ( @xmath27 ) , which increases as the halo - host distance decreases . \n this probably implies that halos near large hosts are either disrupted due to the presence of strong tidal fields or more probably that the excess density of sub - halos near hosts induce strong inter - halo gravitational interactions and merging . \n these results have important consequences for observational studies and put important limits on the validity of using the virial theorem to estimate group or cluster masses in the vicinity of massive clusters . \n allgood et al . , \n apj , _ in press _ , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 2286, "GeneratedTokens": 172, "SynthesizedBody": "in a binary system where at least one of the stars is surrounded by a circumstellar disk , tidal waves excited by the companion propagate into the disk . if the disk and the orbital plane are coplanar , these waves are called density waves . in a noncoplanar system , both density and bending waves are excited . they are respectively of even and odd symmetry with respect to reflection in the disk midplane . \n the pattern speed @xmath0 with which the tidally excited pattern rotates is @xmath1 and @xmath2 for density and bending waves , respectively , where @xmath1 if the binary angular speed . \n the disk is truncated by tidal effects in such a way that its radius is not greater than about one  third of the separation of the system ( papaloizou & pringle 1977 , paczyski 1977 , larwood et al . \n 1996 for the non coplanar case ) . therefore , @xmath0 is smaller than the angular speed of the gas in the disk , and the tidal pattern carries negative angular momentum ( or , in other words , the torque exerted on the disk by the companion is negative ) . through dissipation of the waves , \n the disk then loses angular momentum and disk material flows inwards , whereas the companion star , which excites the waves , gains this angular momentum .    since there is no corotation resonance in the disk , secular exchange of angular momentum between the disk rotation and the orbital motion \n occurs only if the waves dissipate , either in the bulk of the disk or at its boundaries ( goldreich & nicholson 1989 ) . in a laminar disk , dissipation of tidal waves may arise through shocks . \n a shock front forms when the group velocity of the wave relative to that of the fluid ( or , equivalently , the perturbed velocity ) is supersonic . \n shocks are very dissipative so the wave amplitude can not rise much above the level where the front first forms . in other words , \n the wave is decelerated at the shock front in such a way as to restore marginally sonic wave motion . \n conservation of wave action may tend to cause the amplitude of the ( shock)wave to increase again as it propagates further in , but this effect is balanced by shock dissipation maintaining the amplitude at the marginal level . \n tidally  induced angular momentum transport has been considered as an alternative to turbulent transport ( shu 1976 , sawada et al . \n 1986 , spruit et al . \n 1987 , larson 1989 , see also larson in this volume ) . \n it is viewed as particularly attractive in disks where the ionization level is too low for the magnetorotational instability to operate ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) . however , while the presence of spiral waves have been inferred in the accretion disk of the dwarf nova ip  peg ( steeghs et al . \n 1997 ) , there are no indications that they are associated with significant angular momentum transport . \n below we consider successively the case of density and bending waves . \n there are two main obstacles to the propagation of density waves down to small radii . \n first , if the disk is vertically stratified , the wave front tends to be tilted upwards so that the wave action migrates towards the surface of the disk and into any atmosphere it possesses where it can take on high amplitude and be dissipated ( lin et al . \n 1990a , 1990b ) . only under the artificial assumptions of a strict polytropic edge and no dissipation \n can it be channeled into and remain in a very narrow surface waveguide ( ogilvie & lubow 1999 ) . \n migration of wave action towards the surface ( or wave refraction ) is more effective for high azimuthal mode number @xmath3 , but is still efficient for the two  armed spirals which are predominantly excited in binaries . \n this is because even though these waves have a larger wavelength in the linear regime , if they become nonlinear their profile necessarily distort and develop short wavelength components for which refraction might be important . \n the second obstacle to long range wave propagation is a low temperature or , equivalently , a high mach number ( e.g. , spruit 1987 , savonije et al . \n 1994 , godon et al . \n 1998 , armitage & murray 1998 , blondin 2000 ) . \n this is because the characteristic wavelength of the excited waves decreases with increasing mach number , so that it becomes very small compared with the scale associated with the forcing potential ( lin & papaloizou 1993 ) . \n the torque , which is obtained by integrating over the volume of the disk the perturbed mass density times the tidal force , is then very small . \n there have been a number of 3d numerical calculations of tidal shock waves ( see yukawa et al . \n 1997 and references therein , haraguchi et al . 1999 ) but the loss of disk angular momentum has not been computed in these calculations . \n spiral shocks were seen in some of these simulations , but they were much less distinct than in 2d . even in 2d , where refraction is absent and therefore tidal effects are overestimated , the pattern observed in ip  peg can be reproduced only in the outer disk during outburst , when the enhanced viscosity pushes the disk edge into a region of strong gravitational perturbations from the secondary ( armitage & murray 1998 ) , or for unrealistically hot disks ( godon et al . 1998 ) . \n note that observations themselves only show spirality in the outer disk in ip  peg . in 2d , \n calculations by savonije et al . \n ( 1994 ) and blondin ( 2000 ) suggest that wave  driven accretion onto the central star occurs in disks where the mach number is smaller than about 10 , whereas it is inefficient when the mach number is larger than about 20 . \n since the mach number in protostellar disks is thought to be larger than 10 ( the disk aspect ratio is around 0.050.1 ) , tidally \n induced transport is probably not significant in the disk inner parts . \n bending waves are more efficient at transporting angular momentum in a disk than density waves , because they have a longer wavelength ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) . for the same reason they can also propagate down to smaller radii . \n papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) calculated the @xmath4 bending wave response of an inviscid disk with the rotation axis misaligned with a binary companion s orbital rotation axis . \n they assumed that the waves were dissipated by nonlinear interaction with the background flow before reaching the disk inner edge , so that all their angular momentum was deposited into the disk . \n they found that @xmath4 bending waves can lead to the accretion of the disk on a timescale in excess of a few times @xmath5 years . \n terquem ( 1998 ) calculated the tidal torque in a viscous disk ( where the waves are viscously damped ) and found that it can be comparable to the torque communicated internally by horizontal viscous stress acting on the background flow when the perturbed velocities in the disk are on the order of the sound speed . \n the tidal torque can exceed the horizontal viscous torque only if the viscous stress tensor is anisotropic with the parameter @xmath6 which couples to the vertical shear being larger than that coupled to the horizontal shear . \n when the perturbed velocities become supersonic , shocks reduce the amplitude of the perturbation such that the disk moves back to a state where these velocities are marginally sonic ( nelson & papaloizou 1998 ) . \n when shocks occur , the tidal torque exerted on the disk may become larger than the horizontal viscous torque . \n terquem ( 1998 ) also found that if the waves are reflected at the center , resonances occur when the frequency of the tidal waves is equal to that of some free normal global bending mode of the disk . \n if such resonances exist , tidal interactions may then be important even when the binary separation is large . \n however , it is unlikely that in a realistic accretion disk waves can be reflected at the disk inner edge . therefore , in a viscous disk \n , it is unlikely that transport of angular momentum is increased by more than a factor two or so by tidal effects . \n it was also found that if @xmath6 is larger than about @xmath7 , bending waves are damped before they can reach the disk inner parts . \n tidal effects in pre  main sequence binary systems are important for truncating protostellar disks and for determining their size . however , once the disk is truncated , the calculations reviewed above suggest that tidally  induced angular momentum transport does probably not play a dominant role . where the disk is ionized enough so that the magnetorotational instability can develop , transport of angular momentum is most probably dominated by magnetic turbulence . \n if the disk is laminar , the amount of transport provided by tidal waves is unlikely to be large enough to account for the dissipation of the disk on a timescale on the order of a few million years . \n in addition , tidal effects tend to be exerted mainly at the disk outer edge , where the perturbation is the strongest . \n strong tidal effects at the outer edge of the disk would allow mass from the outer region to retract inwards , subsequently weakening the tides at the edge . \n some pile up of mass may result at smaller radii , but whether that would affect significantly the whole disk would depend on the disk mass .", "StartTimeOffset": 1738399878264, "RequestID": "4596a91280e1452c83b61ce8dd213dfa", "TotalTokens": 2458}

@xcite ) poses a real challenge to models of neutron stars built using the so - called modern equation of state ( eos ) where the uncertainties are reduced by improved two- and three - body forces , relativistic effects and many - body calculations @xcite . \n even the stiffest eos so far developed seem to be facing difficulty in accounting for the extreme values ( up to @xmath3 ; sect . \n 4 ) . in @xcite , \n hereafter ob , as an alternative , we constructed an eos of dense matter based on the skyrme model for strong interactions which represents baryons as solitons of classic pionic fields . \n the resulting compact objects we named _ skyrmion stars _ ( sss ) @xcite are intrinsically heavier ( due to the stiffness of the skyrmion fluid ; hereafter sf ) than any other type of compact stars computed using modern eos . \n sss can be as massive as @xmath4 leading us to speculate ( given the above mentioned observations ) that these might exist in nature . \n we expect only older sss that have accreted enough mass to reach these extreme masses . ] . \n the paper is presented as follows : sect . \n 2 is devoted to the discussion of the skyrme model and its link to quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n the problem of the _ missing attraction _ in the skyrme model is described . in sect . \n 3 , we discuss the role the dilaton ( the glueball potential in qcd ) could play in curing such a problem by binding skyrmions together to form the sf . \n we end sect . 3 by reminding the reader of the basic properties of the sf and the resulting eos used to construct models of sss . \n the astrophysical implications follow in sect . 4 where we compare sss to stars constructed using modern eos of dense matter . \n we conclude in sect . \n we first give a brief overview of the skyrme model . \n the fundamental principles are discussed at a basic level . \n the interested reader is referred to ref . \n @xcite for a thorough introduction to the topic . \n skyrme constructed a model of pion interactions consisting of a conventional model of weak meson interactions plus an additional ( higher - order ) term thought to take into account indirect effects of heavier mesons like the @xmath5-meson . \n the now well - known skyrme lagrangian density is usually written as @xcite , @xmath6 where , @xmath7 is the skyrme term ( @xmath8 is the chiral field and @xmath9 is interpreted as the pion decay constant ) , and @xmath10 [ u^{+}\\partial^{\\mu}u , u^{+}\\partial^{\\nu}u ] ) \\label{three}\\ ] ] is the quadratic term introduced by skyrme to keep the skyrmion stable against the derrick instability @xcite ( @xmath11 is the skyrme parameter ) . \n skyrme found that his model contained ` topologically nontrivial ' configurations ( extended objects ) of the meson fields , namely topological solitons , which he identified as baryons . for twenty years \n the skyrme model was overshadowed by the tremendous success of qcd and only in the early 1980 s after the establishment of its link to low energy qcd that the model was revived . \n the success of qcd is limited to the high energy regime , while at low energy it remains virtually intractable . \n the reason for this is that qcd has a running coupling constant @xmath12 ; it is a function of momentum transfer , or distance . at short distances of the order of 0.1 fm or less ( high energy and momentum transfer of several gev ) qcd \n is characterized by a small enough @xmath12 that it is treated perturbatively . \n all of the results obtained in this regime are consistent with experimental data . \n this is the phase in which the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons and it is called the asymptotic freedom phase . at large distances of the order of 1 fm or more ( low energy and momentum transfer of 1 gev or less ) @xmath12 is of the order of unity and qcd is a nonperturbative theory . \n this is the confinement phase in which quarks are confined inside hadrons and the hadronic degrees of freedom are more relevant . \n this phase , which is the most practical , is the most mathematically complex . \n it should provide all properties of hadrons such as masses , sizes , magnetic moments , lifetimes , scattering properties and , in principle , all nuclear phenomena . \n the first major step to overcome this problem was taken by @xmath13thooft @xcite . \n he found that in the limit of a large number of colors ( large @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 could be used as an expansion parameter . in this limit \n , qcd simplifies a great deal and @xmath13thooft went on to show that at large @xmath14 , qcd is equivalent to a local field theory of mesons and ` glueballs ' ( bound states of gluons , without quarks ) , with an effective interaction between them of order @xmath15 . \n the second step was taken by witten @xcite . \n assuming confinement , he showed that baryons in large @xmath14 qcd behave much like solitons in a weakly coupled local field theory of mesons . in this limit , \n baryon masses scale as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the strength of the meson coupling , while baryon sizes are of order 1 . \n solitons in weakly coupled theories have masses that scale as @xmath18 and sizes that tend to constants as @xmath17 tends to zero . \n even though the mesons are weakly interacting , the solitons interact strongly as do baryons in qcd . \n the next natural step , it seems , is to derive the effective meson lagrangian from the fundamental qcd lagrangian . \n this task , as it turned out , is immensely difficult . \n its achievement is equivalent to the solution of the intractable original problem of low energy nonperturbative qcd in the confinement phase . \n nevertheless , the form of the resulting effective lagrangian is being narrowed down under reasonable assumptions . \n assuming chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in qcd ( with the physical pions as the resulting goldstone bosons , and taking the low energy limit in which one expects the golstone bosons to dominate the dynamics ) it has been shown that the first term in the resulting low energy effective lagrangian is @xcite : @xmath19 which is astonishingly similar to the skyrme term ( eq .  [ two ] ) ! this picture , which emerged from large-@xmath20 qcd , is precisely what skyrme had in mind long before qcd . \n further work showed that the similarities between the skyrme model and to what is described as the nature of mesons and baryons in large @xmath21 qcd is simply intriguing . \n the skyrme model , however , as it is build was known to predict an isospin independent spin - orbit force with the _ wrong _ sign . \n that is , it predicts a _ repulsive _ interaction . \n the product ansatz for the two - baryon system as suggested in ref . \n @xcite ( eq .  [ two ] ) , beyond its relative simplicity as compared to other two - baryon field configurations which can be found in the literature @xcite , becomes exact for large @xmath22 separation . \n unfortunately , it is not the case for the isoscalar component of the spin - orbit force since the standard skyrme model predicts an isospin independent spin - orbit force with the _ wrong _ sign . \n namely , it predicts a _ repulsive _ interaction while the phenomenological bonn potential @xcite as the paris potential @xcite gives an _ attractive _ one . \n this came to be known as the problem of the _ missing attraction_. extensions of the skyrme model consisted on including higher - order terms in powers of the derivatives of the pion field @xcite . \n expressed in terms of an @xmath23 matrix @xmath8 which , as we have said characterizes the pion field , a six - order term corresponding to @xmath24-meson exchange @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the baryon current , @xmath27 the @xmath24-meson mass and @xmath28 a dimensionless parameter related to the @xmath29 width , might be a good candidate to solve the problem of the @xmath22 isoscalar spin - orbit force . while it was believed that the inclusion of such a term leads to the correct sign ( _ attractive _ interaction ) for the isoscalar spin - orbit potential @xcite , recent calculations ( see ref . \n @xcite for e.g. ) proved that by taking into account the second part of of the sixth - order term the anomaly of the skyrme model ( _ repulsive _ force instead of _ attractive _ ) remains . \n the treatment of the spin - orbit part of the two - pion exchange potential within the skyrme model needed to be improved in order to correct the anomaly of that sign . \n below we explain how and why the dilaton field was suggested as a plausible cure . \n in ref . @xcite and @xcite the authors explored the idea of coupling the skyrmion to the dilaton field . \n this idea to _ account for a scalar field _ \n confines the skyrmion and provides the attractive term missing in the original skyrme formalism ( see ob for more on this ) . \n we start by writing the energy of @xmath30 skyrmions per unit volume ( parameterized by the density , @xmath31 ) at finite temperature . in the mean field approximation \n it is given by ( where we adopt natural units with @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the strength of the coupling of the @xmath35-meson ( of mass @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the mean - field value ) to skyrmions while @xmath38 represents the isospin degrees of freedom ( @xmath39 for neutron matter and @xmath40 for symmetric nuclear matter ) ) , the @xmath5 meson coupling has been omitted which reduces the analysis to symmetric nuclear matter only . as such in ob the isospin degrees of freedom ( @xmath41 ) was taken as a free parameter as to allow for the two regimes  pure neutron matter and symmetric matter  to be explored . ] . \n @xmath42 is the contribution to energy of a single skyrmion while @xmath43 is the skyrmion s momentum . @xmath44 and @xmath45 parameterize the single particle and anti - particle distribution functions . \n the pressure of such an ensemble at @xmath46 is then simply given by @xmath47 . \n one finds that the contribution of the vector meson field ( @xmath35 ) to the pressure grows with density ( @xmath48 ) , and is positive ; the dilaton potential @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the mean - field value ) gives a negative contribution to the pressure , acting to bind the system into a fluid ; the sf . \n once the eos describing such a fluid is derived ( ob ) the corresponding compact objects ( sss ) are then computed @xcite . \n sss in our picture are not boson / soliton stars where the soliton is a global structure over the scale of the star but rather form their constituent baryons as topological solitons using pions fields . \n this is fundamentally different from other \n exotic \" stars which also follow from solutions to an effective non - linear field theory of strong forces ( see also @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . in what follows , we conclude this letter by describing astrophysical cases plausibly supporting the existence of sss in nature . \n in fig .  [ fig.1 ] we compare the @xmath51 relation for skyrmion stars ( ob ) to the theoretical @xmath51 curve obtained using six recent realistic models for the eos ( uu , bbb1 , bbb2 , bpal12 , hyp , and k@xmath52 ) . the solid curves labeled ss1 and ss2 are for strange stars ( the data was kindly provided to us by the authors of ref . \n the triangle depicts the mass - radius constraint from fits to x - ray bursts in 4u 1636 - 53 . inside the triangle \n is the allowed range of @xmath53 and @xmath54 which satisfies the compactness constraints as modeled in ref . \n @xcite ( see their figure 4 ) , and clearly favoring stiffer eoss . \n our modeled stars ( ob ) cross the triangle suggestive of 4u 1636 - 53 as a plausible ss candidate . \n _ qpos _ are neutron stars emitting x - rays at frequencies of the orbiting accreting matter \n . such _ quasi - periodic oscillations _ ( qpo ) have been found in 12 binaries of neutron stars with low mass companions . \n if the qpo originate from the innermost stable orbit @xcite ) of the accreting matter , their observed values imply that the accreting neutron star has a mass of @xmath55 in the case of 4u 1820 - 30 ; this would rule out most modern eoss allowing only the stiffest ones . \n sss is one possibility given that the gravitational mass of the maximum stable non - rotating ss has a value of @xmath4 ( ob ) . for completeness \n , one should note that even by making the modern / recent eos stiffer at high densities in a smooth way , the maximum mass can never exceed @xmath56 due to the causality condition @xcite . \n we gave a brief historical overview of the skyrme model , its predictions of hadronic interactions and its interesting connection to qcd . \n here we showed how the repulsive term in the skyrme model can be removed by coupling the skyrmion to the dilaton field . \n this lead to the concept of the skyrmion fluid and the related hypothetical stars we called skyrmion stars . \n the stiffness of the skyrmion fluid allows for sss to be as massive as @xmath57 . \n the sss show unique features ; for a given mass their radii are in general larger than those of neutron stars constructed using modern eoss . \n we discussed examples in astrophysics where sss might constitute plausible candidates . \n future observations constraining the mass - radius plane of compact stars would most likely prove or rule out the existence of sss in nature . \n * acknowledgements . \n * i am grateful to s. morsink , g. klbermann and r. bhaduri for encouraging help and valuable discussions . \n the research of r.o . is supported by grants from the natural science and engineering council of canada ( nserc ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1751695304976, "RequestID": "203f0d0d3cf9416abfae08514e82b208", "TotalTokens": 3700}

train gap of about 200ms . \n the data are taken by the detectors on the detection slabs and digitised by the very front - end on - detector electronics or slabs . \n then all output data are delivered to electronics boards at the end of the detector . \n data is then sent to a concentrator card which collects data from many detector units before being sent off the detector on gigabit optical fibres to a detector receiver in the counting room . \n figure[fig_daqoverview ] gives an overview of the generic daq scheme . \n the calorimeter is designed such that vfe chips are embedded in the detector slabs . \n the slabs are served from the ends with a detector interface ( dif ) . \n the difs transmit the data to the link - data aggregator ( lda ) which is fitted on - detector and serves many difs via standard hdmi links . \n the data from the ldas are fed to the off - detector receiver ( odr ) via the gigabit optical cables . \n the odr is a dedicated pci - express card which is hosted in a daq pc , being capable of saving the data to central storage . \n the detector signals are buffered and digitised by the vfe asics situated on the detector slabs . \n the vfe asics depend on the detector used in the prototypes accommodating the different features of each detectors . \n the interface between the vfe and the daq system is provided by the dif board which is located at the end of the calorimeter slabs . \n the dif board consists of a customised part which translates the signals of the asics into more generic signals which are independent of the detector used for the calorimeter . \n the interface has been defined together with three detector groups working on prototypes for the ecal , ahcal and dhcal within the eudet@xcite project and is common to the three different detector types . a generic part of the dif passes the data on and sends configuration on to the vfe electronics . \n hdmi@xcite is a home entertainment system standard with small cabling and connectors which are commercially available at low cost . \n they are rated at more than 300mb / sec for data . to provide redundancy against link failures , \n a provision is made on the dif to connect to its neighbour . by connecting even and odd difs to different ldas \n , the system is protected for the loss of a dif - lda link , or even the failure of an entire lda .      in order to accumulate the data sent from the dif , \n an lda collects the data from several difs and sends it further to the odr . \n the number of difs aggregated in the lda depends on the detector type chosen in the detection layer \n . the optimal number of difs / lda should take into account the number of available pins on the fpga , the bandwidth per dif and the effective performance - price ratio to maximise bandwidth of the optical link . \n the current lda prototype can host up to eight links to the difs with a small upgrade up to ten dif connections . \n the lda has banks of hdmi connectors for connections to the difs and a small form -

on boards : one providing the sfp and serialiser chipset for the optical link , the other hosting eight working hdmi connectors with clock fan - out hardware . \n a first prototype of the lda has been produced by the company enterpoint @xcite and has been thoroughly tested . \n the lda is situated at the edge of the detector , the odr however is located in the counting room connected to the on - detector daq system by an optical fibre . as well as receiving data from the detector , it sends control and configuration data to the lda for distribution to the difs and finally sends the data off the detector to the event building . \n it is realised as a pci - express card and can serve up to four ldas per card , with one pc hosting up to two odrs . \n for the proposed daq system currently a xilinxvirtex4 fpga is used , thereby using a commercial fpga board designed by plda@xcite . at present , the data stream which will come from the detector in the eudet test beam is simulated by an internal data generator in the firmware or via an on - board ethernet interface ; this allows for a thorough debugging and optimisation of the system before integration with the detectors . \n the user interface to the odr card contains two parts : a customised driver and a client program . \n the former is mainly tasked with mapping card memory to the user space and providing direct memory access ( dma ) support . \n the latter client retrieves data from the odr card memory and stores it on the local disk . \n the performance of the prototype odr has been investigated using an ethernet interface to provide an input data stream which is copied to host memory and is currently higher than 150 mb / s writing to an array of disks \n . a higher data rate of up to 700mb / s can be achieved when writing into the host memory . \n the number of dmas has been optimised for the performance . \n the odr prototype is ready and can be optimised further in the next months . \n for the event building a good clock is essential because the events will be built using time stamps . \n it is understood that a machine clock will be fed into the odrs and fanned out to the ldas and difs . \n the requirements on the clock are a low jitter and a fixed latency between the machine clock and the clock in the difs . \n commercial networking hardware is not suited for this task as it is most efficient when it can buffer data and provides no guarantees on delivery times . similarly networking hardware built into modern fpgas suffers from varying latency . \n therefore a clock and control ( c&c ) board has been designed with links to eight odrs . \n the c&c logic is implemented on a board with 6u format , translating into a board size of 100mm@xmath1160 mm . \n the clock and control module must interface with the machine and provide stand - alone signal and clock generation . \n the machine clock is expected to run between 50 and 100mhz . \n the bunch clock will be derived as a multiple of the machine clock . \n it is able to deliver fast asynchronous triggers . \n it will also receive a busy signal from the vfe . \n the hdmi cables used for the dif to lda link will be reused here for sending control data . \n the c&c board has been delivered and has been successfully tested . in parallel the firmware for the c&c board is being developed . \n the most important requirement on the daq software for the calorimeters is its scalability . in order to minimise risks and to shorten development time \n a well - established software framework will be used . \n doocs@xcite was found to be suitable for our daq needs .    to adapt doocs to the requirements of our daq software \n the equipment name server ( ens ) has been used to integrate all daq components into one system . \n ens provides services for naming resolution and rpc communication . in the naming structure of ens \n all the functionalities and properties for each device have to be classified and defined . as seen in fig.[fig_daqoverview ] , the odr is the first hardware layer which can communicate with doocs . \n therefore the software for the odr has been the starting point of the daq software development . \n the doocs client provides a list of commands and configurable parameter with which the odr devices can be managed . \n configuration data and files are used when the system starts and runs . \n a prototype for the odr doocs client has already been shown . to steer the whole system with the doocs control software several further developments are in progress . \n the daq system for the eudet detector will be a hierarchical daq system which minimises the space needed on the detector and uses commercial components to minimise the cost of the daq system . in order to make the development for \n the test system independent of the detector type tested a dif board will make the readout generic . \n an lda card will concentrate the data from the dif and send it off to the odr which is located off the detector in a control room . \n the task of the odr is to store the data . \n all components have in addition the task to send configuration data and control messages to the detector and all other daq components upstream . \n at the time of writing each hardware component of the daq system exists and has been tested ; the individual components now need to be integrated into a complete system . \n current tests have shown that the daq software is able to integrate the odr into the daq system based on the existing software framework doocs and manage successful communication and control tests . \n the goal is to have the whole daq system ready for a test beam in 2009 . \n we would like to acknowledge the support of the commission of the european communities under the 6th framework programme `` structuring the european research area '' , contract number rii3 -

{"ContextTokens": 3962, "GeneratedTokens": 110, "SynthesizedBody": "many of complicated quantum procedures admit an interpretation in terms of some classical analogues . the mass renormalization in qed represents a peculiar case . it is universally recognized due to an incredible exactness of its predictions , and \n its origin lies in the classical theory of a pointlike electron ; nevertheless , there are serious problems with physical interpretation and mathematical correctness of this procedure .    in this paper , we consider a semiclassical model of a spinning particle based on the kerr - newman solution of the einstein - maxwell theory . \n this solution has double gyromagnetic ratio , as that of the dirac electron and may be considered as a model of electron in general relativity @xcite .    in this paper \n we would like to show that the mass renormalization and regularization of the singularities in the kerr - newman source are perfectly realized by gravitational field in a very natural manner . \n it allows one to conjecture that the methodological problems in qed may be related to the ignorance of gravity . \n qed ignores gravitational field arguing that its local action is negligible . \n it is true , but only partially . \n the kerr solution gives a contr - example to this assertion , showing that the local action of the gravitational field may extend on the compton distances due to the stringy structure of the source . \n however , the main effect of gravity is apparently related to a non - local action . \n we would like to show here that in the semiclassical model of the kerr spinning particle , gravity provides the mass renormalization . \n the mass of an isolated source is determined only by an asymptotic gravitational field , and , therefore , it depends only on the mass parameter @xmath0 which survives in the asymptotic expansion of the metric . on the other hand , \n the total mass can be calculated as a volume integral , which takes into account densities of the electromagnetic energy @xmath1 material ( mechanical mass ) sources @xmath2 and energy of the gravitational field @xmath3 . the last term is not taken into account in qed , but it provides perfect renormalization . for a spherically symmetric system , the expression may be reduced to an integral over radial distance @xmath4    m = 4_0^_em dr + 4_0^_m dr + 4_0^_g dr [ mtot ] . \n it looks like the expressions in a flat spacetime . \n however , in the kerr - schild background it is a consequence of the exact tolman relations taking into account energy of matter , energy of gravitational field ( including the contribution from pressure ) and rotation @xcite . in the well known classical model of an electron as a charged sphere with electromagnetic radius @xmath5 integration in ( [ mtot ] ) \n is performed in the diapason @xmath6,$ ] where @xmath7 the total mass is determined by electromagnetic contribution only , and contribution from gravity turns out to be null . however , if @xmath8 the electromagnetic contribution exceeds the total mass and this extension is to be compensated by the negative gravitational contribution . \n indeed , the results will not depend on the cut parameter @xmath9 and , moreover , on radial distribution of matter at all \n . some of the terms may be divergent , but the total result will not be changed , since divergences will always be compensated by a contribution from a gravitational term . \n it shows that , due to the strong non - local action , gravity may be essential for elementary particles , on the distances which are very far from the usually considered planck scale . \n the kerr - newman solution breaks the prevailing point of view that the local action of gravitational field of a particle extends to its schwarzschild radius . \n the schwarzschild singular point turns in the kerr rotating geometry into a singular ring which extends on the compton sizes , since its radius @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , is the compton one , which exceeds the schwarzschild one for an electron at @xmath12 . \n angular momentum @xmath13 for parameters of electron is so high that the black hole horizons disappear , and the source of the kerr spinning particle represents a naked singular ring which may have some stringy excitations , generating the spin and mass of the extended particle - like object - `` microgeon '' @xcite . \n therefore , the kerr source represents a closed singular string of the compton size , and can not be localized in the region which is smaller then the compton size . \n it was shown , that this source is indeed a string @xcite resembling a heterotic string of superstring theory . note \n that this singularity is a branch line of the kerr space which turns out to be two - sheeted , and the disk spanned on this ring plays the role of gates to anti - world ( `` negative '' sheet ) , where the signs of charges and masses , and the directions of the fields are changed . \n so , the kerr string is an `` alice '' one , and all the fields have to fill these ` gates to anti - world ' which have the giant compton sizes ( @xmath14 cm ) . \n note that in qed it is the region of virtual photons . \n one more remarkable structure of the kerr geometry is pnc ( principal null congruence ) . \n it is a vortex of the lightlike rays ( twistors ) which fall on the ` negative sheet ' on the kerr disk , penetrate it and turn into outgoing ` out'-fields on the ` positive sheet ' of space ( see fig.1 ) . \n pnc is a very important object since the tangent to congruence vector @xmath15 determines the kerr - schild ansatz for metric g^=^+ 2h k^k^n [ ks ] ( where @xmath16 is the auxiliary minkowski metric ) and the form of vector potential a_= a ( x ) k_[aem ] for electrically charged solution , i.e. it determines polarization of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields around the kerr source and the directions of radiation for the nonstationary excited solutions @xcite . \n the kerr congruence is determined by the kerr theorem @xcite in terms of twistors . \n the kerr singular ring is a focal line of the kerr pnc . \n the kerr - schild form of metric allows one to consider a broad class of regularized solutions which remove the kerr singular ring , covering it by a matter source . \n there is a long - term story of the attempts to find some interior regular solution for the kerr or kerr - newman solutions @xcite . \n usually , the regularized solutions have to retain the kerr - schild form of metric and the form of kerr principal null congruence @xmath17 as well as its property to be geodesic and shear - free . \n the space part @xmath18 of the kerr congruence @xmath19 has the form of a spinning hedgehog . \n indeed , by setting the parameter of rotation @xmath20 equal to zero , the kerr singular ring shrinks to a singular point , and @xmath18 takes the usual hedgehog form which is used as an ansatz for the solitonic models of elementary particles and quarks . \n it suggests that the kerr spinning particle may have relation not only to electron , but also to the other elementary particles . \n indeed , the kerr - schild class of metric has a remarkable property , allowing us to consider a broad class of the charged and uncharged , the spinning and spinless solutions from an unified point of view . \n our treatment will be based on the approach given in @xcite , where the _ smooth _ regularized sources were obtained for the rotating and non - rotating solutions of the kerr - schild class . \n these smooth and regular solutions have the scalar function @xmath21 of the general form h = f(r)/(r^2 + a^2 ^2 ) [ hf ] . for the kerr - newman solution function \n @xmath22 has the form f(r)f_kn= mr -e^2/2 [ hkn ] . \n regularized solutions have tree regions :    \\i ) the kerr - newman exterior , @xmath23 , where @xmath24    \\ii ) interior @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and function @xmath27 and @xmath28 to suppress the singularity at @xmath29 and provide the smoothness of the metric up to the second derivatives ;    \\iii ) a narrow intermediate region @xmath30 $ ] which allows one to get a smooth solution interpolating between regions i ) and ii ) . \n it is advisable to consider first the non - rotating cases , since the rotation can later be taken into account by an easy trick . in this case , taking @xmath31 and the parameter @xmath32 one obtains for the source ( interior ) a space - time of constant curvature @xmath33 which is generated by a source with energy density    = 1 4 ( fr -f)/^2 , [ rhof ]    and tangential and radial pressures    p_rad=- , p_tan=- 1 8f/ , [ p ]    where @xmath34 it yields for the interior the stress - energy tensor @xmath35 or    = -p_rad =- p_tan= , [ rho ]    which generates a de sitter interior for @xmath36 and an anti de sitter interior for @xmath37 . if @xmath38 we have a flat interior which corresponds to some previous classical models of an electron , in particular , to the dirac model of a charged sphere and to the lopez model in the form of a rotating elliptic shell @xcite . \n the resulting sources may be considered as the bags filled by a special matter with positive ( @xmath39 ) or negative ( @xmath40 ) energy density . \n the transfer from the external electro - vacuum solution to the internal region ( source ) may be considered as a phase transition from ` true ' to ` false ' vacuum in a supersymmetric @xmath41 higgs model @xcite . \n assuming that transition region iii ) is very thin , one can consider the following graphical representation which turns out to be very useful , see figure 2 . \n the point of phase transition @xmath9 is determined by the equation @xmath42 which yields @xmath43 from ( [ rho ] ) , we have @xmath44 and obtain the equation    m= + 4 3 r_0 ^ 3 .    in the first term on the right - hand side , one can easily recognize the electromagnetic mass of a charged sphere with radius @xmath9 , @xmath45 , while the second term is the mass of this sphere filled by a material with a homogenous density @xmath46 , @xmath47 thus , the point of intersection @xmath9 acquires a deep physical sense , providing an energy balance by the mass formation . \n in particular , for the classical dirac model of a charged sphere with radius @xmath48 the balance equation yields the flat internal space with @xmath49 if @xmath50 , the interior is de sitter space , and a material mass of positive energy @xmath51 gives a contribution to the total mass @xmath0 . if @xmath52 this contribution has to be negative @xmath53 which is accompanied by the formation of an ads internal space . \n all the above treatments are valid for the rotating cases , and for the passage to a rotating case , one has only to set    = r^2 + a^2 ^2 , and consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 as the oblate spheroidal coordinates @xcite . \n it looks wonderful , however it is a direct consequence of the structure of function @xmath21 , in which the nominator is independent from the rotation parameter @xmath56    the kerr - newman spinning particle with a spin @xmath57 acquires the form of a relativistically rotating disk which foliates on the rigidly rotating ellipsoidal shells , and the board of the disk has @xmath58 @xcite . \n the corresponding stress - energy tensor ( [ rho ] ) describes in this case the matter of source in a co - rotating with this disk coordinate system . \n the disk has the form of a highly oblate ellipsoid with thickness @xmath9 and radius @xmath59 which is of order of the compton length . \n interior of the disk represents a `` false '' vacuum having superconducting properties @xcite , so the charges are concentrated on the surface of this disk , at @xmath60 . inside the disk , \n the local gravitational field is negligible . \n classical models of a spinning particle encounter an unavoidable conflicts with quantum theory . \n the kerr singular string acquires electromagnetic wave excitations @xcite . in classical theory these excitations lead to a radiation which breaks axial symmetry of the kerr - newman solution and leads to non- stationarity . as a result , only an average metric takes the kerr - newman form . in the kerr - schild formalism @xcite , \n electromagnetic excitations are related to a field @xmath61 which induces electromagnetic radiation along the kerr congruence @xmath62 and non - stationarity of the solutions . \n this radiation leads also to infrared divergence of the mass , and there are arguments that this radiation has to be renormalized @xcite , setting the field @xmath63 . \n in quantum theory oscillations are stationary and absence of radiation caused by oscillations is postulated , although the radiation is present in qed too , being related to radiative corrections : the field of virtual photons , vacuum zero point field and vacuum polarization .    in a semiclassical approach , one can use the receipt of the quantum field theory in curved spaces@xcite , which takes into account the quantum effects concentrated in the divergent vacuum zero point field . by the transfer to the classical einstein - maxwell theory , \n these quantum vacuum fields have to be subtracted from the classical stress - energy tensor by a regularization @xcite . \n it was conjectured in @xcite that regularization of the kerr - newman stress - energy tensor has to be related with a subtraction of electromagnetic radiation caused by field @xmath64 which propagates along the kerr congruence @xmath62 , and involves non - stationarity by a loss of mass . \n twofoldedness of the kerr geometry confirms this point of view , since _ the outgoing radiation on the ` positive ' out - sheet of the metric is compensated by an ingoing radiation on the ` negative ' in - sheet_. it shows , that the field @xmath64 has to be identified with the vacuum zero - point field and may be subtracted from the stress - energy tensor by means of regularization , which has to satisfy the condition ( [ cons ] ) . \n such regularization may be performed , @xcite , and leads to some modified kerr - schild equations @xcite . \n it shows that electromagnetic excitations on the kerr background are similar to the casimir effect and may be interpreted as a resonance of the zero - point fluctuations on the ( superconducting ) source of the kerr spinning particle @xcite . \n although , the exact nontrivial solutions of the regularized system have not been obtained so far , there were obtained corresponding exact solutions of the maxwell equations which show that any ` aligned ' excitation of the kerr geometry leads to the appearance of some extra ` axial ' singular lines ( strings ) which are semi - infinite and modulated by de broglie periodicity @xcite . \n the recently obtained multiparticle kerr - schild solutions @xcite support this point of view , leading to the conclusion that the radiating twistorial structure of the kerr pnc belongs to the vacuum zero - point field , pointing out on the twistorial texture of vacuum @xcite . \n * note added after publication : * a development of the presented point of wiev is given in gr - qc/0606035 , where we arrive at the conclusion that the gravitational kerr s description of spinning particle may be dual to the qed description , similar to the other dualities in superstring theory , like ads / cft , strings / solitons and so on . \n burinskii , sov . \n jetp , * 39 * 193 ( 1974 ) ; in :  problems of theory of gravitation and elementary particles\",*11 * 47 ( 1980 ) , moscow , atomizdat , ( in russian ) . \n lpez , phys.rev . \n * d 30 * 313 ( 1984 ) . \n a. burinskii , phys . \n d * 67 * , 124024 ( 2003 ) ; a. burinskii and r.p . \n kerr , _ nonstationary kerr congruences _ , gr -

{"ContextTokens": 3075, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "the search for increased functionality in semiconductor - based devices is made possible with the advancement of microfabrication and epitaxial growing techniques . \n a quantum well , built from two wider -

in - a - well system that will be studied here is the scattering of a free particle from this potential landscape via the transfer matrix approach . \n the transmission probability is obtained from the ratio between the amplitude of the transmitted wave ( @xmath28 ) and that of the incident wave ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 the transfer matrix technique yields @xcite @xmath31 e^{i[\\kappa(z+\\delta z ) -\\kappa(z)]z}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath32\\right)^{1/2}/\\hbar$ ] . here \n @xmath33 is the incident particle s kinetic energy . \n it is further assumed here that the effective mass does not vary in space . \n length measurements are given in angstroms and energy measurements are in units of @xmath34 . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows a quantum well - in - a - well system , whose subwell size is 24@xmath35 of the full well depth . \n the properties of the composite well is studied using a single mpt well of the same depth as a benchmark . \n in addition , a parabolic well having the same width is fitted to the composite well for comparison . \n the same approach is used to obtain the bound states for the single mpt well and the parabolic well .    , \n @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while for the single mpt well @xmath38 . \n the inset shows the eigenenergies @xmath39 where @xmath0 is the bound state index.,width=309 ]    one finds that the composite well s ground state is lower by @xmath40 relative to the ground state of the single mpt well of the same depth . \n in this example , the ground state of the parabolic well is lowest as expected due to its deeper potential depth . \n note that the composite well has more bound states than that of single mpt well of the same depth or the parabolic well of the same width . \n further , the interval between bound states are more evenly distributed in the composite system as compared to the single mpt well . \n the distribution of states for the composite well is more similar to the even distribution of energy states of a parabolic well of the same width rather than that of the single mpt potential . \n next , fig . \n [ fig3 ] illustrates three well - in - a - well systems of the same depth , symmetry and base width . \n the latter is the potential width at @xmath41 . \n what varies in this plot is the depth of the component side wells yielding systems having different depths of embedded wells . \n figure [ fig3 ] shows systems with embedded wells of depths ( a ) 88@xmath35 , ( b ) 64@xmath35 and ( c ) 28@xmath35 relative to the composite well s full depth . \n the corresponding bound states of the three composite wells are shown in fig . \n as the depth of the component side wells increases the number of bound states also increases . \n well ( c ) has the most number of bound states . \n furthermore , the change in slope of the plot of eigenstate @xmath39 relative to the bound state index @xmath0 , towards a constant value indicates the shift towards an even distribution of the energy states . \n this occurs for the case of well ( c ) since the shape of the edge of this well approaches that of a parabolic potential . \n recall that for the case of the simple harmonic potential well , the energy levels are evenly distributed . \n so as the bottom of the component side wells approaches the depth of the middle well , we expect a straight line \n . however , near the base of the potential the shape retains the tail of a modified pschl - teller potential well , hence the last two bound states are nearer to each other as compared to those adjacent states in the middle and edge of the well . \n another phenomenon which is affected by the potential is the transport of a particle above it . \n recall that in the case of a finite rectangular well of width @xmath42 , or similarly , a potential barrier of the same width , transmission resonance is observed when the wave number takes on integral multiples of @xmath43 @xcite . \n it has also been demonstrated that a low energy incident electron above a rectangular well may be captured into a bound state due to dissipation @xcite . \n transmission resonance is only restored for particle kinetic energies beyond the `` captive '' energy region @xcite .    in the case of scattering above a single mpt potential , transmission resonance is observed when @xmath14 is an integer regardless of the magnitude of the kinetic energy of the incident particle @xcite . unlike in the well - in - a - well systems studied here , there are no resonant wells . \n this is true even for well ( a ) in which its constituent wells , by themselves , are absolute transparent potentials . \n figure [ fig5 ] shows the transmission probability of a free particle with effective mass @xmath4 above each composite well in fig . \n a particle has a lower probability of transmission if the kinetic energy of the particle approaches zero . \n as expected , the larger the kinetic energy of the incident particle the more likely it is to be transmitted . \n the monotonic increasing trend of the transmission probability for the composite wells remains valid even when the well width is increased . \n this is in contrast to the appearance of an oscillatory nature of the transmission coefficient when the width of a finite rectangular well is widened . \n the behavior of interest is that well ( a ) has the lowest probability of transmission relative to systems ( b ) and ( c ) . \n note that for a particle scattered in a finite rectangular well in the non - resonance regime , the transmission probability increases with decreasing depth and width . \n the opposite behavior is , thus , observed here , wherein the most shallow side wells and the most narrow middle well yield a composite system that creates more disturbance to particle transmission . in the perspective of an incident particle with energies corresponding to @xmath44 , wells ( b ) and ( c ) are more slowly varying potential functions relative to well ( a ) . \n the abruptness of the change in the potential in ( a ) provides a stronger force in reducing the probability of transmission in this @xmath45 regime . \n this paper presented a simulation model for a composite quantum well - in - a - well system and investigated the quantum mechanical properties arising from such construction . \n a superposition of modified pschl - teller potentials is chosen for the model because the constituent wells can easily be varied without increasing the numerical complexity in solving the schrdinger equation . \n this work showed that deviations in quantum well structures of the same functional form and depth yield entirely different properties as shown in the differences in their ground state energies , the number and distribution of bound states and the transmission probabilities of an incident free particle above the composite wells . \n tailor -

{"ContextTokens": 3963, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "it is now commonly accepted that most asteroids in the size range 200 m \n 10 km are rubble piles , i.e.   assembles of boulders of various sizes held together only by mutual gravity . \n the main evidence for this is the existence of the surface disruption spin limit ( ( * ? ? ? \n * pravec & harris 2000 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * snchez & scheeres 2014 ) ) . \n the rotation periods of asteroids in this size range are in almost all cases longer than 2.3 hours , corresponding to the limit at which the centrifugal force at the surface equals to the gravitational force . \n rubble piles are products of asteroid collisions leading to disruption of bodies and re - assembly of fragments . \n the rotation periods of asteroids smaller than 200 m are often shorter than the surface disruption spin limit , sometimes shorter than one minute . \n these bodies were therefore considered to be mostly monolithic with significant strength . \n nevertheless , ( * ? ? ? \n * snchez & scheeres ( 2014 ) ) considered small van der waals forces between the grains inside rubble piles . \n they found that the strength of rubble piles may be about 25 pa and that this low strength is sufficient to hold together small asteroids with rotational periods of the order of minutes . \n in particular they argued that the asteroid 2008 tc@xmath1 may have been a rubble pile despite of its rotational period of 99 seconds . \n asteroid 2008 tc@xmath1 was discovered 19 hours before it impacted the earth on october 7 , 2008 ( ( * ? ? ? \n * jenniskens et al . \n photometric observations before the impact revealed that the asteroid was an elongated body in excited rotational state with period of rotation 99.2 s and period of precession 97.0 s ( ( * ? ? ? \n * scheirich et al . \n 2010 ) ) . by combining various data , \n the most probable dimensions were estimated to be @xmath2 m , mass 40,000 kg , bulk density 1800 kg m@xmath3 , and porosity @xmath4 ( ( * ? ? ? * borovika et al . \n the impact occurred in sudan and numerous small meteorites ( @xmath5 kg ) were found in the desert ( ( * ? ? ? * jenniskens et al . \n surprisingly , the meteorites were of various mineralogical types ( ( * ? ? ? \n * bischoff et al . 2010 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * shaddad et al . 2010 ) ) . \n the body was therefore clearly heterogeneous and seems to be good candidate for a rubble pile . \n the data on the behavior of the body during the atmospheric entry are , unfortunately , scarce . \n there was a major flare at the height of 37  km and probably other flares at 53 , 45 , and 32 km ( ( * ? ? ? \n * jenniskens et al . \n 2009 ) , ( * ? ? \n * borovika & charvt 2009 ) ) . \n fireball flares are evidences of meteoroid fragmentation \n . atmospheric fragmentation of meteoroids is a common process ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? \n * ceplecha et al . 1993 ) ) . \n it occurs when the dynamic pressure , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is atmospheric density and @xmath8 is meteoroid velocity ) exceeds meteoroid strength . while the tensile strength of monolithic rocks ( meteorites ) exceeds 30 mpa , the strengths of meteoroids inferred from their atmospheric fragmentations was found to be in the range 0.1  10 mpa ( ( * ? ? ? * popova et al . \n the lowered strength is likely caused by internal fractures . in this respect almahata sitta was not exceptional . \n the flares occurred at pressures 0.3  1.3 mpa . \n such strength is much higher than 25 pa expected for rubble piles .    in this paper \n i explore the possibility that the observed fragmentations are in fact only the secondary break - ups of the building boulders of rubble piles . at least in some cases \n the first break - up may occurs at pressures of @xmath9 pa . \n the question is if we can find evidences for the initial high altitude fragmentation in the bolide data .    , @xmath10 , @xmath11 kg m@xmath3).,width=307 ] \n since there are no detailed data on the almahata sitta bolide , i will inspect another good candidate for rubble pile  the beneov meteoroid . the beneov meteoroid entered the atmosphere over the czech republic on may 7 , 1991 ( ( * ? ? ? * spurn 1994 ) ) . \n the bolide was well observed by three all - sky cameras and two high resolution photographic spectrographs ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika and spurn 1996 ) ) . \n four small meteorites were recovered in 2011  2012 . \n the meteorites were of different mineralogical types ( h and ll chondrites with achondritic clast ) , similarly to almahata sitta ( ( * ? ? ? \n * spurn et al . 2014 ) ) . \n the initial mass of the meteoroid , derived primarily from the amount of radiated energy , was 2000  4000 kg ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . 1998 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * ceplecha & revelle 2005 ) ) . \n the diameter was therefore larger than one meter . \n the initial velocity was 21.3 km s@xmath12 and the trajectory was almost vertical . \n obvious fragmentations occurred at heights 38 km and 25 km , under dynamic pressures of 2.5 mpa and 9 mpa , respectively . nevertheless , the deceleration at heights around 45 km was so strong that the body must have been fragmented already there . \n figure  [ decel ] demonstrates the observed deceleration . \n the lag in trajectory is plotted as a function of height . \n the lag is the difference between the actual position of the fireball at a given time and the position expected for constant velocity . \n the lag is zero as long as there is no deceleration . \n naturally , at a given height , deceleration will be larger for a smaller body ( provided that shape and density is the same ) . \n surprisingly , the observed lag does not follow the curve for a mass of 2000 kg . instead , the mass corresponding to the observed lag is only 40 kg . \n the discrepancy was noted already by ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . ( 1998 ) ) but the mass was then computed for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the drag coefficient and @xmath15 is the shape coefficient ) . \n here we use a more realistic value @xmath16 . \n the density of the meteoroid is assumed to be @xmath11 kg m@xmath3 . \n lowering the density to 400 kg m@xmath3 would explain the observed deceleration , however , such a low density is unrealistic considering the types of the meteorites . \n it is much more likely that the meteoroid was already disrupted into large number of fragments at a height of 50 km . \n the mass of the largest fragment was about 40 kg . \n the question is where the disruption occurred . \n the dynamic pressure of 25 pa was reached at the height of 113 km , while the bolide started to be visible only at the height of 91 km . in principle \n it can be possible that the initial disruption occur earlier than the meteoroid surface reach the temperature needed for ablation and radiation . in that case \n we would not see a direct evidence for fragmentation height in the bolide data . \n nevertheless , it can be expected that fragments of various masses are formed in the disruption . \n mass segregation then occurs since smaller fragments decelerate more . at lower heights \n , the fireball will not be a point - like object but will be elongated with wake formed by smaller fragments . \n the length of the wake will depend on the mass distribution of fragments and on the height of fragmentation . \n the earlier the fragmentation occurred , the longer will be the wake .    to investigate beneov wake \n , we can use the high resolution spectral photographs . \n they were taken with lenses of focal length of 360 mm . \n the spatial resolution at bolide range 100 km is of the order of several meters . \n each camera was equipped by a transmission diffraction grating in front of the lens . \n as it is usual for bolides , the spectrum consisted primarily of atomic lines of metals evaporated from the meteoroid , in particular fe , mg , na , cr , mn , and ca . \n for our purposes it is important that the cameras were periodically closed by a rotating shutter . \n the frequency was 15 hz and the open - to - close ratio was approximately 2:1 . \n if the bolide were point - like , no signal would be visible between the shutter breaks . \n this was the case at the beginning , at heights above 84 km .    at lower heights , strong wake developed . \n figure  [ spectrum ] shows parts of the spectra at heights 70 km and 45 km . \n the wake at 70 km was so long that it filled the whole gaps between the shutter breaks . \n however , this was the case only for certain spectral lines , in particular low excitation lines of fe and mg with low transition probability . \n these lines are known to be strong in meteor wakes ( ( * ? ? ? \n * halliday 1968 ) ) . \n that kind of wake is , however , not produced by fragments but by cooling rarified gas behind the meteoroid . \n the situation changed at lower heights . at 45 km , \n the wake was shorter but its spectrum was more similar to the spectrum of the bolide head ( fig .  [ spectrum ] ) . \n we suppose that the wake was produced here mainly be small fragments lagging behind the large fragments forming the head . \n the length of the wake was about 250 meters at the height of 50 km . \n such length can be explained by fragments of masses 40  0.1 kg separated at 65 km . \n if separated at 113 km , the mass range must have been narrower , 40 \n 0.5 kg . while the larger mass range is more likely , \n the difference between these two scenarios is not substantial . \n the reason is that deceleration at heights above 80 km is negligible ( even for gram - sized fragments ) . \n the length of the wake is therefore , unfortunately , not very sensitive to the actual height of disruption . \n we will now look more closely at the light curve of the beneov bolide . \n figure  [ light ] shows the light curve as measured by ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika & spurn ( 1996 ) ) . \n shown are also two models of the ascending part of the light curve . \n there were no flares in this part , which would point out to fragmentation events . \n however , the slope changed several times . the steep slope at the beginning ( time @xmath17 s ) \n can be ascribed to the onset of ablation . \n this part was not modeled in detail . \n our model ( described in ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . \n 2013a ) ) assumes that the ablation is in full progress . in that case \n the slope of the light curve in the middle part of the bolide is almost constant . \n indeed , the observed slope corresponds to the modeled slope during two intervals : 0  0.2 s ( heights 75  70 km ) and 0.7  1.4 s ( 60  45 km ) . in between \n , the slope was steeper . \n the model of instantaneous disruption at the height of 65 km shows a step on the light curve with the increase of brightness by more than two magnitudes at 65 km . \n the step is due to increased cross section of the meteoritic material after disruption . in reality , the disruption was more gradual and occurred within 0.5 s at heights 70  60 km . \n the second model , which assumed that the meteoroid had been disrupted already before the start of ablation , predicts too bright bolide at heights above 60 km and can not explain the observed change of slope . \n we therefore conclude that the disruption of beneov meteoroid started at the height of 70 km . \n the dynamic pressure at that time was 50 kpa , i.e.  three orders of magnitude higher than the strength of rubble piles . \n although not a rubble pile , the bulk strength of beneov was lower than of other meteorite dropping meteoroids ( ( * ? ? ? \n * popova et al . 2011 ) ) . \n the initial disruption was severe  the largest fragments were of only 1  2% of the original mass ( @xmath0% in terms of size ) . \n but the low strength is in accordance with the heterogeneous nature of the recovered meteorites ( ( * ? ? ? \n * spurn et al . 2014 ) ) . \n note that the similarly massive umava meteoroid fragmented at similar pressures , namely 25  140 kpa ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika & spurn 1996 ) ) . \n the behavior was , however , completely different in that case . \n the body was completely destroyed at height 59 km after several disruptions accompanied by large amplitude flares . \n umava was likely a cometary body with extremely high microporosity and low density ( @xmath18 100 kg m@xmath3 ) and easily disintegrated into dust . \n we can also briefly look at the chelyabinsk event of 15 february 2013  the largest well observed impact ( ( * ? ? ? \n * brown et al . \n 2013 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * popova et al . 2013 ) ) . \n the impactor size was @xmath19 meters ( mass @xmath20 kg ) , the entry speed was 19 km s@xmath12 , and trajectory slope 18@xmath21 . \n the first obvious fragmentation occurred at a height of 45 km under dynamic pressure of 0.5 mpa . \n catastrophic disruption occurred at 1  5 mpa ( ( * ? ? ? * borovika et al . \n 2013b ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * popova et al . 2013 ) ) . \n deceleration was negligible until the disruption , yielding a lower limit of the mass before the disruption of @xmath22 kg ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . 2013b ) ) . from \n that we can not say if some high altitude fragmentation occurred or not . \n wake was presented already at height 85 km but we do not have spectra to judge its nature . a lot of dust \n was deposited in the atmosphere . \n the massive dust trail started already at height 70 km ( dynamic pressure of 25 kpa ) . \n we inspected the light curve ( fig . \n [ chelc ] ) and no flare and no change of slope was found at heights around 70 km . \n there is therefore no evidence for an early fragmentation . \n the dust was likely lost from the surface of the body . \n there is no evidence so far of a meteoroid in the 1  20 meter size range being a rubble pile . \n most meteoroids are fractured rocks with strengths of 0.1  10 mpa . \n even the heterogeneous bodies ( beneov , 2008 tc@xmath1 ) had strength @xmath23 kpa . \n so , there must be a mechanism stronger than van der waals forces to hold the reaccumulated bodies together . \n we , however , note that early fragmentation during the atmospheric entry may not be easy to recognize in all cases .", "StartTimeOffset": 1763553758161, "RequestID": "b75121ff6a944d2daad234c7be712f81", "TotalTokens": 4177}

counting dimension \" is most widely used , because it can be easily applied to fractal objects . \n it is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the smallest number of sets of diameter at most @xmath1 which can cover @xmath4@xcite . \n fractal objects embedded in one- or two - dimension are easy to measure relatively compared to other higher dimensions , but most of fractals in nature that are embedded in three dimensions is difficult to measure even in the capacity dimension . however , the dimensions of a cross - section is generally known to be related with that of the bulk . \n let us think of a bulk of three dimensions , and assume the dimension of its cross - section is two , that is , it is 2/3 of the bulk . \n we can propose an _ \n ansaz _ from the above property : let @xmath9 be a fractal dimension of a cross -

section is independent of directions , eq . \n ( [ 30 ] ) is simply written as @xmath12 . \n we prepared several white cauliflowers of about @xmath13 in mass and @xmath14 in diameter . \n we cut half of them in horizontal ( h ) direction , and the other half in vertical ( v ) direction . \n then , we scanned the cross - section by a scanner and read the image into black and white in fig . 1 . here , the two figures by the two perpendicular directions look totally different . \n next , we read the image into matrix of numbers . \n the numbers of the matrix are the reflectivity of each pixels . \n the black backgrounds produces 0 s , and the white images produce large numbers . \n let us call the non -

sections . \n surprisingly , we found the two slopes for different directions are very similar . \n it is @xmath21 . repeating the procedure for different white cauliflowers , we observed similar values of @xmath22 as @xmath23 for the two different directions \n therefore , from eq . \n ( [ 30 ] ) we predict that the capacity dimension of the white cauliflower is about 2.8 . \n converting a fractal found in nature into a corresponding mathematical model is a hope of a theorist , but most of the work is far away from the real world or extremely complicated in analysis . \n the modeling of nature should be as simple as it can , and at the same time , it should contain the basic structure of nature . \n furthermore , if some physical quantities of the model can match the real systems , it will guarantee more credits to the mathematical model . \n we modeled the cross -

section in v - direction of the cauliflower is pretty close to two dimensions . \n as the @xmath26 approaches @xmath36 , the dimension of the tree goes to two because the limit bents to cover the two dimensional surface . on the other hand , \n as the @xmath26 approaches @xmath37 , the dimension of the tree goes to one because the limit goes to a long rod . \n the head of the real cauliflower is rounded not like the model in fig . \n 4 . it gives a possibility that the real cauliflower is not a self - similar set of single scale factor , but a set of multi - scale factors . \n we measured the fractal dimension of the cross - section of a white cauliflower by the direct scanning method . \n it was @xmath0 , and almost independent of the directions of the cross -

fru device . a small arm microcontroller on the rtm continuously monitors the status of the 8 qsfp+ and 6 sfp+ pluggable transceivers . \n the microcontroller also communicates with the front board ipmc microcontroller and coordinates hot swap sequencing . \n each of the pulsar iia fpgas connects to one qsfp+ transceiver and two sfp+ transceivers on the rtm . \n the pulsar iia supports up to four fmc mezzanine cards with the high pin count ( hpc ) lvds interface . \n mezzanine cards may contain fpgas , pattern recognition asics , fiber optic transceivers , or any other custom hardware . \n we developed our fmc test mezzanine card , shown in figure  [ fig : test_mezzanine_photo ] , in order to become familiar with the fmc form factor and to study high speed lvds communication between fpgas . \n the test mezzanine card features a xilinx kintex xc7k160 t fpga , 4 sfp+ transceivers , 128 mb ddr3 , and a 144 pin socket used for testing custom asic chips , primarily aimed at testing pattern recognition associative memory devices  @xcite . \n the fmc connector supports 3.3v and 12v power . \n an i@xmath2c bus and jtag interface are also provided for slow controls and in - system programming .          the mini backplane ( figure  [ fig : mini_backplane ] ) was developed to support stand alone testing of a single pulsar iia board and rtm on the bench top . \n power is supplied from a 48vdc bench supply . \n the base interface ethernet port is brought out to an rj45 connector which may then be connected to a pc and used for communicating with the ipmc microcontroller . \n the mini backplane also loops back each fabric interface port . \n this loopback feature has proved to be very useful in testing and characterizing the performance of the gtx serial transceivers outside of the crate . \n figure  [ fig : board_level_testing_photo ] shows our bench top test setup , which is used to check basic functionality such power supply operation , ipmc microcontroller communication , fpga programming and gtx loopback tests . \n the fpga gtx transceivers are driving data in the test - stand system in the fabric interface channels , the rtm channels and the local bus . \n it turns out that the fpgas achieved a bit error rates ( ber ) less than @xmath3 level in long - running loop back tests . \n the upper limit of ber is defined to be @xmath4 if there is no single error detected during the test . \n table  [ tab : long_hour_test ] summarized the measured upper limit . \n .ber upper limit measurement results . \n the upper limit depends on the length of the long hour test for each channel . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to the ber test , we performed a receiver margin analysis , or eye scan , using the xilinx ibert tool . \n the kintex-7 gtx transceivers have built - in diagnostic features which provide a mechanism to measure and visualize the receiver eye margin after rx equalizer  @xcite . \n sweeping the receiver sampling point and vertical offset voltage enables the generation of a ber map or statistical eye diagram , where the color represents @xmath5 . \n figure  [ fig : eye_diagram ] shows an example of the measured statistical eye diagram and the open blue region indicates that we can have error free operating points . \n the size of eye corresponds to the quality of the high speed serial communication after the rx equalization . \n all gtx transceiver channels have been tested and characterized using the ibert tool . \n furthermore , the eye scan has been done with a xilinx kintex-7 evaluation kit ( kc705 )  @xcite , which provides a `` golden '' reference for comparison studies . \n comparing the pulsar iia eye diagrams against the xilinx reference design helps us learn more about high speed layout techniques , which will be used in the next iteration of the board ( section  [ sec : pulsa2b ] ) . \n communication over the lvds lines between the fmc mezzanine and the main fpgas has been tested successfully at 400  mhz single data rate ( sdr ) and 200  mhz double data rate ( ddr ) . \n thirty - four lvds pairs running at this speed yield a bandwidth of 13.6  gb / s , which exceeds the atlas ftk requirements for the data formatter board . \n a crate - level testing followed the single board - level testing . \n we set up an atca shelf with a network switch blade in the hub slot and seven pulsar iia front boards as well as rtms in the node slots , as shown in figure  [ fig : crate_level_testing_photo ] .        in our system test \n the ipmc microcontroller communicates with the switch blade over the base interface network . \n we first log into the switch and then telnet into each pulsar iia board , where commands are issued to program the fpgas and monitor various board sensors . \n the default firmware image is setup to drive data over all gtx transceivers to the fabric , rtm and local bus channels . \n the xilinx ibert tool has also been used in the the crate to test the backplane performance . \n while our 10 g atca backplane is rated for only 3  gb / s per lane it has proven to work admirably at up to 6.25  gb / s across all slots , as shown in figure  [ fig : eye_scan_atca ] . \n leveraging the experience we gained through designing , building and testing the pulsar iia system we are in the final stages of laying out the next generation board , the pulsar iib ( figure  [ fig : pulsariib_block ] and figure  [ fig : pulsariib_photo ] ) . \n the new board design replaces the two kintex k325 t devices with a single large virtex-7 fpga . \n the gtx transceiver count has increased up to 80 channels , providing a significant bandwidth increase to the rtm , fabric and mezzanine cards . \n the power regulator sections of the board have been redesigned to handle the increased power required by the virtex-7 fpga . \n the pulsar iib boards will be used for the atlas ftk data formatter system . \n we anticipate that the boards will also be used for cms l1 tracking trigger early technical demonstrations  @xcite . \n the pulsar iia is our first atca prototype board and works as designed , as demonstrated by our successful stand - alone and crate - level tests . through this prototype development process \n we have gained experience using the latest xilinx fpgas and high speed serializers to communicate over the atca full mesh backplane . \n furthermore , the pulsar iia boards have successfully interfaced with other atca system components such as commercial switch blades and shelf manager cards . \n the pulsar iib boards will be used in the atlas ftk data formatter system starting in 2015 . \n the pulsar iib design forms the basic building block of a high performance scalable architecture , which may find applications beyond tracking triggers , and may serve as a starting point for future level-1 silicon - based tracking trigger r&d for cms , where the full mesh backplane is used most effectively for sophisticated time multiplexing data transfer schemes . \n our baseline design also works well as a general purpose fpga - based processor board . \n the design may prove useful in scalable systems where highly flexible , non - blocking , high bandwidth board to board communication is required . \n ted liu et al . \n , _ a new concept of vertically integrated pattern recognition associative memory _ , fermilab -

[ \n fig : eandpiraa ] ) . these data \n falsify the assumption that heavy quark quenching is dominated by radiative energy loss when the bulk qcd matter parton density is constrained by the observed @xmath4 of produced hadrons . \n this discrepancy between radiative energy loss predictions and current data and recent papers motivated us to revisit the assumption that pqcd elastic energy loss is negligible compared to radiative energy loss . in some earlier studies , \n the elastic energy loss was found to be @xmath5 gev / fm , which was erroneously considered to be small compared to the several gev / fm expected from radiative energy loss . in fig . \n [ fig : deltae ] we see that above @xmath6 gev the light and charm quarks have elastic energy losses smaller but of the same order of magnitude as the inelastic losses . due to the large mass effect , \n both radiative and elastic energy losses remain significantly smaller for bottom quarks than for light quark and charm jets , but the elastic loss can now be greater than inelastic up to @xmath7gev . the uncertainties from the coulomb log , as illustrated by the difference between the tg and bt lines  @xcite , are largest for the heaviest b quark : as they are not ultrarelativistic , the leading log approximation breaks down in the jet energy range accessible at rhic . \n we present a calculation of jet suppression using the model explained in @xcite . \n we assume initial @xmath8 and a fixed coupling , @xmath9 . \n the main difference from the previous calculation  @xcite is the inclusion of two new physics components in the energy loss probability @xmath10 . \n first , @xmath11 is generalized to include both elastic and inelastic energy loss and their fluctuations . \n the second major change is that we now take into account geometric path length fluctuations . \n the geometric path averaging used here is similar to that used elsewhere , but the inclusion of elastic energy loss together with path fluctuations in more realistic geometries was not considered .    the results for the suppression of non - photonic single electrons are shown in the upper plot in fig . \n [ fig : eandpiraa ] . as emphasized in  @xcite , any proposed energy loss mechanisms \n must also be checked for consistency with the extensive pion quenching data  @xcite , for which preliminary data now extend out to @xmath12 gev . \n this is also shown in fig . \n [ fig : eandpiraa ] . \n @xmath13    it is important to examine the theoretical uncertainties involved in these predictions . \n uncertainty in the leading log approximation has already been shown and two other sources are illustrated in fig .  [ \n fig : alpha ] . \n the radiative and elastic energy losses are strongly dependent on the coupling . to estimate the uncertainty involved from this approximation , \n the results of varying @xmath14 are shown . while increasing fixed @xmath14 to 0.4 improves the fit to the electron data , \n this then overpredicts the pion quenching . \n @xmath15    the ratio @xmath16 is not sensitive to the scaling of all cross - sections by a constant . \n however , the electron @xmath16 is sensitive to any uncertainty in the relative contribution of charm and bottom jets  @xcite . \n the result of changing the charm to bottom production ratio by a constant is shown , as well as the lower bound extreme of electrons from charm jet only . \n the elastic component of the energy loss can not be neglected when considering pqcd jet quenching . \n while the results are encouraging , further improvements will be required before stronger conclusions can be drawn . \n it will be important to deconvolute the charm and bottom contribution to the electrons , so direct measurement of @xmath17 spectra will be essential . on the theoretical side , further work on the deconvolution of coherence and finite time effects as well as implementing a running coupling will significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainties in the predictions . \n t.  isobe , arxiv : nucl - ex/0510085 . \n s.  s.  adler _ et al . \n _ [ phenix collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * \n 96 * , 032301 ( 2006 ) [ arxiv : nucl - ex/0510047 ] . \n x.  dong , aip conf . \n proc .   * 828 * , 24 ( 2006 ) [ nucl . \n a * 774 * , 343 ( 2006 ) ] [ arxiv : nucl - ex/0509038 ] . \n m.  h.  thoma and m.  gyulassy , nucl . \n b * 351 * , 491 ( 1991 ) . \n e.  braaten and m.  h.  thoma , phys . \n d * 44 * , 1298 ( 1991 ) . \n d * 44 * , 2625 ( 1991 ) . \n s.  wicks , w.  horowitz , m.  djordjevic and m.  gyulassy , arxiv : nucl - th/0512076 . \n m.  djordjevic , m.  gyulassy , r.  vogt and s.  wicks , phys . \n b * 632 * , 81 ( 2006 ) [ arxiv : nucl - th/0507019 ] . \n n.  armesto , m.  cacciari , a.  dainese , c.  a.  salgado and u.  a.  wiedemann , phys . \n b * 637 * , 362 ( 2006 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0511257 ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 1781916529097, "RequestID": "ea94c11c88dc4127a0125dbbdc6fc311", "TotalTokens": 1685}
{"ContextTokens": 3445, "GeneratedTokens": 190, "SynthesizedBody": "the cold - electron bolometer is a broadband bolometric detector where the only fundamental limit to the frequency response comes from the spectral transmission of the absorber . in order to tune the detector to respond to a certain frequency band , \n the absorber is coupled to an antenna structure which defines the frequency response.the original , and still most common , cold - electron bolometer design involved a normal - metal absorber with tunnelling contacts to superconducting leads ; see , for example , the work of kuzmin.@xcite this structure has also been used in the so - called _ microrefrigerator _ devices to cool electrons to below the lattice temperature . \n savin et al.@xcite showed that if the normal - metal absorber is replaced by a degenerately doped , electrons can be more efficiently cooled due to the reduced electron - phonon coupling in such a material compared to a metal.@xcite it has been shown that introducing strain into the silicon lattice can further reduce this coupling , allowing microrefrigerator - type devices to achieve lower electron temperatures compared to unstrained silicon.@xcite    based on this lower electron temperature achieved using strained silicon it is expected that the responsivity of cold - electron bolometer based on strained silicon should be higher than a comparable detector utilising unstrained silicon . a common advantage that both strained- and unstrained - silicon cold - electron bolometers share , compared to those using a normal - metal absorber , is that they do not require the fabrication of an insulating layer , since the naturally forming schottky barrier may be used instead . \n here we explore the performance of cold - electron bolometers utilising degenerately - doped silicon as the absorbing element . \n we take two devices : the _ control _ device using doped silicon , and a device where the doped absorber is strained by a layer of . \n we compare these devices by characterising them in a dark environment and also when illuminated . \n for both device the doping concentration was @xmath3 . in order to measure the noise of the devices themselves \n we present a novel concept of cross - correlating the outputs of two matched jfet amplifiers to remove the uncorrelated amplifier noise leaving only the device noise . \n the cold - electron bolometer consists of an absorbing island with tunnelling contacts to superconducting leads either side of the absorber . in the absence of any bias , \n the fermi energy is the same in the absorber and the superconducting contacts and thus carriers can not tunnel between the two . \n however , in the presence of an external bias , applied across the structure , the fermi level in the superconductor can be moved relative to that of the absorber , allowing tunnelling from the absorber to the vacant states above the superconductor s energy gap . \n this structure is described to greater detail by gulobev and kuzmin , and brien.@xcite    the current , @xmath4 , flowing through each of the symmetric junctions is given by : @xmath5\\,\\mathrm{d}e\\ , ,      \\label{eqn : iv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the normal - state resistance , due to tunnelling , of an individual tunnelling barrier , @xmath7 is half the superconducting bandgap , @xmath8 is the voltage across both junctions due to tunnelling ( i.e. it does not include voltages due to the resistance of the absorber or any leakage across the junction ) , and @xmath9 is the fermi distribution of electrons at temperature @xmath10 . this tunnelling current either increases or decreases the average energy of the electrons in the absorber.this change in energy can be expressed as a tunnelling power , @xmath11 , given by : @xmath12\\,\\mathrm{d}e\\ , ,      \\label{eqn : ptun}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the temperature of the electrons in the absorber and @xmath14 is the temperature of the normal - state electrons in the superconductor . \n a negative value of @xmath11 represents a reduction in the energy of the electrons in the absorber and thus corresponds to electron cooling . in a cold - electron bolometer \n it is this tunnelling power which cools the absorber . \n the temperature of the electrons in the absorber is also affected by the weak thermal link to the phonons . \n this thermal power , @xmath15 , is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the area of the absorber , @xmath18 is the phonon temperature , @xmath19 is a material constant that has been measured to be @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the control and strained silicon materials,@xcite and the power @xmath22 have been found@xcite to be @xmath23 . \n the responsivity , when current biased , @xmath24 , of such a detector has been derived by golubev and kuzmin@xcite and is given by : @xmath25    the dark noise - equivalent power is comprised of several terms , corresponding to various thermal and electronic process , and has been derived , for a current - biased device , by golubev and kuzmin@xcite to be : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the noise voltage introduced by the readout , @xmath28 is boltzmann \n s constant , @xmath29 is the heat - flow noise , and @xmath30 is the current - shot noise . in the presence of optical power , \n the noise - equivalent power can be further degraded by noise introduced by the absorption of photons . \n this photon - noise limit to the noise - equivalent power is given by the well - known equation:@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is planck s constant , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the frequency and power of the radiation incident upon the detector , and @xmath35 is the optical bandwidth . \n as is often the case , the internal noise of device under test here was lower than the input referred noise of the amplifier used ( @xmath36 in this case ) . to combat this \n we have used a novel solution of feeding the output of the device to two matched jfet amplifiers . the output of these two amplifiers \n was then fed to a data - acquisition system and cross - correlated in software . \n this treatment has the effect of removing the amplifier , which is uncorrelated , and leaving only noise present in the system prior to the splitting of the signal wiring . \n this approach is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : crosscol_flow ] . \n since the noise of each amplifier is random there is a finite chance of correlations between the two for any particular acquisition , due to this , in order to sufficiently reduce the amplifier noise in the final spectrum it is necessary to average multiple cross - correlations .    in reality there will always be a weak level of correlated amplifier noise in the final measurement due to stray capacitances in the system which provide a route for the amplifier noise to couple to the device . \n this low level of correlated amplifier noise presents itself as a noise floor below which further averaging offers little improvement . \n both the control and strained devices have been made and fabricated to a common design and process . \n for both devices the absorber is a @xmath37 tall mesa formed from etching n^++^-doped silicon ( @xmath38 ) and the contacts are sputtered aluminium . for the strained device \n the doped silicon is strained by a buffer layer between the absorber and the silicon substrate . \n the sputtered aluminium is etched to form a twin - slot antenna , designed to respond to 160-ghz radiation . \n both devices have been tested in two scenarios . \n firstly , dark ( looking at a blank at @xmath18 ) tests were performed to verify the formation of a schottky contact and to baseline device performance . \n the devices were then illuminated by radiation from external black - body sources ( eccosorb ) with temperatures of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . \n radiation was coupled to the detector via a pair of back - to - back horns and a hemispherical silicon lens which focussed the radiation on to the twin - slot antenna . \n the power incident on the detector was limited by both a low - pass filter , with an edge frequency of @xmath41 , and by a @xmath42 limiting aperture . \n the detector was biased via a pair of @xmath43 resistors and readout via cross - correlated jfet amplifiers ( as discussed above ) . \n all optical measurements were performed at a bath temperature ( @xmath44 ) of @xmath45 . \n +    to compare the strained- and unstrained - silicon cold - electron bolometers , both current - voltage ( @xmath4-@xmath8 ) characteristics as well as noise spectra of the devices have been measured , these measurements have been performed dark and in the presence of optical power . \n @xmath4-@xmath8 curves are presented in fig . \n [ fig : iv ] . for both devices \n there is a clear voltage response to increasing the source temperature from @xmath46 ( dashed lines ) to @xmath40 ( dotted lines ) and this can be seen to a greater extent when comparing these curves to the dark data ( solid lines ) . from fig . \n [ fig : rderiv ] it can be also seen that the unstrained device ( blue curves ) exhibits a lower normal - state ( @xmath47 ) resistance along with greater sub - gap leakage . \n this is attributed to lower - quality schottky contacts in this device along with the absorber resistance being lower in this material ( @xmath48 compared to @xmath49 in the strained detector ) . \n +    the electron temperature for these data has been computed by fitting the data to eq . \n [ eqn : iv ] . using the electron temperature at zero bias , along with eq .  [ eqn : pe - ph ] , it is possible to calculate the power absorbed within the silicon in each scenario . for the control device the absorbed power was @xmath50 for the 77-kelvin source and @xmath51 for the 300-kelvin source . for the strained detector \n the absorbed power was @xmath52 for the 77-kelvin source and @xmath53 for the 300-kelvin source . \n the difference between these powers for the two detectors is due to alterations in the optical setup and in both measurements we believe there to be a substantial background power due to the cryostat optics and stray light ; these values for the absorbed power are supported by our noise modelling , an example of which is shown in fig . \n [ fig : noise ] . from the computed electron temperature it is also possible to calculate the responsivity using eq . \n [ eqn : responsivity ] , the results of this are shown in fig .  [ fig : responsivity ] .    fig . \n [ fig : responsivity ] shows that when the incident power is increased there is an overall drop in the responsivity of the detector ( the difference between the dashed and dotted lines ) , this is attributed to an overall increase in the electron temperature for the higher incident power . if the two curves for the 77-kelvin source are examined ( dashed lines in fig . \n [ fig : responsivity ] ) , then the difference in peak responsivity is a factor of @xmath54 . \n this value is very close to the difference in the @xmath19 parameter for the two materials ( @xmath55 ) .    from the responsivity , and by using eq . \n [ eqn : darknep ] and eq . \n [ eqn : photonnep ] , it is possible to calculate the noise - equivalent power for the two detectors . \n this has been found to be @xmath56 for the control device and @xmath57 for the strained device , both of these values are found when observing the 77-kelvin source . in the case of the control device the limiting noise source , across the entire measurement , was the amplifier noise remaining after cross correlation ( increased by the poorer responsivity ) . \n for the strained device the noise - equivalent power was photon - noise limited for biases corresponding to voltages in the range @xmath58 ( as shown , for the 77-kelvin source , in fig . \n [ fig : noise ] ) , outside of this range the noise - equivalent power was limited by a combination of tunnelling and the amplifier noise . \n the introduction of a straining layer to a silicon cold - electron bolometer has increased the detector responsivity by a factor of @xmath59 . \n this increased responsivity can be attributed to the weaker coupling between the electrons and the phonons in the strained material . in terms of sensitivity \n the limiting noise source for the unstrained device was the readout , whereas in the strained detector the sensitivity was photon noise limited , afforded by the improved responsivity lowering the amplifier noise contribution . taking the strained - silicon device we achieve a minimum noise - equivalent power of @xmath2 at optimum bias . \n this work has been financially supported by the stfc through grant st / k000926/1 , the epsrc through grant numbers ep / f040784/1 and ep / j001074/1 , and the academy of finland through grant 252598 . \n + information on how to access all data supporting the results in this article can found at cardiff university data catalogue at doi : http://dx.doi.org/10.17035/d.2016.0008254680[10.17035/d.2016.0008254680 ] . \n 99 l. s. kuzmin , in _ proc . \n sned _ , pp . \n 145 - 154 , ( 2001 ) . \n d. golubev and l. s. kuzmin , _ journal of applied physics _ \n * 89 * , 6464 ( 2001 ) . \n t. l. r. brien et al . , _ applied physics letters _ * 105 * ( 2014 ) . \n a. m. savin , et al . \n , _ applied physics letters _ * 79 * , 1471 ( 2001 ) . \n r. leoni , _ new astronomy reviews _ * 43 * , 317 ( 1999 ) . \n m. j. prest , et al . \n , _ applied physics letters _ * 99 * , 251908 ( 2011 ) . \n j. zmuidzinas , _ applied optics _ * 42 * , 25 ( 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1794764572134, "RequestID": "9231ebd3f6834dd9855167f4ed8957e7", "TotalTokens": 3635}

rapidity @xmath5 . \n this results in a representation of the entire detector as a @xmath6 map in the @xmath7 plane . \n the trigger tower energy information is then sent to both l1 and l2 calorimeter trigger systems with 10-bit energy resolution , using a least significant count of 125 mev and resulting in a full scale of 128 gev . \n the level 1 calorimeter ( l1cal ) subsystem only uses 8 of the 10 available bits for each trigger tower , with the two least significant bits dropped , giving a least count of @xmath8 mev and a full scale of @xmath9 gev . as an example \n , electron and photon primitives are formed at l1cal by simply applying energy thresholds to the em energy of a single trigger tower while jet primitives are formed using the total em+had of a single trigger tower . for electrons , tracks from the level-1 track trigger ( xft ) \n can be matched to the trigger towers while had energy can be used for rejection . \n l1cal also calculates global sumet and met , using the lower resolution 8-bit em+had energy information . \n the main task of the existing l2cal was to find clusters using the transverse energy ( @xmath10 ) of trigger towers . \n the cluster finding algorithm was based on a simple algorithm used for run i , and was implemented in dedicated hardware . in this simple algorithm , the l2cal hardware forms clusters by simply combining contiguous regions of trigger towers with non - trivial energy . \n each cluster starts with a tower above a `` seed '' threshold ( typically a few gev ) and all towers above a second lower `` shoulder '' threshold that form a contiguous region with the seed tower are added to the cluster . \n the size of each cluster expands until no more shoulder towers adjacent to the cluster are found . because of this , large `` fake clusters '' are likely to be formed as the occupancy of the detector increases because towers which are unrelated to any jet activity have their @xmath10 boosted above clustering thresholds . \n one example of such kind of `` fake cluster '' is when towers above shoulder threshold between true jets link multiple jets together into a single large cluster ( cluster merging ) . \n this would reduce the efficiency , and increase the rate , for triggers requiring multiple jets at level 2 at higher luminosity , such as some important triggers for higgs and top physics . \n one more limitation of the existing hardware - based l2cal system is that it does not re - calculate sumet and met using the full 10-bit resolution energy information available , instead it uses the sumet and met information directly from l1cal , which is based on 8-bit resolution . \n this design feature limits its trigger selection capability , or rejection power , for triggers with global transverse energy requirements . \n the existing l2cal trigger system has worked reasonably well at lower luminosity for run ii , however , as the occupancy in the calorimeter increases with luminosity , the simple hardware - based l2cal system starts to lose its rejection power . \n the main goal of the upgrade is to significantly reduce the growth terms of the existing jet and met related triggers . \n the basic idea of the l2 upgrade is to provide the full @xmath11 bit resolution trigger tower energy information directly to the global level 2 decision cpu where a cluster finding algorithm can reconstruct jets and recalculate met and sumet . \n the upgrade approch is based on the pulsar board @xcite , a general purpose vme board developed at cdf and used for upgrading both the level-2 global decision crate @xcite and the level-2 silicon vertex tracking ( svt ) subsystem @xcite . the full resolution ( 10-bit ) \n calorimeter trigger tower data are received , preprocessed and merged by a set of pulsar boards before being sent to the level 2 decision cpu where more sophisticated algorithms can be implemented . since the actual cluster - finding is done inside the cpu \n , it is more flexible and more robust against increasing luminosity or higher occupancy in the calorimeter . with this approach , \n jet reconstruction using a cone algorithm which is currently being done at level 3 can be moved to level 2 , albeit clustering trigger towers ( instead of physical towers ) and using only a single iteration in order to save processing time . \n the new system is composed by a new hardware path connecting the l1cal directly to the l2 decision cpu ( see figure  [ hardware ] ) . \n the same hardware has been used to transfer the trigger tower information , full 10-bits resolution , to an additional new pulsar boards which calculates , within the l1 timing constraints , the met for the l1 system . \n bits resolution trigger towers to the l2 decision cpu . \n the same full resolution information are sent to an additional dedicated hardware , which re -

based l2cal upgrade has improved both jet and met measurements at level 2 . during the design stage of the new system \n , extensive studies have already shown that level 2 jets found using the new algorithm are nearly equivalent to offline jets in terms of @xmath10 , cluster centroid and efficiency , a vast improvement over the current situation . \n in addition , the calculation of met at level 2 with resolution closer to that at level 3 will significantly reduce level 2 rates for triggers requiring met . \n the upgraded l2cal system has performed as expected in real data taking . as an example , figure  [ efficiency ] shows the difference between the level 2 and level 3 in met and jet transverse energy , for the existing system as well as for the upgraded system . \n these improvements allow a significant rate reduction as well as efficiency improvement in jet and met based triggers . as examples , \n figure  [ jet40 ] shows the level 2 jet40 trigger cross section growth with luminosity before and after the upgrade . \n several higgs - dedicated triggers have been developed exploiting the potentialities of the l2cal upgrade . \n in particular the request of a even lower met at level 2 increases the acceptance on the signal . before the l1met upgrade the different resolution at level 1 and level 2 set a bottleneck to the lowest met threshold at level 2 . \n figure  [ prel1met ] shows the met trigger efficiencies for the new l2cal system with a cut of @xmath12 gev ( full resolution ) and the l1met system ( before the l1met upgrade ) with a cut of @xmath13 gev . \n since the turn on of the level 1 is very slow the trigger has low efficiency when instaed the level 2 is fully efficient , causing a loosing of trigger capability . before the l1met upgrade \n the only solution was keeping a higher threshold at level 2 . \n the l1met upgrade makes available at level 1 the same met trigger capability of the level 2 increasing the flexibility of the met - based triggers ( see figure  [ afterl1met ] ) . \n we have presented the design , the hardware and software implementation and the performance of the new calorimeter system for cdf experiment . \n the new l2cal system makes the full resolution calorimeter trigger tower information directly available to the level 2 decision cpu . \n the upgrade system allows more sophisticated algorithms to be implemented in software and both level 2 jets and met are made nearly equivalent to offline quality , thus significantly improving the performance and flexibility of the jet and met related triggers . as a natural expansion of the upgraded level 2 trigger system we pushed the improved met resolution downto the level 1 , and these are big steps forward to have enough flexibility to deal with potential new challenges at the highest luminosities , and to improve cdf new physics reach sensitivities beyond baseline . \n we foresee many opportunities for additional improvements in trigger purity and efficiency , most notably for physics triggers searching for higgs and new physics . \n 1 r. blair et al ( cdf ii collaboration ) , _ the cdf runii detector technical design report _ , fermilab -

female and the way to overcame that weakness is to obtain the information from the first name nal04 or the family name of the author @xcite . \n the present paper seeks to build upon the previous analysis about gender aspects in research collaboration which literature was recently surveyed in @xcite . here \n , we intend to contribute to at least two points of the literature : the differences of research collaboration and interdisciplinary participation by gender . \n focusing in economics , a scientific subject strongly connected to other scientific domains @xcite and constructing five categories of articles in a gender authorship perspective , this study addresses both issues : research collaboration and interdisciplinarity .    applying a network approach and using as unit of analysis articles indexed in the web of science ( wos ) this analysis maps the research collaboration by gender within dozen of scientific subjects , all associated with economics . \n the choice of network approaches to study research collaboration in economics @xcite has been extensively embraced . \n it often relies on the discovery of patterns of collaborations within researcher communities , aiming to find the influence of individual researchers in the networks using citation analysis . \n reference beaver78 , in the first complete theory of scientific collaboration , list and discuss the causes for that collaboration . \n they stress that it is necessary , when scientists deal with research questions , that cross disciplinary bounds . \n they also identify a large variation in collaboration by discipline , which is being further investigated in more recently published studies ( @xcite;@xcite ) . \n its well known that the adoption of a network approach allows the modeling of social structures from a bottom - up perspective , as resulting from the interaction ( or likeness ) of individual characteristics @xcite . \n moreover , as the individual characterization might be driven by multiple aggregate concerns , the network approaches allow for simultaneously considering that multiplicity of individual aspects and the consequences of the aggregate structures themselves on the emergence of collective patterns . \n meanwhile , in the adoption of a network approach , one shall be aware that the choice of a given network representation is only one out of several other ways to look at a given set of elements . \n as connecting the elementary units of a system may be conceived in many different ways , that choice may depend strongly on the available empirical data and on the questions that a network analysis aims to address @xcite . \n the main question addressed in this paper is whether some relevant characteristics of research collaboration would emerge in networks where subjects are linked whenever they co - occur in a common paper . \n we hypothesized that gender imbalance in authorship of papers might influence the shape of those networks , allowing to uncover patterns from gender differences . \n if it happens , the emerging patterns may help to understand important characteristics of research collaboration , of the relationship among subjects and its relation to gender . \n the paper is organized as follows : next section presents the empirical data we work with and some preliminary statistical results . \n section 3 describes the network approach and the results from its application . \n section 4 concludes . \n the web of science ( wos ) is one of the major bibliometric databases ( together with google scholar and scopus ) and includes all scientific subjects . \n it comprises a total of 11,990 journals ( 8,778 from science and 3,212 from social sciences ) @xcite . \n concerning the scientific domain of economics , it includes 334 publications . \n the wos classifies each journal in one or more subjects ( or categories ) . \n taking as examples the journals * journal of informetrics * and * research policy * , the former is classified in `` computer science , interdisciplinary applications '' and `` information science & library science '' , while the latter is classified in `` management '' and `` planning & development '' .    from the original wos database a selection of articles was carried on adopting as criteria : articles published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 - 2015 , having economics as scientific subject and at least one author affiliated to a portuguese institution .    our motivation to focus on the field of economics and on the papers whose \n authors are affiliated to portuguese institutions is twofold :    1 . \n economic science makes connections with many other scientific subjects . \n 2 .   according oecd data , portugal presents the highest percentage of women in research during the period of 2004 - 2012 ( oecd , 2016 ) . \n consequently , our approach is applied to a data set comprising 1,138 papers published in 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 and having economics as the main subject matter .    besides economics \n , each paper may have extra ( or secondary ) subjects . \n table 1 presents the set of secondary ( extra ) subjects found in our data set . \n each paper in the data set is coded by a string that informs about the presence of extra subjects . in the broader set of 1,138 papers having economics as the main subject matter , 29 different extra ( or secondary ) subjects were found .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 4 : topological coefficients computed from the mst of each authorship category . \n although the five networks have similar sizes , there is a remarkable difference in the values obtained for the man exclusive tree ( m.exc-mst ) . \n when women are excluded , the network of subjects displays an much higher diameter ( @xmath0 ) , showing large distances among subjects are enlarged . \n the also important decrease in the number of leafs ( @xmath1 ) indicates that this network develops a entirely different structure when compared with the other msts by authorship category . \n the plots in figure 10 show the number of leafs ( @xmath2 , the diameter ( @xmath3 and the ratio @xmath4 across the different categories of authorship . as , \n depending on the specific tree motif , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 move in opposite directions , in computing the absolute value of the difference @xmath6 relative to @xmath7 helps to emphasize the distinguish structure of the mst that characterizes the man exclusive network ( m.exc-mst ) .    in the broader set of papers published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 - 2015 in the scientific domain of economics and having at least one author affiliated to a portuguese institution , as the percentage of female authorship decreases , the mst obtained from the corresponding network of subjects moves from a star configuration to a path motif . in so doing , \n the larger distances between subjects are enlarged and the number of poorly connected subjects increases . if , conversely , the network of subjects has a high percentage of female authorship , the corresponding mst approaches a star motif , the number of leafs is enlarged and the corresponding diameter decreases . \n there are many ways to link the elementary units of system in order to induce a network . \n choosing the most suitable way depends strongly on the available empirical data and on the research questions that a network analysis aims to address . \n regarding available empirical data , most of bibliometric databases have a strong weakness concerning the study of the differences by gender . \n in what concerns research questions , gender differences in collaborative research and interdisciplinarity in scientific outputs have received little attention when compared with the growing importance that women hold in academia and research .    from the set of papers published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 - 2015 in the scientific domain of economics and having at least one author affiliated to a portuguese institution \n , our results apparently converge to the hypothesis that women prefer to work in teams . \n however , they also indicate that when papers are exclusively authored by women , the working teams tend to be smaller than any of those that also include men . \n these results converge to the mixed results reported in the literature , where different units of analysis , measures , methods and samples were adopted ( @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite-@xcite ) . \n regarding interdisciplinarity , our findings seem to contradict the hypothesis that women have more propensity to interdisciplinary research collaboration @xcite . \n moreover , we found that academic women in economics compared with their male counterparts reveal preference for the subjects environmental sciences , management and political sciences and that , conversely , the subjects social sciences , mathematics and finance display higher frequencies in papers either inclusively or exclusively authored by men . \n our main contribution relies in the adoption of a network approach allowing to uncover the emergence of a specific pattern when the network of scientific subjects is induced from a set of papers exclusively authored by men . \n such a male exclusive authorship condition is found to be the solely responsible for the emergence of that specific shape in the structure of the network . \n moving away from a _ star _ motif together with the loss of centrality of the subject management have an important bearing on the structure of the  male exclusive authorship network : when papers authorship includes just men , the larger distances between subjects in the network become even larger and this is mainly due to a decrease in the relative number of papers having management as a secondary subject . \n we find enough evidence that gender imbalance in scientific authorships brings a peculiar trait to the networks of subjects . \n such a peculiar trait might facilitate future network analyses of research collaboration and interdisciplinarity . \n acknowledgement : financial support by fct ( fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia ) , portugal is gratefully acknowledged . \n this article is part of the strategic project : uid / eco/00436/2013 . \n the authors thank marilei kroetz for her work in the gender identification process . \n frandsen , t. f. ;

[ \n moehler : fig : arc_raw ] ) . \n the positions of arc lamp spectra on the ccd are determined by a pattern matching technique applied to the detected emission lines . \n for that an estimate of the linear dispersion as well as a line catalog ( which may both be provided by the user ) are required . \n adjacent slitlets with no offsets in dispersion direction are not distinguished and will form one longer slitlet . \n the spatial curvature is determined by tracing the edges of the corresponding flat field spectra ( cf . \n [ moehler : fig : spat_curv ] ) when possible . \n the curvature is fit by default with a second order polynomial . \n the final wavelength calibration is obtained taking into account the spatial curvature of the spectra . \n the pipeline provides the following output calibration files :    * slit positions on the ccd at the central wavelength of the grism * coefficients for the dispersion relation and the spatial curvature * master bias * master flat field ( normalized and not - normalized ) * wavelength map and spatial map * reduced arc lamp frame * spectral resolution and line widths    the wavelength map specifies at the position of each original ccd pixel its corresponding wavelength . \n thus the user can avoid the re - sampling of the spectra usually done after the wavelength calibration . \n the spatial map provides in the same manner the position of the ccd pixel within its associated slitlet . \n the reduced arc lamp frame allows to judge the quality of the calibration ( straight arc lines , no wriggles , no offsets ) . if successful ( see sect . \n [ moehler : sec : weak ] ) the pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.1 pixel both in spatial and dispersion direction . \n the default reduction of spectroscopic science data is as follows : the data are first corrected for bias . \n then the extraction mask derived above ( i.e. the positions of the slitlets and the curvatures of the resulting spectra ) is applied to the science data ; they are flat - fielded and re - mapped eliminating the optical distortions . \n afterward they are rebinned to constant wavelength steps . \n the wavelength calibration can be adjusted using sky emission lines . \n this allows to correct for shifts between night - time science and day - time calibration data . \n such shifts ( of the order of 1 pixel ) are known to happen due to flexure for mxu observations . \n finally object spectra are detected and extracted , together with the corresponding error spectra and sky spectra . \n for long - slit spectroscopy the sky background is determined using a median . \n this is a valid approach if not more than half of the pixels contain flux from objects _ and _ there is no spatial gradient in the sky background . for multi - object spectroscopy instead the sky is subtracted before remapping , i.e. when the spectra are still in the original ccd coordinate system . \n the sky is determined with a robust linear fitting , which allows for a linear spatial gradient in the background . \n also in this case , however , not more than half of the pixels may contain flux from the object(s ) . \n the output science files are    * positions and widths of object spectra * extracted object spectra , error spectra , and sky spectra * unmapped ( corrected for spatial distortions , not rebinned ) science frames * mapped ( i.e. corrected for spatial distortions and rebinned ) science frames * adjusted dispersion coefficients and wavelength map \n the major strength of the new pipeline is its flexibility and robustness . \n it requires only very limited input information ( mainly dispersion estimate and line catalog ) and can therefore be applied to a large variety of instrument configurations . \n thus it is now possible for the first time to _ automatically _ reduce long - slit ( lss ) and multi - object spectroscopic data ( mos / mxu ) from the two fors instruments for all grisms and both collimators ( standard and high - resolution ) . to verify its flexibility \n the pipeline was applied to data from the low - resolution spectrograph of the hobby eberly telescope , which it handled without any problems . \n the pipeline does have problems if there are too few arc lines , e.g. for slitlets with large offsets . \n in such cases it sometimes fails to correctly identify the slitlet . \n this can be most easily recognized by comparing the not - normalized and the normalized screen flat ( cf . \n [ moehler : fig : bad_mos ]  one slitlet is partly missing , another one was not processed at all ) . \n large gaps between arc lines can be problematic as non - linear dispersion terms can become important , while the pipeline currently uses only linear dispersion estimates for the pattern matching . \n the pipeline will fail in case of regularly spaced arc lines , like those created by a laser comb , as its pattern matching ( see contribution by izzo et al . ) \n does not work for such data . \n in order to check the quality of observational data a pipeline is of great importance . otherwise it is difficult to distinguish between well - known and correctable instrument effects and real problems . \n quality control shall ensure that the data observed with the forses can be calibrated . \n in addition the trending of certain parameters allows to have an eye on the instrument health ( see http://www.eso.org/dfo/quality for more details ) . \n therefore the resolution , central wavelength , and number of identified arc lines are regularly monitored . \n a change in the number of identified lines can indicate reduced flux of the arc lamp and possibly impending failure of the lamp . \n a change in resolution could indicate focus problems . \n 079@xmath0 0@xmath1007 with respect to chip 1 ( the known value being 0@xmath1083 ) . the reduced arc lamp image corresponding to the coefficients in the dashed box \n is shown in fig . \n [ moehler : fig : pccx_bad ] ]    the situation for the quality control of fors data has vastly improved with the new pipeline , as now almost all data can be reduced ( with polarimetric data being the only exception ) . \n moreover , the new pipeline also provides additional information on the instrument . \n for example , the combination of the curvature coefficients can be used to monitor grism alignment : the coefficients c1 and c2 describe the slope and the curvature of a slitlet , respectively . if the curvature is 0 , then the slope should be 0 as well  otherwise this indicates that the grism is not well aligned . \n [ moehler : fig : coeff ] shows the coefficients obtained for the 600z fors2 grism . \n obviously the correlation for the majority of solutions passes through zero . \n some solutions , however , show significant offsets from the general trend . \n [ moehler : fig : pccx_bad ] shows a reduced arc lamp image for such a deviating case ( marked by the dashed box in fig .  [ moehler : fig : coeff ] ) . obviously the wavelength calibration obtained for several slitlets is rather bad ( wriggles instead of straight lines ) . \n thus diagrams like fig . \n [ moehler : fig : coeff ] allow to look for bad solutions efficiently in case of large data volume , which may prohibit checking all solutions individually .    . \n ]    other new parameters become available if there are more than 12 slitlets distributed across the ccd . in this case \n the pipeline calculates a global distortion model , which contains good indicators for the monitoring of the instrument s health , like the instrument scale . \n the new spectroscopic pipeline for the fors instruments has been a great success in that it allows to reduce _ automatically _ long - slit and multi - object spectroscopic data for all fors grisms . the fact that it does not need a first guess from an instrument model makes it a promising candidate for the reduction of spectroscopic data from a variety of instruments . \n in addition this approach is extremely helpful in the presence of instrument instabilities as it allows to reduce data whose configurations deviate from the expected one ( e.g. due to instrument aging or earthquakes ) . \n i would like to thank c. izzo and u. hopp for their valuable comments on this manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 1847891716211, "RequestID": "3c67833b2e7141019ca7fd09cc7f16d2", "TotalTokens": 2042}

magnetic and ( or ) hadronic particle cascades and high energy muons produced at the neutrino interaction vertex in a large volume around the neutrino telescope .    within the 70 days of effective data taking of _ nt-96 \n _ , @xmath37 events with @xmath38 have been selected .    for this analysis we used events with @xmath394 hits along at least one of all hit strings . \n the time difference between any two channels on the same string was required to obey the condition :    @xmath40    the @xmath41 are the arrival times at channels @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is their vertical distance . @xmath44 ns accounts for the timing error and @xmath45 ns / m . \n 8608 events survive the selection criterion ( 3 ) . \n the highest multiplicity of hit channels ( one event ) is @xmath46 . \n since no events with @xmath47 are found in our data we can derive an upper limit on the flux of high energy neutrinos which produce events with multiplicity n@xmath4825 . \n the shape of the neutrino spectrum was assumed to behave like @xmath49 as typically expected for fermi acceleration . in this case , \n 90% of expected events would be produced by neutrinos from the energy range @xmath50gev . comparing the calculated rates with the upper limit to the number of zero events with @xmath47 \n , we obtain the following 90% c.l . \n upper limit to the diffuse neutrino flux :    @xmath51    [ fig5 ]    fig.5 shows the upper limits on the diffuse high energy neutrino fluxes obtained by baikal ( this work ) , sps - dumand @xcite , amanda - a @xcite , eas - top @xcite and frejus @xcite ( triangle ) as well as a model independent upper limit obtained by v.berezinsky @xcite ( curve labeled b ) ( starting from the energy density of the diffuse x- and gamma - radiation @xmath52 ev @xmath53 as follows from egret data @xcite ) and the atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite from horizontal and vertical directions ( upper and lower curves , respectively ) . \n also shown are predictions from stecker and salamon model @xcite ( curve labeled ss ) and protheroe model @xcite ( curve labeled p ) for diffuse neutrino fluxes from quasar cores and blazar jets . \n we expect that the analysis of data taken with _ nt-200 _ ( 1998 ) would allow us to lower this limit down to ( 2@xmath14)@xmath5410@xmath8@xmath55s@xmath56sr@xmath56gev . \n since march 1998 we have performed measurements of eas with a cherenkov array deployed on the ice cover just above _ nt-200 _ @xcite .    in march / april 2000 we continue the experiments with the eas array . \n it consists of 4 upward facing _ quasar _ pms placed in special containers . \n three of them were located at the corners and one in the center of an equilateral triangle . \n the distance between the central and each of the outer detectors was 100 m. the array was operating in 2 modes : a cherenkov light detecting mode and a scintillator mode . for the cherenkov mode conic reflectors \n were put on the containers to increase the effective area of pms . for the scintillator mode reflectors \n were replaced by 0.25 m@xmath22 scintillator plates .    in the cherenkov mode , \n the eas array operated in coincidence with _ \n nt-200 _ for studying the angular resolution of the latter . \n the energy threshold in this case was about 200 tev . \n the preliminary analysis of data collected during 1999 shows that the angular resolution of _ \n applying any cuts , which usually used to reject badly reconstructed tracks ) is better than 5 degrees .    in the scintillator mode \n , the eas array has been used as a trigger system in a search for acoustic signals from eas . \n the core of eas triggered the scintillater array is expected to lead to an acoustic signal in the ice and in the upper water layer . with 5 pev energy threshold of the eas - array , 2 - 3 events per hour have been observed . \n acoustic hydrophone was placed 90 m apart from the center of the eas array at a depth 5 m . \n characteristic bipolar acoustic signals with about 150 @xmath57s duration and with a reasonable delay time compared to the eas trigger have been detected . \n a preliminary analysis of the data shows that the amplitudes of the acoustic signals are somewhat larger than it would be expected from standard thermoacoustic theory @xcite . \n the source of this disagreement may be a rough calibration of hydrophon . \n we plan to continue the investigation of acoustic signals from eas in the next year . \n the deep underwater neutrino telescope _ nt-200 _ in lake baikal is taking data since april 1998 . using the first 234 live days , \n 35 neutrino induced upward muons have been reconstructed . \n although in a good agreement with mc expectation this number is on factor 3 lower then predicted for the fully operational _ \n nt-200_. the reason is that , due to unstable operation of electronics , in average only 50 - 70 channels have taken data during 1998 . \n this is in contrast to 1999 and 2000 data taking where stability had improved . \n ten events within a 30 degree half angle cone around nadir have been selected and limits on the excess of muon flux due to wimp annihilation in the center of the earth have been derived . \n also a new limit on the flux of fast monopoles has been obtained .    in the following years , _ \n nt-200 _ will be operated as a neutrino telescope with an effective area between 1000 and 5000 m@xmath22 , depending on the energy . \n it will investigate atmospheric neutrino spectra above 10 gev ( about 1 atmospheric neutrino per two - three days ) . \n due to the high water transparency and low light scattering with effective scattering length greater than 150m@xmath1200 m , the effective volume of _ \n nt-200 _ for high energy electron and tau neutrinos detection is more than two orders of magnitude larger than its geometrical volume . \n this will permit a search for diffuse neutrino fluxes from agn and other extraterrestrial sources on a level of theoretical predictions .    with an effective area two times larger than super - kamiokande , for nearly vertically upward muons ( e@xmath5810 gev ) _ \n nt-200 _ will be one of the most powerful arrays for indirect search for wimp annihilation in the center of the earth during the next few years . \n it will also be a unique environmental laboratory to study water processes in lake baikal . \n apart from its own goals , _ \n nt-200 _ is regarded to be a prototype for the development a telescope of next generation with an effective area of 50,000 to 100,000 m@xmath22 . \n the basic design of such a detector is under discussion at present . \n _ this work was supported by the russian ministry of research , the german ministry of education and research and the russian fund of fundamental research ( grants _ , ) _ and by the russian federal program `` integration '' ( project no .", "StartTimeOffset": 1863978080573, "RequestID": "8132350017df4c4b8434fd13ba32ecce", "TotalTokens": 3812}

a large cell volume is indicative of an isolated galaxy . \n the delaunay triangulation is the geometrical dual of the voronoi partition and is defined by the tetrahedron whose vertices are the 4 galaxies with the property that the uniquely determined circumscribing sphere does not contain any other galaxy . \n we thus may identify high - density peaks by selecting as `` cluster seeds '' the centers of all the voronoi cells with volume smaller than some threshold , and then use the scale length of the delaunay mesh to infer the strength of the physical aggregation . \n we then can define an adaptive cylindrical window in redshift space ( elongated in the @xmath0 direction ) with dimensions determined by the local scale factor and process all the delaunay connected galaxies with a rapidly converging `` inclusion - exclusion '' logic to identify cluster members .    in our algorithm , \n the parameters defining the adaptive search window are only weakly dependent on the galaxy density gradient which inevitably occurs in a flux limited survey , since our smoothing procedure immediately identifies regions of enhanced clustering where galaxies are generally more luminous . \n moreover the number of cluster interlopers aggregated into a system in a redshift space analysis is minimized and we simultaneously obtain a non - parametric local estimate of the surrounding density environment for each galaxy and a quantitative measure of the distribution of cosmological voids in the survey volume . \n we have tested our reconstruction scheme using mock catalogs modelling the deep2 redshift survey ( davis et al . \n 2000 ) derived from gif simulations ( coil et al . \n this survey will obtain high quality spectra for @xmath1 60000 galaxies between z=0.7 - 1.5 using the keck 2 telescope and deimos spectrograph , with the twin goals of studying the evolution of the properties and the large - scale clustering of high redshift galaxies . \n we used a lcdm model with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in order to mimic the selection function of the magnitude limited survey we make a rest - frame b - band cut of 23.4 , which at z @xmath1 1 corresponds to an apparent i - band magnitude with the appropriate k - correction matching the deep2 photometric selection criteria ( @xmath6 ) . in fig . \n 2a we present a mock catalog for one deep2-like field collapsed along the smallest axis , covering the redshift range @xmath0=0.7 - 1.2 ( a depth which corresponds to selecting the 1200 l / mm grating in the deimos spectrograph ) and containing a volume of roughly @xmath7 mpc h@xmath8 ( @xmath1 15000 galaxies ) . \n we have used six independent mock catalogs to determine how well the algorithm performs in identifying clusters of galaxies .    to determine the `` true '' distribution of clusters , we have applied in real space ( volume - limited simulation ) a standard percolation algorithm optimised for selecting virialized objects ( mean overdensity @xmath1 180 ) . \n the resulting distribution of those clusters with more than 5 members is shown in fig 2b . \n cluster candidates selected by the voronoi  delauney algorithm applied in redshift space ( flux - limited simulation ) are shown in fig 2c . \n note how the large - scale pattern defined by galaxy systems and the associations of clusters in higher order structures reproduce in an unbiased way the underlying real space landscape . \n the evolution of the comoving abundance of clusters as a function of their velocity dispersion @xmath9 and redshift @xmath0 is a sensitive function of cosmological parameters ( see newman et al . \n the statistical significance and robustness of the cluster abundance test depends critically on an unbiased mapping of the distribution properties of the cluster observables between real to redshift space . \n we have investigated the differential and integral distribution functions of the number of reconstructed clusters as a function of their richness , velocity dispersion and redshift . \n the kolmogorov - smirnov statistical test confirms the similarity between the real and reconstructed distributions , and thus the reliability of our algorithm . \n this can be seen visually in fig . \n 4 where we show the two - dimensional distributions of the real and reconstructed clusters in redshift z and projected velocity dispersion @xmath9 . \n coil , a. , davis , m. , & szapudi , i. 2001 , pasp , in press , astro - ph/0107541 davis , m. , newman , j. a. , faber , s. a. , & phillips , a. c. , 2000 in proc . of the eso / ecf / stsci workshop on deep fields , ( garching , edition springer ) , astro - ph/0012189 newman , j. a. , marinoni , c. , davis , m. , & coil , a. 2001 , pasp , in press", "StartTimeOffset": 1884164490193, "RequestID": "5456f850d6c54097967bbbc1d326b381", "TotalTokens": 1615}

? ? \n * gray 1983 ) ) . \n we have computed line bisectors for 5 strong , unblended spectral features of a moderate intensity , which were located close to the center of echelle orders : cr i 663.003 nm , ni i \n 664.638 nm , ca i 671.77 nm , fe i 675.02 nm , and ni i 676.784 nm . \n all these lines show well defined bisectors . \n the changes in the spectral line bisectors were quantified using the bisector velocity span ( @xmath25 ) parameter , which is simply the velocity difference between the upper and the lower points of the line bisector ( @xmath26 ) , and the bisector curvature ( @xmath27 ) , which is the difference of the velocity span of the upper half of the bisector and its lower half ( @xmath28 ) . \n it is important to examine both @xmath25 and @xmath27 , because it is possible for a star to show variations in one of these parameters only . in choosing the span points \n , it is important to avoid the wings and cores of the spectral line , where the errors in the bisector measurements are large . for our span measurements we chose @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in terms of the line depth at the line core . using the bisector measurements of all 5 spectral lines \n we have computed the average velocity span and curvature after subtracting the mean value for each spectral line .    in figure[fig1 ] , we present the mean bisector velocity span ( @xmath32)and the mean bisector curvature ( @xmath33 ) for our star , as a function of rv . uncertainties in the derived values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were estimated as standard deviations of the mean . \n the correlation coefficients were found to be @xmath34 for @xmath32 and @xmath35 for @xmath33 . \n it is clear that they are not correlated with radial velocities which supports the planetary mass companion hypothesis . \n the available rv measurements are not uniformly distributed over the estimated period , which is visible in fig . 1 as a scatter varying with rv . \n more observations are needed to confirm the apparent lack of correlation .     for psu - tcfa 18 as a function of radial velocity.,width=182 ]      since our spectra start at 407.6 nm we can not investigate the variation of the ca ii k emission line ( 393.4 nm ) . \n also the infrared caii triplet lines 849.8 - 854.2 are outside the range of our spectra . \n therefoer , we use h@xmath0 line ( 656.28 nm ) as a chromospheric activity indicator . \n the ew measurements of the @xmath36 line can be made in our spectra with a typical precision of a few percent . in the case of our star , \n the measurements give a mean value of @xmath37 . \n the rms value of @xmath38 corresponds to 2 % variation in the ew . in figure [ fig1 ] \n we present ew measurements for @xmath36 as a function of rv . \n the correlation coefficient of @xmath39 shows marginal relationship ( probably resulting from the non - uniform rv coverage ) which again supports the planetary hypothesis . \n a detailed knowledge of stellar parametres of red giants is very important for interpretation of their rv variations . to rule out stellar activity as the source of such variations \n , one needs precise rotation periods and several other indicators to be measured at many epochs . \n an & gn acknowledge the financial support from the mnisw through grant 1p03d 007 30 . \n gn is a recipient of a graduate stipend of the chairman of the polish academy of sciences . \n pz was supported by mnisw grant spb 104e-3376 . \n the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) is a joint project of the university of texas at austin , the pennsylvania state university , stanford university , ludwig - maximilians - universitt mnchen , and georg - august - universitt gttingen . \n the het is named in honor of its principal benefactors , william p. hobby and robert e. eberly .", "StartTimeOffset": 1896017458226, "RequestID": "9ad0b71f6b914ac3ad9a6afbf1da85c4", "TotalTokens": 2849}

einstein condensate vortices@xcite , phase - contrast microscopy@xcite , image filtering for extra - solar planet detection@xcite , stimulated emission depletion ( sted ) microscopy@xcite and the encoding of optical quantum information@xcite . \n the considerable utility of optical vortices has driven the development of several methods for their production . \n most commonly , a phase shift of the form @xmath0 is applied to an incident laser beam where @xmath1 is the topological charge and @xmath2 is the azimuthal coordinate about the beam centre in the transverse plane . \n one method to apply the required phase shift is to use a computer - controlled spatial - light modulator ( slm)@xcite . \n this approach has the considerable advantages of being flexible and allowing the phase profile to be dynamically varied on 10 ms timescales . \n slm s , however , suffer from high cost and limited spatial and phase resolution . \n conversion efficiencies can be quite high for low - order optical vortices but begin to suffer from resolution limits as the order is increased . \n another approach is to use lithographic processes to construct a phase mask@xcite . \n these phase masks have restrictions in terms of phase resolution , spatial resolution , maximum phase shift and useable area , although advanced lithographic techniques can relax many of these restrictions .    here \n , we report on the production by direct machining of spiral phase mirrors ( spms ) that are suitable for generating optical vortices . \n we demonstrate that the resultant phase mirrors can deterministically produce high - quality optical vortices over a large range of topological charges from 1 to 1000 . \n these mirrors can be produced economically and the size of the optics is restricted only by the geometry of the machining enclosure . \n the spms are machined from aluminium using a single - crystal diamond tool . \n the machining is performed by an ultra - precision lathe , produced by moore nanotechnology . the tool position relative to the part surface \n is adjusted while the part is rotated at a constant rate on the spindle . \n high - resolution position encoders ensure that the tool is positioned with nanometric precision for each point on the part surface . \n the cutting speed is limited by the acceleration of the lathe s linear axes , although we can relax this restriction by breaking the spm into segments . \n each segment is a linear ramp with a total height corresponding to a @xmath3 phase shift . \n figure [ sem ] shows an sem image of a charge 100 spm composed of 25 segments , each of which imparts an @xmath4 phase ramp . for the charge 100 spm , we estimate that the central defect accounts for 0.006% of the total mirror surface , while the sharp jumps between segments collectively account for approximately 3% of the total area .    for our analysis , we produced 25 mm diameter optics , which required cutting times ranging from 30 minutes to two hours for charges of 1 to 100 , respectively . \n the size of the optic can be scaled without losing quality or increasing cutting time simply by selecting a diamond tool of an appropriate radius . \n to verify the performance of our phase plate , we made transverse beam profile measurements that can be compared to theoretical models . \n the illumination of an spm with a tem@xmath5 mode results in a beam profile that can be expressed as a hypergeometric gaussian mode ( hygg)@xcite . these modes have a cylindrically symmetric amplitude and propagate from a gaussian profile at the spm into a ring -

quality vortices over a range of topological charges by examining the intensity and phase profiles of charge 1 and charge 100 vortices . \n figure [ charge1and100 ] ( a - c ) shows the results for the charge 1 vortex . due to the slow evolution of the charge 1 vortex , imaging optics were used to record the intensity pattern and the propagation distance which was used for the calculated intensity was selected to fit the measured profile . \n figure [ charge1and100 ] ( d - f ) shows the results for a charge 100 vortex . there is some deviation from the calculated intensity in the peripheral fringes ; however , the primary feature is in good agreement with the calculated intensity distribution . as with the charge 15 analysis \n , the propagation distance was corrected to account for the spm not being located at the beam waist . \n the phase profile shows three distinct regions . \n the central region has zero charge and originates from the undiffracted portion of the beam . \n an intermediate region shows a charge of 25 , which we believe is an artefact of the 25 step design used to create the spm . \n the inner region is , however , of little consequence because the outer region , beyond a radius of 0.25 @xmath7 , contains 98% of the optical power and shows the intended charge 100 optical vortex .    the intensity distribution of the same charge 100 vortex , imaged in a plane that features the smallest observed ring thickness , is shown in figures [ highcharge ] a ) and b ) . \n the minimal undiffracted order , even at high charges , is notable when compared to slm -

corrections were available for the four - jet angular correlations . \n this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : \n vacuum ] , the reader is reminded of the model - independent parametrization of the weak loop corrections to the electroweak observables according to the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite . \n this formalism is extended in section  [ sec : hadronic ] to the corrections

here , the choice was made to parametrize the basic electroweak observables , _ \n i.e. _ , those sensitive to the weak loop corrections , with the ( linearized ) @xmath0 formalism , according to  @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the born approximations of the corresponding observables , _ \n i.e. , _ without any weak loop corrections , and where the pure qcd- and qed - corrections were

whether these limits could be affected by a variation of @xmath24 . this check is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : alpha]a , where it appears that the standard model value of @xmath25 yields the largest upper limits on the three partial widths . the limits of table  [ tab : \n limit ] are therefore conservative in this respect . \n new light hadronic flavours would also modify the evolution of the strong coupling constant . \n although , as already mentioned , @xmath26 is constrained by measurements performed directly at the z mass scale , it is also determined with at least as accurate low energy measurements extrapolated at @xmath23 . a different scaling law for the latter would modify the world average of @xmath26 . however , a contribution from new coloured scalars or fermions would always slow down the running from low energy to @xmath23  so as to increase the value of @xmath27  @xcite . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : alpha]b , such an increase of @xmath26 would render more constraining the limits on the hadronic and invisible partial widths . the limit on the leptonic width \n would be slightly weakened , but would anyway remain the strongest of the three constraints .

obtained when the new particle production leads to fractions in the hadronic , invisible and leptonic ( three flavours ) final states identical to the z branching fractions . in this case , only @xmath18 depends on @xmath28 . \n equations  ( 4 ) to  ( 7 ) no longer yield an independent determination of @xmath37  and @xmath38  with meaningful accuracy , because they all depend on the same linear combination of the two quantities . as a result \n , the new particle contribution to the z width can always be cancelled by the @xmath39 virtual contribution , if a sufficient amount of fine tuning takes place . \n whether or not this amount of fine tuning is acceptable would need different measurements and/or more theory to decide . \n the results obtained in section  [ sec : hadronic ] can be applied to a variety of new processes . in this letter , they are used to constrain the cross section of the gluino production at @xmath8 in the process @xmath40 displayed in fig . \n [ fig : gunion ] as a function of the gluino mass  @xcite . \n because this cross section is the product of the @xmath41 cross section and a term that describes the gluon splitting into a gluino pair , the uncertainties related to the weak loop corrections to @xmath14 were alleviated by using the measured  cross section in the prediction . \n when the gluino is light , the final state arising from this process is purely hadronic irrespective of the gluino decay and hadronization , and therefore contributes solely to the z hadronic decay width in all quark flavours . \n upper limit on the production cross section at @xmath8 can then be set at 67pb ( table  [ tab : limit ] ) . \n the corresponding lower limit on the gluino mass can be read off from the curve in fig . \n [ fig : gunion ] , and is ( including a 2% systematic uncertainty on @xmath27 ) @xmath42    ( 160,95 ) ( 25,-2 )    1.6 mm    this limit confirms the one obtained by aleph  @xcite with an independent study of the qcd colour factors , which makes no use of the absolute z decay rates , and that derived from the running of the strong coupling constant  @xcite , which checks in addition the compatibility of the @xmath26 measurements at all energy scales . because it would add fully independent information and because it would avoid the conservative choices of section  [ sec : hadronic ] to be made , \n a combination of these results would further consolidate the light gluino exclusion . \n for instance , a combination of the present limit and that of ref . \n @xcite yields lower limits on @xmath13  of 6.8@xmath6  and 5.7@xmath6  at 95% and 99.63%c.l . \n , respectively . \n the present limit is not affected by the criticisms put forward to invalidate the previous results . \n it is only if three different fine tuning processes took place , _ \n i.e. , _    1 . \n if other new particles were produced in association with the gluino with a cross section of the order of or larger than that of the gluino production , but still were not directly detected at lep ; 2 .   if these processes led to final states such that the overall fractions of hadronic , invisible and leptonic new decays be similar to those of the z decays , for all lepton and quark flavours ; 3 .   and \n if additional new physics yielded large negative virtual contributions to the z total decay width ( from the @xmath43 combination ) to exactly compensate this multiple new particle production ;    that the limit derived with the method presented in this letter would not hold . \n i leave it to the champions of the light gluino scenario to find a theory in which this devilish conspiracy could take place . \n a method to derive model - independent limits on new physics contributions to z decays has been presented . no general upper limit on the total z decay width \n could be obtained , but very stringent constraints apply when the final states produced by the new physics process of interest are known . in particular , conservative upper limits have been put on @xmath18 of 0.55 , 1.3 and 3.9 mev in the case of purely leptonic ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) , invisible and hadronic final states . \n 99 the lep

{"ContextTokens": 4019, "GeneratedTokens": 227, "SynthesizedBody": "the rare earth nitrides ( re - n ) have recently attracted attention following theoretical advances that have yielded credible band structures in these strongly correlated materials.@xcite however , despite their simple rock - salt structure and their strongly localized 4__f _ _ states there are disagreements among various theoretical treatments regarding the nature of their band structures in either the ambient - temperature paramagnetic state or their magnetic ground states . \n interestingly , among the predictions one finds that some may be half metals@xcite which are of interest for spintronics applications , though their magnetic order is limited to temperatures below 70  k. however , even at ambient temperature the lattice constant varies systematically across the series , leading in turn to a systematically varying band structure and band gap . \n thus the re - n compounds may prove useful in a range of electronic and electro - optic applications . \n the ionicity of these materials is manifest in their band structures , so that their valence bands are of n 2__p _ _ and the conduction bands re 5__d _ _ , 6__s _ _ character . in the presence of \n partially filled re 4__f _ _ levels the exchange interaction shifts the spin - split conduction and valence band edges in the opposite sense , reducing the majority spin gap while the minority spin gap opens.@xcite clearly a sufficiently large shift will reduce the majority spin gap to zero , resulting in a half metal . besides the strong correlation effects affecting the 4__f _ _ \n states , the gap is also affected by the usual underestimate of the gap by the local density approximation ( lda ) . \n the latter is primarily due to long - range coulomb contribution which is over - screened by the electron - gas screening used in lda . in the present case , the conduction band minimum consists of re-@xmath0 states and the underestimated gap can be corrected by shifting the re-_d _ states upward within the lsda+__u _ _ method by introducing a @xmath1 even though the underlying physics is rather different from the hubbard @xmath2 shifts.@xcite the calculations require experimental input concerning the gap in order to fix a value for the empirical parameter @xmath1 . in this paper \n we present transmission data that establish the optical gaps of gdn in both magnetic states , which then allow us to adjust the computed band structure . \n the experimental description of re - ns is far from clear . \n although their nacl structure is well established,@xcite there is remarkably little consensus in the literature concerning their physical properties . \n most are known to be magnetically ordered at low temperature,@xcite though there remains much uncertainty about transition temperatures , saturation moments and even in some cases whether there is magnetic order at all and whether it is ferro- or antiferro - magnetic.@xcite there is also debate about their temperature - dependent conductivity , with specific samples of even nominally the same composition claimed variously as a metal , semimetal or semiconductor.@xcite nitrogen vacancies are common , and even in a material that is fundamentally a semiconductor they may dope the material to degenerate carrier densities.@xcite    optical transmission experiments have the potential to settle these questions by providing a measurement of the optical ( i.e. , minimum _ direct _ ) band gap , but here also the few reported measurements have provided ambiguous results . \n very early studies of the entire range of rare earth nitrides ( excepting the radioactive pm ) were based on powder samples , which dictated that only diffuse reflection measurements could be made.@xcite those data show only a weak dip in their diffuse absorption ( @xmath3 ) , with enhanced absorption at energies both larger and smaller than the quoted gap , which was interpreted as resulting from competition between inter - band and free - carrier contributions to the optical conductivity . \n the gaps , all near 1  ev , were taken as the weak minima between the two competing contributions to the diffuse absorption , rather than by observations of any clear absorption edges . \n in contrast gaps of 2 to over 4  ev@xcite are likely to be associated with severe oxidation ; gd@xmath4o@xmath5 has a 5.2  ev gap.@xcite we find that unprotected films become transparent insulators within seconds after exposure to air.@xcite the propensity of the re nitrides to oxidize joins the presence of n vacancies as the phenomena most responsible for ambiguous historical results . \n gdn , with its half - filled 4__f _ _ shell , is by far the most thoroughly investigated of the re - ns . \n it has the highest curie temperature among the re - ns,@xcite with reports as high as 90  k.@xcite we and others have recently reported a resistivity showing a magnitude and temperature dependence that is characteristic of a semiconductor above t@xmath6 , followed by a rapid fall as the temperature is lowered into the ferromagnetic phase.@xcite however , below 25k the resistivity again begins to increase in a form consistent with a reduced - gap semiconducting ferromagnetic state.@xcite    we recently reported visible - near ir measurements on gdn demonstrating a clear ambient - temperature absorption edge near 1  ev , but without sufficient data below 1  ev to make a reliable estimate of the gap.@xcite in this paper we extend transmission measurements to lower energy , which has permitted an unambiguous determination of the optical gap . \n more importantly the measurements have been completed at temperatures from ambient down to 6  k and signal clear band structure changes at the curie temperature . \n thin films of gdn were grown , as described in more detail earlier,@xcite by deposition of gd from an electron beam heated source in the presence of @xmath7  mbar of pure nitrogen gas . \n the 200 nm - thick film was capped with @xmath8200  nm gan , which we have shown to be an effective barrier to reaction with the atmosphere.@xcite note that in gan the inter - band edge is 3.4  ev ,  @xcite and there is only a small , approximately energy - independent absorption in the energy range probed in this study . \n the gdn in the present study contains crystallites with diameters of about 8 nm and has a resistivity of 0.15  @xmath9  cm at 300  k , rising through a peak of 0.25  @xmath9  cm at a curie temperature of 66  k and thereafter falling to a minimum of 0.18  @xmath9  cm . a carrier density of @xmath10  @xmath11 at 300 \n k has been estimated by noting that the mean - free - path can not be larger than the radius of the crystallites . \n spectral measurements in the range of 0.2 - 2  ev were performed with a bomem model da8 fourier transform spectrometer using films on sapphire substrates . for variable - temperature data the film was mounted in a flow - through cryostat with polyethylene windows . \n the multilayer system , sapphire - gdn - gan , shows complex interference . \n fringes with a periodicity of about 6  @xmath12 ( @xmath80.1  mev ) associated with the substrate have been simply smoothed , leaving weak interference associated with the film and capping layers . despite the weak fringes the band edges are strikingly clear , permitting an unambiguous determination of the optical gap and its red shift in the ferromagnetic phase . \n figure  [ fig1 ] shows the frequency - dependent transmission at temperatures of 6 , 75 and 300  k. turning first to the 300  k data it can be seen that there is a clear onset of absorption just above 1 ev . \n there is no evidence of sub - gap absorption at lower energies , with the transmission flat except for interference fringes that modulate the transmission by 3% . \n the gap of @xmath13  ev is estimated as the intersection of the frequency - independent transmission below the edge and the extrapolation from the inflection point centered on the edge . at 75 \n k ( immediately above t@xmath6 ) the transmission is little changed from 300  k , showing merely a 1 - 2% fall in the low - frequency transmission and a changing interference pattern associated with contraction and with the temperature dependence of the optical constants in the film and substrate . \n most importantly there is only a very weakly shifted inter - band edge as compared to the results at 300 k. in contrast the ferromagnetic phase , at 6  k , shows a very significant change in both the absorption edge and the sub - gap transmission . \n a very clear tail extends to a new edge at lower energy , which can be seen much more clearly in a plot of the difference between the transmissions at 75 and at 6  k , in the inset of fig . \n using again the intersection of extrapolated data above and below the edge we find a gap of @xmath14  ev in the ferromagnetic state . \n the lower - energy edge enhances the refractive index below the gap , which then increases the reflectivity and is in turn responsible for the reduced sub - gap transmission .    in order to estimate the energy - dependent absorption coefficient , @xmath15 , across the edge note that , with the neglect of interference enhancement within the gdn film , the transmission coefficient @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the thickness and @xmath19 the reflectivity of the multi - layer . \n figure [ fig3 ] shows the absorption coefficient estimated using this equation , replacing the factor @xmath20 by the transmission in the sub - gap region . \n it is significant that the absorption coefficient rises steeply to over @xmath21  @xmath12 . \n such strong absorption is typical of inter - band direct transitions , and is orders of magnitude larger than is seen at indirect transitions . \n as discussed above there exist historical data suggesting that the optical gap in gdn is 0.98 ev.@xcite it is interesting that the same paper reported what was regarded as anomalous optical data on one sample of gdn , apparently with a lower - than - typical n deficiency and thus weaker free carrier absorption , in which the diffuse absorption showed an onset close to that reported here . \n the paper also made the claim that there was no shift of the edge in the ferromagnetic phase , but that the sub - gap absorption increased significantly . \n although no low temperature data were presented , that description suggests a behaviour similar to the present report , except that the data were apparently not extended to the red - shifted edge . \n more recently there has been a report of band shifts in gdn observed in x - ray magnetic circular dichroism data.@xcite the conduction - band density - of - states ( cbdos ) at the gd l@xmath22 edge was seen to red - shift by a few hundred mev in the ferromagnetic state . \n those data measure the cb maximum relative to the gd @xmath23 core level , so they are not directly comparable to the present inter - band data . however , it is interesting that the red shift of the gd 2p - to - cbdos is of very similar magnitude to the inter - band edge red shift reported here . \n the very clear optical gaps that we report relate directly to the lsda+__u _ _ computed band structure of larson _ et al._,@xcite in which the same red shift of 0.4  ev is predicted between the para- and ferro - magnetic phases . \n however , the absolute magnitudes of the gaps are in disagreement with our data . \n the experimental optical gap of busch _ et al_. @xcite was used in that calculation as a means to fine tune the gap . \n this is done by choosing a @xmath24 parameter that is applied to the empty gd 5__d _ _ levels , shifting them up . \n the gap , 0.98  ev in the paramagnetic state , was assumed to correspond to the average of the majority- and minority - spin gaps in the ground state for which the calculation was made . from this \n they fix @xmath1 at 6.4  ev . using the same method and software we have recalculated the gdn band structure to fit the new data . in a remarkable agreement between theory and experiment we find that a choice of @xmath24 = 8.0  ev leads to a majority - spin gap of 0.91  ev and an average gap of 1.30  ev , which correspond to our measurements within their uncertainties . \n figure [ fig4 ] shows the band structure calculated with that parameter ; note that gdn is an indirect - gap semiconductor with the direct gap at x and an indirect ( @xmath25 ) gap of 0.43  ev ( 0.98  ev ) in the ferromagnetic ( paramagnetic ) state . \n it is important to explore whether the representation of the gap in the paramagnetic state as the average spin - resolved ferromagnetic gap is realistic . \n to test the idea we have carried out calculations of both ferromagnetically - aligned and non - collinear random - aligned spins in a @xmath26 supercell of the conventional cubic fcc cell , containing 32 atoms . \n this calculation was done within the atomic sphere approximation and shifts were simply added to the gd-@xmath27 and gd-@xmath28 bands mimicking the full - fledged lsda+__u _ _ ferromagnetic state as closely as possible . with this approach the average gap of spin up ( 1.12  ev ) and \n spin down ( 1.58  ev ) gaps came out to be 1.35  ev in the ferromagnetically - aligned case . \n the simple shift approach compared to the lsda+__u _ _ has as a side - effect that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) at @xmath29 ( of rocksalt ) equals the vbm at @xmath30 , making the direct and indirect gap equal . \n however , the calculation clearly illustrates the relation between the gap of a disordered spin arrangement and the average of spin up and spin down gaps of the ferromagnetic system as a proof of principle . using the same shifts in the supercell with non - collinear spins , \n the gap was found to be 1.30  ev , as can be seen in fig . \n [ fig5 ] , which is indeed close to but slightly less than the average of the ferromagnetic gaps . \n the reason for the small discrepancy is that the calculation was performed for only one representative random sample and the size of the cell is still relatively small to represent a random configuration . \n in fact , it had a net residual magnetic moment of 1.44 @xmath31/gd in the cell . \n so , one could say it is still 20  % magnetized instead of completely demagnetized . \n thus it has only 80  % of the upward shift in gap from the ferromagnetic case , i.e. 1.30  ev . \n the bands in fig . \n [ fig5 ] are color coded according to their spin content . \n red means 100  % majority spin , blue means 100  % minority spin and bands with mixed spin character have the appropriate mix of blue and red . \n one may see that the valence band maximum still has 100  % majority spin character but the conduction band minimum has a mixed character , the lower one being slightly more majority and the next one being slightly more minority spin in character . \n this direct way of simulating the paramagnetic system would require larger cells to be fully converged . \n nevertheless , it provides a direct test that the gap is indeed larger for a system with randomly oriented spins compared to the gap for the ferromagnetic system and provides additional support to our procedure of estimating the gap of the paramagnetic system as the average of majority and minority spin gaps in the ferromagnetic state . \n we have reported an unambiguous signature of the direct optical gap in a rare - earth nitride . \n the absorption edge is seen as a rapid loss of transmitted intensity as the photon energy rises through the edge , and is accompanied by an energy - independent transmission indicating no significant absorption below the edge . \n the direct gap is seen at 1.3  ev in the paramagnetic phase at 300  k , and on entering the ferromagnetic phase it falls to 0.9  ev . \n the red shift of 0.4  ev is in good agreement with recent lsda+__u _ _ calculations and a slight fine tuning of the empirical @xmath24 parameter used in those calculations allows us to reproduce the absolute values of the gaps in the band structure calculation . \n the procedure of estimating the gap of the paramagnetic state as the average of majority and minority spin gaps in the ferromagnetic state was justified by a separate calculation for a system with randomly oriented spins . \n it is significant that earlier predictions concerning the conducting character of the entire range of re nitrides were based on the value of @xmath24 in gdn , adjusted so as to reproduce the earlier incorrect optical gap of 0.98  ev in the paramagnetic state . \n similar fine - tuning readjustments of band structures will be required also for other re nitrides . \n the macdiarmid institute for advanced materials and nanotechnology is supported by a grant from the new zealand tertiary education commission under the centre of research excellence fund . \n the work at cwru was supported by the army research office under grant number w911nf-06 -

{"ContextTokens": 2334, "GeneratedTokens": 102, "SynthesizedBody": "ever since r. sunyaev and ya . \n b. zeldovich predicted the distortion of the spectral density of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) in 1969 @xcite @xcite by the ionized plasma in globular clusters , whose main constituent is a relatively dense electron gas , dozens of papers have been published addressing various aspects of this phenomenon . \n this avalanche of works is mainly due to the undeniable importance of such effect , not only because it yields information on deviations from the isotropy and homogeneity of the universe , but also provides an aid in determining other important cosmological parameters such as the baryonic density of matter , hubble s constant , age and velocity of massive clusters , and others . \n these features have been thoroughly reviewed in recent literature so we shall not dwell with them here @xcite-@xcite . \n although practically every cosmologist or astrophysicist believes that this effect is now `` clearly '' understood , there are reasons that we believe will help clarifying some of the still subtle details that remain unclear in the available treatments . \n firstly , the early attempts to study this effect by visualizing the motion of the photons through the hot electron gas in the cluster as a diffusion process which , in the non - relativistic limit is described by the famous kompaneets equation @xcite @xcite . \n the analysis of the results obtained through the hot electron gas in the cluster through the use of this equation are well - known @xcite-@xcite . \n nevertheless , it was soon realized by many authors , including sunyaev himself , that due to the very small probability that an incoming photon is scattered even once in its passage through the gas , a compton - like scattering of a photon off an electron was a much more suitable mechanism to explain the effect . \n this trend of ideas has been recently reviewed by dolgov et al @xcite where the reader may find more literature about the subject . \n the somewhat intriguing result is that both approaches lead to identical results , a fact that needs further clarification . \n we address this question in this paper . \n secondly , the role of the optical depth @xmath1 , related to the distance a photon can travel in the plasma before it is scattered off an electron , plays in the way the broadening of the spectral lines of the scattered photon is modified by the doppler effect , has not yet been justified in a convincing manner . here \n we address this question form an entirely different point of view . \n and thirdly , we also show that this different interpretation of @xmath1 also leads to the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in a rather trivial way . \n we begin our discussion by establishing a general expression for the full distorted spectrum , @xmath2 of the scattered radiation off the plasma . \n let @xmath1 be the optical depth as discussed above . \n this quantity is a direct measure of the probability that a photon is scattered off an electron in the gas . \n thus , since the effect is small , @xmath3 is the probability that the photon traverses the plasma unscattered . \n therefore , @xmath4 \\,d\\bar{\\nu } \\end{array } \\label{uno}\\ ] ] the first term in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) is self - explanatory , the lower limit justified since @xmath5 , the incoming flux is zero for negative frequencies . \n the second term , the important one , defines a gaussian probability function describing scattering of a photon with incoming frequency @xmath6 off an electron whose average kinetic energy in the gas , in the non - relativistic approximation is @xmath7 . \n this function has been thoroughly discussed in earlier work @xcite so we shall not discuss it here further . in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) the incoming flux is given , for @xmath8 by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the temperature of the cosmic background radiation , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath12 is planck s constant , and @xmath13 the speed of light . \n further , @xmath14 is the width of the spectral line at frequency @xmath15 and its squared value reads @xcite : @xmath16 in eq.([dos ] ) @xmath17 is the temperature of the electron scatterers , @xmath18 is the electron mass and @xmath19 for @xmath20 . \n notice should be made of the fact that the mathematical expression for @xmath21 corresponds to what in the literature is called the inverse compton scattering @xcite . \n in particular , this is the reason of the factor @xmath22 in such equation . to show this fact we take into account the frequency distribution function for photons with incoming frequency @xmath23 isotropically scattered by electrons with velocities @xmath24@xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 . the expected value for the photon frequency at fixed @xmath27 is then given by : @xmath28 direct application of the equipartition energy theorem allows us to identify @xmath29 @xmath30 . \n physically , this implies that a typical photon scattered off an electron will have a temperature dependent blue shift simply given by @xmath31 . \n it is interesting to notice that a similar `` frequency shift approach '' leads to the analytical well known expression of the kinematic sz effect . \n this is shown in the appendix . \n ( [ uno ] ) can be evaluated analytically leading to an expression which is identical to the one reported in the literature . setting in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) @xmath32 we get that @xmath33 \\,d\\alpha \\label{cinco}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 since @xmath35 is a small number @xcite and @xmath36 is an analytical function of @xmath15 we may expand the integrand in eq . \n ( [ cinco ] ) in a taylor series : @xmath37 all odd powers of @xmath38 yield zero upon integration so , after a straightforward calculation , we get that @xmath39 to first order in @xmath40 @xmath35  we reproduce _ exactly _ the analytic expression for the distortion curve @xcite-@xcite . \n it is also interesting to notice that , taking into account the second order terms in @xmath35 included in eq . \n ( [ ocho ] ) , the crossover frequency @xmath41 corresponding to the solution of equation @xmath42 is now clearly dependent on the value of @xmath35 namely , on the electron temperature , a feature not ordinarily recognized for a non - relativistic intra - cluster gas . for typical values of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 a numerical calculation yields @xmath45 , while the value obtained by considering only linear terms in @xmath35 yields @xmath46 ghz , a difference of nearly @xmath47 . \n 1 shows the plot of the analytical non -

emission process of photons by electrons to first order in @xmath35 . \n the problem posed in ref . \n @xcite requiring an explanation of why two different mechanisms lead to the same result is now mathematically solved . \n finally , we want to stress that it is now clear why the curves describing the thermal sz effect obtained by numerical integration of different mathematical expressions turn out to be identical . \n we therefore expect that the relativistic sz effect and other photon scattering problems in hot plasmas can be handled by a similar procedure . \n the central idea of the convolution integral approach to cmbr distortions is that , in a dilute gas , a scattering law @xmath52 is given by what in statistical physics is known as the _ \n dynamic structure factor _ , where @xmath53 and @xmath15 are the corresponding incoming / outcoming photon frequencies . \n then , one computes the distorted occupation number through the convolution integral @xmath54 with @xmath55 in the non -

transparency ( eit ) in the atomic ensembles @xcite , photonic crystal waveguide band edgespc01,pc02 , solid - state multilayer semiconductor structure@xcite , coupled resonator optical waveguide ( crow)@xcite , more complicated hybrid structure , e.g. , coupled resonator optical waveguide doped with atoms@xcite .    for a static photonic structure , for example a bare crow , due to the limitation of delay - bandwidth product constraint , \n it is not suitable to stop light . to dynamically stop and release the light , a dynamically tunable system is required . \n fan suggested that , if there are extra resonators side coupling to the optical cavity cells of the crow , fano interference can lead to a large change of bandwidth of the system when a small refractive index modulation is employed@xcite . \n the velocity of light can therefore be dynamically slowed down and even stopped . unlike the case of eit the light is coherently stored in a static way in the resonance cavity

with a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is suggested to slow the light@xcite . \n research groups led respectively by painter@xcite and kippenberg@xcite proposed slowing down light based on eit in optomechanics . \n the photons are mapped onto the phonon modes instead of internal atomic degrees of freedom in the case of eit in atomic ensembles . \n in fact , like the case of a crow , an optical waveguide coupled to an optomechanical crystal array has been suggested to slow and stop light pulse@xcite . \n motivated by the work mentioned above , this paper investigates the photon transmission in a homogeneous side coupled optomechanical crystal array , in which each optical resonator in the bare crow couples to an extra mechanical resonator . \n the interaction between the mechanical mode and optical modes allows the photonic band structure of crow to be modulated , allowing stopping and releasing light possible in our model . by adjusting the refractive index of the photonic crystal \n , the photons can be mapped onto the collective excitation of mechanical modes and then be stopped . \n our scheme offers a patternable , compact and on - chip platform to slow and stop light . \n

relations of upper and lower branch polaritons obtained in previous section , take lower polariton for example , we investigate the band structure and demonstrate how slow down the velocity of polariton by compressing the bandwidth in sec . \n iv . the final section concludes the paper . \n we consider an 1-d periodic array of optomechanical crystals , which consists of @xmath0 evanescently coupled optomechanical crystals , shown in figure 1 . the single optomechanical crystal cell , co - localizing photonic and phononic resonances in a quasi one - dimensional optomechanical crystal , is proposed by the research group led by painter@xcite . \n the mechanical modes of the optomechanical crystal cell can be divided into common and differential modes of in - plane and out - plane motion of these nanobeams . for simplicity \n , we just consider the case that the gaps between the nanobeams are time - independent , i.e. the common mode case . \n therefore the coupling between neighboring optical cavities is constant . to excite the system , \n a probe optical signal is dropped in the optomechanical array in a side - coupled configuration , and the output signal is dropped out in a similar manner . with this consideration , the hamiltonian of the system in the reference frame rotating with probe laser frequency @xmath1 can be written as    [ h ] @xmath2here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are creation ( annihilation ) operators of optical cavity mode and mechanical mode in the @xmath5-th optomechanical cell , respectively . \n @xmath6 is the detuning between cavity field and probe laser , @xmath7 is the mechanical resonator angular frequency , the constant @xmath8 is the coupling strength between cavity and mechanical resonator and @xmath9 denotes the nearest neighboring evanescently coupling of intercavity .    when the intracavity fields have a large amplitude , i.e. in the strong - driving limit , we can linearize the hamiltonian by setting @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is the steady mean value and @xmath13 is the corresponding fluctuation around its steady value . with this ansatz , \n we then obtain the linearized hamiltonian    @xmath14    where the effective detuning is @xmath15 and the effective coupling between light and mechanical vibration is @xmath16 . in eq . \n ( [ hi ] ) we have omitted the counter - rotational wave term in the interaction between the cavity field and mechanical vibration . \n let us study the hamiltonian in @xmath17-representation . \n taking into account the periodic properties of the system , we can make fourier transformations    [ ab ] @xmath18where @xmath19 are the normal mode operators of the coupled optical cavity , @xmath20 are the boson operators to describe the collective excitation ( phonon ) of mechanical resonators , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the distance of inter - cavity . inserting above transformation relation into eqs . \n ( [ h1 ] ) , we arrive at the new hamiltonian

the interaction of the photonic and phononic modes .    to decouple the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) \n , we introduce the bogoliubov transformation    [ akbk ] @xmath26 and the inverse transformation is    [ ckdk ] @xmath27 since operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 must satisfy bosonic commutation relations    @xmath30 & = 1 \\\\ \\left [ d_{k},d_{k}^{\\dagger } \\right ] & = 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    transformation coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 have the relation @xmath33 . substituting eqs . \n ( [ akbk ] ) into eq . \n ( [ hk ] ) , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as@xmath34obviously , if @xmath35the hamiltonian will have the diagonalized form    @xmath36    from eqs . \n ( [ ckdk ] ) and ( [ hk ] ) one can note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 operators represent two types of elementary excitations ( phonon - photon polaritons ) in coupled optomechanical array system , which is the result of the coherently mixing of photons and phonons through coupling in each optomechanics cell . \n the dispersion relations of lower and upper branches polaritons are determined by    @xmath37    it is found that the original single optical band structure is split into two bands owing to the interaction between photons and phonons . \n the bandwidths of lower and upper branches , respectively , are @xmath38where    @xmath39    with the detuning @xmath40 . compared to the original optical band , \n the bandwidth of the lower branch polariton is enlarged and the upper one is compressed . moreover \n , the most important thing is that both of these bandwidths of lower and upper bands can be modulated by changing parameters , such as @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath42 . \n figure figure2 shows a typical picture of the bandwidth of lower branch polariton dependent on @xmath42 , from which one can note that the bandwidth decreases with increasing @xmath42 . in more detail , when @xmath43 , the bandwidth of lower band @xmath44 , corresponding to the maximum bandwidth ; when @xmath45 , the bandwidth is approximately equal to zero . \n the insets are the corresponding band structures of polariton when detuning ( a)@xmath46 ; ( b ) @xmath47 and ( c ) @xmath48 . \n @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . here \n @xmath42 is in units of @xmath9 . \n , width=307 ]    on the other hand , it is known that the group velocity of polaritons in a lattice is related with dispersion    @xmath52    which is also dependent on parameters @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath53 and therefore can be tuned . \n such a tunable band structure leads to a tunable group velocity . \n figure [ figure3 ] shows the lower branch polariton with a momentum @xmath54 . \n we observe its group velocity decreases rapidly from its maximum value @xmath9 and vanishes as @xmath42 increases . \n in fact , such tunable band structure can play an important role in optical communication and quantum memory , for example , fan suggested using a tunable crow to slow and stop light pulse@xcite . \n .,width=307 ]    here we briefly demonstrate the process , taking the lower branch polariton as an example , to slow the light pulse in optomechanical crystal array . to begin with \n , the optical cavity is adjusted to be resonant with laser frequency , so the detuning is @xmath55 . at this point \n , the bandwidth of lower branch is largest and can accommodate the entire light pulse , and the lower branch polariton is made up of photons , shown in figure [ figure4 ] . \n after the pulse enters completely into the optomechanical array , we then compress the bandwidth of lower branch polariton adiabatically by tuning the resonance frequency of the optical cavity until @xmath56 . further compressing the bandwidth , more and more photons are converted to mechanical modes in the lower branch \n , meanwhile , the velocity of polaritons slows down and approaches to zero .    from the point of conversion between photons and mechanical collective excitations \n , one can also understand the mechanism of stoping light . \n because the total excitations number @xmath57 commutes with hamiltonian @xmath58 , when adjusting some parameters , such as @xmath53 , the total excitations number is conserved , while the numbers of photons and mechanical collective excitations @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not conserved due to not commuting with the hamiltonian . \n hence the photons and mechanical collective excitations are mutually convertible , which results in mapping the light onto the mechanical vibration and vice versa . \n figure [ figure4 ] illustrates that the conversion between the photons and mechanical collective excitations . the number of mechanical collective excitation increases , from zero to unity , while the number of photons decrease from unity to zero , with increasing the detuning @xmath42 .     and \n @xmath32 represent the ratio of photons and phonons in the lower branch polariton . \n solid and dashed lines represents @xmath61 and @xmath31 respectively . \n other parameters are the same as in fig . \n [ figure2].,width=307 ]    we keep in mind that the rate of tuning cavity frequency should be less than the band gap between upper and lower branches , which is given by    @xmath62    this limitation avoids the polaritons in lower branch jumping up to the upper branch . \n figure [ figure5 ] shows that the band gap first linearly decreases and then linearly rises with increasing the detuning @xmath42 . \n the minimum value of band gap is about @xmath63 when the detuning of optical cavity is resonant with mechanical resonator .    . \n other parameters are the same as in fig . \n [ figure2].,width=307 ]    to practically stop light in the coupled optomechanics array , we tune the detuning between optical cavity field and probe laser by adjusting the refractive index of material , e.g . \n si , which makes up of the optomechanical crystal . in our scheme \n , the amplitude of detuning modulation is the same order of magnitude of the mechanical resonance frequency , so the refractive index shift should be    @xmath64    which is feasible in practical optoelectronic devices@xcite . here \n we have taken the typical parameters @xmath65 thz , @xmath66 ghz@xcite . \n we have studied the model of light transmission in a spatial periodic optomechanical crystal array . \n the optical cavities of the array evanescently couple to each other one by one to form a crow . in the strong driving limit , we linearized the system and obtained the dispersion relations of lower and upper branch polaritons with bogoliubov transformation in the momentum space . \n our results show that the modulation of detuning between optical cavity and laser light can vary the bandwidths of polaritons , which has been demonstrated to be able to stop and release a light pulse . \n we thank andrew bolt for polishing english .", "StartTimeOffset": 1974057645973, "RequestID": "38d9d18018d94dda82009deac627e2b9", "TotalTokens": 3503}

layer networks , but has not yet been investigated thoroughly in multiplex networks , i.e. that of correlations  @xcite . in networks with a single layer it has been found that there are correlations in the properties of connected nodes . \n namely , the degree of a node can be either positively or negatively correlated with the degree of its first neighbors . in the first case , the hubs of the networks \n are preferentially linked to each others , while in the second case they are preferentially connected to low - degree nodes  @xcite .    in multiplex networks \n the very same concept of correlations is far richer than in a network with a single layer . \n in fact , on one hand it is still possible to explore the standard degree - degree correlations at the level of each layer of the network , but on the other hand it is more interesting to introduce a truly multiplex definition of correlations , for instance by looking at how a certain property of a node at a given layer is correlated to the same or other properties of the same node at another layer . \n we present here a complete and self - consistent study of correlations of node properties in multiplex networks . in doing this , we follow the usual steps of the typical approach to complex networks : _ \n i ) _ we first explore empirically correlations in real multiplex networks , _ ii ) _ we introduce various measures to characterize and quantify correlations in multiplex networks , _ iii ) _ we propose a series of models to reproduce the correlations found in real multiplex systems , or to assess their relevance . \n we find that multiplexity introduces novel levels of complexity . \n in particular , in real - world multiplex networks the patterns of presence and involvement of the nodes at the different layers are characterized by strong correlations . and \n this has to be taken into account when it comes to model such systems . \n the article is organized as follows . in sect . \n [ why ] we focus on two small real - world networks and we use them as examples to explain why a description in terms of multiplex networks captures more information on a system than a single - layer projection . in the remaining sections we study the structure of five real - world multiplex networks ( additional information about the networks are provided in appendix ) , with the main attention to the concept of correlations . in particular , in sect . \n [ sec : activity ] we focus on the patterns of node activity and involvement at the various layers . \n we say that a node is active at a given layer if it has at least one link at that layer , and we introduce various quantities to characterize the distribution and the correlations of node activities . \n we also investigate the activity correlations between pairs of layers . \n we find that real - world multiplex networks are quite sparse , with only a few nodes active in many layers , and are characterized by strong correlations : interestingly , the activity of a node in a particular layer is very often correlated with its activity in some other layer . in sect . \n [ sec : activity_models ] we introduce the first null - models to assess the significance of the observed patterns of node activity . in sect . \n [ sec : cartography ] we investigate correlations between the activity and the degree of the nodes of a multiplex network , while in sect . \n [ sec : degree - degree ] we show how to quantify inter - layer degree correlations ( degree correlations between layers ) . \n in particular , we focus our attention on measuring correlation in the node degrees of a pair of layers , either by using the spearman s rank correlation coefficient of the two degree sequences , or by plotting , as a function of @xmath0 , the average degree @xmath1 at one layer of nodes having degree @xmath0 at the other layer . \n we find that there exist significant correlations among the degree of the same node at different layers , and such correlations can be either positive , meaning that nodes tend to have similar roles across layers , or negative , meaning that nodes with a large degree in one layer tend to have small degrees in another layer . finally , in sect.[sec : model_degree -

3021a and j1824 - 2452a lie .      if the mass accretion phase lasts tens or hundreds of million years after @xmath18 , the evolutive scenario is more complicated . \n the plasma flowing onto the neutron star forms an accretion disk whose inner edge is given by the coupling radius of the magnetosphere ( of the same order of magnitude of the alfvn radius ) @xmath35 \n the interaction between the magnetic field of the compact object and the conducting material flowing from its companion can provide the necessary torque @xmath36 to spin up the pulsar  @xcite . however , under certain conditions , it is possible that this interaction leads to a torque reversal . \n the growth of the external field @xmath10 causes the magnetic boundary @xmath37 to move outward relative to the corotation radius @xmath38 defined as the distance at which the spin frequency of the star is equal to the keplerian frequency . \n the star enters a propeller phase when @xmath39 : a centrifugal barrier prevents the material to flow onto the star and a new braking torque @xmath40 acts to slow down the pulsar  @xcite . \n ( green line ) , @xmath41 ( red line ) and period @xmath42 of the star ( blue line ) . \n the dashed black line indicates the moment at which the spin equilibrium phase takes place . \n here we assume @xmath43  ms , @xmath44  g and @xmath45 . \n _ panel ( b ) _ : frequencies at which the spin equilibrium phase takes place as a function of the mass accretion rate . \n we show two examples , corresponding to @xmath46  ms ( gray area ) and @xmath47  ms ( cyan area ) . \n the width of the strips corresponds to the uncertainty on @xmath48 ( see yellow area in figure  [ fig.1 ] ) . \n the red dot refers to the case shown in panel ( a ) . \n , width=340,height=264 ]    in figure  [ fig.3]a we show a typical evolutionary path for an accreting neutron star if the diffusion of the internal poloidal component @xmath11 is taken into account . the growth of the external magnetic field @xmath49 leads to the end of the spin - up phase . \n the star evolves into an equilibrium spin phase , it alternates between spin - up and spin - down ( @xmath50 ) and finally it appears as a radio pulsar at the end of the mass accretion phase .    finally , \n from the analysis presented above we can notice that in order to reach high spin frequencies it is necessary a mass accretion rate @xmath51 ( see figure  [ fig.3]b ) . \n in the previous section we have presented a general scenario for the evolution of msps when the production and the diffusion of the internal magnetic field is taken into account . in this section \n we concentrate on the cases of the two isolated pulsars j1823 - 3021a and j1824 - 2452a .    in the most widely discussed model , \n msps have been re - accelerated through mass accretion , in particular by having spent a fraction of their lives as part of a lmxb . \n the way by which they end up as isolated pulsars is still not fully understood . \n a possibility is that the companions are destroyed through ablation caused by energetic radiation from the pulsar @xcite . \n another possibility requires mass loss from the companion which can take place in very close binary systems due to tidal dissipation @xcite . a totally different scheme to produce an isolated msp is the one in which the pulsar had an interaction with another star or binary in the globular cluster , and was spun - up in the process @xcite . in the following \n we will concentrate on the scenario in which msps are produced in lmxbs . \n + the pulsar j1823 - 3021a , located in the globular cluster ngc 6624 , was discovered in 1994  @xcite . \n the fermi large area telescope has recently detected the @xmath52 ray counterpart of its pulsations  @xcite with a luminosity of @xmath53 ergs s@xmath54 , the highest observed @xmath52 ray luminosity for any msp . \n the pulsation period @xmath42 is @xmath55 ms and the observed spinning down rate is extremely large @xmath56 s s@xmath54 , larger by far than the typical value for other msps . \n these properties make j1823 - 3021a an extremely interesting stellar object . \n the total observed @xmath52 ray emission implies that a significant fraction of @xmath57 is due to the intrinsic spinning down rate @xmath0  @xcite . within the standard magnetic dipole model for pulsar emission , \n such a large @xmath0 is generated by a large surface magnetic field @xmath58 , larger than @xmath59 g. this fact represents a puzzle for standard msp theory  @xcite : if j1823 - 3021a was spun - up by mass accretion from a companion , due to its large magnetic field @xmath58 , even assuming an accretion rate at the eddington limit @xmath60 , the star would have reached a period @xmath61 ms , which is larger than its present period . \n + the isolated millisecond pulsar j1824 - 2452a is located in the globular cluster m28 at @xmath62  kpc from the sun @xcite . \n the pulsation period is @xmath63  ms and the observed spinning down rate is @xmath64 s s@xmath54 . \n indirect evidence exists that this large @xmath0 observed is indicative of the true value , e.g. the detection of glitches @xcite , giant pulses @xcite , strong x - ray pulses @xcite and a large second period derivative @xmath65 @xcite . as for j1823 - 3021a , \n the large @xmath0 implies a surface magnetic field @xmath66  g and the combination of values ( @xmath31 ) is difficult to explain in the standard msps theory . \n + note that these anomalous pulsars can be explained in the standard model if the accretion occurred at super - eddington rate . \n about such a possibility , we note that all the accreting compact stars detected up to now in lmxbs have steady mass accretion rates @xmath67  @xcite presented in @xcite in parentheses refer to these active periods and not to steady accretion . ] . \n moreover , taking into account also the interaction between the external magnetic field and the accretion disk , a minimal value for the mass accretion rate @xmath68 is necessary to accelerate the stars up to the present spin frequency . for lower values of @xmath29 \n the accreting ns enters a propeller regime that prevents a further acceleration . \n in our analysis we have presented a scheme in which the msps can populate the region occupied by j1823 - 3021a and j1824 - 2452a . \n it is important to remark that the existence of a propeller phase does not invalidate the possibility to interpret these two special msps in our scheme . \n indeed , in figure  [ fig.3]a we show that the spin frequency of the star does not change significantly during the spin equilibrium phase : even if a fast spin - down of the star takes place during the propeller regime @xcite , the star nevertheless will continue to appear as a radio pulsar in the shaded area of figure  [ fig.2 ] . concerning the two anomalous stellar objects they are no more accreting and if a propeller phase took place during accretion it is clearly already over . \n the exact position in the @xmath42-@xmath2 plane before a possible propeller phase can not be determined precisely , but it was located at higher frequencies : the existence of this phase would make therefore even more difficult to interpret these two objects within the standard pulsar model ( because they would lie further from the eddington limit ) but it is easy to accommodate in our model . \n we have discussed the evolution of the external magnetic field of recycled msps due to the diffusion of strong internal magnetic fields generated by r - modes during the mass accretion phase . \n our analysis is based on the previous work of @xcite and @xcite where it has been shown that r - modes generate strong internal magnetic fields in accreting compact stars . \n we have shown that the growth of the external magnetic field affects the evolution of the spin - down rate @xmath0 of the msps and that this mechanism can explain the high @xmath0 of j1823 - 3021a and of j1824 - 2452a . \n our analysis open new evolutionary paths for the _ recycled _ msps in the @xmath31 plane . \n g.p . acknowledges financial support from the italian ministry of research through the program rita levi montalcini .", "StartTimeOffset": 2004600505878, "RequestID": "75f71bc6109a4b75a5bf981c220dac38", "TotalTokens": 4045}

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     more detailed experimental results are shown in fig . \n [ profiles ] where we depict peak profiles at two different driver voltages . \n the profiles were taken at the times of largest peak voltage amplitude and lowest peak voltage amplitude . for @xmath43v ( \n left column of panels ) we see that , as the frequency is raised from below , we cross from the 1-peak region through the 2-peak region and into the 3-peak region . for the @xmath44  v case ( right column of panels ) \n the same sequence can be observed when scanning in one frequency direction . in order to illustrate both the hysteresis and the overlap between @xmath0-peak regions , we depict in the figure ( panels ( e ) and ( f ) ) a situation where the 2-peak solution occurs at a higher frequency than the 3-peaked one . \n the reason is that in fig . \n [ profiles](f ) , the 3-peak solution was obtained at higher frequencies and then adiabatically extended to lower ones , whereas in fig . \n [ profiles](e ) the 2-peak solution was obtained starting from the 1-peak region . \n we show the eventual location of peaks in the breather pattern ( i.e. after the driver has been on for a long time ) . however , it is important to mention that the exact location where the peaks eventually settle is sensitive to slight impurities in the lattice . \n we have noticed that when we turn on the voltage source , at first we can observe a more sinusoidal pattern ( corresponding to the most modulationally unstable @xmath45-value ) , but as the pattern reaches higher energy and becomes more nonlinear , the peaks may shift and adjust themselves in the lattice . \n as it can be observed , peaks are not perfectly equispaced in the lattice . \n this is obviously due to the inhomogeneities and noise present in the experiment .    for the numerical results depicted in fig . \n [ profiles ] we used a set of initials conditions based on the experimental data and determined the stationary state by letting the numerical profiles to settle to a steady state . for the cases corresponding to @xmath43 \n v and @xmath44  v , adding a small frequency offset @xmath46  khz , we observe , in general , a good agreement between numerics and experimental data . \n the mismatch between experiments and theory , in particular the intersite distance peaks , can be attributed to the above mentioned factors . \n furthermore , to reproduce precisely the experimental peak voltage is extremely difficult because it corresponds to the voltage at resonance and , therefore , even very small parameter changes can create large differences in the maximum amplitudes . \n nevertheless , the quantitative agreement appears fairly good , especially for the @xmath44  v case . \n in this paper we have formulated a prototypical model that is able to describe the formation of nonlinear intrinsic localized modes ( or discrete breathers ) in an experimental electric line . \n this has been derived based on a combination of the fairly accurate characterization of a single element within the lattice ( including its nonlinear resonance curves and hysteretic behavior ) and fundamental circuit theory in order to properly couple the elements . \n comparison between theory and experiments shows very good qualitative and even good quantitative agreement between the two . \n we characterized the regions of existence and stability of @xmath0-peaked breathers for @xmath1 and illustrated how transitions of the coherent waveforms of one kind to those of another kind take place , rationalizing them on the basis of stability properties and their corresponding floquet spectra . \n we also showed that the precise number of peaks and their location in the lattice is fairly sensitive to initial conditions , a feature also generally observed in the experiments where the potential for states with different numbers of peaks similarly manifests . \n naturally , many directions of potential future research stem from the fundamental modeling and computation basis explored in the present manuscript . on the one hand , it would be very interesting to attempt to understand the stability properties of the different breather states from a more mathematical perspective , although this may admittedly prove a fairly difficult task . \n on the other hand , from the modeling and computation perspective in conjunction with experimental progress , the present work paves the way for potentially augmenting these systems into higher dimensional setups and attempting to realize discrete soliton as well as more complex discrete vortex states therein  @xcite . \n such studies will be deferred to future publications . \n f.p . and j.c . \n acknowledges sponsorship by the spanish micinn under grant no . \n fis2008 -

{"ContextTokens": 2106, "GeneratedTokens": 113, "SynthesizedBody": "the concept of an optical light shining through the wall ( lsw ) experiment has been adapted to microwaves as described in @xcite . a block diagram of the setup at cern as it has been used to search for axion like particles ( alps ) with microwaves is shown in fig . \n [ fig : ovrblock ] , it consists of two identical microwave cavities with a loaded quality factor of @xmath0 and a spacing between them of less than 20  mm . \n one serves as alp emitter and is excited by 50  w of rf power on its resonant frequency @xmath1  ghz . \n it develops a strong electromagnetic ( em ) field , corresponding to a large number of microwave photons @xmath2 . \n these can convert to alps by the primakoff effect @xcite . \n alps do not interact with matter and propagate towards the detection cavity , which is connected to a very sensitive microwave receiver . \n the reciprocal conversion process transforms alps back to microwave photons , which can be observed as an excitation of the seemingly empty and well shielded detection cavity . \n since there is no energy loss associated with the alp conversion process , the signal from the detection cavity would be observable at exactly the frequency @xmath3 , making a narrowband receiving concept feasible . \n in this section , we give an overview of the critical engineering challenges , which were encountered during the realization of the microwave based lsw experiment :    electromagnetic shielding : :    shielding is required around the detecting cavity and the microwave    receiver to eliminate ambient electromagnetic interference ( emi ) and    to mitigate coupling to the emitting cavity by electromagnetic    leakage . \n this would generate false positive results , as a signal    originating from leakage can not be discriminated against an alp    signal . within 2 cm , the field strength must be reduced by at least a    factor of @xmath4 to obtain    meaningful results and avoid degradation of alp sensitivity . \n most    microwave components used in the setup like sma connectors or    semi - rigid coaxial cables provide less than 120 db of shielding ,    making an external shielding enclosure and strategic use of optical    fibres for signal transmission necessary . with the current setup , over    300 \n db shielding effectiveness has been achieved @xcite . \n detection of weak signals : :    the smallest detectable signal power during the alps run in june 2013    is    @xmath5  dbm  @xmath6 \n w  @xmath7  photons / s .    as the experiment is carried out at room temperature , the thermal    noise * density * is @xmath8  dbm / hz . a very    narrow band filter can be implemented to detect the sinusoidal signal    within the background noise . \n it is realized by a discrete fourier    transformation over the entire recorded time trace of length    @xmath9  h. each resulting spectral bin will respond to    signals within its resolution bandwidth , given by    @xmath10 . as noise power scales    linearly with resolution bandwidth and \n signal power stays constant , we    achieve a signal to noise ratio improvement proportional to    measurement time . to keep the filter on the right center frequency \n , a    global 10  mhz reference clock is used to phase lock all oscillators    involved in the downmixing chain . \n this detection method has been    successfully demonstrated with resolution bandwidths down to    10  @xmath11hz in @xcite . keeping the cavities on tune \n : :    for an exclusion result , it is necessary to prove that the detector is    working and that a potential alp signal could not have been concealed . \n detection sensitivity will be limited if the resonant frequency of any    of the cavities does not equal the system frequency    @xmath12 within its 3  db bandwidth . \n the resonant    frequency of the cavities can drift due to thermal expansion . for the    emitting cavity , \n the reflected rf power was monitored to ensure it is    on resonance during the whole measurement run . for the detecting    cavity , \n its thermal noise density was measured before and after the    recording of experimental data , indicating its resonant frequency . \n compatibility with magnetic fields : :    as the shielding enclosure and the cavities have to be placed in a    strong magnetic field for alp measurements , they need to be    constructed from non - ferromagnetic materials like aluminium or brass . \n this is to prevent field distortion and to avoid strong attractive    forces during insertion of the setup into the magnet . \n some electronic    components like the low noise amplifier and the analog optical    transmitter need to be placed as close as possible to the detection    cavity . \n therefore special precautions had to be taken to ensure they    operate reliably within the magnetic field . \n for example , ferrite or    iron cored inductors or transformers had to be avoided as the material    saturates and changes its magnetic properties in strong magnetic    fields . \n r0.5 [ fig : exclsignal ]        the most sensitive measurement run for alps has been carried out in june 2013 in cooperation with the brain & behaviour laboratory of geneva university . \n we were able to operate the setup within the bore of a superconducting magnet , which is part of an mri scanner . \n it provides a solenoid - like field of @xmath13  t. over the course of one weekend , 2  x  10  h of experimental data were recorded . as no alps were detected , the corresponding exclusion limits in comparison to other experiments are shown in fig .  2 . \n for diagnostic purposes , a sinusoidal signal of known frequency is emitted within the shielding enclosure . \n this `` test tone '' of relatively low and constant power ( @xmath14  dbm ) couples from a @xmath15 antenna to the detection cavity and to the components of the receiver frontend . by identifying the signal in the recorded spectrum , \n we demonstrate that the entire signal processing chain was operational during the measurement . \n this also allows to evaluate unwanted frequency offsets , frequency drifts , or phase noise by comparing shape and position of the measured signal peak to the expected one . \n furthermore , as long as the test tone signal is observed with constant power during the measurement run , it qualifies that the em shielding performance has not degraded . \n figure  3 shows the resulting power spectrum from the measurement run . \n the test tone signal is visible as a single peak , clearly above the noise floor , spanning only one single bin . \n a frequency window ( shaded green ) has been defined with a width of @xmath16 , around the frequency where an alp signal would be expected . \n the peaks within this window do not exceed the detection threshold of @xmath17  w , allowing us to set an exclusion limit for alps .    in order to define the detection threshold , the histogram of @xmath18 frequency bins  containing exclusively spectral background noise \n was evaluated . \n @xmath19 was set such , that only in 1% of all measurement runs , a single peak signal above the detection threshold would appear within the wisp window , resulting in a false positive outcome of the experiment . \n [ fig : resultspect ]    , no alp signal is visible above the detection threshold.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] \n profiting from the high mobility and ruggedness of a microwave based lsw experiment ( compared to optical setups ) , we were able to successfully deploy and operate the apparatus within a 3  t mri magnet . \n over the course of one weekend sufficient experimental data was recorded to achieve comparable sensitivity to first generation optical lsw experiments ( e.g. , alps-1 at desy ) . \n sensitivity could be further enhanced with a stronger magnet . \n there is a recent trend towards 7  t mri systems in medical research , which might provide us an opportunity for a follow up alps measurement . \n furthermore , sensitivity can be enhanced with larger and thus lower frequency cavities . \n one might think of a lsw setup consisting of 200  mhz sps standing wave cavities @xcite within the 3  t m1 magnet @xcite at cern . + \n special thanks to s.  w.  rieger and the brain & behaviour laboratory of geneva university , for making the mri magnet accessible to us on weekends . \n the authors would like to thank r.  jones , e.  jensen and the be department management for encouragement and support . \n thanks to the organizers of the patras workshop for a very enjoyable and inspiring conference . supported by the wolfgang -

based gravitational wave detectors . \n the predicted burst gravitational waves have a some peculiar characteristics : type i ) big narrow spike of @xmath21 msec and following 10 - 15 msec decay ringing , type ii ) a few msec spikes iterate a few times with @xmath210 msec interval , type iii ) broad excess of @xmath25 msec with fine structure of @xmath21 msec . \n the predicted burst gravitational waves have a duration and tail of signals . \n since the tail structure and frequency spread is not same as popular spike noises which caused by the detector instruments , it will be possible to differentiate the gravitational waves from noises . \n however , it is hard to predict the gravitational wave forms in analytically or hard to fit with a few parameters .    to identify such a signal , \n we have developed a new method by examining clustering of signal powers in time - frequency domain@xcite . \n we study using tama observation data and numerical predicted gravitational waveforms by dimmelmeier at al.@xcite@xcite    in some other time - frequency domain analysis , which especially use cluster , were studied as reference @xcite , to find efficient power filter window . \n our practical issue is employment much more parameters and find efficient combinations of parameters . \n tama300 is a 300 m baseline laser interferometric gravitational wave detector in mitaka , tokyo , japan@xcite . \n the interferometer is fabry - perot - michelson type with a power recycling technique . \n the strain sensitivity of the detector is @xmath3}$ ] around 1khz , and the integral observation time is more than 3000 hours@xcite@xcite@xcite . \n the typical strain sensitivity of tama detector in 9th data taking ( dt9 ) is displayed in figure 3 of the reference @xcite . \n gravitational waves from stellar - core collapse of supernovae , or quasi - normal mode oscillation of black holes , has the typical time scale 10@xmath2100 msec . \n it corresponds to the good sensitive observation band 100hz@xmath21khz of ground - based gravitational wave detectors as tama300 . \n the time series signal from the tama interferometer is digitized by analogue - to - digital converter of 16 bit depth . \n the sampling interval is 50@xmath4sec(=20khz sampling ) . \n the raw data as time series signal @xmath5 is stored in frame format@xcite . \n one data file consists from 20 frames , and each frame is 3.2768 sec time series signal . for the convenient of the event search analysis , we repack raw data frames into new frame of 52.4288 sec data for @xmath6 samples . for this analysis , we use part of dt9 real data which has good stableness and better sensitivity . \n to investigate the search performance for burst gravitational wave , we used predicted burst gravitational waves by dimmelmeier et al.@xcite@xcite ( dfm waveforms ) . \n we inject dfm waveform by software ( off - line injection ) on tama data . \n since this signal @xmath5 is given after the detector response , electric servo and whitening filter , we convert dfm waveform from strain @xmath7 to @xmath5 using transfer function , and embed to raw data . \n also gaussian noise simulation data is used . since real data \n include many unstable spikes or glitch noises which have short time duration , these will make spurious signals of gravitational waves . \n gaussian noise simulation data need to evaluate the statistical fluctuation of stable noises .      before transforming the time series data to time - frequency domain \n , we remove the line noises which come from ac power line and its harmonics , mechanical resonances of suspension , etc . \n the detail is given in the references@xcite@xcite . \n we split time series data to 3.2 msec chunks . \n time shift of next chunk is 0.8 msec , thus the neighbor chunks overlap 2.4 msec . \n the figure [ fig : tchunks ] displays this process . for each of the chunks , signal powers are calculated by using fft ( short - time fourier transform , sfft ) with a hanning window . \n the frequency resolution in the sffts is 312.5hz . \n we dispose these sffts in time order , which is called sonogram in time - frequency domain . \n one bin of data of time - frequency domain is displayed as pixel. each pixel represents the signal power at a given time and a frequency . \n sfft spectrum at each frequency band is normalized using average noise . \n thus the sonogram will appear as flat pixels with gaussian noise . \n the figure [ fig : sfft1 ] and [ fig : sfft2 ] are examples of sonogram of tama data around spike like noise , and typical dfm waveform injected in the tama300 data . \n sonogram illustrate the pixel magnitude using color . \n short - fft ( sonogram ) process schematic , width=377 ]     sonogram example : tama spike like noise + spike noises spread entire the frequency band , but concentrate in short time duration.,width=453 ]     sonogram example : burst gravitational wave ( dfm waveform ) injected tama data + typical dfm waves not widely spread in frequency , but have a tail along the time axes.,width=453 ] \n in time - frequency domain sonogram , we can find a closed pixels of which have higher magnitude in the figure [ fig : sfft2 ] as cluster of signal .    to identify and define a cluster are as follows : \n 1 ) we find all pixel which magnitude exceed signal - to - noise ratio @xmath8 . \n 2 ) we assume that a local maximum pixel is a peak of the cluster . \n the peak specified with its time @xmath9 and frequency @xmath10 . \n 3 ) if one of a 8 pixels around the peak of the cluster exceed the cluster threshold , this pixel is connected pixel . \n the cluster threshold is settled as square root of snr of the peak pixel . \n 4 ) we check the neighbor of connected pixels , again . \n 5 ) if no more connected pixel can not be found , we define the peak and these connected pixels as one tf - cluster. 6 ) we will iterate 2)-5 ) exclude the pixel which belongs to previous cluster , for other local peak .      when the cluster found , we calculate some parameters which shows cluster character . each cluster can be characterized by the absolute power , spread area , shape of power distribution et al . \n figure [ fig : cluster_profile ] displays the schematic of projection of the cluster to each axes . \n we can project the cluster by the numbers of pixels , or integrated magnitude of pixels along the orthogonal axes . \n we employ following parameters to quantitate the shape of the projection ; the number of pixels in the cluster for area @xmath11 , the sum of a magnitude of pixels for cluster volume @xmath12 , @xmath13 as @xmath14-th moment of projection of area ( = the numbers of pixels ) along the time axes , @xmath15 as @xmath14-th moment of projection of magnitude along the time axes , @xmath16 as same as a @xmath13 along the frequency axes , @xmath17 as same as a @xmath15 along the frequency axes . \n ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) is a mean center of the cluster area , and ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) is a center of magnitude of the cluster . \n higher orders @xmath13 corresponds to the standard deviation , skewness et al . \n tf - cluster and its projection to each axes . \n + the pixels inside white border is recognized as one cluster.,width=377 ] \n some combinations of the parameters makes possible to separate gravitational wave signal from many noises . \n the figure [ fig : paramscatt1 ] and [ fig : paramscatt2 ] shows the example of two combination which efficiently separate the gaussian noise from the dfm wave forms .    in case of figure \n [ fig : paramscatt1 ] ( @xmath19 - @xmath22 scatter plot ) , injected dfm wave forms concentrate within the box of blue solid line . however , many tama noises spread wider region . \n most of tama noises are spike noises . \n one can see that the dfm waveforms can be efficiently separated from spike noises in the figure . on the other , \n the figure [ fig : paramscatt2 ] shows the separation from gaussian noises . \n gaussian noises will make spurious clusters accidentally according to the statistical fluctuations . almost of them have small size , and parameters correlation is different from spike noise of gravitational waves . in this @xmath23 - @xmath24 scatter plot , both spike noises and dfm waveforms concentrate in the blue circle .    in this study , we require all the criteria in the table [ table : criteria ] for the selection of burst gravitational wave candidates . \n c l c parameters & brief meaning & criteria + & & ( unit is [ pixels ] except for @xmath10 ) + @xmath11 & area size of the cluster & @xmath25 + @xmath10 & frequency at the peak of the cluster & @xmath26}$ ] +   +   + @xmath19 & distance from center to the to the peak & @xmath27 + @xmath22 & standard deviation around @xmath19 & @xmath28 + @xmath29 & kurtosis around power weighted center @xmath21 & @xmath30 +   +   + @xmath20 & distance from weighted center to the to the peak & @xmath31 + @xmath32 & standard deviation around @xmath20 & @xmath33 +   +   + @xmath34 & & @xmath35 +   + @xmath36 & & @xmath37 +    [ default ]     scatter plot of cluster parameters @xmath19 -

carlo simulation with random injection of the dfm gravitational waves in tama data . the figure fig : distvseff shows the efficiency for tf - clusters of source distance from the earth . \n the efficiency depend on the type of burst waveform . \n also the figure fig : hrssvseff shows the efficiency for @xmath38 : root square sum of strain amplitude . the selection criteria for clusters which peak snr@xmath13 achieved 50% average efficiency for injected dfm waveforms at 350 pc ( @xmath0 ) for type i burst@xcite , and at 170 pc for all average . \n we take note that the efficiency looks higher than previous our analysis@xcite , because we set lower snr threshold for the comparison of clusters . \n if we wish to derive better upper limit of event search , we must set more higher threshold of snr to reject small spurious noise . \n tf - cluster selection efficiency for injected dfm waveforms ( source distance),width=377 ]     tf - cluster selection efficiency for injected dfm waveforms ( @xmath38),width=377 ]      tf - cluster selection criteria can reject typical noises efficiently in real data . using a part of tama dt9 data ( @xmath39 ) , we compare the snr histogram of peak before and after cluster parameter selection . the reduction for spurious event clusters by spike noises \n are more than one order improvement for the snr@xmath1100 . \n the reduction is efficient for higher snr clusters for snr@xmath1200 . because that tf - cluster method is efficient when the waveform is clear . \n histogram of snr for real data + histogram of cluster snr is shown for a part of tama dt9 data . \n green dashed line is all found cluster in tf domain . \n red line is after the selection by criteria in the table [ table : criteria].,width=377 ] \n we recently practice the newer search algorithm as tf - cluster using many cluster parameters . \n the method is efficient to select gravitational event and reject noise fake , especially in larger snr case . \n since the tf - cluster method is not require the exact template of wave form , it is useful to identify the burst gravitational waves which we believe only the typical characteristics is knows , or which predicted numerically without analytic waveform .    in the sonogram of this analysis \n , we employed sfft , which has uniform time and frequency resolution . \n however , this is not optimal time - frequency resolution in an uncertainty principle of short wave packet . according to the complemental relation between the time and the frequency \n , we can improve time resolution in high frequency band , can improve frequency resolution in lower frequency band instead of time resolution . \n we began to employ with wavelet transform to achieve such resolution and to make more clear appearance of burst gravitational waves . \n this research is supported in part by a grant -
