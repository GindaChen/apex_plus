Amazon Go allows shoppers to simply take whatever they want to purchase and leave, eliminating the need for lines or cashiers. The concept store is slated to open Monday on the company's Seattle campus after the original launch planned for early 2017 was postponed due to problems with the technology, CNBC reports. According to the store's website, the shopping experience at Amazon Go begins with an app customers scan on their phones to enter the store. \"Then just browse and shop like you would at any other store,\" the site says. \"Once you\u2019re done shopping, you\u2019re on your way! No lines, no checkout.\" Rachel Metz of MIT Technology Review writes that Amazon Go \"might take some getting used to\" for customers. The 1,800-square-foot store uses \"computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning\" that Amazon says is akin to tech found in new driverless cars. It all makes for a very hands-off experience on the part of store employees. It \"feels a little weird,\" writes Metz, adding that the experience was \"seamless and quick,\" if \"unnerving\" with so little human interaction. In addition to questions about user experience, some have wondered about what sort of impact Amazon Go might have on the workforce. CNBC notes that some 900,000 cashier jobs in the US are in grocery stores, all jobs that could become unnecessary should Amazon's concept catch on. For now, Amazon said it has no plans to implement the technology in its recently acquired Whole Foods stores.", "StartTimeOffset": 423699227829, "RequestID": "22bbf5c152364d21aaa5d882b7912e68", "TotalTokens": 942}

AJ proved himself on the field, making 62 tackles and earning Big Sky Defensive Player of the Week honors after the Vikings beat Eastern Washington in November. He was also an \"incredible leader\" who \"busted his rear end, day after day,\" and was \"always humble, nice, classy, appreciative,\" a PSU social studies teacher tells the Portland Tribune. Other tributes are coming in from officials at the school, where James Schlatter was an assistant football coach and AJ's mother, Terri Jo, is in the athletics hall of fame for her time with the volleyball team. \"Things like this aren't supposed to happen,\" says PSU athletic director Mark Rountree. \"[AJ] will be missed.\" (A tonsillectomy-gone-wrong features prominently in the high-profile case of Jahi McMath.)", "StartTimeOffset": 1371144637760, "RequestID": "f41f9893d382492d8ba554bd660bd560", "TotalTokens": 1322}

That's the claim being made in a lawsuit filed by two New Yorkers who visited Los Angeles earlier this month, My News LA reports. The 45-foot-long \"Skyslide\" opened last month on the side of the US Bank Tower, running between the 70th and 69th floors nearly 1,000 feet above the street, notes the AP. Gayle Yashar, 57, claims she broke her ankle while coming down the Skyslide July 3; she's suing for negligence, while her co-plaintiff and husband, Morty Yashar, is suing for loss of consortium. Her lawyer says you can hear her ankle crack on video taken during her ride. The couple is seeking unspecified damages from OUE Skyspace LLC, which owns the building. The lawsuit claims the slide's design doesn't allow riders to slow down before it ends. It also states that mats stacked near the end of the slide \"increased the risk of serious injury for an ankle fracture which was far beyond the risk assumed by the uninformed and unsuspecting riders.\" (Slide down this sand dune and it will start \"singing.\")", "StartTimeOffset": 1384359279497, "RequestID": "aaa9671bd4404f23aefdd36d9c0f8030", "TotalTokens": 1077}

Officials say the man was found in the 100-foot-deep gap Thursday after he succeeded in making an emergency call from his cellphone following numerous failed attempts because of poor reception, the AP reports. The man had been reported missing by his father Saturday on the rugged Dachstein range southeast of the city of Salzburg. State broadcaster ORF cites an alpine rescue official as saying the man is only \"relatively lightly hurt\" considering the drop, with shoulder and foot injuries. Deutsche Welle, which notes the poor weather and risk of avalanches made rescuers' efforts more difficult, documents how police first found the man's car near a lake at the foot of the mountain Wednesday night. He'd been trying to make calls from his phone, and finally one call went through, though only for a few seconds. A quick-thinking member of the rescue team switched communications over to texting, at which point the man was able to relay to them where he was. \"We would not have found him otherwise,\" another rescuer says. The man was flown by helicopter to a nearby hospital after the early morning rescue. He's not being identified due to Austrian privacy laws.", "StartTimeOffset": 1388528342501, "RequestID": "c564337ae9084defb0232c4f0a2a7035", "TotalTokens": 841}
