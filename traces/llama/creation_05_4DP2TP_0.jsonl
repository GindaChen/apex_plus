One employee tells WSOC that the room \"erupted in emotion,\" with people \"crying\" and \"yelling,\" partly because a deputy on staff had recently been lost to suicide. After the meeting, the EMS workers banded together with other EMS workers across the state, as well as local firefighters and retired law enforcement members, to protest Bronson's words. Per WIS, the head of an EMS crisis management group called Bronson's remarks \"absolutely appalling,\" \"insensitive,\" \"unprofessional,\" and \"childish,\" especially to a group of workers \"who deal with death and crisis situations every day.\" Per Quorum Columbia, Bronson tried to apologize Friday in an email, noting he'd lost someone close to him to suicide, but he submitted his resignation Monday, acknowledging the \"horrible and terrible thing\" he'd said.

Instead of making it to South Africa, he lived as a hostage until June 26 of this year.

As the New York Times recounts, Gustafsson says he and the others stopped counting the number of times they were moved once that count hit 100. They were initially blindfolded, bound, and forced to make ransom videos in Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits. That all changed four months in once the men decided to convert to Islam. For their remaining time in captivity (Rijke was released in April 2015, McGown in August), they lived alongside their captors in a situation Gustafsson likened to \"a prison sentence and Robinson Crusoe.\" He tried to escape once, and spent two nights walking through the desert before being recaptured. Sweden's foreign minister says diplomatic efforts eventually prevailed; a source disputes that, telling the Times $4.2 million made its way to the captors via a South African charity.

But, as of Wednesday, it had melted so much that it now falls a hair below the height of the mountain's northern peak, the New York Times reports. Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University, says she's \"surprised\" by the rapid melt-off (about 13 feet during July), per NBC News, \"even though it has been ridiculously warm.\" Once towering 6,892.4 feet, the southern peak was down to 6,879.2 feet as of Friday, per Business Insider. The northern peak measures at 6,879.3 feet. Rosqvist, speaking to a local Swedish paper, says the melting glacier is symbolic of climate change, per the Times. When first measured in 1880, the southern peak was more than 6,965 feet tall. Since 1995, it has shrunk about 3 feet per year. Still, the southern tip is expected to gain back a bit of lost height during the winter, and the title of highest point may vacillate between the southern and northern peaks in years to come. One consequence of the melting southern peak is that climbers may now opt to tackle the northern peak so they can say they climbed to the highest point in Sweden, a rescue worker tells the Times. And, he says, that peak is \"much harder to climb\" due to the topography. Record heat has also affected Sweden's reindeer herders, causing a lack of vegetation and snow melt that makes it so \"not even the reindeer can find a place to get relief from the sun,\" Rosqvist says.", "StartTimeOffset": 674699202936, "RequestID": "e268dc47c0bd41a6a661576453d4420c", "TotalTokens": 1404}

The UK woman became estranged from her mother in 1978 when Ilott, at 17, went to live with her boyfriend, who ultimately became her husband. In 2002, Ilott's mother, Melita Jackson, made her last will, specifically noting that Ilott had been disinherited and instructing executors to fight any claim Ilott might attempt to make on the estate. Jackson died in 2004, leaving the majority of her $600,000 estate to animal charities. In 2007, Ilott challenged the will under the Inheritance Act, which allows a child to sue if a parent's will does not reasonably provide for their maintenance, per the Evening Standard. She argued she had been \"unreasonably\" excluded and that she, now a mother of five herself, was living on state benefits because she had no pension. A district judge awarded her about $60,000 of the estate. Quite a bit of back-and-forth followed, per the BBC: Ilott then tried to get more of the money, leading a High Court judge to reverse the district judge's decision, awarding Ilott nothing. In 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled she should get some of the money, but in 2014, again battling to get more of the money, the High Court denied her. The following year, however, she won a challenge at the Court of Appeal, which heard testimony that she couldn't even afford clothes for her children, and was awarded about $200,000. But three of the animal charities that were named in Jackson's will then challenged that increase, and now the Supreme Court has ruled in their favor.

What interested researchers, however, was that those who posted photos and updates most often felt pressure to be a perfect mom, sought validation, and considered motherhood to be an important part of their identity, reports Mashable. A key indicator was using a baby photo as a profile picture\u2014which almost 80% of study participants did.

A bullet hit the female passenger, who is three months pregnant, in her left eye. Police say her husband turned the vehicle around, pulled over, and asked a bystander to call police. He then rushed to a nearby hospital escorted by a police officer. Once there, the victim was airlifted to another hospital for emergency surgery, but the details of her condition and that of her unborn child aren't known. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office says the confrontation \"appears to have been unprovoked\u2026so it's unclear why someone in the suspect's vehicle resorted to an act of violence.\" Authorities are still searching for a suspect.

The Survivor producer's Mexican trial for Monica Burgos' murder has finally wrapped up after stretching on for nearly three years. Prosecutors argued Beresford-Redman killed his wife in their room at Cancun's Moon Palace resort on the morning of April 5, 2010, then hid her body in the room until evening, when he deposited it in a cistern, about 75 yards away. The judge's verdict is expected sometime next spring, and Beresford-Redman could face 30 years in prison if convicted. But as the Hollywood Reporter explains, the case is hardly cut and dried. Coroner's tale: Evidence gathered from Burgos' body doesn't support the prosecution's argument. As her body showed no evidence of lividity\u2014the bluish marks left by exposure to a hard surface, like in a hotel room\u2014a coroner said Burgos likely died at the cistern itself. The coroner also determined Burgos died at around 11pm on April 5, not that morning. Missing evidence: Police didn't complete a rape kit on Burgos and didn't test under her fingernails, though the state claimed scratches on Beresford-Redman's neck indicated a fight. The prosecution later said much of its evidence was \"lost\" or damaged by mold and water. It also turned out that blood samples prosecutors said were taken from the hotel room and a railing outside didn't belong to Burgos or Beresford-Redman. Witnesses recant: Hotel employees who said they'd seen the couple fighting later said Beresford-Redman wasn't the man they'd seen. A worker testified that a British family had complained\u2014in a handwritten note\u2014of a woman's screams coming from the couple's hotel room, but no official statement was ever taken from the family. Expert opinion: A forensic scientist and criminologist hired by Beresford-Redman's Mexican defense attorney said Burgos was likely killed by two people familiar with the layout of the hotel. He also found no evidence tying Beresford-Redman to the crime. An expert for the prosecution and an independent forensic expert brought in by the judge couldn't link him to it either.

The feud \"deteriorated into a fistfight,\" police said today, and one of the men eventually shot the other in the head with an air gun\u2014multiple times, the AP notes. The victim survived; the attacker could be in prison for a decade, RIA Novosti adds. Police arrested a 36-year-old woman after she allegedly stabbed another woman at a birthday party; the 21-year-old victim was apparently dancing with the attacker's boyfriend, RIA Novosti reports. The alleged attacker \"took a knife, approached the dancing woman, and stabbed her twice,\" investigators say. The victim died in the hospital. A guilty verdict could mean 15 years in prison for the suspect. A man has been convicted of killing his mother, brother, and father in a cemetery. They were reportedly living in the graveyard after he evicted them, and when his mother accused him of the eviction, he hit her. His brother stepped in, and the man ended up stabbing both of them\u2014and killing his father, who'd seen the attack.

Authorities found remains of another possible Reece victim in the same area just this week. His attorney says Reece, who's in poor health, is trying to avoid death row. \"I'm just sorry it had to be 19 years and it's for his own benefit, not because he truly has a conscience,\" says a former police chief who helped convict Reese. \"After 19 years, he decided to help these families.

Jackson County Sheriff Tony Boggs said the girl died of her injuries at a hospital Wednesday, the AP reports. Benjamin Taylor of Cottageville was charged Monday with first-degree sexual assault; an additional charge is pending. Taylor is the boyfriend of the victim's mother but is not the child's father. According to a criminal complaint, the baby, IDed by WSAZ as Emmaleigh Barringer, had extensive bleeding and a body temperature of 90 degrees. The complaint says the injuries indicated a violent sexual assault, as well as shaking or striking of the face. Taylor, 32, told deputies he took the baby to the basement of an apartment while doing laundry. He said he \"blacked out\" and didn't know how the baby's injuries occurred. Boggs says the mother hasn't been accused of being involved with the crime, and Emmaleigh's siblings appear to be unharmed, per WSAZ. \"The only way justice is going to be served is if [Taylor] feels every ounce of pain that he caused her,\" a cousin of the baby's mother says, with KTRK adding the family is calling Taylor a monster.

The lawsuit claims the slide's design doesn't allow riders to slow down before it ends.
