In what the study in Gender Issues describes as a \"low violation\" scenario, the male asks to borrow a pen; in the \"high violation\" or \"disconcerting\" scenario, he suggests she try modeling and asks to take her photo. The women were then asked a series of questions, including whether they would comply; most said yes to the pen and no to the photo, regardless of how attractive the man was. But they also ranked each man as to how friendly, ambitious, mean, rude, and creepy (and more) he was. In the low-violation case, both men's personalities were perceived to be similar. But in the modeling scenario, \"the perceptions of the facially attractive male's personality were significantly less negative ... than the perceptions of (the) facially unattractive male's personality.\" As researcher Jeremy Gibson puts it, \"The unattractive male is tolerated up to a point; his unattractiveness is OK until he misbehaves.\" The researchers call it a \"double\" devil effect, Science Daily reports: The bad behavior and the unattractiveness combine, and the negative perception is magnified. This has real-world implications, says researcher Jonathan Gore. \"A man who stands trial has already shown himself to have violated social norms in one way or another.

In a caption for the YouTube video he posted about the incident, entitled, \"How to pay a speeding ticket\" (it's already racked up more than 1 million views), Sanders notes he was convicted for going 39mph in a 30mph zone, that he's \"not a big fan of extortion,\" and that he had to pay the $212 (plus a processing fee) facing \"the barrel of a gun\" (which we're assuming is metaphorical). The video shows Sanders unrolling the approximately 22,000 one-cent pieces he retrieved from a local bank and dumping them into two large buckets labeled \"Extortion Money,\" per Today.com. He lugged the buckets to the city's municipal court, where he proceeded to unload his coinage onto a clerk's counter. The New York Daily News says it took the clerks three hours to count and roll the pennies back up. \"It felt really great,\" Sanders says, per NBC. The kicker to his stunt, which technically isn't illegal, is that he overpaid: The city now owes him a grand total of $7.81, though he says he's cool with them holding onto the change. \"I'm just going to go ahead and let them keep that,\" he notes.

The Guardian reports that all but about 20% of the victims are typically elderly, and Japan Today earlier reported that the six people who were taken to Tokyo-area hospitals on Thursday ranged in age from their 50s to their 90s. The sticky rice cakes are generally added to \"ozouni\" soup over the holidays, but they can also be toasted and wrapped in dried seaweed. The country's police and fire services advise the elderly to cut the mochi into small pieces and never eat it alone. In a 2011 look at the \"silent killer,\" the Wall Street Journal explained why the elderly are more susceptible to mochi-related deaths, which it describes as the leading cause of food-related suffocation: Age chips away at their \"mastication abilities and saliva secretion,\" making it easier for a bite of the glutinous cake to get lodged in the throat.

In 2002, Ilott's mother, Melita Jackson, made her last will, specifically noting that Ilott had been disinherited and instructing executors to fight any claim Ilott might attempt to make on the estate. Jackson died in 2004, leaving the majority of her $600,000 estate to animal charities. In 2007, Ilott challenged the will under the Inheritance Act, which allows a child to sue if a parent's will does not reasonably provide for their maintenance, per the Evening Standard. She argued she had been \"unreasonably\" excluded and that she, now a mother of five herself, was living on state benefits because she had no pension. A district judge awarded her about $60,000 of the estate. Quite a bit of back-and-forth followed, per the BBC: Ilott then tried to get more of the money, leading a High Court judge to reverse the district judge's decision, awarding Ilott nothing. In 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled she should get some of the money, but in 2014, again battling to get more of the money, the High Court denied her. The following year, however, she won a challenge at the Court of Appeal, which heard testimony that she couldn't even afford clothes for her children, and was awarded about $200,000.

The new guidelines are in line with Sessions' strong advocacy for law enforcement, and in contrast to the efforts of the Obama administration, which entered into more than a dozen of these decrees to help solidify relationships between police and their communities. \"This memo will make the Justice Department much less effective in enforcing civil rights laws,\" a former DOJ civil rights attorney tells the Times.
