{"ContextTokens": 2627, "GeneratedTokens": 239, "SynthesizedBody": "the problem of galaxy formation is a central problem of cosmology . \n recent pogresses , both from the theoretical side and the observational side , have triggered numerous works . \n the most dramatic changes are probably the ability to have access to direct information at high redshift : the hi gas , the star formation rate , the possible detection of an infrared background originating from early galaxies @xcite as well as the direct spectroscopy of high redshift field galaxies provide a number of observational constraints to which theories can now be confronted . \n the model we present has a amazing small number of free parameters , and still reproduces quite well several key observational constraints . \n it is generally believed that structure formation originated accordingly to the gravitational instability picture . \n structures which achieved a high contrast density , namely greater than 200 , are called virialized . \n properties of clusters of galaxies can actually be used as useful constraints on cosmological scenarios @xcite . \n the dynamics of dark matter seems to be understood well enough that the basic time evolution of the correlation function and the mass function of cosmic structures can be described at any redshift provide that the power spectrum of the primordial fluctuations is known ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n first attempts to address the question of galaxy formation has met a first important apparent success : it has been suggested that a criteria to differentiate dark halos leading to galaxies from those leading to clusters is the cooling criteria . \n when gas falls in a potential it is shock - heated ( and/or by adiabatic compression ) up to the virial temperature allowing the gas to be in hydrostatic equilibrium . \n numerical simulations has confirmed @xcite that this simple argument provides an accurate estimation of the actual temperature : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total mass in unit of @xmath3 of the object forming at redshift @xmath4 . \n the typical size of the halo is : @xmath5 when the gas reaches its virial temperature , it has a characteristic cooling time . \n clusters typically represent structures for which the cooling time exceeds the age of the universe , while for galaxies it is much shorter . \n it is tempting therefore to conclude that the cooling criteria can be used as a criteria for star formation : if the gas is able to cool , it will contract in a runaway fashion , which is can end up only by star formation ( as there is not so much cooled gas in the universe ) . \n this argument successfully explains the order of magnitude of the luminosity of the brightest galaxies ( @xmath6 ) . \n the previous scheme has remained a qualtitative picture for a while . \n however , the need for a more quantitative picture has become clear as the amount of data on distant galaxies has increased : from the number counts of faint galaxies to the recent star formation rate versus redshift . \n the first basic difficulty one faces on in the simple cooling scheme is the so - called overcooling problem : at high redshift a large fraction of the baryons lies is small potentials with temperatures in the range @xmath7k in which cooling is extremely efficient . \n consequently , most of the baryons are expected to have been cooled by now . \n this is in clear contradiction with two basic facts : known stars represent only a small fraction of baryons predicted by nucleosynthesis , typically 10% and most of the baryonic content of clusters is still in the gas phase , while most of them should have been cooled . \n both facts suggest that only 10% to 20% of the primordial baryons were actually turn into stars during the cosmic history . \n this problem was first pointed out by blanchard et al . @xcite and cole @xcite . \n a simple estimate of the integrated cooled fraction can be obtained from the mass function of cosmic structures , by noticing that any piece of gas within a halo with @xmath8k should have settled in the cooling region at some earlier epoch @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the mass of halos which have a virial temperature of @xmath11k at redshift @xmath4 . \n the amount of total cooled gas at different redshift is presented in figure [ fig : ftot ] . \n the reality of this overcooling problem is not easy to test by mean of numerical simulations because of resolution limitations \n . however , navarro & steinmetz found that [ eq : ftot ] provide a reasonable approximation and therefore qiute reasonable to believe that the simple based press and schechter argument can be used . \n therefore , the solution of the ovecooling problem implies that the gas have undergone some substantial reheating . \n the fact that the x - ray luminosity of clusters does not scale as predicted by the scaling argument provide a further evidence of a complicated baryon history . \n the existence of a reheating phase of baryons has been advocated in various contexts in galaxy formation scenario . \n for instance , white and frenk @xcite argued that the energy input of supernova from the first generation of stars is able to prevent the cooling of the gas that remains confined in galactic scale halos . \n blanchard et al . \n @xcite suggested a rather different picture : the first objects which form heat the igm to a temperature high enough that most of the gas does not fall in most of the forming potentials in which cooling would have been possible otherwise because of the temperature of the gas . \n this introduces the idea that a key physical quantity controlling galaxy formation is the temperature of the igm , which could be regulated by galaxy formation . \n the basic equation which governs the temperature of the igm in a self - regulated picture is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature of the igm at redshift @xmath4 , @xmath14 is the mass associated to this temperature , @xmath15 is the total energy ouput resulting from star formation ( essentially supernova ) and @xmath16 is the energy fraction which is transferred to the igm and @xmath17 is the cooling function . as the igm is likely to be photo - ionized at the same time that it undergoes the reheating we used the cooling function of a photoionized gas . \n the temperature of the igm versus redshift depends on the value of the efficiency of energy injection to the igm . \n the temperature of the igm is increasing from @xmath11k to reach a maximum value between @xmath18k and @xmath19k at redshift of the order of 3 to 5 depending on the details of the model . \n such a high temperature will easily explain the absence of detected gunn - peterson decreement , even if most of the baryons lies in the igm . \n explaining the existence of lyman-@xmath20 clouds will be certainly challenging for this scenario : they could not be small halos nor large scale fluctuations in the igm \n . a possible explanation might be that they are the extended parts of galactic disks . \n although this model is relatively simple , there are still a number of free parameters . \n the power spectrum as well as the primodial nucleosynthesis value have been left free until now . \n the final important free parameter is the value of @xmath16 . \n @xmath21 means that the energy transfer is 100% efficient for a standard imf ( a higher value could be used , due to a non standard imf or because of extra energy input ) . \n the parameter @xmath16 can be constrained by computing the integrated amount of stars produced . \n the gas which has been cooled can be compared directly the amount of observed hi gas versus redshift : this is presented on figure [ fig : hi ] . \n the models which are presented are those who explained the present amount of stars . at this stage , there are no free parameters other than the power spectrum . \n the standard cdm spectrum do not lead to the right amount of hi versus redshift , while the @xmath22 fits impressively well the observed distribution . \n given the relatively small number of free parameters , this is rather amazing . \n a further step can be obtained by noticing that the hi gas is likely to be the progenitors of present day stars ( or at least of the progenitors of stars in disks ) . assuming that te hi gas is transformed in stars but with some delay \n , we can infer the star formation rate at different redshift and compare it to the one inferred by madau @xcite from the cfrs survey and hdf . \n this is illustrated by figure [ fig : mad ] . \n such modeling is rather crude , but is still rather instructive : we found that the rapid decrease of star formation rate between redshift 1 and 0 is expected in the self - regulated photoionized picture . \n moreover the amplitude can be well reproduced , provide that star formation from cooled hi is delayed by 2 gyr . \n the high redshift star formation rate is not well reproduced : the theoretical model systematically predicted a higher star formation rate . \n it is fundamental to realize that this is due to the fact the madau star formation rate integrated from redshift 5 to 0 can not explain the total amount of present day stars , and therefore either this formation rate has been underestimated or there is an other period of earlier star formation at high redshift ( which is not expected in any of the models presented here ) . \n one of the strongest problem in the galaxy formation history is the so - called overcooling problem . \n it is likely that its solution and consequently the galaxy formation history is connected to the thermal ( and chemical ) history of the igm . \n we have presented a simple global coherent picture of the stars formation history based on the hypothesis of a self - regulating mechanism . \n this simple model impressively succeeds in explaining the whole set of present day observational constraints one can set on galaxy formation theory . \n it is therefore interesting to investigate such a model in more details . \n 99 bartlett , j. , 1997 , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 2927, "GeneratedTokens": 162, "SynthesizedBody": "numerical simulation procedures for designing waveguide couplers to accelerator structures are described in [ 1 ] and an example of its application to the design of the input coupler for the nlc linac is given in [ 2 ] . \n a coupler cavity is designed with the intent of providing a matched connection between a waveguide and a uniform accelerator structure with dimensions corresponding to those of the cell adjacent to the coupler cavity . \n a symmetric structure consisting of two coupler cavities ( with associated waveguides ) connected by a short section of accelerator structure ( typically two cells worth ) is modeled and subjected to a ( let us assume single frequency ) time domain simulation . \n the entire assembly is treated as a single structure with two wave guide ports . \n the coupler cell dimensions are adjusted until an apparent match is achieved , that is , until no reflection is experienced at the ports ( the external matching condition ) . to eliminate the possibility that the match arises from a fortuitous cancellation between forward and backward waves within the accelerator structure , both the amplitude and phase of the accelerating field on the beam axis are observed and required to have the periodicity and phase advance properties appropriate to a pure traveling wave ( the internal matching condition ) . as a check one may add a cell to the accelerator structure and see whether all these conditions are still satisfied . \n it is often the case that accelerator structures are slowly varying rather than uniform , in which case the input and output couplers are matched separately .    in practice the procedure ( we refer to it as the standard procedure ) has been quite time consuming , involving trial and error rather than a systematic procedure to simultaneously satisfy both the internal and external matching conditions . \n another limitation arises from the fact that the method assumes that evanescent bands can be neglected but provides no procedure for demonstrating their absence .    in the next section \n we describe a new simulation procedure which has been found to be much more efficient , and also which provides information about the presence of evanescent bands . \n the basic elements of the method were briefly described in [ 3 ] in connection with the design of a coupler for the zipper structure . \n because it has since replaced the old method for all of our coupler design work , a more complete presentation together with examples will be presented in the following sections . \n as in the case of the old standard procedure one applies a single frequency time domain simulation by driving the input port of a two port structure consisting of an input cavity , an @xmath0 cell periodic structure with period @xmath1 , and an output cavity . \n instead , however , of focusing attention on the s parameters of the structure as a whole , we direct our attention to the simulated accelerating field @xmath2 evaluated along the beam axis . \n we assume a steady state has been reached , so that the subsequent time dependence can be expressed in terms of the complex @xmath3 ( @xmath4 henceforth ) , obtained in the standard way by combining the simulated real fields at two times separated by a quarter period . then from floquet s theorem ( neglecting evanescent bands , losses , and an irrelevant overall phase factor )    @xmath5.\\ ] ]    here @xmath6 is a real positive amplitude function with period @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is a real phase function , periodic except for a cell to cell phase advance @xmath8 . \n thus    @xmath9    @xmath10 is a @xmath11 independent complex reflection coefficient . \n note that one is free to shift @xmath12 by an arbitrary constant with a compensating phase shift in @xmath10 , since the overall phase of @xmath13 is irrelevant . \n this freedom corresponds to the choice of reference plane through some point @xmath14 where we take @xmath15 . \n we now consider the quantities @xmath16    where @xmath17    elementary algebraic manipulation leads to the relations :    @xmath18    @xmath19/[2sin(\\psi)+j\\delta(z)].\\ ] ]    we note that while the rhs of ( 5 ) is formed of @xmath11 dependent complex quantities , it nevertheless turns out to be real and @xmath11 independent . \n similarly the absolute value of the rhs of ( 6 ) is also @xmath11 independent . \n both these results should hold for all `` allowed '' @xmath11 values , i.e. , values such that the three points @xmath20 , @xmath11 , and @xmath21 all lie within the periodic portion of the structure simulated , and together they constitute a powerful constraint on the validity of the floquet representation eq . \n their failure beyond small numerical fluctuations or small deviation from steady state is evidence for the presence of evanescent bands . \n an example will be presented in the section on the zipper structure . \n it is noteworthy that these relations allow one to determine all the properties of the traveling wave solutions , including the functions @xmath7 and @xmath6 from a simulation which contains an arbitrary mixture of forward and backward waves . \n of particular importance is the fact that it gives the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient . \n in contrast to the old standard method , there is here only one matching condition to be satisfied , namely @xmath22 . \n typically match is achieved by varying two parameters in the coupler design . \n once one has determined how the real and imaginary parts of @xmath10 vary with the parameters , one can choose linear combinations of changes which accelerate the process of converging to the origin in the complex @xmath10 plane [ 4 ] . because the phase of @xmath10 does depend upon the position of the reference point relative to the couplers , one naturally keeps it fixed while carrying out this process . \n note that it is the output cavity that is matched by this procedure . while not necessary , it is usually convenient to construct a symmetric mesh . \n the input and output cavities are then the same , and the structure as a whole is matched when @xmath10 vanishes . \n _ ( a ) the nlc four port output coupler _    as an example of the principal features of the new method we use the new nlc four port output coupler cavity [ 5 ] . \n the purpose of the four port design was to provide damping for those dipole modes that reach the end of the structure while also providing an output for the accelerating mode . \n these dipole modes are typically those which had been poorly damped because of decoupling of the last cells from the manifolds . \n the four port symmetry provides damping for both dipole mode polarizations and has the added advantage of eliminating quadrupole distortion of the coupler fields . \n the design simulation was carried out with a three cell periodic structure , and results are illustrated in fig . \n two cases are shown , one matched , the other not . \n the reflection coefficients @xmath23 as computed from eq . \n ( 5 ) for the two cases are shown as functions of @xmath11 . \n the allowed z values are those lying within the central cell , and one sees that for both cases @xmath23 is constant over that range . the real part of @xmath24 is also plotted as a function of @xmath11 . \n one sees that the two values are indeed constant over the allowed range , but contrary to expectations they differ somewhat from each other and from the expected value of one half . \n this is due to the fact that a different and coarser mesh than that used to determine the phase advance parameter was used for the time domain simulations . \n the two cases differ from one another because the parameter variations in the coupler associated with the matching procedure induce small but global changes in the meshing . \n it has been confirmed in a number of cases that there is good agreement between the phase frequency relation determined from single cell periodic boundary condition frequency domain calculations and that determined from the time domain method described here so long as the same mesh is used for both simulations . \n ( 100,200)(-10,15 ) = 7.5 cm    _ ( b ) a photonic band gap ( pbg ) structure _    ( 100,200)(-5,-65 ) = 8.5 cm    a coupler cell very similar to those of the slac structures has been designed for a pbg structure , that is , a cylindrical cell with a pair of symmetrically placed waveguide ports , a conventional beam pipe , and conventional beam iris coupling to the periodic pbg structure . \n the pbg cell structure [ 6 ] is a seven by seven square array of metallic posts aligned in the beam direction and terminated by metallic end plates , the cell cavity being formed by removing the central post . \n a circular aperture in the end plates , identical to that between the coupler cell and the adjacent pbg cell , provides cell to cell coupling and a path for the beam . a perspective representation of the four cell quarter structure used for the simulations is shown in fig . \n ( 2 ) . also shown is the simulated electric field distribution , scaled logarithmically to enhance the visibility of weak field strengths . \n the figure illustrates the effectiveness of the pbg structure in confining the acceleration fields to the interior of the structure . \n the matching procedure worked well , and , as in the four port coupler above , there was no evidence for evanescent band contamination . \n fabrication of an experimental model with 5 coupled pbg cells and complete with couplers is in progress at slac .    _ \n ( c ) the zipper structure _ \n the zipper is a planar accelerator structure described in [ 3 ] . \n a 25 ( counting the coupler cavities ) cell w band model has been built , cold tested , and subjected to bead pull measurements as reported in [ 7 ] . \n the design was governed by a decision to avoid bonded joints involving tiny structure elements such as the vanes which serve as cell boundaries and also form the beam iris . \n the coupler cell is a quarter wave transformer terminating in wr10 waveguide . \n early attempts at matching the coupler using the old standard method failed , and it was this failure which led to the development reported here . matching using this method was accomplished by making use of a time domain simulation of a structure with 22 periodic cells . \n 3 shows the resultant @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath23 plots as computed from eqs . \n ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . \n one sees large deviations from the expected @xmath11 independent behavior as one moves away from the center of the structure . \n this effect indicates a clear violation of eq . \n ( 1 ) . from the fact that the violation fades away as one moves away from the couplers \n indicates that the effect is due to the couplers generating an evanescent band , the nearby monopole band pointed out in [ 3 ] . \n this example demonstrates how the method indicates the presence of evanescent band interference , and also how one can carry out the matching procedure even when it is present . \n ( 100,200)(-5,-62.5 ) = 8.cm \n electrical discharge damage has been commonly observed in the coupler cells of accelerator structures and has been attributed to the field enhancement noted in simulations . \n we have taken advantage of our enhanced matching capability to initiate a study of this long standing problem . \n exploration of the situation for the nlc coupler [ 2 ] showed that the largest enhancement occurred on the coupler side of the aperture of the iris separating the coupler from the adjacent cell with azimuthal maxima opposite the coupler waveguides and azimuthal minima 90 degrees away . \n this observation was consistent with the pattern of discharge damage [ 9 ] . \n it is pointed out in [ 8 ] that the azimuthal variation is due to the quadrupole component introduced by the coupler waveguides and that the enhancement can be reduced by introducing a racetrack like modification of the coupler cell shape designed to eliminate it . \n this effect and its cure have been confirmed in our own studies of the nlc coupler . \n two other modifications have also been explored . \n the simplest and most effective was simply to reduce the radius of the cell adjacent to the coupler . \n the effect for a 2@xmath27 reduction is illustrated in fig . \n 4 where it is seen that the field on the coupler cell iris is significantly less than that on the interior coupling irises . \n an undesirable consequence is a 10 degree phase advance deficiency in the modified cell . \n an even larger field reduction would be obtained by removing the quadrupole enhancement . \n we attribute the reduction to an increase in group velocity . the other modification consisted of enlarging the coupler iris combined with an increase in the adjacent cell

{"ContextTokens": 1755, "GeneratedTokens": 394, "SynthesizedBody": "astronomers will soon have access to unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity in the far - infrared with the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) . \n far - infrared astronomical observations , which are impossible from the ground due to water absorption , are necessary to understand fully a number of important astronomical problems and issues . \n many astrophysical conditions require far - infrared probes because the areas of interest are mostly inaccessible at other wavelengths due to severe extinction from interstellar dust or the physics of interest is only manifest at far - infrared wavelengths \n . in particular , far - infrared spectroscopy , pioneered and developed on sofia s predecessor the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) and greatly extended with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , will provide an injection of important data into astrophysical issues . \n building upon the success of our previous imaging fabry - perot far - infrared spectrometer ( fifi@xcite ) that was designed for the kao , we are developing a successor instrument for sofia : the field - imaging far - infrared line spectrometer ( fifi ls@xcite ) . \n fifi ls will utilize integral field spectral imaging in two wavelength bands : 42 to 110 @xmath2 m and 110 to 210 @xmath2 m . \n this will allow the instrument to simultaneously obtain dual wavelength band , spectral imaging of a 5 @xmath0 5 pixel field , without scanning a fabry - perot or multiple pointings with a long - slit spectrometer . \n thus , fifi ls is designed as a `` major - step '' forward and will take advantage of the unique benefits that sofia offers .    with the increased sensitivity and resolution provided by sofia , the main scientific targets for fifi ls will include the detailed morphological studies of : ( 1 ) the heating and cooling of galaxies , ( 2 ) star formation and the interstellar matter under low - metalicity conditions , as found in dwarf galaxies , ( 3 ) active galactic nuclei and their environment , ( 4 ) merging and interacting galaxies , and ( 5 ) large surveys of nearby galaxies . \n to reach our scientific goals , very high observing sensitivities and efficiencies are essential , requiring a compromise of spectral resolution ; however , for the science objectives listed above , a comparably low spectral resolution ( r @xmath12000 ) is more than sufficient . \n overall , fifi ls on sofia will be more sensitive than the iso long - wavelength spectrometer and have much higher spatial resolution and mapping capabilities . as a future option \n , an extension of the instrument to the 25 - 42 @xmath2 m range is planned upon availability of the si : sb detector arrays developed for sirtf . \n fifi ls achieves 2-dimensional spatial mapping and simultaneous spectral multiplexing by optically slicing , or re - arranging , the 2d field of view onto a single slit , which is then dispersed via a standard long - slit spectrometer . \n this type of `` optical slicer '' was originally devised for laboratory spectroscopy@xcite and later successfully implemented for near - infrared astronomy@xcite , but this is the first time that this technique has been applied in the far - infrared . \n specifically , fifi ls has a 5 @xmath0 5 pixel field of view which is sliced into five individual slitlets , re - arranged into a continuous 25 @xmath0 1 pixel slit , and finally , fed into a grating spectrometer and dispersed onto a 2d 16 @xmath0 25 pixel detector array . \n one of the other unique aspects of fifi ls is its dual - channel nature . by using a dichroic beamsplitter in the entrance optics and two optical slicers , \n fifi ls covers the diffraction - limited field of view simultaneously in two wavelength bands : a short wavelength band 42 to 110 @xmath2 m and a long wavelength band 110 to 210 @xmath2 m . \n fig . 1 shows how the dual channel integral field system is realized in more detail as a projection of the focal plane onto the two detector arrays with diffraction - limited optics . on the right side of the figure \n is the long wavelength channel of the spectrometer which has a pixel scale of 14@xmath5 per pixel . on the left side of the figure \n is the short wavelength channel which has a pixel scale of 7@xmath5 per pixel . \n this of course implies that the shorter wavelength channel has a smaller field of view , as demonstrated in fig . \n overall , this scheme ensures that for all spatial elements in the field , spectra are observed simultaneously in the two bands , thereby increasing observing efficency .

{"ContextTokens": 4032, "GeneratedTokens": 251, "SynthesizedBody": "-5 mm    many problems in biology , chemistry and material science can be formulated as the study of the energy or free energy landscape of the underlying system . \n well - known examples of such problems include the conformational changes of macromolecules , chemical reactions and nucleation in condensed systems . \n very often the dimension of the state space is very large , and the energy landscape exhibits a hierarchy of structures and scales . \n these problems are becoming a major challenge in their respective scientific disciplines and are beginning to receive attention from the mathematics community . in this article , we report recent work in this direction . for a detailed account , we refer to @xcite . \n we begin with a simple example . \n plotted in figure 1 is the solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath0 where the potential @xmath1 and @xmath2 is gaussian white noise , @xmath3 . without the random perturbation , \n the solution would be @xmath4 . \n indeed the deterministic part of dynamics in does nothing but taking the system to local equilibrium states . with the random perturbation , \n the solution , over long time , exhibits completely different behavior . \n it fluctuates around the two local minima of @xmath5 and 1 , with sudden transitions between these two states . \n the time scale of the transition , @xmath6 is much larger than the time scale of the fluctuation around the local minima , @xmath7 . for this reason \n , we refer to @xmath8 and 1 as the metastable states . \n time series of the solution to the stochastic differential equation ( 1.1 ) , with @xmath9 . \n obviously the transition between the metastable states is of more interest than the local fluctuation around them . \n the transition time is much larger since it requires the system to overcome the energy barrier between the two states . \n this is only possible because of the noise . \n when @xmath10 is small , a huge noise term is required to accomplish this . \n for this reason , such events are very rare , and this is the origin of the disparity between the time scales @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n this simple example illustrates one of the major difficulties in modeling such systems , namely the disparity of the time scales . \n it does not , however , illustrate the other major difficulty , namely , the large dimension of the state space and the complexity of the energy landscapes . \n indeed for typical systems of interests the energy landscape can be very complex . \n there can be a huge number of local minima in the state space . \n the usual concept of hopping over barriers via saddle points may not apply ( see @xcite ) .    in applications , \n the noise comes typically from thermal noise . in this case \n , we should note that even though the potential energy landscapes might be rough and contain small scale features , the system itself experiences a much smoother landscape , the free energy landscape , since some of the small scale features on the potential energy landscape are smoothed out by the thermal noise . \n our objective in modeling such systems are the following :    1 .   find the transition mechanism between the metastable states . \n 2 .   find the transition rates . \n 3 .   reduce the original dynamics to the dynamics of a markov chain on the metastable states . \n our discussion will be centered around the following model problems : @xmath11 or @xmath12 @xmath10 is related to the temperature of the system by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant . \n we refer to as type - i gradient flow and as type - ii gradient flow .    before proceeding further , \n let us remark that there is a very well - developed theory , the large - deviation theory , or the wentzell - freidlin theory @xcite , that deals precisely with questions of the type that we discussed above . \n however as was explained in @xcite , this theory is not best suited for numerical purpose . \n therefore we will seek an alternative theoretical framework that is more useful for numerical computations . \n -5 mm    transition state theory ( tst ) @xcite has been the classical framework for addressing the questions we are interested in . \n it assumes the existence and explicit knowledge of a reaction coordinate , denoted by @xmath15 , that connects the two metastable states . \n in addition it assumes that along the reaction coordinate there exists a well - defined transition state , which is typically the saddle point configuration , say at @xmath16 , and the two regions @xmath17 and @xmath18 defines the two metastable regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for these reasons , \n transition state theory is restricted to cases when the system is simple and the energy landscape is smooth , i.e. the energy barriers are larger than the thermal energy @xmath21 .    knowing the transition state \n , tst calculates the transition rates by placing particles at the transition state , and measuring the flux that goes into the two regions . \n for example , the transition rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is given approximately by @xmath22 where @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the surface delta function at @xmath16 , @xmath25 is the heaviside function , @xmath26 is the lebesgue measure restricted to @xmath19 . for a system with a single particle of mass @xmath27 and potential @xmath28 \n , this gives @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy barrier at the transition state , @xmath31 , @xmath32 denotes the location of the local minimum inside @xmath19 . \n formulas such as are the origin of the arrhenius law for chemical reaction rates and boltzmann factor for hopping rates in kinetic monte carlo models . \n -5 mm    for simplicity , we will discuss mainly type - i gradient flows . \n the fokker - planck equation can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the equilibrium distribution @xmath35 @xmath36 is the normalization constant @xmath37 . \n the states of the markov chain consist of the sets @xmath38 , where @xmath38 satisfies    1 . \n the @xmath39 s are mutually disjoint 2 . \n @xmath40    where @xmath41 . \n an illustration of the collection the @xmath38 is given in figure 2 . \n @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 . \n as @xmath43 decreases , the @xmath39 s exhibits a hierarchical structure . \n illustration of the collection of metastable sets @xmath42 at different energies . \n having defined the states of the markov chain , we next compute the transition rates between neighboring states . \n denote by @xmath19 and @xmath20 two such neighboring states . \n we would like to compute the transition rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . without loss of generality \n , we may assume @xmath44 . \n let @xmath45 be the metastable region containing @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , and let @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . applying laplace s method to ( 3.1 ) \n we get @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 is a so - called minimal energy path , to be defined below , @xmath52 is the family of hyperplanes normal to @xmath53 . \n the minimal energy path ( mep ) is defined as follows . if @xmath28 is smooth \n , then @xmath53 is a mep if @xmath54 for all @xmath55 $ ] , i.e. @xmath56 restricted to @xmath53 is parallel to @xmath53 . in general \n there is not a unique @xmath53 that is particularly significant , but rather a collection ( a tube or several tubes ) of paths contribute to the transition rates . \n however , one can define a mep self - consistently via the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 . in the case when @xmath28 has two scales : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is smooth , then @xmath53 can be defined as the mep of @xmath61 .    for type - i gradient systems , if the two metastable sets are separated by a single saddle point , then the mep is the unstable manifold associated with the saddle point . \n mep for type - ii gradient systems is less trivial . in this case \n ( 3.3)-(3.6 ) have to be modified @xcite . \n consider the simple example @xmath62 where @xmath63 . \n it has two local equilibrium states @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n the mep that connects @xmath19 and @xmath20 is plotted in figure 3 . \n it is not a smooth curve . \n the velocity is reversed at the saddle point . to verify that the mep does reflect the true behavior of the transition path \n , we also plot the transition path obtained from direct simulation of the stochastic differential equation . \n mep for type - ii gradient systems . \n the red line is the mep in phase space , the green line is the transition path computed from solving the stochastic differential equation . \n mep is a very important concept since it defines the `` most probable '' transition path from which transition rates can be computed via equation . \n however we should emphasize that from a numerical point of view our task is not that of a conventional optimization or control problem , since there is not an objective function that we can easily work with . \n instead our aim is to perform importance sampling in path space to sample the paths that contribute significantly to the switching . \n finally , if there exists a mep that connects two metastable sets without going through a third one , then we connect these two metastable sets by a link . in this way \n , we form a graph . \n the original dynamics is then reduced to a markov chain on this graph . \n -5 mm    a variety of numerical techniques have been developed , most prominently in chemistry , but also in biology and material science , for computing meps and sometimes transition rates . among the most well - known techniques in the chemistry literature \n are the nudged elastic band method and the transition path sampling technique . \n the nudged elastic band method ( neb ) @xcite aims at computing the mep defined by ( 3.5 ) . \n it represents the mep by a discrete chain of states . \n these states evolve according to the potential forces of the system . \n to prevent the states from all falling to the two local equilibrium states , a spring force is applied to neighboring states to penalize the non - uniformity in the distribution of the states along the chain . \n this by itself may cause convergence to a path which is not a mep . \n hence a nudging technique is used , namely only the normal component of the potential force and the tangential component of the spring force is applied . \n neb is a very effective method for small systems with relatively smooth energy landscapes . \n it has two main drawbacks . \n one is that it is highly inefficient and may not even be applicable to systems with rough energy landscapes . \n the other is the choice of the elastic constant . \n a large elastic constant requires a small time step in the evolution of the states . \n a small elastic constant will not achieve the desired uniformity of the states and hence will not give the required accuracy for the energy barrier . \n a second important technique is transition path sampling ( tps ) @xcite . \n this method aims at complex systems with rough energy landscapes by developing a monte carlo technique that samples the path space . \n its efficiency hinges on the ability to produce new accepted paths from old ones . \n other techniques include the ridge method , blue mooth sampling , etc . @xcite . \n often these methods require knowing beforehand the reaction coordinate . \n al propose to minimize the onsager - machlup action as a way of finding the most probable path for macromolecular systems @xcite . \n the onsager - machlup action is the same as the wentzell - freidlin action . from a numerical point of view \n , there are certain difficulties associated with minimizing this action functional . \n these issues are discussed in @xcite . \n -5 mm    the basic idea in the string method , developed in @xcite , is to represent transition paths by their intrinsic parameterization in order to efficiently evolve and sample paths in path space . \n it has two versions . \n the zero temperature version is designed for smooth energy landscapes . \n the finite temperature version is designed for rough energy landscapes in which case thermal noise acts to smooth out the small scale features . \n the simplest example of a zero - temperature string method is to evolve curves in path space by the gradient flow @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the tangent vector of the curve @xmath68 , @xmath69 denotes the component of @xmath56 normal to @xmath67 , @xmath70 is the lagrange multiplier that enforces certain specific parameterization of the curves . \n for example if we require equal arclength parameterization , then we need @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 we call such curves with intrinsic parameterization strings .    in practice \n the strings are discretized into a collection of points . \n these points move according to the normal component of the potential force . \n a reparameterization step is applied once in a while to enforce the proper parameterization of the strings . \n the finite temperature string method is designed for systems with rough energy landscapes , particularly the case when the potential can be expressed in the form @xmath73 where @xmath61 is smooth and @xmath74 . in this case \n we would like to compute the mep of @xmath61 without first computing @xmath61 explicitly . \n this is achieved by creating an ensemble of a special type . \n our computational object will be a string connecting the two metastable sets , together with a family of probability measures on the hyperplanes normal to the string . \n consider the stochastic equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is gaussian noise with mean 0 and correlation @xmath77 the projection operator @xmath78 is defined by projecting to the hyperplane normal to the string @xmath79 , where @xmath80 @xmath81 is the tangent vector of @xmath53 at @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the lagrange multiplier that enforces proper parameterization of @xmath53 .    * \n theorem 1.1 . * \n _ _    1 .   the statistical steady state of satisfies : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the hyperplane normal to @xmath53 at @xmath82 , @xmath58 . \n the stationary distribution of is given by the family of distributions @xmath86    knowing @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the transition rates and free energy landscapes can be computed , see @xcite . \n the finite temperature string method is applied to the perturbed mueller potential @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the so - called mueller potential ( see @xcite ) , @xmath91 is a random perturbation . \n the results of the ( finite temperature ) string method is shown in figure 4 . \n also plotted is the mep of @xmath92 ( since @xmath93 is explicitly known for this particular example ) as well as the fluctuations around @xmath53 . \n effective mep and local fluctuations for the perturbed mueller potential . \n the red curve is the mep for @xmath94 . \n the black curve is the mep computed from the finite temperature string method . \n the green curves show the size of the fluctuations . \n -5 mm    there are several important topics that we did not cover in this brief report . \n these include the effect of dynamics , non - gradient systems , and acceleration techniques . \n these are discussed in @xcite . also found in these references \n are applications of the ideas discussed here to thermal activated reversal of magnetic thin films , models of martensitic transformations , and the formation of @xmath95 from 60 carbon atoms . \n the last example is a case when the barrier is entropic . even though the potential energy is mainly going downhill , the free energy has barriers because of entropic effects . \n such examples are found frequently in biopolymers .    from a numerical point of view , our main idea for overcoming the difficulty caused by the disparity of the times scales is to reformulate the problem as a boundary value problem instead of initial value problem , since we have some knowledge of the initial and final state of the system . \n compared with other existing methods that assume explicit knowledge of a reaction coordinate , our method finds the reaction coordinate self - consistently during the computation . \n the topic discussed here is relatively new in applied mathematics , but it is of paramount importance in science and particularly computational science . \n progress in this area will likely have a fundamental impact in many areas of applications . \n jnsson , h. ; mills , g. ; jacobsen , k. w. nudged elastic band method for finding minimum energy paths of transitions . in : classical and quantum dynamics in condensed phase simulations . \n edited by : berne , b. j. ; cicotti , g. ; coker , d. f. world scientific , 1998 .", "StartTimeOffset": 73531577918, "RequestID": "12f0bea880774a0cac9d6213056742f1", "TotalTokens": 4283}

@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n if the angular separation of the images of a point - like source is comparable to the wavelength of the light , interference between the lensed images will lead to a distinctive fringe pattern both in coordinate space and in energy spectrum . \n the interference pattern in the energy spectrum will depend upon the location of the detector . \n since well separated detectors will see different patterns , there is a distinctive signature of the effect . \n if gamma - ray bursters are of cosmological origin they would be small enough to act as point - like sources , and lenses of extremely small masses , @xmath2 , ( @xcite ) . ] \n would produce a frequency - dependent signal in their spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n for source and lens at cosmological distances , the angular separation of the images would be in the femto - arcsec range , so the phenomenon was dubbed `` femtolensing '' by gould ( 1992 ) . \n for source and lens of cosmological distances , the einstein ring radius is @xmath3 cm . \n this means that if two gamma - ray burst detectors are separated by distances larger than @xmath4 , typically one detector will be within the einstein ring and the other will not . \n measurement of different fluxes in two widely separated detectors would extend the detectable range of lens masses to @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , which can be called picolensing . \n thus , femtolensing and picolensing could be a probe of dark matter in a mass range difficult to probe by other means , not to mention settle the issue of the origin of gamma - ray bursters . \n although the phenomenon of femtolensing ( henceforth we omit picolensing for brevity , but everywhere below we mean both phenomena ) is quite intriguing , the possibility has not attracted a great deal of attention because of a lack of attractive femtolens candidates . among the front runners in an admittedly weak field \n are snowballs , black holes , and small molecular clouds . \n snowballs ( lumps of primordial h and he ) are generally believed to evaporate on time scales shorter than the hubble time ( @xcite ) and for this reason they are not very attractive . \n a significant fraction of closure density in black holes in the requisite mass range seems difficult to arrange without a very peculiar spectrum of primordial fluctuations to prevent too many small holes which would be evaporating now . as an unattractive possibility in a field of even more unpalatable choices , small molecular clouds \n are usually considered the best bet for femtolensing . \n even if one thought of a way to arrange baryons into femto - mass objects , it is unlikely that they would contribute a large enough fraction of closure density for a reasonable optical depth for femtolensing . \n even if _ all _ baryonic matter would form femtolenses , their density is constrained by big - bang nucleosynthesis to be less than about 10% of closure density . \n since non - baryonic dark matter is expected to dominate the mass density of the universe , perhaps it is easier to arrange a near critical density of _ non - baryonic _ material into objects capable of femtolensing . \n but most particle dark matter candidates are very weakly interacting , and they would not be expected to clump on the femtolensing mass and density scales .    in this paper \n we shall show that the situation may be different if axions are the dark matter . here \n we outline a scenario where a significant cosmological density of axion miniclusters ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1994a ) form with the necessary properties to be natural candidates both for femto- and picolensing . \n the invisible axion is among the best motivated candidates for cosmic dark matter . \n the axion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is the pseudo - nambu  goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath6 global symmetry known as the peccei \n quinn , or pq , symmetry introduced to explain the apparent smallness of strong cp - violation in qcd ( @xcite ) . \n there are stringent astrophysical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and cosmological ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) constraints on the properties of the axion . in particular , \n the combination of cosmological and astrophysical considerations restrict the axion decay constant @xmath7 and the axion mass @xmath8 to be in the narrow windows @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . \n the contribution to the mean density of the universe from axions in this window is guaranteed to be cosmologically significant . \n thus , if axions exist , they will be dynamically important in the present evolution of the universe . \n the axion is effectively massless well above the qcd confinement temperature of a few hundred mev . at the confinement scale and below \n , qcd effects produce a potential for the axion of the form @xmath11 $ ] , where the axion field was parametrised as a dimensionless angular variable @xmath12 . above the qcd scale \n there is no reason for the axion field to be at its low - temperature potential minimum , so as the axion potential turns on the field must relax to the minimum of the potential . \n thus the energy density in axions corresponds to coherent scalar field oscillations , driven by a displacement of the initial value of the field ( the `` misalignment '' angle ) away from the eventual minimum of the temperature - dependent potential . \n there will be nothing special in the subsequent evolution of the axion field if the initial misalignment angle is constant throughout the universe . \n this may in fact be a reasonable picture if the universe underwent inflation with the `` re - heat '' temperature well below @xmath7 . however , equally plausible early - universe scenarios lead to fluctuations of order unity in the misalignment angle on scales larger than the hubble radius as the potential starts to develop . since the final energy density depends upon the initial misalignment angle , spatial fluctuations in the misalignment angle \n are transformed into spatial fluctuations in the axion density , which later lead to tiny gravitationally bound `` miniclusters . '' \n it is easy to understand that miniclusters will be very dense objects . \n background axion density scales with temperature as @xmath13 for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the entropy density and @xmath16 is the temperature of equal matter and radiation energy densities . \n consider a region with axion over - density , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is larger than unity . \n the matter density in that region will dominate the radiation density at a temperature @xmath19 . at this time the density fluctuation became non - linear , separate out from the cosmological expansion , gravitationally collapse , relax , and form a minicluster with the approximate density it had at @xmath20 . \n a detailed study of this leads to a final minicluster density of ( @xcite ) @xmath21 even a relatively small increase in @xmath18 is important because the final density depends upon @xmath22 for @xmath23 .    in hogan & rees ( 1988 ) \n it was assumed that typical values of @xmath18 corresponding to a minicluster are of order unity . \n the typical mass of a minicluster in hogan & rees ( 1988 ) was assumed to correspond to the mass of all axions inside the horizon at @xmath24 mev , with the result @xmath25 .    in our numerical investigations of the dynamics of the axion field around the qcd epoch ( @xcite , 1994a ) we found that as the oscillations commence , important , previously neglected , non - linear effects of the field self - interaction can result in the formation of transient soliton - like objects we called axitons . \n the non - linear effects result in regions with @xmath18 much larger than unity , possibly as large as several hundred , leading to enormous minicluster densities . \n we also found that the minicluster mass scale is set by the total mass in axions within the hubble radius at a temperature around @xmath26 gev when axion mass is equal to @xmath27 . \n this lowers the minicluster mass from the estimate of hogan and rees to about @xmath28 . \n our previous calculations suggested that miniclusters could be a candidate for femtolensing . \n we have since extended and improved our original calculation of the properties of axion miniclusters using the same approach as in @xcite , but with better numerical resolution and using a different spectrum of initial fluctuations of @xmath12 . \n the new calculation confirmed the basic picture of minicluster formation and sharpened the predictions of the masses , radii , and abundance of miniclusters . in the next section \n we summarize the results relevant for femtolensing . \n the evolution of the axion field in an expanding , spatially flat universe during the epoch when axion mass switches on is governed by a wave - like equation with a non - linear , time - dependent potential ( @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the conformal time ( normalized to @xmath33 when the inverse of the axion mass is equal to the hubble radius  i.e . , \n @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is the laplacian with respect to comoving coordinates . \n the factor of @xmath36 in this equation arises from the way the potential develops due to instanton effects : @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .    as an initial conditions in the new calculation we considered the possibility that the main source of axions is provided by the decay of axion strings prior to @xmath39 \n ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n this might be expected if the reheating temperature after inflation is larger than the temperature of the peccei - quinn phase transition . \n in such a scenario the spectral energy density of axions produced by string decay corresponds to a power law : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( recall that the axion effectively is massless prior to @xmath42 ) . \n this corresponds to @xmath43 for the fourier amplitudes of the axion field . in our latest calculations we used initial conditions at @xmath42 with amplitudes of the fourier modes corresponding to the above spectrum and with random phases . \n overall amplitude was chosen to ensure rms value of @xmath12 to be @xmath44 .    the final density distribution of axions in one of the 2-dimensional slices through the integration volume is shown in figure 1 . \n three high amplide density peaks which are seen on this figure results from non - linear interaction and are absent in the case of the harmonic potential . \n they form miniclusters of interest at @xmath45 . \n the evolution of the axion field with the above initial conditions was qualitatively similar to the evolution using the white - noise initial conditions of our previous calculations . from the results of the numerical calculation we determined the mass , radius , and abundance of axion miniclusters . \n minicluster mass . \n _ the mass of axion minicluster is set by the scale when axion oscillations commence . as mentioned above , \n we have defined @xmath46 as a temperature when the axion mass equals the hubble constant , @xmath47 . using results of turner ( 1986 ) we use @xmath48 gev . in what follows \n we assume @xmath49 gev . as a reference mass scale \n we define the mass of all axions in a cubic volume of length equal to the hubble length at @xmath46 , and density equal to the mean cosmological density : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of an effectively massless degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath46 . using @xmath52 we find @xmath53 . \n our numerical integration of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) shows that there is a spectrum of minicluster masses , but typically the mass of the axion minicluster is a reasonable fraction of @xmath54 , @xmath55 . \n we estimate the average minicluster mass to be of order @xmath56 . \n masses of miniclusters are relatively insensitive to the particular value of @xmath18 associated with the minicluster . \n minicluster radius . \n _ typical axion miniclusters have a large density contrast , @xmath57 ( @xcite ) , see figure 1 . \n equation ( [ rhofl ] ) gives the minicluster radius as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath18 : @xmath59    the radius of a particular minicluster depends upon its associated value of @xmath18 . in the limit @xmath23 the radius of a minicluster scales as @xmath60 . \n minicluster abundance . \n _ from the numerical calculation we have extracted the mass fraction of axions in density peaks of @xmath18 larger than a given value @xmath61 . \n it is plotted for several values of conformal time @xmath62 and @xmath63 in figure 2 . by the time @xmath64 \n we are no longer able reliably to resolve the highest density peaks because density contrasts became too large for our @xmath65 grid . \n although at @xmath66 the evolution has not completely frozen out , ( especially at the large-@xmath18 end ) we can set a lower bound for the density fractions , e.g. , more than 13% are in miniclusters with @xmath67 and 70% of all axionic dark matter are in miniclusters @xmath68 , see figure 2 . \n for axion miniclusters ( or , for that matter , any other possible candidate ) to be detected by femtolensing ( or picolensing ) the following three conditions must be satisfied :      _ ii . ) _ the physical radius of the minicluster has to be smaller than its einstein ring radius \n . for source and lens of cosmological distance the einstein ring radius is , see e.g. press & gunn ( 1973 ) : @xmath71 where as usual @xmath72 km s@xmath73mpc@xmath73 . \n _ iii . ) _ the third condition is that a significant fraction of the total mass density of the universe must be in the form of miniclusters , say @xmath74 , for the lensing rate to be reasonable . \n this condition is independent upon the lens mass ( @xcite ) . \n these conditions are non - trivial , which is why there were no serious candidates for femtolensing . \n but we shall now demonstrate that all three conditions are naturally met for the case of axion miniclusters .    that miniclusters satisfy the mass condition follows from the fact that the minicluster mass is determined by the total mass of axions within the hubble radius at @xmath75 gev . \n of course there will be some spread in minicluster masses , but as discussed in the previous section , the masses should be peaked around @xmath28 , well within the desired range for lensing .    using the radius of miniclusters from equation ( [ r ] ) and the einstein ring radius from equation ( [ re ] ) , we find @xmath76 . \n the requirement that miniclusters be smaller than their einstein ring radius places restrictions on @xmath18 as a function of @xmath58 \n . we see that if @xmath77 , then miniclusters with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( depending upon @xmath80 ) are within their einstein ring radius . \n actually , objects with the radius comparable to their einstein radius have a better chance to be detected as femtolenses ( compared to point mass objects ) if they are in the mass range @xmath81 ( @xcite ) . from figure [ fig2 ] \n we see that more than about 20% of all dark matter axions are in miniclusters with @xmath82 and will be within their ring radius . \n we conclude that if axions are the dark matter with @xmath83 close to unity , then the fraction of @xmath84 in miniclusters capable of femtolensing is 15% - 20% ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) , i. e. will be in excess of 10%large enough to result in a detectable rate . \n since miniclusters in the igm as well as in galactic halos contribute to femtolensing events , questions such as : how are they clustered , do miniclusters survive the epoch of galaxy formation , are they disrupted in their encounters with stars , etc . \n , may be irrelevant here . \n since large-@xmath18 miniclusters are very dense , form early , and are well separated from each other , they should escape mutual disruption and merging . \n we conclude that axion miniclusters are candidates for femtolensing and picolensing . \n we do not believe that the conclusion is sensitive to specific initial conditions , but is generic so long as there are large super - horizon - sized fluctuations in the misalignment angle during the development of the axion potential .", "StartTimeOffset": 90903730772, "RequestID": "815a776c1b76423c911b075fe65c65e3", "TotalTokens": 4208}
{"ContextTokens": 2489, "GeneratedTokens": 155, "SynthesizedBody": "timing noise is low - frequency fluctuation in the rotation - rate of pulsars and is evident in the timing residuals of all young and middle - aged pulsars . \n the basic properties of timing noise were reviewed recently by ( * ? ? ? \n * hobbs et al . ( 2010 ) ) who presented the results of an analysis of the rotation of 366 pulsars . in summary , timing noise is seen as smooth changes in the timing residuals ( and rotation frequency ) . \n the timing residuals are often asymmetric , with peaks and troughs having different radii of curvature ; the variations are often quasi - periodic with timescales which are typically 1 - 10 years . for long \n , it was thought to arise from the fluid interiors of the neutron stars . \n a breakthrough was made in 2006 , when ( * ? ? ? \n * kramer et al . ) showed that the timing noise in the long - term intermittent pulsar b1931 + 24 could be explained in detail by switching in the magnitude of the slowdown rate @xmath0 betwen the `` on '' and `` off '' emission states of the pulsar , indicating that changes in the current flow from the pulsar resulted in changes of both the radio emission and of the braking torque . \n the implication that changes in magnetospheric currents could alter pulsar emission properties as well as slowdown rate led ( * ? ? ? * lyne et al . ( 2010 ) ) ( hereafter lhkss ) to study the detailed pulse profiles of some of those pulsars having the largest amounts of timing noise . \n they demonstrated that six of these pulsars exhibited the well - known phenomenon of mode - changing , in which a pulsar switches abruptly between two stable profiles . \n moreover , in all six pulsars , there was a high degree of correlation between the pulse shape and slowdown rate , the pulsars switching rapidly between low- and high - spindown rates . \n two years after the publication of lhkss , we review the observational evidence for switched changes in magnetospheric states , both in intermittent pulsars and in mode - changing pulsars , and discuss the relationship between the two phenomena . \n many pulsars show intermittency in their radio emission , although usually the durations of the `` on '' and `` off '' states are measured in seconds to hundreds of seconds , timescales which are far too short to permit the determination of any change in slowdown rate between the states . \n this is the phenomenon of pulse nulling which has been known since shortly after the discovery of pulsars ( ( * ? ? ? \n * backer 1970 ) ) .    however , the intermittent pulsar b1931 + 24 is typically on for 1 week and off for about 1 month , permitting ( * ? ? ? \n * kramer et al . ( 2006 ) ) to show that the ratio of on- and off- slowdown values @xmath1 , roughly consistent with an absence of all magnetospheric currents during the off phase , in accordance with the calculations of the braking effects of magnetospheric currents by ( * ? ? ? \n * goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) ) .    shortly after that publication \n , a second long - term intermittent pulsar was discovered ( psr  j1832 + 0029 ) and reported to show similar large changes in in slowdown rate ( @xmath2 ; ( * ? ? ? * \n kramer 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * lyne 2009 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * lorimer et al . 2012 ) ) . \n 1 shows the measured values of rotation rate during the 10 years since its discovery . with rather poor statistics , the lengths of the on and off states are typically many hundreds of days , compared with tens of days for b1931 + 24 . \n more recently , a third long - term intermittent object ( psr  j1841@xmath30500 ) , also with timescales measured in hundreds of days , has been reported by ( * ? ? ? \n * camilo et al . \n ( 2012 ) ) . even though the statistics are also poor for this pulsar , it is clear that this has an even greater slowdown rate ratio ( @xmath4 ; see fig . \n lhkss studied those pulsars in the jodrell bank timing database which showed the largest amounts of timing noise , measured as the ratio of maximum to minimum values of slowdown rate . \n seventeen examples are shown in fig . \n pulsars typically have peak - to - peak values of about 1% of the mean , over a 4-orders - of - magnitude range of slowdown rates . \n individual pulsars may have a factor of 10 times more or less than this . \n lhkss found that six of the 17 pulsars showed pulse - shape changes which were correlated with these slowdown rate variations . \n subsequent studies ( lyne et al . , in prep ) have now shown that a further four of these 17 also have significant pulse - shape variations that are correlated with slowdown rate ( psrs b0919 + 06 , b1642@xmath303 , b1826@xmath317 and b1903 + 07 ) as well as two others ( psrs b1740@xmath303 and b0105 + 65 ) .    ) of 17 pulsars ( from lyne et al . \n 2010).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]        a further striking example of correlated changes in pulse shape and slowdown is displayed by psr  j2047 + 5029 , discovered at westerbork in the 8gr8 survey ( ( * ? ? ? \n * janssen et al . 2009 ) ) . at discovery , \n the observed profile showed a main pulse and an interpulse with an associated precursor having about 1/3 of the flux density of the main pulse ( fig .  4 top ) . \n however , when monitoring commenced at jodrell bank , the main pulse had reduced in intensity by a factor of about 10 , so that it was then much weaker than the interpulse ( fig .  4 bottom ) . \n the pulsar has since changed from this `` abnormal mode '' back to the earlier `` normal '' mode . \n these changes were accompanied by changes in slowdown rate , which was larger when in the normal mode than in the abnormal mode , again consistent with the notion that the particles responsible for much of the normal - mode main - pulse radio flux density were also responsible for the increase in braking .    in total \n there are now 16 pulsars with established synchronised changes in the radio emission and the slowdown rate . \n the properties of these pulsars are summarised in table  1 , in decreasing order of the magnitude of the timing noise , measured as the ratio of the maximum and minimum slowdown rates .    .timing noise slowdown rate ratios ( @xmath5 ) and emission changes in 16 pulsars . \n [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the time sequences of slowdown rates shown in fig .  2 are usually bounded by well - defined maximum and minimum levels , each extreme level being identifiable with a characteristic emission profile or flux density . \n as reported by lhkss , each pulsar is usually seen to switch abruptly between these extreme states . \n the fact that the patterns in fig . \n 2 are generally smooth and do not display abrupt switching behaviour was demonstrated to arise from changing statistical properties of the mode - changing phenomenon , and the observed profile shape parameter is determined by the proportion of time spent in the two modes . \n this is most clearly illustrated in fig . \n 5 which shows a number of 8-hour observations of psr  b1828@xmath311 chosen at different phases of the 500-day oscillating pattern displayed by this pulsar in fig .  3 . \n we note that although pulse nulling and profile mode - changing was first observed in 1970 ( ( * ? ? ? \n * backer 1970 ) ; ( * ? ? ? \n * backer 1970a ) ) , the following four decades have seen no study of the stability of the statistics of nulling or mode - changing . \n the processes of nulling and mode - changing are similar in many ways . both are switched phenomena between ( usually ) two discrete emission states . \n they both have similar large ranges of timescales and both have a major synchronisation with the spindown rate of the pulsar . \n they are both understood in terms of changes in magnetospheric particle currents . \n the natural conclusion is that nulling is probably an extreme form of mode - changing . \n this view is supported by a few cases in which an apparently nulling pulsar has been found to have low - level emission in the null state . \n one such example is psr  b0826@xmath334 shown in fig .  6 , in which integration of the data during apparently `` null '' episodes shows pulsed emission at a level of about 2% of the un - nulled pulses . \n perhaps one telescope s nulling pulsar is a larger telescope s mode - changing pulsar ! \n pulsar magnetospheres switch between a small number of discrete states , usually two , each of which corresponds to an apparently quasi - stable magnetospheric configuration . \n it seems that changes in magnetospheric current flows between these states cause variations in both the emission beam snd the slow - down rate . \n this is supported by the general observation that the larger slowdown - rate is nearly always associated with enhanced emission , particularly of the pulsar `` core '' emission . \n i have no understanding of why there are these discrete states , or of the origin of the multi - year quasi - periodicities that modulate the statistical properties of the states . \n free - precession of the neutron star and orbiting asteroids have been proposed , but any links are obscure .    finally , it must be emphasised that these phenomena are widespread . the majority of pulsars of young and intermediate characteristic age display detectable timing noise . \n the studies of profiles described here have mostly been of those pulsars which have the largest fractional changes in slowdown rates and hence may be expected to suffer the greatest magnetospheric changes and corresponding variation in emission properties . \n in fact , 12 of the 19 pulsars with largest timing noise show correlated emission variations . most of the remaining 7 have much poorer signal - to - noise ratio , making the precise determination of pulse shape changes challenging . \n the changes expected in less timing - noisy pulsars are likely to be much more subtle and a challenge to detect . at present \n , there is no reason to doubt that all timing noise has its origin in switched magnetospheric states .", "StartTimeOffset": 107339858544, "RequestID": "cc282a39378e4d0098d466763424fc20", "TotalTokens": 2644}

2 ) to investigate the bimodality of the metallicity distribution , which was seen only in the spectroscopic data of the previous catalog , but not clearly in any photometric data ( barmby et al . 2000 ) ; 3 ) to investigate the difference in mean luminosity between the metal - poor gcs and the metal - rich gcs . \n the present catalog of m31 globular clusters shows that the metal - poor gcs are 0.4 mag fainter than the metal - rich gcs ( barmby et al . \n 2000 , barmby 2001 ) , which is the opposite to the case of the gcs in early - type galaxies and our galaxy ( larsen et al . \n our new catalog will be helpful to resolve this discrepancy ;

{"ContextTokens": 3574, "GeneratedTokens": 249, "SynthesizedBody": "aerogels are materials with density and refractive index in the region between gases and liquids or solids . \n already some time ago , cantin et al . \n @xcite proposed that cherenkov radiation from silica aerogels could be used for detection of particles . \n besides particle detectors like for example tasso @xcite , such threshold counters found applications also in other fields @xcite . with improved manufacturing techniques , aerogels of higher transparency \n i.e. less rayleigh scattering became available , permitting their consideration as radiators in ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) counters @xcite . \n ypsilantis and seguinot @xcite proposed a combined aerogel+gas , mirror - focused rich counter for the lhc - b experiment at cern . \n the hermes team @xcite constructed and operated such a ring imaging detector at desy . \n the present paper reports on experimental investigation of an aerogel based rich detector not requiring mirrors i.e. of the proximity focusing type . \n such a detector is being considered in connection with a possible upgrade of the belle particle identification system at kek @xcite . \n initial tests of the apparatus with cosmic rays were reported recently @xcite . \n the present paper describes measurements and results obtained with the @xmath1 beam at kek . \n a beam particle - pion , muon or electron - traversing the apparatus is signaled by two @xmath2  @xmath3 scintillation counters which determine the time of arrival . \n two co@xmath4 gas cherenkov counters produce signals only upon the passage of electrons so these signals could be used either to select or to exclude electrons .    the aerogel radiator and the position sensitive , single photon detector are contained in a light tight box ( fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) , of which the entrance and exit sides each have a multiwire proportional chamber for measuring the track of the incident particle . \n these @xmath2  @xmath3 mwpc s , with 15 @xmath5 m diameter , gold - plated tungsten anode wires at 2  mm pitch and with 90% ar + 10% ch@xmath6 gas flow , are read out by delay lines on the x and y cathode wires .    after passing through the entrance mwpc , \n the charged particle hits the aerogel radiator in which it emits cherenkov photons . \n measurements have been made mainly with 2  cm thick aerogel slabs of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , produced by the method described in @xcite . \n the position sensitive detector of cherenkov photons is situated 17 - 29  cm downstream of the aerogel , depending on the refractive index value of the specific aerogel . \n the detector is a @xmath10 array of 16 channel multianode photomultiplier tubes ( hamamatsu pmts type r5900 - 00-m16 with borosilicate window @xcite ) at 30  mm pitch . the sensitive surface of the m16 pmt is divided into 16 ( @xmath11 ) channels , each covering @xmath12 mm@xmath13 . \n it follows that only 36% of the detector area is occupied by the photosensitive channels , the rest being dead space . \n the photon detection system and the aerogel radiator tile may be rotated around an axis perpendicular to the beam direction , enabling measurements of angular acceptance i.e. measurements of the number of detected cherenkov photons as a function of the charged particle incident angle . \n the pmts are plugged into voltage divider boards inside the light tight box with signals passing through connectors to the readout system located outside the box . \n the pmt anode signals are first discriminated and then recorded by camac multihit , multichannel tdcs , for which the common stop is provided by the scintillation counter signals . \n the tdc information is stored for later analysis in a personal computer .    as only 196 readout channels were available for the 576 pmt anode outputs , only part of the system \n could be read out with the 4.5  mm pixel size . however , by connecting 4 ( @xmath14 ) anodes to one readout channel , the entire system could be read out with 9  mm pixel size . \n pion given by the measured track position.,width=340 ]    a few typical events are displayed in fig . \n [ fig2 ] . from the photon hit position and the measured direction of the incident charged particle , the cherenkov angle is calculated . \n accumulated distributions of hits , depending on their cherenkov angles , are plotted in figs . \n [ fig3 - 0 ] and [ fig3 ] . \n peaks and rings , corresponding to pions , muons and electrons , are clearly visible . \n signals from the gas cherenkov counters may be used for either selecting or excluding electrons . \n fitting these distributions with gaussian peaks and linear backgrounds yields the average values and standard deviations of the measured cherenkov angles . \n the main contributions to the resolution in cherenkov angle as determined from a single photon ( standard deviations of the peaks in distributions of figs . \n [ fig3 - 0 ] and [ fig3 ] ) come from pixel size and from uncertainty in the emission point . for normal incidence of tracks the first contribution \n could be estimated as @xmath15cos@xmath16 , where d is the pixel size , @xmath17 is the cherenkov angle and @xmath18 is the distance from aerogel to detector . \n the second contribution is @xmath19 sin@xmath20cos@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the aerogel thickness . \n the uncertainty in the track direction is negligible at 3  gev/@xmath23 , but increases at lower momenta . \n the error due to dispersion in the radiator ( chromatic error ) should also be negligible , but contributions could arise due to possible non - uniformities of the aerogel ( position variations in refractive index ) , non - flat aerogel surface , forward scattering of photons etc .    the measured cherenkov angle resolution , i.e. the standard deviation of peaks in distributions of photon hits versus the value of aerogel refractive index , is shown in fig .

[ fig6 ] . \n although the threshold for @xmath8 is reached , as expected , at lower particle momenta than for @xmath7 , the saturated number of detected photons per cherenkov ring is more or less the same for both radiators . \n the above discrepancies can be well understood , and have been estimated from the known aerogel attenuation lengths and the response of the counter ( fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . \n the attenuation lengths at 400  nm for the samples of fig . \n [ fig5 ] are 36  mm , 15  mm and 7  mm for the aerogel samples with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and 36  mm for the 28 mm thick novosibirsk sample with @xmath8 @xcite .    it has been already noted by the hermes group @xcite , that a loss of cherenkov photons occurs at the side wall boundaries between adjacent aerogel tiles . \n we have confirmed this finding by measuring the number of photons on the cherenkov ring as a function of the distance of the charged particle impact point from the boundary between two tiles . the measurement is shown in fig . \n [ fig7 ] , where a dip is seen at the tile boundary @xmath30  mm . in order to eliminate other geometrical factors , like for example \n the acceptance of the photon detector , the measured yield was normalized to the yield obtained with one tile covering the entire range . \n the result clearly indicates the reduction of yield when the charged particle is closer than about 5  mm to the boundary of a 2  cm thick @xmath8 aerogel tile . \n it is worth noting that a simple model , where all photons hitting the boundary between the two tiles get lost , accounts for most of the observed dependence . \n we have constructed and tested a proximity focusing rich detector module with aerogel as radiator and multianode pmts as position sensitive detectors of individual cherenkov photons . \n the measured values of the basic parameters i.e. the single photon cherenkov angle resolution and the number of photons detected per cherenkov ring , look promising . \n the resolution is in relatively good agreement with estimates based on pixel size and emission point uncertainty . \n the number of detected photons , however is sensitive to the particular aerogel used . \n it seems that these differences are due to rayleigh scattering , which reduces the aerogel transparency mainly in the wavelength region of maximal photocathode sensitivity . \n photomultipier tubes with a higher fraction of active area , possibly combined with a light collection system , consisting of lenses or light guides , are expected to increase the number of detected cherenkov photons by reducing the dead space of the photon detector . \n the increase in photon yield , however , is in the latter case at the expense of an increase in the effective pixel size , so a compromise , optimizing the final resolution of the charged particle cherenkov angle should be found . \n the information obtained from the results of the present tests suggests that a proximity focusing aerogel rich as required by the belle particle identification upgrade is feasible , so investigations of optimal detector parameters are being continued . \n 15 m.  cantin , m.  casse , l.  koch , r.  jouan , p.  mestreau , d.  roussel , f.  bonnin , j.  moutel and s.j . \n teichner , `` silica aerogels used as cherenkov radiators , '' _ nucl . \n instrum . methods _ , vol . \n 177 - 182 , 1974 . \n h.  burkhardt p.  koehler , r.  riethmuller , b.h . \n wiik , r.  fohrmann , j.  franzke , h.  kraseman et al . , ` ` the tasso gas and aerogel cherenkov counters , '' _ nucl . \n . methods _ , vol . \n 319 - 331 , 1981 . \n fields , h.  van  hecke , j.  boissevain , b.v . \n jacak , w.e . \n sondheim , j.p . \n sullivan , w.j . \n willis , k.  wolf , e.  noteboom , p.m.  peters and r.  burke , `` use of aerogel for imaging cherenkov counters , '' _ nucl . \n instrum . methods _ , \n a349 , pp.431 - 437 , 1994 . \n n. akopov , e.c . \n aschenauer , k. bailey , s. bernreuther , n. bianchi , g.p . \n capitani et al . , `` the hermes dual - radiator ring imaging cerenkov detector , '' _ \n instrum . methods _ , \n a479 , pp . \n 511 - 530 , 2002 . \n i.  adachi , i.  bizjak , a.  goriek , t.  iijima , m.  iwamoto , s.  korpar et al . \n , `` tests of a proximity focusing rich with aerogel as radiator , '' proceedings of the 4th workshop on rich detectors , june 2002 , pylos , greece , to be published in _ nucl . \n methods _    s.  korpar , i.  bizjak , m.  brako , a.  goriek , t.  iijima , m.  iwamoto , p.  krian , r.  pestotnik , m.  stari and a.  stanovnik , `` tests of a proximity focusing rich with aerogel as radiator '' 2001 ieee nuclear science symposium , san diego , california , usa , november 4 - 10 , 2002 , conference record ( 2002 ) , 4 pages .", "StartTimeOffset": 156086455372, "RequestID": "c6b6914950d0405c864d9aa39d3b69c0", "TotalTokens": 3823}
{"ContextTokens": 2542, "GeneratedTokens": 78, "SynthesizedBody": "the recent results obtained by the hst on the optical counterpart of grb 970228 [ 3,4 ] have given answer to important questions concerning its light decay , its proper motion and the nature of the underlying nebula . \n this information must be taken into account in reanalysing all the previously published data .    in this paper \n we aim to refine the values and lower limits ( particularly those obtained with the 1.5meter telescope of the bologna astronomical observatory ) of the points in the @xmath0 light curve of grb 970228 , taking into account the refined magnitude value for the underlying nebulosity given by fruchter et al . \n moreover , we show for the first time and briefly discuss the @xmath1 light curve of this grb . \n galama et al . [ 5 ] collected all the known @xmath0 points and lower limits referring to the grb 970228 optical light curve . \n they however used a value for the luminosity of the nebulosity associated to the object ( @xmath2 ; groot et al . [ 6 ] ) which is overestimated according to the most recent hst observations ( @xmath3 ; fruchter et al . [ 4 ] ) . \n this discrepancy is likely due to calibration errors which depend on the faintness of the object and not on an intrinsic variability ; fox et al . \n [ 2 ] and fruchter et al . [ \n 3 ] actually showed that the nebula is constant in brightness . \n therefore , we refined the @xmath0 data collection by galama et al . [ 5 ] using the new value of the magnitude for the underlying fuzzy object ; in particular , since the ccd observations obtained at bologna observatory [ 7 ] measured the total flux received from the transient plus the nebula and a nearby k  type star whose magnitude is @xmath4 [ 9 ] , we obtained the new @xmath0 magnitudes or lower limits for the optical transient by subtracting the two latter contributions from the data . \n we want to note that in the galama et al.s [ 5 ] data collection the @xmath0 point by guarnieri et al . [ 7 ] is wrongly plotted and must be corrected . \n indeed , the quoted @xmath0 magnitude refers to the total contribution coming from the transient plus the nebulosity and the nearby star , and not from the optical transient alone . the right value on feb . \n 28.827 ( and not on feb . \n 28.76 ) is therefore @xmath5 .    in this revision \n pedichini et al.s [ 10 ] observation of feb . \n 28.81 was not considered because of the difficulty of reliably converting their color system to the @xmath0 band . \n anyway , the importance of pedichini et al.s [ 10 ] observations lies in the fact of providing a variation @xmath6 m @xmath7 between feb . 28 and \n 4 . their observations span from feb 28.795 to 28.827 ut . the bologna @xmath0 frame was taken between feb . \n 28.816 and 28.837 ut , so the two observations partially overlapped . \n the magnitude could be quite different only if the luminosity of the transient during the first part of the observation was higher than in the last part . assuming that pedichini et al.s [ 10 ] magnitude on feb . \n 28 was the same as that found in bologna in the @xmath0 band the same day , the lower limit @xmath8 could be derived for the day mar \n we consider this figure as representative of the magnitude variation in the @xmath0 band , too .    from the observation of margon et al . \n [ 8 ] on mar . \n 3.1 , made with the astrophysical research consortium 3.5meter telescope at apache point in the apm @xmath9 photometric band , galama et al . \n [ 5 ] derived an estimate of @xmath0 by interpolating between the color index @xmath10 measured on feb . \n 28 and on mar . \n bartolini et al . \n [ 1 ] found evidence of fast color variations near the maxima of the optical counterpart of both grb 970228 and grb 970508 , so it could be dangerous to extrapolate the @xmath0 magnitude from margon et al.s [ 8 ] observation and to assume @xmath9 = @xmath11 ; moreover , galama et al . \n [ 5 ] used the color index of the optical transient alone on feb . \n 28 , and that of the optical transient plus the underlying extended source on mar . 9 \n for these reasons we did not include the value obtained by galama et al . \n [ 5 ] from the apache point measurement . \n the refined @xmath0 light curve of the optical transient associated to grb 970228 is shown in fig . 1 \n .    we also collected from the literature all the @xmath1 data points [ 3,7,11,12 ] and plotted them in fig . \n 2 . the @xmath1 band lower limits published by van paradijs et al . \n [ 12 ] were slightly corrected with the use of the @xmath1 magnitude of the nebula ( @xmath12 , as reported by fruchter et al . [ 3 ] ) . \n it should be noted that the value by guarnieri et al . [ 7 ] is interpolated from their @xmath11 and @xmath0 data acquired on feb . \n the overall trends of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves of the transient associated to grb 970228 are quite similar . indeed , we find that both decay following a power law with spectral indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 , i.e. they are coincident within the errors . \n this similarity is however related to the long  term trend . \n actually , in a short time scale the @xmath0 light curve ( fig . \n 1 ) deviates from a unique power law . \n the decay from the light peak can indeed be divided into two phases : the first one , spanning from the optical maximum and lasting 34 days with @xmath15 and the second one , after march 4 , with @xmath16 . \n these figures are in agreement with the findings by galama et al . \n [ 5 ] and confirm the rapid light decay noticed by guarnieri et al . [ 7 ] during the first 3 days after the optical maximum . \n we can not be sure of a similar trend in the @xmath1 since at that time the coverage of the light curve was very poor ( only two lower limits are available ; see fig . \n 2 ) ; we see however that the lower limit of mar . \n 4.9 [ 12 ] seems to suggest a possible rapid decay also in @xmath1 .    with the refined value of the @xmath0 magnitude of the underlying object , we can now correct the value for the ratio between the luminosity of the optical transient and that of the fuzzy object in the @xmath0 band reported by guarnieri et al .

[ maps ] ) . \n the low energy band stretches from 100 mev to 30 gev , while the high energy band covers the energies from 30 gev up to 10 tev . \n the energy division corresponds to the energy bands of fermi gst ( the low energy band ) and h.e.s.s . \n ii ( the high energy band ) . \n photons with energies below 30 gev ( fig . \n [ maps ] , top panel ) are emitted in a range of the viewing angle @xmath27 that is wider in comparison with the range for the high energy band ( fig . \n [ maps ] , bottom panel ) . \n the emission cone of the high energy photons is centred at the pulsar magnetic axis . \n this centring of emission is also traceable in the horizontal cuts made through the photon density maps for chosen observers ( fig . \n [ profile ] ) . in the energies above 30 gev the level of the photon density drops dramatically if the observer moves away from the magnetic axis ( fig . \n [ profile ] , right panel ) . \n the decrease in the photon density level is also present in the lower energy band ( fig . \n [ profile ] , left panel ) ; however , it is not so rapid . \n this behaviour is clearly visible if one compares the light curves for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in different energies . \n the overall photon density level is lower for the high energy photons . \n to have an idea how accurate the estimations of the average power radiated by the pulsar are , we have calculated a pseudo luminosity @xmath2 for both energy ranges . \n @xmath2 emulates the power inferred by an observer viewing the pulsar at an angle @xmath27 . \n the emitted radiation is confined to a solid angle @xmath31  sr . \n the formula for the pseudo luminosity in the energy range from @xmath32 to @xmath33 for a viewing angle @xmath27 is thus given as @xmath34 @xmath2 is a theoretical counterpart of @xmath35 inferred from observations in the given energy range @xmath36 , which can be described with the following formula : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a solid angle chosen arbitrarily ( 1 steradian or sometimes @xmath39 steradians ) , @xmath40 is a distance to the object and @xmath41 is a phase - averaged energy flux within @xmath36 inferred from observations . \n this formula is frequently used to asses the pulsar luminosity from the observed phase - averaged flux and the known distance to the object . \n the modelled pseudo luminosities @xmath2 will therefore test the accuracy of the observed luminosities @xmath35 versus the actual luminosity @xmath1 . \n the theoretical pseudo luminosity spectra are presented in the top panel of fig . \n [ pseudolum ] . in the same figure \n the spectrum of the actual power radiated by the pulsar from one pole is shown with solid line . \n for each observer we can construct _ the bias factor _ \n @xmath42 where @xmath2 is given by eq . \n [ pseudo ] and @xmath1 is defined as @xmath43 both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are calculated within the same energy range ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) . \n the dependence of the bias factor on the viewing angle is presented in the bottom panel of fig . \n [ pseudolum ] . in the low energy range ( solid line ) \n the bias factor equals 1 for @xmath44 . \n the observers with @xmath45 tend to overestimate the pulsar actual luminosity ( eq .  [ actual ] ) using the pseudo luminosity ( eq .  [ pseudo ] ) , while observers with @xmath46 underestimate @xmath1 . in the high energy range ( dot - dashed line ) the situation is different due to the opening angle of radiation being smaller than the inclination angle @xmath11 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . \n viewing the pulsar with @xmath27 in the range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 results in overestimation of @xmath1 . \n however , the overestimation is rather insignificant ( _ b _ is less than 1.5 in maximum ) . on the other hand , \n viewing it with @xmath27 lower than @xmath50 or higher than @xmath51 leads to underestimation of the pulsar actual luminosity . \n finally , we calculate the gamma - ray efficiency factor : @xmath52 here , @xmath1 ( eq .  [ actual ] ) is calculated within the energy range stretching from 100 mev up to 10 tev . \n this factor demonstrates what part of the pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath53 is converted into the gamma radiation . \n the gamma - ray efficiency factor for the modelled millisecond pulsar is @xmath54 . \n this result is in good agreement with @xmath55 estimated by @xcite . \n the preliminary results of the numerical modelling of millisecond pulsars have been presented in this paper . we have calculated the photon density maps in two energy regimes corresponding to the operational energy bands of fermi gst and h.e.s.s . \n we have also computed the pseudo luminosities for different viewing angles and on their basis the plot presenting the behaviour of the bias factor has been constructed . from the comparison of the bias factor - viewing angle dependence in different energy bands \n we may infer information on accuracy of the so - called pseudo luminosity @xmath2 as an estimation of the pulsar actual luminosity @xmath1 in @xmath0-rays . \n it turns out that there are very few favourable @xmath27 for which @xmath2 is a good estimate of @xmath1 . \n most often @xmath1 tends to be under / overestimated . \n the gamma - ray efficiency factor for the modelled millisecond pulsar has been calculated . \n its value @xmath54 is in agreement with the values in @xcite . \n however , further work concerning modelling , especially the inclusion of radiative processes like synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering important for pulsar x - ray emission , has to be done in order to draw accurate conclusions about millisecond pulsars . also simulations for other sets of pulsar parameters , especially for different inclination angles @xmath11 , \n have to be carried out . \n we intend to use the results of modelling as a tool for predicting the detectability of millisecond pulsars with high energy observatories like fermi gst , h.e.s.s . \n ii and even cta @xcite . \n furthermore , we plan to develop the population synthesis studies of high energy pulsars that would incorporate the results of the modelling described briefly in this paper . \n az wants to thank bronek rudak and jarek dyks for many helpful discussions and critical remarks on the paper . \n az is also grateful to the organisers for giving her the opportunity to attend _ the lapis school _ and for financial support . \n this work was supported by the grant n203 017 31/2872 of the ministry of science and higher education and the polish astroparticle network 621/e-78/sn-0068/2007 .", "StartTimeOffset": 202479912000, "RequestID": "2a483c981d1944a88ceae1c8d0168f6d", "TotalTokens": 3021}

known classical random walk ( crw ) @xcite . \n the main distinguishing feature of a qrw , compare to a crw , is the possibility of interference between the multiple paths that can be simultaneously traversed by a quantum walker , enabling thus a faster spreading of the uncertainty of location of the walker than in the classical case @xcite . \n the temporal evolution of a quantum system , such as a qrw , depends on the presence , and specific characteristics , of the environmental effects ( decoherence ) which can modify it @xcite . in most cases , \n the influence of decoherence during the evolution of a quantum walker transforms an originally pure state into a mixed state , lowering the uncertainty about the location of the walker as it propagates . in the limiting case , when all cross - interference terms between different lattice sites are completely erased , \n the state of pure diffusive classical propagation is reached @xcite . \n qrws have been theoretically explored for the case of one - dimensional lattices @xcite , and experimentally implemented by means of different physical platforms , such as photon - based systems @xcite , optical lattices @xcite and waveguide arrays @xcite . \n also , qrws have been implemented using trapped ions @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite . \n although the implementation of one - dimensional qrws has showed to be useful when describing several quantum information systems , there is a great interest in expanding the concept to multidimensional lattices . along these lines , \n two - dimensional qrws provide a powerful tool for modeling complex quantum information and energy transport systems @xcite . \n notwithstanding , their realization represents a challenge because of the need of a four - level coin operation @xcite . \n one way to overcome this drawback is to make use of different degrees of freedom of photons , such as polarization and orbital angular momentum , as it has been shown in @xcite . \n another approach is to mimic the two - dimensional qrws evolution by performing two subsequent one - dimensional qrws @xcite .    here , we make use of the latter approach to put forward an experimental setup for the realization of two - dimensional qrws . \n we include the environmental effects ( decoherence ) as pure dephasing by means of the introduction of random phase patterns , generated by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , which can be different from site to site ( _ spatial disorder _ ) . by controlling the degree of decoherence \n , we study the transition from the quantum ballistic spreading to the diffusive classical walk . \n also , by adding static disorder , we show the possibility of observing anderson localization @xcite . \n importantly , our proposal provides a versatile , highly - scalable experimental setup , which may be used as a tool for understanding quantum processes whose underlying physics can be somehow traced to the concept of random walks , such as energy transport in photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes @xcite and material band gap structures @xcite . \n the structure of the article is as follows . in sec . \n ii , we introduce the qrw model system , including dephasing , considered here \n . the proposed experimental setup is described in sec . \n numerical results are discussed in sec . \n finally , we summarize our results in the conclusion . \n a typical discrete quantum random walk comprises two operations : a coin - tossing operation and a shift operation . here \n , the coin - tossing operation is performed in the hilbert space @xmath0 spanned by vectors @xmath1 , corresponding to the photon polarization . \n the random walk is performed in the hilbert space @xmath2 , corresponding to the position of the photon in the transverse plane , spanned by vectors @xmath3 ( @xmath4 integers ) , which indicate sites ( @xmath4 ) in the transverse plane ( @xmath5 . the global quantum system thus evolve in the hilbert space @xmath6    the state of the system is described by the density matrix @xmath7 , which is transformed to a new density matrix each step @xmath8 via the map @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the hadamard operator @xmath11 which acts on the polarization degree of freedom . \n the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which describe the walker s shift in the transverse dimensions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , independently , read as @xmath16 and @xmath17    the coupling of the quantum walker with the environment is described by pure dephasing @xcite . \n the form of the unitary dephasing operator considered here can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a random phase matrix and @xmath20 is the pauli operator . \n inspection of eq . \n ( [ eq:6 ] ) shows that @xmath19 represents a newly introduced phase difference between the horizontal and vertical polarizations at each site . \n concerning this , we will consider three physically relevant scenarios , that can be easily implemented in the set - up proposed here ( see sec . \n iii ) . in the general case , \n the phase differences @xmath19 are independent random variables , but with the same probability distribution . \n moreover , the ensemble of phase differences @xmath19 can change from step @xmath8 to step @xmath21 . in the following \n , we will refer to this case as a qrw influenced by _ \n dynamical spatial disorder_.        the easiest probability distribution that we can consider is an uniform probability distribution . if phases can be chosen arbitrarily between the extreme values @xmath22 and @xmath23 , \n there is a constant probability @xmath24 to obtain any phase in this interval . \n @xmath25 is the maximal phase which we can have between the two orthogonal polarizations . \n @xmath26 corresponds to the absence of any spatial disorder . if phases do not change during propagation , \n even though they might differ from site to site , i.e. @xmath27 , then we have _ static spatial disorder_. finally , if all phase differences are the same for all sites , but they can still change from one step to the following , we have _ dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder_.    the probability of detecting a photon in the site ( @xmath4 ) is @xmath28| i , j\\rangle , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where the density matrix that describes the whole system is traced out over the polarization degree of freedom @xmath29 . \n the spreading of the uncertainty of photon location is characterized by dependence of the variance on the step index n    @xmath30    where @xmath31 represents the lattice site with indexes ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath32 is the mean position , i.e. , @xmath33 . \n the main building block of the qrw setup is the multi - path mach - zehnder - like configuration shown in fig . \n 1 . it allows to make several runs of the qrw without the necessity of using a large amount of optical components , as it is the case , for instance , of the experiment described in @xcite . \n a similar scheme , based on a single - path mach - zehnder - like configuration has been used @xcite . however in these cases , the walker moves in time , whereas in our proposal the walker moves in the two - dimensional transverse plane , offering a way to simplify the experimental implementation of the two - dimensional qrw . \n as source of photons one can use a highly attenuated short coherent pulse , prepared by the combination of a photon source and attenuator ( at ) , generating the initial state @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the central site . \n the duration of the pulse has to be sufficiently smaller than the time - of - fly through the setup in one cycle . \n the transverse size of the gaussian beam profile of the pulse has to be carefully chosen , so that two adjacent sites are not overlapping in the space due to diffraction . \n for instance , by making use of a gaussian beam of 2 mm beam waist , corresponding to a rayleigh range of 23.6 m ( for a wavelength @xmath36 = 532 nm ) , along with typical - sized optical components , we could in principle perform a qrw of approximately more than 20 steps . \n the number of steps can be further improved by applying smaller beams together with a re - focusing system placed along the walker s path . \n alternatively , a spontaneous parametric down - conversion source can be used , provided each down - converted photon is generated in a pure state . \n then , the photon is transmitted via the beam splitter ( bs ) to the system .    to get a clearer picture of the working of the quantum random \n walk , let us consider in detail the quantum state of the photon in its first passage through the system . first , the polarization state of the photon is changed by the half - wave plate ( hwp1 ) to @xmath37 $ ] , i.e. , the hadamard ( @xmath10 ) operation is applied . after this transformation , the photon is displaced by the horizontal beam displacer ( hbd ) along the @xmath14 axis according to its polarization , as described by the shift operator @xmath12 . \n the photon is now in the state @xmath38.$ ] a second half - wave plate ( hwp2 ) implements a new hadamard transformation , which transforms the quantum state to @xmath39 . \n the vertical beam displacer ( vbd ) shifts the position of the photon along the @xmath15 axis . after this \n , the quantum state of the photon reads    @xmath40 . \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the spatial light modulator ( slm ) is used to introduce random phases , given by the phase - matrix @xmath19 . after the photon passes through the slm , the whole cycle is repeated with high probability . \n if not , the photon escapes through the other output port of the beam - splitter , which directs it towards a highly sensitive ( single - photon sensitivity ) intensified ccd camera with integrated photo - multipliers , which allows to spatially resolve a weak signal with a high efficiency ( @xmath4190% ) @xcite . \n moreover , losses in the setup can be compensated by an increase of the amplitude of pulse . \n the size of whole array of beams can be reduced by an auxiliary imaging system in order to fit on the limited size of sensitive area of ccd .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig:5 ]    the photon position is less dramatic than in the case with dynamical spatial disorder . for the dynamical spatial disorder , @xmath42 for @xmath25 after 20 steps . on the contrary , for dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder , we have @xmath43 under the same conditions . \n indeed , the @xmath8-dependence of the typical deviation , characteristic of the classical regime , it is not yet reached after @xmath44 steps , as is readily observed in fig . \n 4(b ) .      in the context of our discussion \n , the anderson localization is the reduction of spreading of the uncertainty of the photon position @xcite . we will demonstrate that this effect can also be observed in the set - up considered here . in @xcite , anderson localization was observed in the transverse plane of a light beam passing through a crystal with random static fluctuations of the index of refraction . since the randomness in the index of refraction is affecting only the phase of the propagating beam , it is possible to imitate these phase - fluctuations with a slm , under the consideration of static spatial disorder , since anderson localization does not appear with dynamical spatial disorder .    in fig . \n 5(a ) we present a typical profile of the phase - matrix @xmath19 , independent of n , which leads to beam localization . \n 5(b ) shows the corresponding probability distribution of the photon position for this specific phase profile . \n notice that it contains a strong peak located in the middle of the lattice . \n the presence of anderson localization is confirmed in fig . \n 5(c ) , where we show the averaged probability distribution function for @xmath25 , exhibiting an exponential suppression of probabilities for sites distant from the center . for the sake of clarity , we also plotted in fig . \n 5(d ) two cuts of the averaged probability distribution along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes , to highlight this feature . \n we have put forward a new , highly scalable and easily implemented experimental configuration to observe spatial two - dimensional random walks under a great variety of circumstances , by means of the implementation of two consecutive one - dimensional random walks . \n the proposal makes use of only a small amount of simple optics components , and allows us to simulate many different quantum systems and protocols based on the quantum random walk concept . additionally , by carefully controlling the amount and type of disorder present in the system \n , we have shown the effects of different environmental effects : dynamical spatial disorder , dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder and static spatial disorder . \n the last case drove us to the observation of anderson localization . \n the control of environmental effects is paramount importance in nearly all quantum systems . in some cases , it is even crucial to understand the dynamics experimentally observe . \n for instance , in light harvesting complexes @xcite , the interplay between coherent evolution and noise is a critical ingredient , which allows to obtain a high efficiency energy transport . \n the authors thank to dr . \n jan soubusta for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by project nos . \n fis2010 - 14831 and fet - open 255914 ( phorbitech ) . \n thanks the project fi - dgr 2011 of the catalan government . \n this work has also supported in part and by projects cost oc 09026 , cz.1.05/2.1.00/03.0058 of the ministry of education , youth and sports of the czech republic and by project prf-2012 - 003 of palack university . \n a.  peruzzo , m.  lobino , j.  c.  f.  matthews , n.  matsuda , a.  politi , k.  poulios , x.  zhou , y.  lahini , n.  ismail , k.  wrhoff , y.  bromberg , y.  silberberg , m.  g.  thompson , and j.  l.  obrien , science * 329 * , 1500 ( 2010 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 238945131632, "RequestID": "9d09da304add4ca7bf5def63592e3363", "TotalTokens": 3630}

stationary during the time @xmath83 . in recent times \n , bonanno and urpin has shown that this instability exists in many cases of interest @xcite . \n the presence of this instability has also been demonstrated in the case of protostellar disks @xcite also . \n it is clear that the instability discussed in the present report appears in many astrophysical situations including protoplanatery disk ( albeit with small growth rate ) . \n this instability is different and independent of the magnetorotational instability . \n the necessary and sufficient condition for this instability to occur is @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath84 ; therefore ,    \\1 ) the instability exists for non vanishing radial and azimuthal component of magnetic field whereas the poloidal component of magnetic field is important for mri to occur . \n mri can exits for vanishing radial and azimuthal fields . \n \\2 ) the instability exists for any differential rotation , i.e. for any sign of @xmath85 whereas mri exists only when the angular velocity in the disk decreases outwards , i.e. @xmath86 . \n \\3 ) the instability exists even in sufficiently strong magnetic field which suppresses the magnetorotational instability . \n mri exists only in the weak field limit . \n a special case was considered in the present report where wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath32 . since the growth rate of mri is directly proportional to the @xmath87 , mri does not exists in this case . \n this is one of the most important differences between the present instability and the mri . \n it is observed that a high growth rate is reached for large values of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . if @xmath90(typical in keplerian disk ) , \n the magnetic energy density is greater than the rotational energy density . \n therefore , the present instability will be operating in a regime where `` magnetic energy density more that the rotational energy density '' can be realized . for an accretion disk , the rotational energy ( essentially by definition ) \n is larger than all other energies thermal , magnetic , radiation . \n so , the rotationally supported accretion disk are out of question to envisage the regions where magnetic energy density is more than rotational energy density . \n one possible realization of such regions might appear when one inches towards the inner most region of accretion disk , where the disk starts truncating / evaporating and the rotational support starts getting diminishing and magnetic field takes over . \n a standard pulsar ( or even more a magnetar ) meets this condition . \n consider a @xmath91 g surface field on a pulsar . \n several scale heights away from the star the density is very small , so the rotational energy density is much less than the magnetic energy density . \n if we consider the low - density regions far above the disk then any magnetic bubble that floats away after reconnection could temporarily have a larger magnetic energy density than rotational energy density . \n the scenario closest to our regime was considered by begelman and pringle @xcite where magnetic pressure exceeds the combined gas + radiation pressure in the disk but not the rotational energy density . for magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in accretion disk , \n the balance is achieved via the joint action of rotation , pressure gradients and magnetic tension . for the regions mentioned above \n , one can not count on rotation . \n it is important to identify a robust equilibrium about which to perturb , perhaps gradients in pressure or radiation pressure could help in the inner disk regions . \n one needs to solve such scenario theoretically . \n we will consider this scenario in a future work . \n in the present report , we have demonstrated the presence of very high growth rate instability in a differentially rotating compressible flows . \n it has been shown that the growth rate of this instability is very high and for a special case considered above , the growth rate increases to as high as @xmath92 for @xmath59 . \n it is observed that the present instability might be operating in regions where magnetic energy density is more than the rotational energy density . \n the author thanks c. miller , v. urpin and b.p.pandey for the insightful discussions . \n the author also thanks both the anonymous referees for their useful comments . \n this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system and arxiv.org e -

detached , contact ) . \n this will provide us with a representative sample of the huge zoo of eclipsing binary stars within the observational capabilities of the coming esa cornerstone  6 mission .    nevertheless , a few brief statements are in order to comment on the promising results on well detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries of a , f spectral types of a few days orbital period obtained here .      in this paper we used a mean of 23 spectra per star , spread over a wide range of s / n . \n table  2 ) . \n orbital separations and individual masses are constrained to @xmath30.7% and @xmath31.5% , respectively . \n thus the selected @xmath4250   wavelength range between 8490 and 8740   is working fine for spectral types a and f , even though it was optimized for cooler stars ( the vast majority of field stars in the range of magnitude of interest to gaia are g and k stars ) . \n gaia will record the majority of its spectra at s / n lower than obtained for this paper , but this will be compensated by a much larger number of spectra per star , typically 150 . \n it is therefore quite possible that a sizeable fraction of the well detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries of a - f spectral type observed by gaia will have their orbital separation and masses of both components determined to an accuracy of @xmath31% provided that the spectral dispersion and resolution will be not too far from 0.25  / pix and 0.5  , respectively . \n the baricentric velocities are constrained to better than 0.5 km sec@xmath5 , which is fine in comparison to the accuracy of gaia tangential motions , and also adequate to resolve the internal kinematics of stellar aggregates ( clusters , associations , etc . )        for the program stars we adopted @xmath6 because modeling excluded any eccentricity larger than 0.01 , which can be taken as a rough indication of the accuracy to which eccentricity could be determined by gaia observations . \n periods for the three program stars have been determined to such an accuracy that it would take @xmath7170 years ( on the average ) to bring the ephemeris out of phase for more than 10%  of the orbital period . \n the 5 years of gaia operation ( compared to the time span of 3.36 years for hipparcos data or 1.38 years for the spectral data used here ) , should expand the 10% accuracy horizon of the ephemeris to @xmath7250 years . \n hipparcos has collected about 110 measurements per star . \n if eclipses last for 1/10 or less of the orbital period , one has to expect 10 or less photometric points to be distributed over the eclipse phases . \n gaia will have three lines of view ( at @xmath3120 deg ) . \n if the same set of core photometric bands is present in _ all _ the three channels ( a feature yet to be optimized in the currently baselined gaia design ) , the number of collected photometric points will proportionally increase with great benefit not only to the study of eclipsing binaries but also to variable stars in general . \n effective temperatures and surface gravities are in fact two of the basic output of spectral synthesis analysis ( e.g.  based on kurucz model atmospheres ) . \n the 0.25  / pix dispersion and 0.5   resolution gaia spectra used here are quite adequate to derive temperatures to @xmath830  k and gravities to 0.1 dex ( cf . \n munari and castelli 2000 ) . \n the analysis of gaia spectra of eclipsing binaries ( mainly those obtained at quadratures when spectra of both components are better observed ) would therefore provide these quantities directly .    the effective temperature and surface gravity determined directly from gaia spectra \n could then be used to check _ a posteriori _ the results of modeling or used as inputs in the modeling process to decrease the number of variables . \n a natural check about the goodness of the orbital solution and modeling is to compare the distance to the program stars computed from the modeling parameters in table  4 with the trigonometric parallaxes measured by hipparcos . \n this is done in table  5 , together with the distance to v505  per from the modeling of marshall et al . \n ( 1997 ) . \n the high expected performances of gaia observations are confirmed : ( @xmath1 ) the modeling of photometric lightcurves and radial velocity curves for the three program stars constrains the distance to a better accuracy than hipparcos trigonometric parallax , and ( @xmath2 ) modeling distances and hipparcos parallaxes agree inside the respective errors .    as for the effective temperature and surface gravity , trigonometric parallaxes determined directly by gaia ( at an average 200@xmath9 better precision than hipparcos ) \n could then be used to check _ a posteriori _ the results of modeling or used as an input value in the modeling process itself . \n the unique characteristic of gaia as a single mission which combines astrometry , spectroscopy and photometry appears to offer special advantages compared to the classical ground - based approach to eclipsing binaries . \n the possibility to use effective temperatures , surface gravities and trigonometric parallaxes as fixed input values to the modeling of lightcurves and radial velocities should allow more confident derivation of other parameters , both stimulating a new modeling approach to eclipsing binaries and also granting lower errors to the solution .    by probing all constituents of the galaxy ( halo , disk , bulge ) and detecting eclipsing binaries there \n , gaia can foster an epochal leap in our knowledge of the basic stellar parameters and how they vary with mass , age and chemical abundance . \n this will be true not only on statistical grounds ( given the huge number of observable eclipsing systems ) but also for an object by object approach . \n this paper has in fact shown that an accuracy of 1% in the derived stellar parameters can be achieved by gaia on a fraction of the detached eclipsing binaries observed during the mission . \n andersen j. 1991 , a&a review 3 , 91 carquillat j.m . , nadal r. , ginestet n. , pedoussaut a. 1982 , a&a 115 , 23 castelli , f. , munari u. , 2001 , 366 , 1003 gilmore g. , perryman m. , lindegren l. favata f. , hoeg e. , lattanzi m. , luri x. , mignard f. , roeser s. , de zeeuw p.t . , 1998 , proc spie conference 3350 , p. 541 kallrath , j. , milone , e.f . 1999 , _ eclipsing binary stars : modeling and analysis \n , springer -

{"ContextTokens": 3389, "GeneratedTokens": 309, "SynthesizedBody": "the alice experiment is dedicated to the studies of the properties of the deconfined qcd medium ( quark - gluon plasma , qgp ) by conducting ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the lhc  @xcite . \n a significant increase of the luminosity for heavy ions is expected in run 3 after long shutdown 2 ( ls2 ) , which implies a collision rate of about 50 khz and @xmath0 = 10 nb@xmath1 . \n this luminosity upgrade provides a substantial enhancement of capabilities for measuring observables relevant to the characterization of the qgp at the highest temperatures  @xcite .    in order to exploit the scientific potential of the high - luminosity heavy - ion program in run  3 , alice plans to extend its physics reach by upgrading the alice detector . \n the major goals of the upgraded alice detector are as follows ; precision measurements of heavy - quark and quarkonia production at low transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) to study the mechanisms of heavy - quark thermalization and interactions in the medium , production of low - mass dielectrons to extract information on thermodynamical properties of the medium and to characterize the chiral phase transition , jets and jet correlations to reveal the mechanisms of partonic energy loss in the medium  @xcite . \n the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is one of the main tracking and pid devices in the central barrel of the alice detector . \n it provides precise charged - particle tracking , momentum measurement , and particle identification in very high multiplicity heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . \n the readout rate of the tpc is currently limited by the necessity to prevent ions generated in the the amplification region of the mwpc - based readout chambers from drifting back into the drift volume , which is achieved through active ion gating by operating a dedicated gating grid . \n the relevant ion drift times limit the maximum trigger rate of the tpc to about 3.5 khz . \n operation of the current tpc with the mpwc - based readout scheme and the current active ion gating scheme at 50 khz pb - pb collisions in run  3 can not be possible . \n on the other hand , operation of the current tpc with continuously open gating grid can not be the solution since back - drifting ions from the amplification region will lead to excessive ion charge densities and distortions of the electric field in the drift volume . \n the proposed scheme to acquire high rate operational capability and a small number of back - drifting ions is to replace the existing mwpc - based readout chambers and gating grid system by a multi - layer gas electron multiplier ( gem ) system and to run the tpc in an ungated continuous mode . \n gems have been developed to cope with the stringent requirements for high - luminosity experiments  @xcite and have proven to provide excellent position resolution , to have very high rate capability , and better ion blocking capability compared to mwpc . \n the main considerations for the tpc upgrade and the design requirements are as follows  @xcite :    * the maximum ion backflow ( ibf ) that can be tolerated is about 1% at a gain of 2000 in ne - co@xmath3-n@xmath3 ( 90 - 10 - 5 ) , i.e. 20 back - drifting ions per incoming primary electron ( @xmath4 = 20 ) . * in case of ibf = 1% , space - charge field distortions reach 20  cm and 8  cm in @xmath5 and @xmath6 at small @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in the tpc , respectively . in order to preserve the present momentum resolution , online and offline distortion corrections with a precision better than 500  @xmath9 m , i.e. a few times 10@xmath10 , \n are required . * due to the limited bandwidth of the data acquisition system , reduction of data flow size by a factor of 20 is needed in the online reconstruction by finding the clusters associated to tracks . \n * the upgraded tpc must preserve the performance of the existing system in terms of particle identification via d@xmath11/d@xmath12 , implying a local energy resolution better than 12% ( at 5.9 kev ) . \n an extensive r&d program has been started in 2012 to study the performance of gem - based detectors ( ibf , gain stability , discharge probability ) , technology choice ( gem stacks including the combination of gems with different pitches , cobra - gem , 2 gem + micromegas system ) , large prototype production by single mask technology , electronics r&d , and simulation studies to establish the strategy for space - charge distortion corrections . \n our baseline solution comprises stacks of 4 gem layers , where 1st and 4th gems are standard gems with 140  @xmath9 m pitch , 50  @xmath9 m thickness , and 70 ( 50 )  @xmath9 m outer ( inner ) hole diameter , and 2nd and 3rd gems are large pitch gem foils with 280  @xmath9 m pitch , 50  @xmath9 m thickness , and 70 ( 50 )  @xmath9 m outer ( inner ) hole diameter . \n this setup allows to block ions efficiently by employing low / high fields above / below gems and foils with low optical transparency . \n figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the results of the measured ibf and energy resolution at 5.9 kev at a gain of 2000 for a 4-gem system , where the voltage across gem1 increases from left to right along the x - axis . \n it can be seen that an ibf of 0.7% is achieved at an energy resolution of 12% ( at 5.9 kev ) the observed anti - correlation between ibf and resolution is related to the gains of the first two gems : higher electron multiplication at the early stages improves the energy resolution , while it results in larger number of ions escaping into the drift region . \n detailed simulations based on garfield++  @xcite were performed to describe the observed ibf performance . \n it was found that ibf is very sensitive to the alignment of the gem holes in consecutive layers , which can not be controlled experimentally . \n the measured ibf values are best reproduced in simulations , if a random misalignment of the holes is assumed , corresponding to the most probable relative geometrical position of gem foils in a stack . \n /d@xmath12 spectrum of 1  gev/@xmath13 electrons and pions recorded at a gain of @xmath14 5000 measured with an iroc prototype employing a triple stack of large - size gem foils . \n ( y - axis shows the number of counts and x - axis shows d@xmath11/d@xmath12 ( a.u.).,width=330 ]    /d@xmath12 spectrum of 1  gev/@xmath13 electrons and pions recorded at a gain of @xmath14 5000 measured with an iroc prototype employing a triple stack of large -

mask technology developed by the mpgd workshop at cern . \n beam test was carried out at the ps - t10 beamline and the d@xmath11/d@xmath12 resolution was studied as function of the transfer fields and voltages across gems . \n figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows the d@xmath11/d@xmath12 spectra of 1  gev/@xmath13 electrons and pions recorded at a gain of @xmath14 5000 . \n the energy resolution is 10.5% for the ibf - optimized field configurations and the resolution is comparable to the d@xmath11/d@xmath12 resolution of the current tpc .    an alternative solution is a system combining 2 gems with a micromegas detector . \n micromegas ( mm ) provides low ibf due to the larger ratio of the electric field values in the small amplification gap to the drift field above the mm . if the mm employs a fine mesh ( 400 - 1000 lpi ) , ibf is close to the ratio between two fields itself  @xcite . \n the ibf and energy resolution for this hybrid 2-gem + mm system were measured , using a 10 @xmath15 10 @xmath16 prototype detector . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig5 ] , where an ibf of  0.2% is reached at an energy resolution of 12% at 5.9 kev . \n a large - scale solution for the inner and outer tpc readout chambers and the operational stability will be verified in the future . \n r73 mm        the new scheme also required the development of new front - end electronics to cope with the reversed polarity , the requirements for continuous readout , and the increased data throughput in high rate pb - pb collisions . \n a new front - end asic called sampa has been developed , which integrates the functionality of the present preamp / shaper and altro adc+dsp ( digital signal processing ) and supports continuous or triggered readout  @xcite . \n first mpw ( multi - project wafer ) submission was done in april 2013 and further developments are ongoing . \n online and offline reconstruction and calibration are very challenging due to the demand of data compression and requirement of the space - charge distortion corrections . \n currently a two - stage reconstruction scheme is under consideration . in the first stage of the reconstruction , \n an averaged space - charge distortion map scaled to the averaged multiplicity for certain time intervals is used for the distortion corrections , and cluster finding and cluster - track association are performed , which leads to a data compression by a factor of 20 . \n full tracking with the external detectors ( inner tracking system + transition radiation detector ) will be performed in the 2nd stage of the reconstruction , where a high - resolution space - charge map being updated every 5  msec is generated for the full distortion corrections . \n figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the expected @xmath2 resolution in 50 khz pb - pb collisions without any space - charge distortions ( left ) , with space - charge distortion and distortion corrections at the first stage ( middle ) , and with space - charge distortion and full distortion corrections at 2nd stage of reconstruction ( right ) . in these calculations , space - charge fluctuations mainly due to the number of pileup events and charged particle multiplicities \n are taken into account . the obtained @xmath2 resolution after the 2nd reconstruction stage is comparable to that without distortions , if tpc - its global tracks are considered . \n to exploit the full potential of the high luminosity of the lhc in run 3 , the alice program for run 3 requires an upgrade of the tpc . \n the heart of the tpc upgrade is to replace the mwpc - based readout chambers by detectors employing micro - pattern detectors including gems to allow tpc operation in continuous mode . \n extensive detector r&d and simulations have been conducted and a baseline scenario for the detector design has been established . \n quadruple stacks of gem layers with different gem pitches provide the required ibf and energy resolution . also a design based on a hybrid configuration of gems and micromegas is studied . \n simulations show that the performance of the present tpc can be retained in 50 khz pb - pb collisions after distortion corrections . \n further studies of the long - term stability , uniformity of the gain and ibf , and discharge probability are being conducted . \n iroc prototypes employing a 4-gem stack and a hybrid 2-gem + mm system are being built and beam tests will be carried out at the ps and the sps in the fall of 2014 . \n alice collaboration , `` the alice experiment at the cern lhc '' , jinst 3.08 ( 2008 ) , s08002 . \n doi : 10.1088/1748 -

 1500  v has been applied to the photo multiplier tube ( pmt ) of sc-01 for signal collection . in a separate study \n we have observed that the efficiency of the detectors reaches a constant ( plateau ) value close to 100% at high voltage beyond -  1450  v. the signals from the scintillator have been fed to the discriminator . \n the discriminator threshold has been increased in equal interval of 0.5  mv from an initial threshold value of 7.5  mv . for each discriminator threshold setting the count rate has been measured with the source and also without source , taking the total counts in the scaler in a particular time .    for the cosmic ray muon detection a constant voltage of -

 1500  v. mip peak seems to have developed around @xmath10  30  mv but large noise peak ( below 20  mv ) masks it . \n this peak come due to our assumption that the noise level are nearly same for the two consecutive threshold settings , which is not true for the very low threshold . from the cosmic ray spectra obtained from sc-01 and sc-02 it is also clear that at most probable value ( mpv ) of the count rate is nearly double for the sc-02 relative to sc-01 as the area of the sc-02 ( area 100 @xmath11 ) which is nearly double of that of the sc-01 ( area 49 @xmath11 ) . \n as the calibration curve has been drawn for the sc-01 at -

ionized igm , and the magnetic field strength . \n the full set of equations is given in @xcite and was implemented in the recfast code @xcite . in particular , the magnetic energy decreases with time due to adiabatic expansion and dissipation into heat through ambipolar diffusion . \n for strong fields this can change substantially the thermal and ionization history of the igm , although full reionization can not be achieved this way , as collisions induced by ambipolar diffusion become inefficient at high temperatures .    with the calculation results , \n the thompson scattering optical depth is computed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the thompson scattering cross section and the effective ionization degree is @xmath47 contributed by both the fully ionized volume fraction as well as the partially ionized gas . \n in the following , we set the upper limits on the comoving magnetic field strength , @xmath2 , using the thomson optical depth ( a redshift - integrated quantity ) as well as the the observed ionization degree at @xmath3 . we discuss the uncertainties due to the cosmological parameters , the reionization parameters and the observed uv luminosity function . \n finally , we discuss the possibility of more stringent constraints from future progress on the high redshift igm . \n [ fig : tau ] shows the constraints on @xmath2 due to the observed optical depth , @xmath48 , and its uncertainties . starting from our reference case in the top panel , we see that for weak magnetic fields the optical depth is well within the @xmath16 range of wmap7 results . as @xmath2 increases the low - luminosity cut - off of halos contributing ionizing photons is raised and at @xmath49 ng \n , @xmath48 starts to drop . \n it reaches a minimum at several ng and then , as collisional ionization resulting from heating due to ambipolar diffusion kicks in , @xmath48 increases again  ( however , values of several ng for @xmath2 , would be inconsistent with cmb observations , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n this is the qualitative trend in all panels of fig . 1 , 2 and 3 . \n the top panel also shows the effects of @xmath50 variations of the cosmological parameters , on @xmath48 . for the purpose of the current discussion , * higher * values of @xmath51 and smaller values of @xmath52 increase the value of @xmath48 and thus weaken the constrain on @xmath2 . \n thus , the constraint on @xmath2 is set by the highest curve , which says that the required field strength at the 95% cl limit is @xmath21  ng . note also that adopting a cosmology as in @xcite would have minor effects on our results .    in the mid panel \n we consider instead the effect due to uncertainties in the reionization parameters . \n such uncertainties can in principle be very large . \n however , a large clumping factor @xmath53 is inconsistent with the observed ionization fraction ( see fig . \n 2 ) even in the limit of weak magnetic fields . likewise , \n a very large escape fraction @xmath54 produce too high an ionization rate at @xmath55  @xcite . with these considerations , \n a meaningful 95% cl upper limit of 2ng is implied by our results . \n finally , in the bottom panel we consider the uncertainties due to 3@xmath56 observational errors in the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , of the schechter function . here , it is large values of @xmath59 or @xmath31 that increase @xmath48 , and therefore weaken our constraint . \n thus , the highest curve on the plot shows that the computed value of @xmath48 remains within @xmath60 of the wmap7 result for @xmath613ng . \n note that the redshift evolution of the schechter function parameters is also very uncertain , but we have verified that it does not lead to more significant uncertainties on the current constraints . \n we thus arrive at a 95% cl upper limit of @xmath62  ng on @xmath2 . \n [ fig : ion ] shows the constraints due to the observed ionization degree , @xmath63 , and its uncertainties . following the analysis of  @xcite \n , the igm is assumed mostly ionized at @xmath3 . \n note that for the present purposes the accurate value of the ionization degree is not crucial and even a 90% value would lead to very strong constraints independent of the specifically adopted cl . in our reference case ( top panel ) \n , we find at @xmath64 an ionization degree close to 1 for co - moving field strengths up to @xmath65  ng . for increasing field strengths \n , @xmath63 drops rapidly , as the magnetic jeans mass increases with @xmath66 , significantly suppressing the production of ionizing photons . thus considering all the uncertainties due to the cosmological parameters \n leads to @xmath67ng . \n as already discussed for the optical depth , the uncertainties due to the reionization parameters are considerably higher ( mid panel ) . \n however , cases with high clumping factors , low escape fractions or low igm temperatures and even very high escape fraction  @xcite are inconsistent even in the limit of weak magnetic fields . for the remaining cases , the ionization degree drops rapidly for @xmath2 above a ng , and the most conservative upper limit corresponds again to @xmath68 2ng . \n as for the uncertainties in the parameters of the schechter function bottom panel of fig . \n [ fig : ion ] shows that some extreme values can be ruled out because inconsistent with the ionization degree at @xmath64 , even with negligible @xmath2 . \n however , the most important source of uncertainty for the upper limit on @xmath2 are those related to @xmath31 . \n this forces our constraint to @xmath61 3ng . \n this constraint will be improved once the schechter function is observed more accurately . \n again , we checked that the uncertainties in the redshift evolution have no impact on our results.from the observed ionization degree , we thus find an overall constraint @xmath4  ng .    in fig . \n [ fig : redshift ] we show the ionization degree at different redshifts as a function of the co - moving field strength . \n the plot illustrates the sensitivity of our constraint to the redshift at which the ionization degree is measured \n . in particular our constraint would be slightly weaker if based on data at @xmath69 , while it would considerably improve if a high ionization degree at @xmath70 could be observationally established . at even higher redshifts , \n our model predicts the presence of a substantial neutral fraction in the igm which could be translated into a further independent constraint . \n using the combined constraints from the observed thomson optical depth , the ionization degree of the igm at @xmath64 and the observed uv luminosity function at high redshifts , we have derived robust upper limits of @xmath71  ng , virtually independent of the cl , on the strength of primordial magnetic fields . \n previous work  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see also introduction ) found similar limits but generally was based on the thomson optical depth only , used less refined physical models , had a lower cl . \n however , the similarity of conclusion also suggests that we are approaching the intrinsic limitation of the methods . \n our results are mostly based on the lower cutoff of the luminosity function of galaxies contributing ionizing photons , set by the magnetic jeans mass ( eq .  [ jeansb ] ) . on the other hand , \n heating effects due to ambipolar diffusion are important for @xmath2 close to 10 ng , which is ruled out by cmb observations . \n our constraints on the primordial magnetic field would be mostly strengthened by measurements of a high ionization degree at redshift @xmath72 . \n this is simply because the earlier the igm is reionized , the more important becomes the contribution of ionizing photons from halos whose collapse is hindered by primordial magnetic fields . \n however , improvements beyond an order of magnitude are likely out of reach , as the formation of structure at the magnetic jeans mass corresponding to 10@xmath73 g ( see eq .  [ jeansb ] ) is severely affected by other feedback processes  ( see , e.g. , discussion in * ? ? ? \n other limiting factors in the derivation of our constraints are mostly due to uncertainties in the uv luminosity function at high redshift and lack of information about the igm ionization fraction at redshift higher than 7 . \n there is reason to expect good progress in these areas in the near future . \n for example , jwst will provide a unique opportunity to probe the igm at and beyond redshift @xmath74 , lyman @xmath57 emitters may provide additional information on the strength of the photoionizing background ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , while the planck satellite will provide an improved measurement of the thomson optical depth . \n these additional data may help to improve our understanding both with respect to reionization and the origin of magnetic fields . \n we thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments and r. banerjee , b. ciardi , c. federrath , d. galli , r.s . \n klessen and r. salvaterra for stimulating discussions .", "StartTimeOffset": 326307541507, "RequestID": "4a5bad7b275a496d8039b4129e583155", "TotalTokens": 4371}

{"ContextTokens": 3248, "GeneratedTokens": 294, "SynthesizedBody": "since hydrogen is one of the best clean fuels in the future , looking for an ideal storage material has become an important task for experimental and theoretical researchers . among all the candidates , magnesium ( mg ) based materials are widely concerned because they are relatively inexpensive and can hold a high weight percentage of hydrogen @xcite . \n so the interaction between hydrogen and mg has been extensively studied @xcite . \n the main disadvantage that prevents the vast applications of mg for hydrogen storage lies in that the corresponding hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures are large @xcite . \n recently , it is found that the aluminum ( al ) doped mgal thin films have much lower hydrogenation temperatures than pure mg films @xcite . \n however , the specific reason for the improvement as well as the influence of al doping on the electronic properties of mg films , remains unclear . \n so , in order to advance the searches for ideal hydrogen storage materials and applications of hydrogen fuels , it become quite important to make clear the influence of al doping on the electronic structure of mg and the the interaction between hydrogen and mg . \n apart from the potential usages in hydrogen storage , mgal alloys are also important industrial materials used in aerospace applications @xcite . \n it is always believed that the al doping makes mg more resistent to being corrupted by air . \n so lots of efforts have been applied to upgrade the manufacturing techniques to dope al in mg materials , and now the technology has become quite mature . \n studying the interactions between small molecules and al - doped mg surfaces can give us critical information about the mechanisms for al doping to improve the resistance of mg to corruption , and thus are very meaningful and necessary . \n based on this background and the requirements of hydrogen storage materials , we here perform first principles calculations to systematically study the influence of al doping on the electronic properties of the mg(0001 ) surface and the adsorption behavior of hydrogen molecules . \n previous studies have revealed that the mg(0001 ) surface has both considerable @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic states distributing around the fermi energy , because of the @xmath3 hybridizations @xcite . \n here we further find that after doping of an al atom , the electronic structures around the fermi energy mainly distribute around the doping layer . \n for the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the clean mg(0001 ) surface , it has been found that the most energetically favored site is the surface bridge site @xcite , with the corresponding minimum energy barrier of 0.85 ev @xcite . through our present first - principles calculations , we find that al - doping will not change the most energetically favored dissociation channel . \n however , the minimum energy barrier for dissociation of hydrogen is critically dependent on the doping depth of al , and the values are all larger than that on the clean mg(0001 ) surface . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec . \n ii , we describe our fist - principles calculation method and the models used in this paper . in sec . \n iii , we present in detail our calculated results , including the comparisons of the electronic structures of the mg(0001 ) surface before and after al doping , and the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the al - doped mg(0001 ) surface . at \n last , the conclusion is given in sec . \n our calculations are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . \n the pw91 @xcite generalized gradient approximation and the projector - augmented wave potential @xcite are employed to describe the exchange - correlation energy and the electron - ion interaction , respectively . \n the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion is set to 250 ev , which is large enough to make the calculational error of the adsorption energy below 0.01 ev . \n the clean and al - doped mg(0001 ) surface are modeled by a slab composing of five atomic layers and a vacuum region of 20  . \n the @xmath4 supercell in which each monolayer contains four mg atoms are adopted in the study of the h@xmath0 adsorption . \n our test calculations have shown that the @xmath4 supercell is sufficiently large to avoid the interaction between adjacent hydrogen molecules . \n integration over the brillouin zone is done using the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite with @xmath5 grid points . \n a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.1 ev is chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around the fermi energy ( e@xmath6 ) by a finite-@xmath7 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath8 k. during geometry optimizations , the bottom layer of the clean and al - doped mg(0001 ) surface is fixed while other mg and al atoms are free to relax until the forces on them are less than 0.01 ev /  . \n the calculation of the potential energy surface for molecular h@xmath0 is interpolated to 209 points with different bond length ( @xmath9 ) and height ( @xmath10 ) of h@xmath11 at each surface site . the calculated lattice constant of bulk mg ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and the bond length of a free h@xmath11 molecule are 3.21  , 5.15    and 0.75  , respectively , in good agreement with the experimental values of 3.21  , 5.20   @xcite and 0.74   @xcite . \n as shown in fig . 1 , we have employed 3 different doping depths for al in the mg(0001 ) surface , with the al atom respectively in the first ( mgal1 ) , second ( mgal2 ) and third monolayer ( mgal3 ) . \n for the clean mg(0001 ) surface , our calculations reveal that the distances between the three topmost atomic layers are expanded from their bulk values , in accordance with previous theoretical @xcite and experimental reports @xcite . \n it is because that due to its special surface charge redistribution , the topmost three layers of the mg(0001 ) surface are negatively charged and hence repel each other . \n in fact , the surface expansion is a special phenomena for the mg(0001 ) surface , which is not seen for other surfaces of mg @xcite . and instead of expansions , the surface relaxations of many metals show contractions @xcite . the relaxation calculation for the clean mg(0001 ) surface also confirms the precise of our methods . \n however , after the doping of an al atom , the surface relaxation is changed . to describe more clearly the changes , here \n we define the surface relaxation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the distance between the @xmath17th and @xmath18th layer of the relaxed surface , and the lattice spacing along the ( 0001 ) direction of bulk mg . \n table i summarizes the calculated relaxations for the clean mg(0001 ) , mgal1 , mgal2 , and mgal3 surfaces . \n we can easily see from table i that the results critically depend on the doping length of the al atom . \n if the al atom is doped at the first ( i.e. the topmost ) layer , then the distance between the first and second layers is contracted by 3.00 % . and \n if the al atom is doped at the second layer , then @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively decreases by 2.60 % and 2.12 % . \n one can see that for the layer containing the doped al atom , the lattice spacings with its nearest mg layers are decreased a lot from that of bulk mg . \n this result is confirmed by the relaxation results of the mgal3 surface , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are decreased by 2.25 % and 2.12 % . by analyzing the atomic charges , we find that the neighboring mg atoms always lose electrons to the doped al atom . \n so the charging state of the doping layer and its neighboring mg layers are respectively negative and positive , and the interactions between them become attracting forces . thus the surface relaxation changes from expansion of the clean mg(0001 ) surface to the contraction after al doping . \n .surface relaxations ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and work function ( @xmath25 ) of the mg(0001 ) , mgal1 , mgal2 , and mgal3 surfaces . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tableii ]    for the dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules on most metal surfaces , it has been revealed that two different interactions exist , which are respectively the orthogonalizations between molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 and electronic states of metal , and the charge transfer from metal atoms to hydrogen atoms @xcite . as shown in fig . \n 2(b ) , we find that the al - doping did not change the metallic properties of the mg(0001 ) surface . \n so such two different interactions still exist for the dissociation of h@xmath0 on the mgal1 surface .    /mgal1 \n system with the height of h@xmath0 to be 2.00 ( a ) and 0.92    ( b ) . \n mg , al , and h atoms are shown in grey , dark grey , and red balls respectively . \n all the values are in unit of electrons per @xmath26.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figures 6(a ) and ( b ) respectively show the difference electron density for the adsorption system of h@xmath0/mgal1 before ( @xmath27=2.00  ) and after ( @xmath10=0.92  ) the transition state along the bri-@xmath28 channel , namely , @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the electron density of the adsorption system , the h@xmath0 molecule and the mgal1 surface . to calculate @xmath33 , the atomic positions in the last two terms in eq . \n 2 have been kept at those of the first term . through careful wavefunction analysis \n , we find that at the beginning of the adsorption process , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 orthogonalize with electronic states of the mgal1 surface and are thus broadened . \n this orthogonalization is very similar to that has been observed during the interaction of h@xmath0 with the mg(0001 ) @xcite and al(111 ) @xcite surfaces . as shown in fig . \n 6(a ) , there is an electron - depletion region on top of the al atom , which is formed because electrons around the al atom are repelled by the h@xmath0 bonding electrons due to the orthogonalization . in comparison , on the clean mg(0001 ) surface \n , the electrons of mg are repelled from the surface at the beginning of the adsorption of a h@xmath0 molecule . \n we can also see from fig . \n 6(b ) that the h@xmath0 molecule begins to get some electrons from the mg and al atoms , when it gets more closer to the mgal1 surface .    as we have already seen , extra electrons on the mgal1 surface trends to distribute around the al atom . \n thus during the initial stage of the adsorption of a h@xmath0 molecule , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 orthogonalize only with electronic states around the al atom , while on the clean mg surface , the molecular orbitals orthogonalize with electronic states around the two nearest mg atoms . besides , the ability to lose electrons is stronger for a mg atom than an al atom . therefore , the h@xmath0 molecule is more difficult to get electrons from the mgal1 surface . \n and so the dissociation energy barrier is larger on the mgal1 surface . \n in summary , the electronic structures of the al - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces and the dissociation behaviors of h@xmath0 molecules on the doped surfaces are systematically studied , using the first - principles calculations . \n our calculational results show that after al - doping , the surface electronic structure is largely changed . due to the electrons redistribution , the surface relaxation changes from expansion to contraction around the doping layer . for different doping lengths , the work function of the mg(0001 ) surface \n are all enlarged . through careful electronic structure analysis , we further find that the electronic states around the fermi energy mainly distribute around the doping layer for al - doped mg(0001 ) surface . by calculating the potential energy surface of a h@xmath0 molecule on the al - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces , we find that the doping of an al atom does not change the dissociation path with the lowest energy barrier , but enlarges the energy barrier . and \n for the first layer doping , the energy barrier is changed by 0.30 ev . from wavefunction and charge - density analysis \n , we reveal the two interaction stages during the dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule , i.e. the first orthogonalization and later charge - transfer stages . \n we find that because more surface electrons distribute around the al atom , the orthogonalization mainly happens between the h@xmath0 molecule and the surface al atom . \n in addition , since al atom has a weaker ability to lose electrons , the dissociation energy barrier for h@xmath0 is enlarged on the mgal1 surface than on a clean mg(0001 ) surface . \n our studies provide a detailed mechanism for explaining the improvement on the resistance to corrosion for the mg(0001 ) surface by doping of al atoms .", "StartTimeOffset": 411170534580, "RequestID": "c59e9206f53e409a95f69db71dad4636", "TotalTokens": 3542}

this is particularly true for spbs/@xmath0doradus stars that share the same typical frequency range . \n however , the data in the exodat catalog should be treated with caution ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . \n it is therefore essential to complement the space data with other ones : colour photometry and high resolution spectroscopy . \n we are in particular part of the proposal concerning the classification of stars using eso s flames instrumenti ( pi : c. neiner , lesia , meudon ) . \n before the frequency analysis , performed both with period04 @xcite and sigspec @xcite , the data set is corrected from the `` flags '' provided by the corot consortium ( saa , orbital eclipses  ) and the hot pixels . \n these latter are particularly tricky since they produce jumps of different amplitudes associated to short - time trends related to the consecutive relaxation . \n the resulting frequency analyses ( performed until the frequency has a significance of 5 in the sigspec frame ) show many frequencies related to the satellite orbit ( in particular at 2.01d@xmath3 and 13.97d@xmath3 ) together with their numerous harmonics / aliases .    once these frequencies ( more than 30 ) \n are removed , there remains a group at low frequency that is usually related to the trends ; these latter are not easily taken into account by the process . \n these trends represent therefore the main difficulty to deduce the intrinsic stellar frequency , since trends frequencies might combine with true ones , even at high values . \n figure[fig2 ] shows a typical frequency map for a hybrid @xmath0doradus star . \n the hybrid status of the star is based on the presence of frequencies that are typical for @xmath0doradus stars together with much higher frequencies , above 20d@xmath3 . \n d@xmath3 ) that still represent the long - term trends of the data despite a correction using spline - functions . \n finally , the remaining frequencies should be intrinsic to the star unless some might be a combination between a real frequency and a low - one corresponding to a trend . \n note that some frequencies are in the typical @xmath0doradus domain , while others are quite high , above 20d@xmath3 . ] \n from the light curve behaviour and the frequency analysis , we are able to classify the sample of the 32 stars in different categories :    * @xmath0dor candidates : 10 ( + 3 uncertain ) * hybrid @xmath2- & @xmath1-mode pulsators : 2 * constant stars : 13 . * unclassified cases : 4 . among these 4 , one might be a rr lyrae star since both the basic and its 2 harmonics dominate the residuals . \n other cases might be related to stellar activity . \n note that these results may slightly evolve through a much powerful treatment of the different trends in particular . \n the number of hybrid should in particular increase , while the number of constant stars should decrease . \n figure[fig3 ] shows the sine - fit of the star corresponding to fig.[fig2 ] . \n in order to manage such an enormous amount of data , it is essential to develop automated procedures to take care of the flags , the trends , the outliers , and , very tricky , the jumps . up to now , \n only part of these tasks are done in an automated way . \n however , a fundamental problem is to be sure that the star is indeed a @xmath0doradus star : the frequency spectrum itself is not enough to conclude to a @xmath0doradus membership ( the confusion with spb stars is obvious ) : complementary observations are required .    in any case , ground based data are requested . indeed , in addition to the location of the star in the hr diagram , other fundamental parameters have to be obtained in order to perform modelling and consecutive asterosismic studies . \n a difficult problem , especially for @xmath0doradus stars , is the knowledge of the stellar rotation . \n indeed , what we measure is the frequency spectrum in the solar frame , that might be completely different from the real one i.e. , in the stellar frame ; the fequency shift depends on the rotation period , the azimuthal number and the whole stellar structure . even considering @xmath2-modes , and a quite low @xmath4-value ( 2 ) , a rotation frequency of 10d@xmath3 \n may shift the considered frequency by 10d@xmath3 ! therefore , the key - objects that are the hybrid stars have to be validated in the correct frame . \n thus , the case given in this paper may also be interpreted through a pure @xmath2-mode pulsator .    therefore , whereas space missions will bring fundamental insights on the precision and the quality of the temporal signal , it is essential to accompany them with complementary observations , especially in order to derive the fundamental parameters of the stars .", "StartTimeOffset": 424997855286, "RequestID": "be787917a6554956b6565b2eb2395471", "TotalTokens": 2014}

state @xmath10 in the ground state potential vanishes , and varies as @xmath11 . at ultracold temperature \n , the atoms collide with a near zero relative kinetic energy @xmath12 , which is therefore very close to @xmath10 . \n when the laser is tuned in the vicinity of the free - bound transition , the excited state is therefore close to resonance with the least - bound state . as a consequence , a shift of the excited state \n is produced , which is dependent on @xmath10 and so on @xmath6 . \n second , the couplings of the excited state with the bound and scattering ground states involve franck - condon overlaps which depend critically on @xmath6 .    in this letter , \n we report the first observation of the light shift of the j=1 ro - vibrational states recently found by our group  @xcite in the purely long - range @xmath3 interaction potential for @xmath0he atoms . \n the v=0 , 1 , 2 levels ( see fig . \n [ fig : potential ] ) can be populated from two ultracold colliding atoms excited by absorption of laser light red - detuned from the @xmath4 transition . from the measurement of the light shifts for several vibrational levels , we deduce an estimation of the value of the s - wave scattering length @xmath6 of the spin polarized @xmath0he@xmath1 atoms in @xmath7 quintet potential . \n this is the first spectroscopic measurement of @xmath6 , which provides a significantly lower value than most previous experimental results  @xcite . \n the spin - polarized ultracold atomic @xmath0he@xmath1 samples are confined in a three - coil magnetic trap of ioffe - pritchard type and cooled down to @xmath13k range by radio - frequency - induced evaporation . \n the bias field is typically 3 g and the density is of the order of @xmath14 atoms/@xmath15 . \n the pa experiment is performed at a temperature of around 4 @xmath13k , just above the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation  @xcite to avoid mean field shifts . \n the pa light is provided by a dbr diode laser with an external cavity operating at 1083 nm and a 1 w yb - doped fiber amplifier . \n the pa pulse is focused with a waist of 640 @xmath13 m on the atomic sample of approximately 30 @xmath13 m diameter ( in radial direction ) and switched on for durations from tens of @xmath13s to a few ms depending on the laser intensity . \n the light propagates parallel to the trap bias magnetic field in @xmath16 polarization to produce selectively the desired bound states from v=0 to v=4 in the purely long - range @xmath17 potential by setting its detuning in the range of -20 mhz to -1.4 ghz  @xcite . in order to allow large detunings \n , we use a heterodyne frequency locking technique : the beat signal between the pa laser and a master laser is monitored by a fast photodiode , mixed down with a local oscillator and converted to dc voltage which is then fed back to the current supply of the pa laser . \n the master laser is locked to the atomic d@xmath18 transition . \n the linewidth of the pa laser is measured to 0.6 mhz . \n our polarization purity is limited to approx . \n 98 % in the electric field because of imperfections in the optical elements .    ) vibrational level of the @xmath3 potential with pa laser intensity of ( a ) 9 mw/@xmath19 and ( b ) 5 w/@xmath19 and pulse duration of 1 ms and 10 @xmath13s respectively . \n the heating of the cloud due to the pa process is plotted as a function of the opposite of the laser detuning @xmath20 from the @xmath21 transition . \n the two sets of data are fitted with lorentzian curves represented in solid lines , and the center frequencies are found to be ( a ) -1435.0 @xmath22 0.6 mhz and ( b ) -1460 @xmath22 1 mhz . \n the resonance peak ( b ) is clearly shifted by a quantity @xmath23 larger than 20 mhz at strong pa laser intensity . ] \n the pa resonance curves are obtained by the calorimetric method described in ref . \n @xcite . even for intensities \n several order of magnitudes higher in the present work , the rise in temperature , the optical density and the atom loss signals ( which are simultaneously registered ) still give the same central position of the resonance line . \n this validates our detection method . \n we deduce the temperature by ballistic expansion . for each pa line \n , the pa laser frequency is scanned over 20 mhz in steps of 0.3 mhz by changing the rf - frequency of an acousto - optic modulator in the pa beam line . \n [ fig : shift - raw](a ) shows a pa resonance line obtained at low pa laser intensity . \n the width is typically 3 mhz . when the pa laser intensity is increased , the line is red shifted and broadened as shown in fig . \n [ fig : shift - raw](b ) . \n we decrease the pulse duration as we raise the laser intensity in order to keep enough atoms trapped after photoassociation , so that the heating by the pa process is still measurable . \n we checked that the resonance position is independent of the pulse duration by varying it by more than an order of magnitude . \n the amplitude of the temperature raise signal is not proportional to the laser energy : when the laser energy focused on the cloud is large , the atom loss is not negligible compared to the initial number of atoms , and the thermalization properties of the cloud are changed . with the temperature and laser intensity we use \n , the broadening of the signal is too large to be explained by ref . \n @xcite where it is related to the transition rate from the coupled scattering states to the excited state . \n however , some decay mechanisms enhanced by light are suggested by the observation of ions when a metastable helium cloud is illuminated by a laser red - detuned from the atomic transition @xcite . \n for each vibrational level , we measure the shifts @xmath23 of the center of the resonance curve for different pa laser intensities i. typical results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : shift - comp ] . \n the error bar is explained as follows . at high intensities , the error bar in @xmath23 increases due to signal broadening and large shot - to - shot noise . \n close to zero intensity , we assign an error of 0.6 mhz to @xmath23 resulting from fluctuations of experimental parameters , which is larger than the error of the lorentzian fit . \n the results displayed in fig . \n [ fig : shift - comp ] show a linear dependance of @xmath24 as a function of i. the maximum measurable light shift is limited by two experimental factors . \n first , the signal broadens with the laser intensity . \n second , to keep the amount of loss of atoms low enough , the pulse duration is decreased when i is increased as mentioned earlier , which is limited by the 5 @xmath13s switching time of the aom . \n these constraints are more severe for v=2 . the main error in the determination of the slopes @xmath25 is due to the systematic uncertainty in the intensity i. this results from the difficulty to measure precisely the beam diameter at the cloud location , the calibration of our laser power meter , a possible slight misalignment of the laser on the cloud and the optical losses on the glass cell walls . \n we estimate that these factors lead to an error of up to 50  % in the absolute value of i. this is why our measurement of the scattering length relies on the ratio of the slopes for two vibrational levels : v=0 and v=1 or v=0 and v=2 , which is not affected by the systematic error in the intensity . \n we also observed that the laser intensity to which we expose the atomic cloud varies from day to day by approximately 10  % , due to small changes of the position of the center of the magnetic trap . \n the slopes of the three levels are therefore measured in a single run without interruption to keep the experimental conditions as similar as possible . \n the precision in the measurement of each ratio is limited by the fitting errors in the slopes @xmath26 which are 2  % for v=0 , 2.5  % for v=1 , and 4.5  % for v=2 ( see fig .  [ \n fig : shift - comp ] ) . \n the ratios of the frequency shifts are measured several times , and we find the results @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . \n the error bars are chosen such that they include all the measurements and their individual error bars , and a statistical analysis shows that they correspond to a three standard deviation error . \n the result for @xmath28 is the most precise because larger shifts produce less error in the linear fit . \n the details of the theoretical analysis which provides the relation between the shifts and the scattering length for different vibrational levels and light polarizations will be given in great detail in a forthcoming paper @xcite . \n we focus here on its main features . \n we consider the light coupling of the molecular bound state in the purely long - range @xmath31 potential to the continuum of scattering states in the @xmath32 waves as well as in several spin states allowed by selection rules . under our experimental conditions ( ultracold atoms in a magnetic trap ) \n , the only significant entrance collisional channel corresponds to two spin - polarized atoms colliding in the s - wave . \n however , the contribution to the light shift of all other possible allowed channels may not be negligible @xcite . \n the fact that @xmath33 channels contribute to the shift suggests a dependance on light polarization . \n in addition , the contributions of the ground molecular bound states is included . \n the least bound state v=14 of the @xmath7 potential gives the most important one , as the other vibrational levels are much further from resonance . \n using ref . \n @xcite , it can be shown that the shift @xmath26 is the sum of partial shifts @xmath34 due to different collisionnal channels @xmath35 . \n only the partial shifts corresponding to s - wave collisionnal channels depend on the scattering length . \n each @xmath34 can be written as a sum over bound and continuum states or as an overlap integral involving the regular and irregular solutions of the scattering equation , and the excited state wavefunction @xcite . \n the former can be used to show that in our case both contributions of the least - bound state and the scattering states in the s - wave collisional channel provide the sensitivity of the shift on @xmath6 . \n the latter is preferred for computational reasons , and proves that the shift is a linear function of @xmath6 , very weakly dependent on the scattering energy @xmath12 and on the magnetic field for the low temperature and values of the field we use . \n we prefer using experimentally the ratio of the shifts between different vibrational levels which is independent on intensity . in our case , \n the fraction of the shift which depends on @xmath6 is appreciably different for the different levels . \n the ratios of the shifts depend therefore in a critical way on @xmath6 . \n several approximations are made in the theoretical analysis . \n first , the isolated level approximation , which takes into account that the resonances associated to the excited molecular states are well separated , is valid as their shifts and broadenings are much smaller than the level spacing . \n second , the different ground state collisional channels can be assumed to be uncoupled in the absence of light , as the spin - dipole interaction , which mixes different spin states , is very weak @xcite . \n third , we neglect dressing effects , which arise from the fact that at infinite separation the colliding atoms still interact with light @xcite . as we solely deal with the deepest bound excited states our laser is tuned far from the atomic resonance . \n although these approximations are made , the errors they induce on the determination of @xmath6 are much smaller than the one due to experimental uncertainty on the ratio measurement . \n we compare the measured ratio of the light shift for @xmath28 with the calculations in ref . \n the fact that the polarization is not pure is taken into account . \n as mentioned above , our theory does not add uncertainty when deducing the scattering length . \n the measured ratio of the light shift for @xmath28 provides a determination of the scattering length of @xmath36  nm as shown in figure  [ fig : ratios](a ) . \n the ratio @xmath30 and the measurements for linear polarization shown in figure  [ fig : ratios](b ) provide less precise but yet compatible values . \n one can infer from the present determination of @xmath6 the absolute values of the slopes of @xmath37 as a function of i for different polarizations ( see ref . \n we find a systematic discrepancy of 40% with the experimental results , which are smaller in absolute value . \n we attribute this to an overestimation of the intensity i.    this new value of @xmath6 can be compared with the previous experimental determinations . in most cases \n the error - bars do not overlap . \n the condensate expansion yields @xmath38  nm  @xcite and @xmath39  nm  @xcite . \n the largest discrepancy is found with the value of the orsay group @xmath40  nm derived from inelastic collision rates combined with the determination of the critical temperature  @xcite . \n however , the measurement of the elastic collision rate based on the evaporative cooling rate gave @xmath41  nm  @xcite , which is in good agreement with our result . \n the small value of @xmath6 could explain why the hydrodynamic regime was not reached in our previous experiment accounting for the collective excitation of collisionally dense thermal clouds  @xcite . \n the comparison with theoretical values obtained from ab  initio calculations is also instructive . using the potential of starck and meyer  @xcite \n a value of @xmath42 nm is found . \n more recently , a value of 8.0 nm @xmath43 12.2 nm has been calculated  @xcite . \n after completion of the present work , we became aware of the result of przybytek and jeziorski  @xcite , which agrees very well with our measurement . \n we measure precisely the light - induced frequency shift of the pa spectra of metastable helium atoms and compared our results with our theoretical calculation . \n the measurements of several ro - vibrational levels at different light polarizations are considered . \n we also provide the first pa spectroscopic measurement of the s - wave scattering length of spin - polarized helium atoms in metastable @xmath2 state . \n the value for @xmath6 presented in this letter is significantly lower as compared to most previous values .    a more precise spectroscopic method to determine the scattering length would be to measure the binding energy of the least bound state ( v=14 ) in the ground state @xmath7 potential with a two - photon scheme . \n this pa experiment is in progress in our group . \n the authors thank olivier dulieu from the cold atoms and molecules group at laboratoire aime cotton in france and paul julienne from national institute of standards and technology in usa , for fruitful discussions .", "StartTimeOffset": 446401144211, "RequestID": "58dc8697cf824789b341e13c58b314d9", "TotalTokens": 4180}

photoluminescence ( @xmath19-pl ) measurements ( size of the laser spot on the sample : @xmath20 ) to observe single qds emission lines ( fig . \n [ micropl ] ) . \n the qds are excited above the barrier by a continuous wave laser beam at @xmath21 .        as seen in fig . \n [ macropl ] , the pl intensity of the qds ensemble in the yellow range ( @xmath22 ) grown on a ten fold dbr is @xmath11 times higher than in the case of qds grown on a @xmath7 znte buffer . \n this intensity enhancement is accounted for a higher extraction coefficient of the light emitted by the qds resulting from the coupling of the emission to the increased density of electromagnetic states ( mode ) of the cavity defined by the bottom dbr and the znte / air interface . in the case of qds on a znte buffer , most of the light emitted towards the substrate or back reflected from the cap / air interface is absorbed by the substrate . \n also in the case of the full cavity structure the macro - pl measurements show a significant enhancement of the pl intensity from the qds ( fig.[macropl ] ) . \n the interpretation here is , however , less straightforward . the cavity quality factor is higher as compared to the case of the half - cavity ( it is high enough to result in mode linewidth narrower than the qd ensemble emission peak , in contrary to the case of the half - cavity ) . on the one hand \n , this increases the effect of cavity enhanced extraction and may account for a net purcell effect on the qd emission . on the other hand , the excitation is less efficient due to absorption of the excitation beam in the top dbr . at the same time , \n not a single qd sheet , but @xmath16 qds sheets ( excited with an unequal efficiency ) contribute to the collected signal . \n the overall emission intensity is a result of the interplay of the above mentioned factors .    . \n ]    the micro -

cavity structure although the same procedure for the deposition the cdte qds was used for both structures . \n the cause of the observed broadening can be of structural type ( _ e . \n g. _ , the propagation of stacking faults through the qds sheet ) , of crystalline type ( _ e . g. _ , poor crystalline quality of the qds or matrix in their vicinity ) or of electronic type ( _ e . \n g. _ , accidental doping ) . in the next paragraph , we show that the latter effect is predominant .    , the single qds lines exhibit a fwhm comparable in the case of both structures . ] \n to identify the origin of the qds single lines broadening observed for the structure with a single qds sheet embedded in a half - cavity , imaging with the high angular annular dark field detector ( haadf ) in the scanning transmission ( stem ) mode and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) analysis have been undertaken on a microcavity sample embedding four qds sheets . as shown in fig . \n [ hrtem ] a ) and b ) the the haadf images do not show any structural defects across the cavity or dbrs , like stacking faults or amorphous inclusions . \n this indicates a good crystalline quality of the sample . \n however , an additional layer under the qds sheets can be seen ( fig . \n [ hrtem ] a , and close - up b ) . in this region \n , the presence of zn , te and se is mapped by edx chemical analysis ( fig . \n [ hrtem ] respectively c , d , e ) . \n the mapping shows unequivocally that a thin znse layer ( @xmath23 thick ) has formed . the unintentional deposition of this znse layer occurs while cooling the substrate from @xmath24 ( growth of the ddbr ) to @xmath25 ( growth of the qds ) . because of the higher sticking coefficient of se atoms with respect to te atoms@xcite , the residual se pressure in the growth chamber ( even with the se shutter closed ) is sufficient to result in preferable incorporation of se in place of te when cooling the substrate . \n thick ) layer has been unintentionally deposited during the growth interruption necessary for the growth of the cdte qds . ] \n the recovery of sharp single qds lines in the case of the full cavity structure indicates that the effect of the intercalated se in the form of a znse thin layer in the cavity is a short range type and that it affects only the first qds sheet grown . \n since no structural defects are observed in the vicinity of the unintentional znse layer , we infer that the main influence of this additional layer is a short range , local modification of the electronic environment affecting the optical properties of the nearest qds sheet . \n the non negligible thickness of the znse layer ( @xmath26 ) , being still under the critical relaxation thickness ( @xmath27 for znse on znte@xcite ) suggests that also a local strain could be involved in the broadening of the single qds lines observed for the half - cavity structures with a single qds sheet . \n the znse layer unintentionally forms during the growth interruption introduced to lower the temperature of the substrate prior to the growth of qds . \n thus , in order to assure a good qds optical performance it is crucial to avoid interruptions during the growth . \n this is especially important in the case of the cdte qds embedded in the microcavity . \n this indicates that in growth processes combining selenium and tellurium compounds it is better to grow the cdte qds without inducing their formation by amorphous tellurium . \n the fact that for the half - cavity structure broadened single qds emission lines are observed together with an enhancement of the pl from the qds ensemble suggests that the unintentional znse layer does not introduce any non - radiative exciton recombination channel . \n in this work , we show the enhancement of the yellow emission intensity of self assembled cdte / znte qds embedded in microcavities defined by dbrs involving selenium and tellurium compounds . \n the extraction coefficient of the light emitted by the qds ensemble is @xmath11 times higher for half - cavity structures as compared to qds grown on a buffer . in such cavities the spectrally wide cavity mode is well suited for fundamental investigations on qds , and for applications like solotronics or information storage and processing for which one focuses on the full emission pattern of individual qds . \n we show that the formation of a znse layer ( identified by edx analysis ) in the znte cavity during the cooling of the substrate for the growth of the cdte qds , does not affect the structural and crystalline properties of the sample , as shown by haadf stem imaging . \n however , this additional znse layer may induce a short range modification of the electronic and strain environment affecting the optical properties of the qds in its proximity ( e.g. , broadening of individual qd emission lines ) . since the influence of these effects is of short range type , the growth of a thicker znte layer after cooling of the substrate and before the deposition of the qds allows to cancel them . for the full cavity structure , \n we show the enhancement of the qds ensemble emission without any effects of single qds lines broadening . \n this work was partially supported by the national center for research and development in poland ( project lider ) , the polish national science center under decisions dec-2011/02/a \n / st3/00131 , dec-2011/01/n / st3/04536 , dec-2012/05/n / st3/03209 , dec-2013/09/b / st3/02603 , dec-2013/10/e / st3/00215 , umo-2012/05/b /st7/02155 , and by the foundation for polish science . \n research was carried out with the use of cept , cezamat and nltk infrastructures financed by the european union -

however , one of the effects of baryonic dissipation is to make dm halos more spherical than their counterparts in dissipationless simulations ( e.g. , kazantzidis et al . \n one may inquire whether the alignment of satellites along the principal axes of host halos is as prevalent in dissipational simulations . \n one might expect differences between dissipational and dissipationless simulations to be small in this regard because both the major axis and the positions of satellites reflect the directions of recent accretion along filaments and because subhalos are biased toward large halo - centric distances compared to dm ( @xmath16 ) , where the change in shape is small . \n the right panel of figure  [ f1 ] is an explicit demonstration that dissipational processes do not significantly alter the alignment of halo and satellites . \n the figure shows an analysis of the eight cluster halos of kazantzidis et al . \n ( 2004 ) simulated once with dissipationless , adiabatic gas physics and a second time including radiative cooling and star formation . \n though the inner halos in the cooling simulations are significantly rounder , the alignment of host halo and satellites remains pronounced . \n , while the _ right _ panel shows the axis ratio @xmath17 . \n each panel is a scatter plot of the axis ratios of _ all _ dm in each host halo on the _ horizontal _ axis against the axis ratios of each of the subhalo populations on the _ vertical _ axis . \n the _ triangles _ show number - weighted subhalo axis ratios and the _ squares _ represent mass - weighted subhalo axis ratios . \n all subhalos with @xmath18 are included . \n , width=415 ]    it is interesting to quantify the relationship between the spatial distributions of the smooth , dm components of host halos and the subhalos that reside within them . \n do the subhalos simply follow the triaxial mass distribution ? \n there are several potential ways to address this issue , such as computing angular correlations etc . , and i discuss two intriguing quantifications in this section . one way to address the relationship of subhalos and dm is through the ratios of the principal axes of inertia denoted @xmath19 . for subhalos , \n the inertia tensor can be computed in two ways . in the first , \n each subhalo is counted equally and in the second method , each subhalo can be counted in proportion to its bound mass . \n the result is a `` number - weighted '' inertia tensor and a `` mass - weighted '' inertia tensor . \n figure  [ f2 ] shows a comparison between the axis ratios of host dm halos using , computed as specified above , and the mass- and number - weighted axis ratios of their subhalo populations . \n the sample consists of @xmath20 hosts with @xmath21 and their subhalos simulated with the art code ( kravtsov et al . \n the particle mass is @xmath22 , the spatial resolution is @xmath23 , and each host contains @xmath24 particles within its virial radius .    the number - weighted axis ratios in fig . \n [ f2 ] show that the full number - weighted satellite populations broadly trace the dm distributions of their host halos . \n however , notice that the mass - weighted axis ratios are systematically smaller than that of the dm in the host halo . \n more massive subhalos are more strongly biased toward a flattened distribution than small subhalos , a result consistent with the studies of z05 , l05 , and a05 . \n the robustness of this result has been checked by randomly re - assigning the weights ( masses in this case ) among the subhalo populations . \n the axis ratios based on these randomized weights are generally similar to the number - weighted axis ratios shown in figure  [ f2 ] . \n this angular bias for large subhalos is not entirely surprising . \n the smallest subhalos have generally been accreted over an extended period of time and interact gravitationally as dm particles , adopting a self - consistent configuration with the host potential . \n the largest subhalos have typically been accreted more recently so they more faithfully reflect the directions of recent infall , and they tend to be more strongly biased to form in overdense filaments .    as a second comparison between substructure and smooth mass , \n consider the 2d projected fraction of mass in substructure , @xmath1 . \n this quantity is constrained by measurements of flux ratio anomalies in multiply - imaged quasar systems ( e.g. , dalal & kochanek 2002 ) , and can be used as a probe of cosmological parameters that influence the growth of small - scale structure . \n zentner & bullock ( 2003 ) and mao et al . ( \n 2004 ) have made predictions for the mean projected substructure mass fractions , with the former considering a variety of primordial power spectra and dark matter properties . in what follows \n i show the projected substructure mass fraction as a function of projection angle @xmath10 , from the major axis of the host halo . following mao et al . \n ( 2004 ) , i have computed @xmath25 as a function of projection angle using all mass and substructures within @xmath7 virial radii of the center of each host , in order to include correlated material associated with each halo . \n i projected in cylinders of radius @xmath26 , comparable to the einstein radii of strong - lens systems . \n the result is shown in figure  [ f3 ] , along with the observed @xmath27% confidence region for @xmath1 measured in quadruply - imaged systems by dalal & kochanek ( 2002 ) . \n the mean substructure mass fraction is approximately @xmath28% with a large scatter , consistent with mao et al . \n interestingly , @xmath29 is @xmath30 times higher for projections near the long axis of the host . \n if elliptical galaxies are well aligned with their host halos , this result may have important consequences for determinations of @xmath1 in multiply - imaged quasar systems and several other observed properties of strong lenses . \n measured from all @xmath20 host halos , using two projections for each host . \n the _ outer _ \n errorbars represent the scatter among projections and the _ inner _ errorbars represent the estimated error in the mean of @xmath1 . \n the shaded band represents the @xmath27% confidence region of @xmath1 from the measurement of dalal & kochanek ( 2002 ) . \n , width=226 ]    i am grateful to my collaborators brandon allgood , oleg gnedin , anatoly klypin , andrey kravtsov , daisuke nagai , and eduardo rozo for their invaluable contributions to this research . \n i thank james bullock , neal dalal , stelios kazantzidis , chuck keeton , ben metcalf , and jeremy tinker for helpful discussions . \n arz is funded by the kavli institute for cosmological physics at the university of chicago and by the national science foundation under grant no . \n nsf phy 0114422 .", "StartTimeOffset": 509571431894, "RequestID": "3a5fe5815da14cffa4d79239b3b0d5a4", "TotalTokens": 3131}

have seemed insufficient to many people . \n one of the best known examples of this is the estimate he made of the power of the first atomic bomb detonated on july 16 , 1945 at the new mexico desert , measuring the distance travelled by a few scraps of paper that he dropped to the ground while participating as an observer of the explosion@xcite . \n later , when he served as professor at the university of chicago , fermi used to pose such problems to his students as a teaching method . \n the most famous was to estimate the number of piano tuners in chicago at that time . making a series of reasonable assumptions , such as the number of people living in chicago , the number of people living on average in every household , every how many houses there is a piano , how often a piano should be tuned , how long it takes for a tuner to do his work , etc . \n , he could effectively estimate the number of piano tuners in chicago , obtaining a result that compared reasonably well with those contained in the telephone directory .    in the first year of the physics teacher program at the unrn \n we frequently face the students with everyday problems , which can sometimes be solved   la fermi \" . \n we find it is a very good method to help students sharpen their imagination as well as their observation skills , and at the same time is a training in logical reasoning . \n within this type of problem we recently raised the possibility of estimating the power developed by the puyehue - cordn caulle volcanic system , near the argentine - chilean border , in its eruption of june 4 , 2011 at 17:00 utc ( 14:00 local time , gmt-3 ) . to do this \n we consider only the first eruption , which covered with ashes and sand the some small villages in chile and the cities of san carlos de bariloche ( @xmath0w , @xmath1s ) , villa la angostura ( @xmath2w , @xmath3s ) and surrounding areas in argentina . in figure[fiaqua ] the first stage of the eruption \n is shown , as it has been recorded from space by nasa aqua satellite@xcite .    ] \n the working hypotheses that we use are :    1 .   area covered by sand and dust . + according to photographs taken by nasa terra satellite@xcite on june 5 , 2011 , wind conditions during the eruption day made the cloud of sand and ash follow almost a straight line running along the nahuel huapi lake , in the wnw - sse direction . \n although the fallout was only partially visible on water , it is clear that it covered the entire area @xmath4 of the lake . \n therefore we use this area as a parameter to estimate the amount of ash fall . as a working hypothesis \n we assume the area covered by ash and sand to be about three times the area of nahuel huapi lake , @xmath5 . \n +    + in figure[terra ] the nasa terra satellite image for 05 jun 2011 at 13:45 utc is shown . \n the blue profile corresponds to the coastline of the lake , and in red the area covered by sand and ashes is highlighted . as a guide to the eye , a rectangle of area @xmath6 is also indicated . to determine @xmath7 , \n the following data was used : the surface of the lake is @xmath8km@xmath9 ; adding the surfaces of the largest islands , victoria and huemul , totalling @xmath10km@xmath9 , we find @xmath11km@xmath9 . so the area covered by ash would be @xmath12km@xmath13km@xmath14m@xmath9 . \n the picture has been post processed by using the google earth software@xcite . \n thickness of the sand layer . \n + in line with the above hypothesis on the covered area , we assign a value to the average thickness of the layer of sand and ash \n . it is known that a layer over @xmath15 m covered villa la angostura while east of bariloche the layer was less than @xmath16 m thick . on the other hand reports indicate an accumulation of more than @xmath16 m in the town of ingeniero jacobacci ( @xmath17w , @xmath18s ) 210 km eastward from bariloche . \n this corresponds to ash and sand that did not fell into the area @xmath7 but which must be included in the computation since its elevation affects the energy balance of the volcano . to account for the total energy cost we assume an average height of @xmath19 m . covering the chosen area @xmath7 . \n duration of the first eruption . \n + the ash fall in bariloche started at 16:30 local time ( art , gmt-3 , 19:30 utc ) and ended five hours later , at 21:30 art , so the total time of the eruption first phase is 5 hours , @xmath20s . \n 4 .   height reached by the cloud . \n + the height of interest is the difference @xmath21 where @xmath22 m is the height of the volcano . \n we have @xmath23 m , an average value as different components of the column reached varying heights , the lightest getting up to @xmath24 m . \n density of the mixture of sand and dust . \n + the density of the sand and ash fell in bariloche was determined using household items : a measuring cup used to measure the flour or sugar and a kitchen scale . \n the result was @xmath25kgm@xmath26 . \n this value , lower than the density of water , is explained because ash and pumice , which floats on water , are mixed with denser components that tend to sink into water . \n a simple volumetric calculation shows that the volume of sand and ash fall is @xmath27 considering that a cargo truck can carry about @xmath28m@xmath29 , the amount of sand fall is equivalent to @xmath30 i.e. , more than twenty four million trucks of sand .    an alternative way to visualise the amount of sand consists of calculating the height it would reach if it were placed in a square area of side @xmath31 by stacking a pyramid of height @xmath32 . the volume of the pyramid @xmath33 must match the estimated volume of sand \n however , as the angle @xmath34 of inclination of the pyramid should not exceed the `` angle of repose '' of the sand , approximately@xcite @xmath35 , there is a link between the height @xmath32 and the base @xmath31 . \n we have the relations @xmath36{\\frac{6v}{\\tan \\theta } } \\\\   h&=&\\frac{l}{2}\\tan \\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 . \n it follows @xmath38 this means that the fallen sand could be stacked in a square field @xmath39 km wide ( with an area of @xmath39km@xmath40 ) , making a @xmath41 m high pyramid . as a visual reference we note that the area of the emergent of huemul island , in bariloche is about @xmath42 ha ( @xmath43km@xmath40 ) , and its height certainly less than the @xmath41 m we obtained here .      to determine the mass of sand fall , we multiply the calculated volume by the measured density , to obtain @xmath44 i.e. about 100 million of metric tonnes .      the energy required to raise this mass of sand to @xmath45 m \n can be estimated from the potential energy acquired when it reaches its maximum height . \n we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the acceleration of gravity . \n thus we have @xmath48 that is more than one thousand kilotons of tnt equivalent . for comparison , we mention that the 2011 earthquake in japan had a magnitude of @xmath49 in the richter scale@xcite and released an energy@xcite of @xmath50j ( @xmath51kt of tnt equivalent ) . \n another reference point is given by the total energy produced in a country . \n for example , the installed electric power in argentina@xcite is @xmath52mw and so , the energy produced during a day is @xmath53j . \n thus the energy released by the first phase of the eruption is equivalent to that produced in the whole country in @xmath54days . \n the magma rises through the conduit of the volcano mixed with fumes of molten rock and water vapour , which results in a turbulent two phase flow . \n the velocity of the magma exiting the crater can be coarsely estimated from the energy conservation law , since the flow , at least for the denser components , is ballistic . \n the ashes reaching the top of the column probably ascend the last section by convection . for that reason we took an average altitude of @xmath45 m , a moderate value compared to the @xmath55 m or even @xmath24 m that have been reported . neglecting air friction \n , the kinetic energy of fluid at the crater must be equal to the potential energy reached in the final ascent , @xmath56 from this it follows that @xmath57 that is , nearly the speed of sound in air . \n this high speed of the outgoing material determines its rapid cooling , which explains the amorphous structure and the presence of micro crystals in the ejecta since production of larger crystals requires slow crystallisation .      assuming that the first eruption lasted @xmath58hours , i.e. @xmath20s , it is possible to estimate the power generated by the volcano , which turns out to be @xmath59 by comparing this result with the installed electric power in argentina mentioned above \n , the ratio obtained is @xmath60 the power developed by the volcano is @xmath61 times the installed power in argentina . \n we can also compare our result with the worldwide installed electrical power@xcite , which is @xmath62tw@xmath63w . \n a percentage comparison results in @xmath64 so the power developed by the puyehue volcano is equivalent to about 2% of the global electric power . \n in the problem of piano tuners , fermi could compare the estimated result with the answer obtained from a query in the telephone directory . \n the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that some tuners had no phone or were not listed as such in the directory , or to an error in the various estimates . \n but this last point is part of the game : the idea is not to obtain an accurate result , but to reach a reasonable approximation . as such \n we understand a discrepancy not exceeding a certain limit , say half an order of magnitude , or a factor of five .    in what follows we comment on each of the scenarios we used :    1 . \n area covered . \n + in the eruption of june 4 , 2011 ash and sand covered an area larger than the one assumed in this work . \n that could mean that we underestimate the energy and power of the volcano . \n we tried to compensate for material falling beyond the chosen zone , by assuming a uniform thickness of @xmath65 cm in the reference area . \n average thickness of the layer of sand and ash . \n + it is known that in the vicinity of the volcano on the chilean side and in villa la angostura the layer of sand and ash reached @xmath66 cm , while further east it did not exceeded @xmath58 cm . \n we believe that the figure of @xmath65 cm distributed uniformly over an area equal to three times the area of the nahuel huapi lake ( over @xmath67km@xmath9 ) is appropriate as an average estimate . \n 3 .   estimated time of activity . + \n the fall of sand and ashes in bariloche ceased at 00:30 utc ( 21:30 art ) , that is the first eruption lasted five hours . \n the thunder caused by electric shock lasted a total of approximately @xmath61hours indicating that volcanic activity continued until then . \n this does not affect the estimation of the energy developed in the first five hours . \n 4 .   height reached by the cloud . \n + reports on june 4 indicated a height of the column of up @xmath24 m above sea level . \n as the column included different density components , we believe our assumption @xmath23 m for the thicker components of the plume is a reasonable estimate for our purposes . \n density of the mixture of sand and ashes . \n + the density measurement was made with a sample collected within hours of the onset of the rash . \n samples taken a few days later gave higher density values , probably because rain water dissolved or dragged away part of the components and swept them away . \n 6 .   output speed . \n + we are not aware of measurements of the output speed of the magma in the volcano being made , but specialised authors have studied the supersonic flow of magma in volcanoes in some typical situations of the so - called explosive pyroclastic eruptions ( see for example @xcite ) , as the puyehue - cordn caulle eruption of june 4 , 2011 . \n an eruption of this type occur in the year 79 of the christian era at the vesuvian volcano , inducing the tragic disappearance of the city of pompeii . \n this eruption had two distinct phases : first a _ \n phase , where material was ejected in a tall column , spread in the atmosphere and fell to earth like rain ; followed by a _ pelan _ phase where material flowed down the sides of the volcano as fast - moving avalanches of gas and dust , called pyroclastic flow ( pyroclasts are rock fragments formed by a volcanic explosion or ejected from a volcanic vent ) . \n the solution of the present problem indicates that using knowledge normally available to high school students , and introducing a series of reasonable assumptions , it is possible to solve approximately a problem resulting from a natural event that affects everyday life . \n andrew w. woods and sally m. bower , _ the decompression of volcanic jets

trivial static correlations between particles . \n it has been shown that , despite their apparent simplicity , these models exhibit surprisingly many of the hallmarks of glassy behavior that have been the focus of recent experimental and theoretical efforts @xcite . \n the model we study consists of hard core particles on a triangular lattice with no static interactions other than those that prohibit multiple occupancy of a single site . to each particle \n is associated a vector which can point along the six directions bisecting the triangular lattice . in other words , the vectors point toward the interstitial sites of the lattice @xcite . \n translation of particles obeys the kinetic constraints of the two vacancy assisted triangular lattice gas , or the ( 2)-tlg @xcite : a particle at site @xmath0 is allowed to move to a nearest neighbor site , @xmath1 , if ( 1 ) @xmath1 is not occupied and ( 2 ) the two mutual nearest neighbor sites of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also empty . \n these rules coincide with a physical interpretation of steric constraints on the movement of hard core particles in a dense fluid @xcite . \n rotation of particles obeys a similarly physically motivated kinetic constraint if one imagines that the particles have small hard protrusions along the direction of their orientation vector @xcite : a particle , @xmath2 , with a unit vector @xmath3 , can rotate either 60 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise provided the two neighboring lattice sites along the direction between the initial and final orientations of @xmath3 are empty . \n translations preserve the direction of @xmath3 . \n we refer to this model as the rotational tlg @xcite . due to the absence of non - trivial static interactions \n , there are no static correlations between particles . \n however , constraints on the kinetics allow non - trivial dynamic correlations to emerge in trajectory space .    in the computer simulations , we investigated particle densities , @xmath4 , between 0.10 and 0.81 on a lattice with edge length @xmath5 = 128 ( @xmath5 = 256 for @xmath4 = 0.81 ) . \n the density @xmath4 = 1 corresponds to the completely full lattice . at densities up to and including 0.77 , over 60 independent trajectories of lengths 10 - 100 times @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the time for the self - intermediate scattering function at @xmath7 @xcite to reach @xmath8 of its initial value ( see below ) , were run . at densities \n 0.79 , 0.80 and 0.81 , four to sixteen trajectories were run . \n these trajectories were stored logarithmically for later analysis ( i.e. configurations were saved after 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , etc . \n time was measured in monte carlo sweeps . during each sweep , \n particles were chosen randomly and translational and orientational moves were attempted with equal probability . for the higher density runs , \n a continuous time algorithm was used for greater efficiency @xcite . \n this algorithm involved making and updating a list of only those particles which have the possibility of either moving or rotating and choosing from among those exclusively during every move . \n the time was then incremented as one over the number of possible moves . due to the lack of static correlations , initial configurations could be generated by random occupation of empty lattice sites by particles with random orientations until the desired density was reached . \n despite the lack of static correlations between rotational and translational degrees of freedom , dynamic coupling exists via the kinetic constraints @xcite . \n a particle which can not rotate because it is sterically blocked by neighboring particles must wait for those particles to translate away before it is allowed to rotate again . in this sense \n , we expect rotational dynamics to be a good indicator of local structural relaxation in this model , as they are in experiment . \n [ probes ] shows rotational trajectories of six particles at low and high densities . \n the particles at low density ( fig . \n [ probes]a ) rotate freely , performing a random walk through all angles . at higher densities , \n the particles perform random walks punctuated by periods of little to no rotation . \n in contrast to the trajectories at low density , dynamics at high density are clearly heterogeneous : at any given time , some particles are rotating quickly while others are essentially frozen . \n similar behavior has been observed for translational motion of a probe molecule immersed in spin - facilitated models @xcite and in poilymer films @xcite . \n a useful ensemble measure of slow dynamics is the rotational autocorrelation function , @xmath9 , which indicates the time it takes for a particle to lose memory of its initial spin orientation @xcite . here , the angled brackets denote an average over all particles and times , @xmath10 . a plot of @xmath11 is shown in fig . \n [ corr]a . at low densities \n , relaxation shows a simple exponential profile . as density increases , \n the curves become more and more stretched exponential indicative of averaging over multiple relaxation timescales . \n this stretched exponential decay is what one would expect qualitatively from rotational trajectories such as those depicted in fig . \n [ probes]b . \n an important quantity that can be extracted from @xmath11 is the rotational correlation time , @xmath12 , which is defined as @xmath13 . \n the inverse of this timescale is the rotational diffusion constant , @xmath14 . \n translational relaxation is often studied via the self - intermediate scattering function , @xmath15 = @xmath16 . here \n , @xmath17 denotes the position of particle @xmath2 at time @xmath10 . \n the decay of the scattering function to @xmath8 at wavevector @xmath18 is typically defined to be a structural relaxation time , @xmath6 , as it gives a sense of how density fluctuations relax at relatively short lengthscales . \n dynamic behavior at large lengthscales is studied via the self - diffusion constant , @xmath19 , extracted from the mean - squared displacement , @xmath20 = @xmath21 . \n the self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath19 , is defined as @xmath22 . \n we omit further discussion of these quantities as they have been presented at length elsewhere for this @xcite and other models @xcite . \n an important ramification of heterogeneous dynamics is the breakdown of mean - field dynamical relations such as the much studied stokes - einstein ( se ) relation @xcite . in a system with homogeneous dynamics such as a normal liquid \n , we expect relaxation behavior to be similar at all but the smallest lengthscales . in a glass \n , the presence of dynamic heterogeneity implies that such mean - field relations can be violated . in fig . \n [ corr]b , we plot the rotational diffusion constant , @xmath23 , and the self - diffusion constant , @xmath19 , versus the translational structural relaxation time , @xmath6 . \n rotational diffusion tracks structural relaxation whereas self - diffusion does not . \n that is , @xmath24 whereas @xmath25 . \n the same trend has been seen in experiment @xcite . \n the scaling of @xmath23 with @xmath6 can be rationalized qualitatively from the idea mentioned above that the ability to rotate is intimately tied to local structure . \n = 0.50 , 0.60 , 0.65 , 0.70 and 0.75 . \n the inset to ( a ) shows the exchange time distributions as a function of linear time , @xmath10 , as opposed to logarithmic time to emphasize the emergence of broader long time tails as density is increased . \n the two distributions are related via @xmath26 . \n the solid lines in ( b ) are the distributions of persistence times calculated from the distributions of exchange times via eqn . \n [ jungeq ] and the open circles are results of direct calculations.,width=480 ] \n direct measures of heterogeneous dynamics in glassy systems are distribution functions of persistence , @xmath27 , and exchange , @xmath28 , times @xcite . \n persistence times measure the first instance of a change in state given an initial configuration . \n exchange times measure the duration of particular states . \n for example , the distribution of rotational persistence times , @xmath29 , in this model is the distribution of times , given an initial configuration , when a particle changes its rotational state for the first time . \n the distribution of rotational exchange times , @xmath30 , is the length of time a particle remains in a particular rotational state . \n these distributions are multi - point functions because they depend not only on two points in time , but on all intervening points as well . \n [ trans]a and fig . \n [ rot]a show the distribution of exchange times for translational and rotational motion , respectively . \n distributions of exchange times are important for understanding the origin of dynamical decoupling phenomenon @xcite ( see fig .  [ corr]b ) . \n , except for rotational times.,width=480 ]    the distribution of exchange times for translations and rotations are very similar . \n there is very little change in short time structure as @xmath4 increases . \n evidence of broadly distributed dynamics occurs in the long time tails . \n the distributions of persistence times for translation and rotation are also qualitatively similar and display the same features noted in previous studies @xcite . \n differences in structure between rotational and translational persistence can be attributed to the differing kinetic constraints . \n a particle can have the ability to rotate while being constrained translationally and vice versa . \n recently , it has been shown that the distributions of exchange and persistence times are related via the equation @xcite : @xmath31 the constant of proportionality is fixed by normalization . \n this should be a general relation independent of the model or observable studied . \n the solid lines in fig . \n [ trans]b and fig . \n [ rot]b show the distribution of persistence times calculated via equation ( [ jungeq ] ) . \n the open circles are the results of direct calculations . \n we see that equation ( [ jungeq ] ) is well - satisfied . \n recent single molecule experiments determined distributions of rotational exchange times by following the dipole of embedded dye molecules @xcite . near the glass transition temperature , \n the absolute value of the rate of angular change , @xmath32 , showed abrupt changes between different dynamical environments . \n we can anticipate from fig . \n [ probes]b that the same quantity in the rotational tlg will show similar behavior . from this quantity , \n deschenes and vandenbout extracted a distribution of exchange times using a standard deviation criterion @xcite . here , we examine to what extent the distribution of times measured in this way corresponds to the distribution of rotational exchange times defined in section [ dist ] .    in fig . \n [ experiment]a , we plot @xmath33 where @xmath34 for the rotational tlg at high density . \n deschenes and vandenbout assigned an exchange event whenever the average angle jump changed by more than two standard deviations from the previous average angle jump . \n due to the coarse grained nature of the rotational tlg , @xmath35 changes by discrete jumps . \n therefore , exchange events can be unambiguously assigned whenever such a jump occurs . \n [ experiment]a plots @xmath36 in increments of ten sweeps during a portion of a single molecule trajectory . \n the fastest exchange event measurable at this time resolution is 10 sweeps . with infinite time resolution , however , we see that the definition of exchange times used in section [ dist ] would correspond precisely with the deschenes - vandenbout procedure . \n we verify this in fig . \n [ experiment]b . here , \n the distribution of times obtained via the deschenes - vandenbout procedure outlined above ( open circles ) @xcite are compared to the distribution of rotational exchange times calculated in section [ dist ] ( solid line ) . \n the comparison is very good for about ten orders of magnitude . \n this method overestimates the distribution at early times for the reasons of time resolution mentioned in the previous paragraph . \n the inset shows a comparison of the distribution of rotational persistence times . \n the open circles are obtained from the open circles in the main panel of fig . \n [ experiment]b via equation ( [ jungeq ] ) . \n once again , the agreement is very good . in particular , the data obtained via the procedure of deschenes and vandenbout captures the structure and location of the main peak . \n single molecule experiments also measured the mean rotational exchange times , @xmath37 ( i.e. the first moment of @xmath30 , fig . \n [ rot]a , inset ) , as a function of temperature . \n it was found that @xmath37 scaled with temperature in the same way as @xmath12 , the rotational correlation time , and that @xmath37 was 10 - 20 times larger than @xmath12 at a given temperature @xcite . \n our calculations indicate that @xmath38 or , using the definition that @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath40 . \n the rotational correlation time , @xmath12 , scales like the structural relaxation time : @xmath41 @xcite . \n that is , @xmath37 exhibits a much weaker dependence on temperature than @xmath42 similar to what is found in spin - facilitated models @xcite . \n we also find that @xmath37 is as much as six orders of magnitude times smaller than @xmath12 at the highest densities . \n this difference with experimental findings is most likely due to the issue of time resolution mentioned earlier and also discussed in @xcite which biases experimental measures of @xmath43 to longer times . \n the author would like to acknowledge david chandler , juan garrahan and younjoon jung for valuable discussions and the us national science foundation and department of energy ( grant no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 3767, "GeneratedTokens": 257, "SynthesizedBody": "after more than a half - century of study , the basic physical processes that are responsible for heating the million - degree corona and accelerating the supersonic solar wind are now beginning to be pinned down . \n different mechanisms are probably dominant for different regions ( see reviews by * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n for example , it seems increasingly clear that bright euv and x - ray loops are heated by small - scale , intermittent magnetic reconnection that is driven by the continual stressing of their magnetic footpoints @xcite .    for the open - field regions that link the corona and the solar wind , \n there is still disagreement about the relative contributions of different processes ( see   4 below ) . \n however , we are rapidly approaching a time when these processes can be included in self - consistent models that can make testable predictions . \n this paper attempts to summarize some recent work that is helping us to bring observations and theoretical models to the point of straightforward comparison and testing . because the coronal magnetic field varies so substantially both as a function of position ( on the sun at any one time ) and as a function of time ( over the solar cycle ) , there is always a broad range of solar wind source regions available for comparison with model predictions . in some ways , \n these variations give us something approaching the turnable `` parameter knobs '' of a laboratory experiment . \n this paper emphasizes the example of differences between the previous solar minimum ( 19961997 ) and the present minimum ( 20072009 ) . \n the most definitive link between a particular type of coronal structure ( measured via remote sensing ) and a specific type of quasi - steady solar wind flow ( measured _ in situ _ ) is the connection between large coronal holes and high - speed streams @xcite . \n coronal holes are generally interpreted as bundles of open flux tubes that flare out superradially with increasing distance . \n observations from the uvcs instrument on _ soho _ suggest that the range of heights over which the wind s acceleration occurs in coronal holes can vary greatly , even when the wind at 1 au is identically fast @xcite . \n the denser slow - speed solar wind appears to come from many different coronal sources . \n two regions that are often cited as sources of slow wind are : ( 1 ) boundaries between coronal holes and streamers , and ( 2 ) narrow plasma `` stalks '' that extend out from the tops of streamer cusps ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n however , during active phases of the solar cycle there is evidence that slow wind also originates in small coronal holes and active regions @xcite . \n the remainder of this paper will discuss the fast solar wind that emerges from polar coronal holes at solar minimum @xcite . \n however , as the soho23 meeting has demonstrated , not all solar minima are created equal . \n the morphology of the coronal magnetic field exhibited some interesting differences from the previous minimum to the present minimum . \n polar coronal holes on the disk in 20072009 are smaller in area ( by about 15% ) in comparison to those from 19961997 , and their mean photospheric magnetic fields are lower by about 40% as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) . the magnetic field measured at 1 \n au is also lower , but by only about 20% @xcite . \n the streamer belt observed in the extended corona has a broader latitudinal extent than it did in 19961997 @xcite . \n it is likely that this is the result of two contributing factors . \n ( 1 ) the weaker polar field does not exert as much transverse pressure , which acts to confine the streamer belt to low latitudes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n ( 2 ) there are more small and transient coronal holes at low latitudes during the present minimum ; these can also deform the streamer belt . \n some likely consequences of the above differences in the coronal magnetic field are discussed below . \n low - density coronal holes exhibit a complex array of plasma parameters due to their nearly collisionless nature . as a result \n , every particle species evolves towards having its own unique temperature , its own type of departure from a maxwellian velocity distribution , and its own outflow speed . \n remote - sensing measurements of the low corona ( i.e. , @xmath01.3 @xmath1 ) and the extended corona ( @xmath2 to 10 @xmath1 ) , as well as _ in situ _ particle and field detection in the heliosphere ( @xmath3 ) , can be combined to follow this evolution . \n the extended corona is particularly important to study in this regard , since it is not only where most of the wind s acceleration occurs , but it is also where many plasma species undergo their transition from collisional to collisionless dynamics ( see * ? ? ? \n as an example of how different types of measurements can help paint a more complete picture , figure 1 shows temperature measurements in polar coronal holes from the last solar minimum in 19961997 . \n the one - fluid temperatures shown at the lowest heights come from semi - empirical ( * ? ? ? \n * dashed curve ) and theoretical ( * ? ? ? \n * solid curve ) models of the photosphere , chromosphere , and low corona . \n electron temperatures in the low corona were measured by sumer/_soho _ and reported by ( * ? ? ? \n * black bars ) and ( * ? ? ? \n * gray bars ) . \n uvcs - derived proton temperatures in the extended corona are also shown ( * ? ? ? \n * triangles ) with an attempt to remove the model - dependent alfvn wave broadening . \n perpendicular temperatures of a representative minor ion ( o@xmath4 ) are shown from sumer measurements at low heights ( * ?

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n however , many other dissipation processes have been proposed as well , and they often involve multiple steps of energy conversion between waves , reconnection structures , and other nonlinear plasma features . \n taking all of the above complexities into account and producing a self - consistent model of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration ( for all particle species ) has still not been accomplished . however , if an assumption is made to consider only the _ total _ energy content of the plasma  and not its `` partitioning '' into protons , electrons , and other ions  then the problem becomes more tractable . at this level of detail , \n there are two general types of physics - based model that attempt to explain the overall flows of energy :    1 . \n there are _ wave / turbulence - driven _ ( wtd ) models in which open magnetic flux tubes rooted to the photosphere are jostled by convection , leading to waves that propagate up into the corona . \n these waves ( usually alfvn waves ) are often proposed to partially reflect back down toward the sun , develop into strong mhd turbulence , and dissipate over a range of heights . \n these models also tend to explain the differences between fast and slow solar wind _ not _ by any major differences in the lower boundary conditions , but instead as an outcome of different rates of lateral flux - tube expansion over several solar radii @xcite . \n 2 .   there are _ reconnection / loop - opening _ ( rlo ) models in which the flux tubes feeding the solar wind are influenced by impulsive bursts of mass , momentum , and energy addition . \n there is often assumed to be strong coupling between closed , loop - like magnetic flux systems ( that are in the process of emerging , fragmenting , and diffusing across the surface ) and the open flux tubes that connect to the solar wind . \n these models tend to explain the differences between fast and slow solar wind as a result of qualitatively different rates of flux emergence , reconnection , and coronal heating at the basal footpoints of different regions on the sun @xcite . \n @xcite presented a set of wtd models in which the one - fluid equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation were solved simultaneously with transport equations for alfvnic and acoustic wave energy . \n the coronal heating rate was computed self - consistently from a phenomenological description of turbulent dissipation of partially reflected alfvn waves ( see also * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n it is important to note that these models were run with lower boundary conditions in the optically thick solar photosphere , and _ not _ in the transition region ( tr ) or low corona . \n thus , the properties of the chromosphere , the height of the tr , and the mass flux of plasma entering the solar wind were all computed robustly and consistently in these models . \n the @xcite models of polar coronal holes produced conditions at 1 au that appeared consistent with fast solar wind measurements at the 19961997 solar minimum . \n more recently , we computed a new set of wtd models that were designed to correspond to the 20072009 solar minimum \n . the _ only change _ made to the models was in the radial dependence of the imposed magnetic field strength . \n the @xcite magnetic field profile was multiplied by a smooth function constructed to produce the following effects : ( 1 ) no change to the @xmath81 kg field strength in the intergranular flux tubes in the photosphere ; ( 2 ) a 40% reduction in the field strength at the base of the corona ( @xmath9 ) to account for the lower polar field strengths measured by low - resolution magnetograms ; and ( 3 ) an 18% reduction in the field strength in interplanetary space from one minimum to the next ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n figure 2 shows the relative changes in the resulting wtd models of polar coronal holes . \n all quantities are ratios of the form @xmath10 , where the subscript `` old '' refers to the 19961997 minimum and `` new '' refers to the 20072009 minimum . \n the change in the input magnetic field strength , described above , is shown as a solid line . \n the other quantities are all self - consistent _ outputs _ of the model . \n the relative changes at 1 au can be compared with measured changes in the plasma parameters from @xcite and @xcite . \n table 1 shows this comparison and confirms that the modeled solar wind responds in a very similar way to the changing magnetic field as does the actual solar wind . in both the models and the _ ulysses _ polar pass data , \n the solar wind speed @xmath11 is relatively unchanged , but the density @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 decrease by factors that hover around 20% and 10% , respectively . \n the decreases in gas pressure ( proportional to @xmath14 ) and dynamic pressure ( proportional to @xmath15 ) are between 20% and 30% for both the observations and models . \n lcc & _ ulysses _ polar data & wtd model output + speed & 03% & + 01% + density & 17% & 22% + temperature & 14% & 08% + gas pressure & 28% & 21% + dynamic pressure & 22% & 27% +    figure 2 also shows that the models predict the present solar minimum should have a smaller temperature in the low corona and a slightly higher density . \n nobeyama measurements of the radio `` brightness temperature '' ( yashiro et al . \n , this meeting ) do indicate a slightly lower temperature in the upper chromosphere during 20072009 , in comparison to 19961997 , but there are not yet any firm comparisons from measurements in the low corona . at the heights observable by uvcs , \n the predicted temperature decline in figure 2 is about 20% and the predicted density change has shifted from an increase to a slight decrease . \n ( at these heights we expect the proton , electron , and heavy ion temperatures to be behaving differently from one another . ) \n preliminary reports of minimum - to - minimum variations from uvcs indicate that the h  i ly@xmath16 intensities are higher in 20072009 than in 19961997 , and the o  vi intensities are lower ( gardner et al . \n , this meeting ; miralles et al . , this meeting ) \n . both of these changes may be consistent with lower electron temperatures and electron densities , but only detailed empirical modeling of the spectral line properties will reveal whether that is the case . \n the _ soho _ era has seen significant progress toward identifying and characterizing the physical processes responsible for coronal heating and solar wind acceleration . as \n remote - sensing measurements have become available in the collisionless extended corona , the traditional gap between solar physics and _ in situ _ space physics has become narrower . however , there are still many unanswered questions : how and where in the solar atmosphere are the relevant waves and turbulent motions generated ? which kinds of fluctuation modes ( i.e. , linear or nonlinear ; alfvn , fast , or slow ; high @xmath17 or high @xmath18 ) are most important ? what frequencies dominate the radially evolving power spectrum ? what fraction of the interplanetary solar wind comes from filamentary structures such as coronal reconnection events and/or plumes and jets ?    answering the above questions involves moving forward in both the theoretical and observational directions . a key step to making further progress \n is the ability to include both the wtd and rlo processes in existing 3d numerical simulations of the sun - heliosphere system . \n some recent progress in producing computationally efficient approximations to the rates of wtd wave reflection has been reported by @xcite and @xcite . \n studies of the connection between the evolving `` magnetic carpet '' and the open flux tubes that feed the solar wind are also ongoing . \n the plasma parameters of both the major species ( protons , electrons , and he@xmath19 ) and minor ions are not yet known in coronal holes to the accuracy required to determine the relative contributions of the proposed physical processes . \n as figure 1 shows , even quantities as basic as the ratio @xmath20 are not yet known with sufficient accuracy because measurements of the proton and electron temperatures have not yet been made over the same ranges of heights . \n minor ion measurements need to be extended to a larger number of ions ( i.e. , a wider range of ion cyclotron frequencies ) so that the ultimate kinetic damping mechanisms of waves and turbulence can be determined ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n also , we do not yet have a good enough observational `` lower boundary condition '' on the energetics of waves and turbulence in the photosphere . \n existing measurements of the sun s convective granulation with sub - arcsecond spatial resolution need to be matched by sub - second _ time resolution , _ so that the power spectrum of the motions of small - scale magnetic flux tubes ( e.g. , g - band bright points ) can be extended to higher frequencies .", "StartTimeOffset": 582280655645, "RequestID": "08d31ea8af1d43c9b314fc46d4b9c396", "TotalTokens": 4024}

{"ContextTokens": 2201, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "modern and demanding application of radial velocities , like those associated with the search for extra - solar planets , have promoted the introduction of new methods of wavelength calibration . \n the key to success has been recording of the reference wavelength grid for to the whole duration of the science exposure and through the same optical train and path . \n two approaches have been followed : the _ parallel _ ( where thorium lines going through telescope optics are recoded on the ccd close and parallel to the science spectrum with an exposure lasting as long as the science observation ) , and the _ iodine - cell _ one ( the stellar spectrum passes through and is absorbed by a cell filled with iodine vapors , that mark the stellar spectrum with a huge number of sharp and equally intense absorption lines ) . \n both approaches require delicate instrumentation , careful maintenance and dedicated spectrographs . \n as such they are not easily manageable on small , all - purpose telescopes . \n we propose here a third , independent way to mark with reference wavelengths the science spectrum as it is recorded , through exactly the same optical train and path . \n it consists of using optical fibers with recorded in them bragg gratings that allows undisturbed passage of all wavelengths except a selection of few ones that will appear in the spectrum as sharp , deep absorption lines of constant and pre - selected wavelengths . \n the latter are then used as a reference grid to accurately wavelength calibrate the science spectrum . \n the system is easy and fast , allows to decouple the spectrograph from the telescope and operate it in a controlled environment , requires minimal mechanical work to be adapted to existing spectrographs , the marking absorption lines can be placed at any preferred wavelength , and the fibers can be mass - produced at low cost for distribution to interested observatories . \n fbgs can be easily installed on spectrographs already designed to operate in multiple fiber mode . \n the rave project ( steinmetz 2003 ) , with its fixed wavelength range , would represent an ideal case for the application of fbgs . \n the fbgs ( fiber bragg grating ) appear of potential interest also to gaia . \n the latter s spectrograph operates in tdi , slit - less mode with thousands of spectra simultaneously crossing the field of view as the satellite spins . \n no conventional calibration lamp can be used , obviously . \n the base - lined wavelength calibration procedure foresees using stars of recognized constant radial velocity as they travel across the spectrograph focal plane , by accurately linking their astrometric position on the sky to the wavelength of their absorption lines on the pixels of the ccds .    a bundle of fbgs properly introduced in the gaia spectrograph optical train would mark with a set of properly placed reference absorption lines the spectra of all stars entering the field of view . \n the fbgs could become the prime wavelength calibration mean of gaia spectra ( particularly for preliminary solutions while the mission is still flying ) , or a backup for the method based on standard radial velocity stars in case this would not satisfactorily operate for whatever reason once the satellite will reach l@xmath0 . \n the fbgs dissipate no power and have no movable parts . \n they should also stand the low operating temperatures of the satellite in l@xmath0 and should do not degrade with time , and thus looking ideal for use in space . \n no fbg has ever been used as proposed in this paper , and thus confirmatory tests are required . at the astronomical observatory of padova \n we plan to manufacture and test prototype fibers for the gaia / rave wavelength range to check their performance with actual observations at the telescope . \n fiber gratings are made by laterally exposing the core of the fiber to a periodic pattern of intense ultraviolet light . \n the exposure produces a permanent increase in the refractive index of the fiber s core , creating a fixed index modulation according to the exposure pattern : this fixed pattern is called a grating . at each periodic change of refraction , a small amount of light is reflected ( bragg diffraction ) . \n all the reflected light signals combine coherently to one large reflection at a particular wavelength when the grating period is approximately half the input light wavelength . \n this is referred as the bragg condition and the wavelength at which this reflection occurs is called the bragg wavelength ( @xmath1 ) . \n light at wavelengths different from @xmath1 , which are not phase matched , will pass unabsorbed through the fiber . thus , light propagates through the grating with negligible attenuation and only those wavelengths that satisfy the bragg condition are affected and strongly back - reflected . \n application of this technology to astronomical spectra at gaia wavelengths is attractive for two basic reasons : ( @xmath2 ) the technology is already mature with the tele - communication industry that operate it in the near - ir , down to 1  @xmath3 m , and ( @xmath4 ) the limited @xmath5 range observed by gaia and rave requires only a limited number of reference lines to be properly calibrated ( see discussion in desidera and munari 2003 ) , which in turn means an easier fbgs production . \n exposing a photosensitive fiber , usually germanium - doped ( yuen , 1982 ) , to an intensity pattern of ultraviolet radiation ( at wavelengths between 240 and 255 nm , where the germanium has an absorption band ) is used to produce ( i.e. write ) a fiber bragg grating . in its basic form \n the grating selectively reflects light at the bragg wavelength @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the grating spacing and @xmath8 is the effective index of refraction . \n both @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on fabrication parameters : @xmath8 depend on the modal dispersion characteristics of the fiber and lies , for each mode , between the core and cladding indices . \n the functional form of the normalized frequency ( @xmath9 ) parameter is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diameter of the fiber core , @xmath12 is the free space wavelength , @xmath13 the core index and @xmath14 the clad index . \n note that the difference between the two squared index is also the numerical aperture of the fiber . for low enough @xmath9 values \n the fiber is single mode and only one bragg reflection is observed at @xmath15 wavelength given above . at a certain value of @xmath9 the fiber become two moded with two separated bragg wavelengths , and for larger @xmath9 values many more modes begin to appear in the fiber grating spectrum . \n the lowest order or fundamental mode has the longest @xmath1 , and the higher order modes have progressively shorter @xmath1 with the cladding index giving the limit on the shortest @xmath1 . \n the peak reflectivity is an increasing function of the grating length and of the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( lam & garside , 1981 ) .    recording fbgs inside a fiber usually involves interference between two coherent uv laser beams that precisely define the spacing between the grating planes . for symmetric incidence and an angle @xmath16 between the uv beams , \n the pitch of the recorded grating is 0.5@xmath17 , where @xmath12 is the illumination wavelength . \n the basic interferometric setup splits the laser beam to create an interference pattern on the fiber ( morey et al . \n , 1989 ) as shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) . \n because the beams travel different paths , the laser must have sufficient temporal coherence to account for path - length mismatch , and good spatial coherence . \n the sensitivity to mechanical instabilities of this method of fbg production can make difficult to produce identical replicas . \n the other way for writing fbgs is to use phase mask to generate multiple beams ( hill et al . , 1993 ) . \n two of the beams carry approximately 40% of the total energy and closely overlap the phase mask surface to create an interference pattern at the desired bragg wavelength . \n the fiber - phase mask assembly can be illuminated either by a large beam to cover the full fiber bragg grating length or by a small scanning beam . because the fiber is usually in proximity to the phase mask , the assembly is a very stable mechanical system , suitable for mass - production of identical fbg replicas . \n the pattern recorded into the fiber is a copy of the phase mask ( pitch and chirp ) scaled by about 50% . \n desidera , s. , munari , u. , 2003 , this volume , pag . \n xxx hill k. , malo b. , bilodeau f. , johnson d. 1993 , appl.phys.lett . \n 62 ( 10 ) , 1035 lam d.k.w . , \n garside 1981 , appl . \n optics , 20 ( 3 ) , 440 morey w.w . , meltz g. , glenn w.h . \n 1989 , proc . \n spie , 1169 , 98 steinmetz m. , 2003 , this volume , pag . \n xxx ( and http://www.aip.de./rave/ ) yuen m.j . \n 1982 , appl . \n optics , 21 ( 1 ) , 136", "StartTimeOffset": 604825924924, "RequestID": "fb7e324413714b989746687516c5f6d6", "TotalTokens": 2376}

linear mfv where resummation ( non - linear @xmath21-model techniques ) become imperative . ] allows higher dimensional operators to be controlled , which otherwise give rise to rather anarchic flavour transitions @xcite . \n the effective lagrangian , in the absence of the knowledge of the dynamics of the underlying model , is parametrized as , @xmath22 the sum of all combinations invariant under @xmath23 . \n the dimension of the operator ( invariant ) brings in a certain hierarchy in the infinite sum above with the scale of new physics is generally obscured by loop factors , mixing angles and renormalization group effects as in any bottom - up effective field theory approach . ] . \n the crucial technical point is that _ finding the invariants is equivalent to finding the constant tensors of the symmetry group_. let us here introduce the following ( standard ) notation for tensors : an index transforming under a @xmath24 or @xmath25 representation shall be denoted by lower and upper indices respectively @xmath26 non - constant tensors will be denoted by @xmath27 . in principle this tensor classification is not sufficient for our general problem since there are three different group factors . \n it will though prove sufficient here to contract the other indices invariants and those groups are not of interest to us anyway . ] . \n we therefore contract the @xmath28 index and directly write @xmath29 the subscript @xmath30 shall be dropped when there is no reason for confusion . in the reminder we shall use the following notation : @xmath31 the following operator classification @xmath32 directly connects to the mfv operators @xcite @xmath33 before entering into the realm of invariants \n let us briefly discuss the discrete su(3 ) subgroups . \n the discrete su(3 ) subgroups were classified a long time ago @xcite and further analysed as alternatives to su(3)@xmath34 in the context of the eightfold way @xcite . \n explicit representations and clebsch - gordan coefficients were systematically worked out in a series of papers around 1980 @xcite , partly motivated as alternatives to @xmath35 for lattice qcd ; and further elaborated very recently @xcite in the context of family symmetries . \n the discrete su(3 ) subgroups are of two kinds . \n the analogues of crystal groups , of which we list here the maximal subgroups : @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 . \n the factor @xmath36 can in general either be one or three depending on whether the center of su(3 ) is divided out or not . \n for the maximal subgroups it is three . \n the second kind are the infinite sequence of groups , sometimes called `` dihedral like '' or `` trihedral '' , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 . \n the symbol `` @xmath40 '' denotes a semidirect product . \n the largest irreps of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are 3- , respectively 6-dimensional ; independent of @xmath43 .    that the catalogue of @xcite as compared to @xcite is not complete already surfaced in the 1980 @xcite and it has recently been reemphasized @xcite that the so - called @xmath44-groups @xcite have not been discussed systematically in the literature . in appendix \n @xcite we argue that the @xmath44-groups , or more precisely the six - parameter @xmath45 matrix groups , are subgroups of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the lowest common multiple of @xmath43 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . \n this is sufficient for our consideration .      in discussing invariants \n we are going to use the fact , based on the orthogonality theorem , that the number of times the identity appears in a kronecker product @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath51 , is equal to the number of invariants that can be formed out of the irreps @xmath52@xcite . \n + * new invariants @xmath53-level  no @xmath54 : * the problem of finding all invariants of the @xmath4 operator is equivalent to finding the invariants of the following kronecker product : @xmath55 . \n the symbol @xmath56 stands for the symmetric part . \n the restriction to the symmetric part can be justified by first considering the tensor products of the yukawas and the quarks separately . \n the logic that we shall employ is that if the kronecker product of the @xmath57 decomposes any different from su(3 ) then there are necessarily further invariants . \n the following kronecker products will prove sufficient to convey our argument : @xmath58 the two equations above make it evident that a necessary condition for an identical decomposition is that the discrete group contains a 27d irrep . \n the trihedral groups @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not in this category since their largest irreducible representations ( irreps ) are at most 3- , respectively 6-dimensional . going through the character tables in @xcite and \n the more recent work @xcite we realize that there is _ no _ discrete subgroup of su(3 ) which has a 27d irrep ! note , on even more general grounds that @xmath59 almost saturates the relation between the order of the group and the sum of the dimension of its irreps squared @xcite and leaves @xmath60 as the only hypothetical candidate among the crystal - like groups . \n + * no new invariants @xmath61-level for four groups : * the good news is though that the four crystal - like groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 do have representations that decompose as and are going to be interesting under the technical assumption of `` family irreducibility '' to be discussed below . here \n we shall give an overview of the number of complex conjugate 3d irreps and the number of invariants ( under certain symmetrizations ) :    .__number of invariants for tensors of type @xmath62 , whose definition can be inferred from eq .  . \n the subscripts @xmath63 indicate symmetrizations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 pairs of @xmath66 indices . @xmath67 and \n @xmath68 correspond to the ( symmetric ) contractions of @xmath5 and @xmath69 in . \n _ _ [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that we implicitly stated that there are groups where @xmath69 operators are possible with @xmath61 solely ; without any yukawa transitions . \n the group @xmath70 is an example which is discussed in appendix a of reference @xcite . \n it is argued , with concrete examples , that new invariants necessarily upset the flavour hierarchy of mfv @xcite . in particular \n the breaking of the continuous flavour group down to a discrete group implies that the mass - flavour basis transformation become observable and deprive the approach of its predictivity . to conclude , that the necessity of new invariants at the @xmath53-level and its connection with the well - tested @xmath4 transitions , imply that no discrete flavour group is suitable appears too hasty . \n the generation mechanism of @xmath4 operators has to be reflected upon . \n we distinguish the two cases where the @xmath69 process is generated via two subsequent @xmath5 parts and where this is not the case . \n we shall call the former `` family irreducible '' and the latter `` family reducible '' , c.f . fig . \n [ fig : deltaf12 ] . \n the sm and the r - parity conserving mssm are examples of the `` family reducible''-type whereas the r - parity violating mssm is of the `` family irreducible''-type . \n the composite technicolor model @xcite , in the absence of the knowledge of its non - perturbative dynamics , have to be counted into the latter class as well . \n `` family reducability '' essentially implies @xmath71 factorization of the invariant and proves to be a _ sufficient _ condition for a discrete tev - scale scenario for the four crystal - like groups listed in tab . \n [ tab : candidates ] . to this end \n we would like to discuss two further points :    * @xmath72 model - independent : the most suitable candidate , for a tev - scale dmfv scenario is @xmath72 , since the first new invariants appear only at the @xmath53-level c.f . \n tab  [ tab : candidates ] . yet : _ how small does @xmath73 need to be in order for @xmath74 to satisfy the same kind of experimental bounds as for @xmath75 found in reference @xcite ? _ the discussion in section 5.1 @xcite suggests that @xmath76 could be induced at first order in @xmath77 for new invariants , as compared to order @xmath78 in mfv . \n a @xmath79 transition could therefore be @xmath80 as compared to @xmath81 in mfv . according to our reflection above we have to balence : @xmath82 . \n * it has to be kept in mind that even when a model is in the `` family irreducible''-class , the fact that the vertices are @xmath23-invariant prevents the generation of non factorizable @xmath53-invariants . \n we argue that this is indeed the case for the r - parity violating mssm ( at least to leading order ) @xcite . \n our aim , in this work , was to point out general issues of implementing mfv via a discrete group . \n we would hope that this work would be of some help for further investigations towards more specific models . \n it also has to be said that although mfv has very attractive features , e.g. a sufficiently stable proton in the r - parity violating mssm @xcite , so far no explicit model for mfv has appeared in the literature . \n moreover the formulation could be refined by constructing a discrete subgroup of @xmath11 which does not factor into direct products of su(3 ) subgroups @xcite . \n one might wonder what the consequences are , of such a non - trivial embedding , for the invariants . \n * acknowledgements : * rz would like to thank many colleagues for inspiring discussions and remarks and at last i would like to thank the organizers if the kazimierz workshop for the organization and a very pleasant atmosphere . \n rz acknowledges the support of an advanced stfc fellowship . \n s.  dimopoulos , h.  georgi and s.  raby , phys . \n b * 127 * ( 1983 ) 101 . \n g.  dambrosio , g.  f.  giudice , g.  isidori and a.  strumia , nucl . \n b * 645 * ( 2002 ) 155 [ arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3811, "GeneratedTokens": 205, "SynthesizedBody": "at high density , normal hadron matter has been predicted a deconfined transition , where quark - gluon plasma is formed . \n this could have important consequences for compact stars , with central densities several times the nuclear saturation density . \n ever since strange quark matter(sqm ) , a conglomerate of up , down and strange quarks , has been suggested as a possible absolutely stable or metastable phase of nuclear matter@xcite , it has been speculated that strange stars might exist in the universe@xcite . \n the studies that quark interactions within lowest order perturbative qcd were considered in the mit bag model also predicted that sufficiently heavy strangelets might be absolutely stable@xcite . \n if the sqm hypothesis is correct then some ( perhaps all ) pulsars may be strange stars@xcite . \n thus it would have obvious implications for our understanding of pulsars if strange stars could exist . \n it is an important subject that probing possible observational evidences of the existence of strange stars by astrophysical investigations . \n since self - bound of sqm due to strong interaction is very important , the mass - radius relation of the assumed strange stars has been uncovered to be different from that of neutron stars . however , for the canonical mass of @xmath0 , gravity dominates the strong interaction which leads to strange stars and neutrons being similar in size@xcite . \n therefore , the attempt to distinguish strange stars from neutron stars for given observed masses and radii of pulsars seems to have encountered with great difficulties . \n strange stars could indicate the distinguishable signal from neutron stars by their cooling properties , but the difference in the cooling behavior of strange stars and neutron stars will disappears if the direct urca process is operating in the core of an neutron star , which is done either by the proton fraction rising above @xmath1 @xcite or by hyperons being present in the core of a neutron star@xcite . \n this would make it difficult to identify a strange star from cooling data . \n ever since andersson realized that the r - modes are unstable at all rates of rotation in perfect fluid stars@xcite , a series of papers have investigated the many implications for gravitational radiation detection and the evolution of pulsar@xcite . in recent years \n , several crucial issues regarding the astrophysical relevance of the r - mode instability have been investigated . \n key results concern the interaction between oscillations in core fluid and the crust@xcite , the role of the magnetic field@xcite superfluidity@xcite and the effect of exotic particles that are thought to exist in the deep neutron star core@xcite . \n meanwhile , @xcite has pointed out that the r - mode instability may provide the means to distinguish strange stars from neutron stars . \n the main reason for this is that the viscosity coefficients are rather different in these two cases . \n while the shear viscosity of a strange star is comparable to that of a neutron star , the bulk viscosity would be many orders of magnitude stronger than its neutron star counterpart . \n this has interesting effects on the r - mode instability . \n based on the characteristic r - mode instability window of strange stars , which is related to the gravitational wave emission and the viscosity , a few mechanisms have been discussed to explain the clustering of spin - frequencies of lmxbs@xcite . \n however , the bulk viscosity coefficient in madsen s studies takes the one for the case of non - interacting quark gas in mit bag@xcite . \n in fact , if the interaction among quarks is considered , the bulk viscosity increases , which is calculated by @xcite . as we will show in the following , the r - mode instability window for strange stars will be significantly modified , when the improved bulk viscosity is adopted .    as demonstrated blow \n , we find the r - mode instability window is evidently narrowed due to the inclusion of medium effect(interactions among constituent particles ) . \n the medium effect makes the lowest critical spin frequency rise to 558hz from about 300 - 400hz(for the case of free quark gas ) . \n the limiting period of 1.78msec corresponding 558hz is closer to the two most rapidly spinning pulsars known ( with the periods of 1.56msec and 1.61msec ) than the periods of 2.5msec and 3msec given by madsen . \n in addition , if it could be established that rapidly spinning pulsar are strange stars , the pulsar data would put certain constraints on the model parameter , namely the current mass of strange quark mass @xmath2 . as we can see in madsen s article@xcite , in the normal and especially in the 2-flavor color superconducting phase ( 2sc ) case , \n the theoretical results is not consistent with the pulsar data when @xmath3mev . \n however , when we taking the medium effects into account , the constraints to @xmath2 from pulsar data appears to be deeply relaxed , and we will show that @xmath2 can be taken as 100mev in this article . \n this paper is organized as the following . in section 2 \n , we recall the bulk viscosity of interacting quark matter and compute the damping time scale on r - modes . in section 3 , we give the improved critical curve(spin frequency ) in spin frequency(@xmath4)-temperature(@xmath5 ) plane . in section 4 , we give a summary . \n ever since @xcite pointed out that strange quark matter is characterized by a huge bulk viscosity relative to nuclear matter , some investigations have tried to calculate the relevant viscosity coefficient of sqm@xcite . in a mit bag model \n , it is thought that the exact solution had been obtained by madsen@xcite . however , he ignored the coupling among quarks in the bag , which had been considered in the study of the equation of state of sqm@xcite . soon before , we found the coupling s effect on the bulk viscosity leads to an increase of the viscosity over an order of magnitude although the medium modifications of the equation of state of strange quark matter was proven to be small@xcite . \n to very good approximation , the relevant bulk viscosity coefficient still takes the form formulated by @xcite : @xmath6 but here @xmath7 and @xmath8 were given by @xcite , which are extremely differing from madsen s and strongly depending on the coupling constant of strong interactions among quarks . \n we expressed them as @xmath9 @xmath10 ^{2}{\\rm ( s}^{-2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 was given in the references@xcite . \n the bulk viscosity is expected to be the dominated internal fluid mechanism in hot compact stars . \n the timescales for the bulk viscosity damping of r - modes need to be estimated . since the coupling of the r - modes to bulk viscosity vanishes in the lowest - order expression , the derived timescales must be based on the fully self - consistent second - order calculation of this coupling . \n the earlier estimates ca nt gain this end@xcite . \n but it has been completed by @xcite . \n we substitute our viscosity for the given low - t limit(@xmath13 ) into the formula(6.2)given by @xcite , and find the only difference comparing to the early calculation is the change of the viscosity coefficient . \n thus , we can immediately obtain the timescale by a simple comparison instead of the repeat of the complicated calculations @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote temperature in units of @xmath18 k and the current mass of strange quark in units of 100 mev , and @xmath19 is the mean density of the star . \n evidently , @xmath20 is determined with the chemical potential @xmath21 , which can be obtained by solving the equations related to chemical equilibrium , electric charge neutrality and conservation of baryon number for given @xmath22 , namely @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 here , @xmath27 denotes the baryon number density , and @xmath28 is the particle number density . \n @xmath29 is the energy per baryon and we approximately take it as the mass of a neutron in our calculation .    the coupling @xmath30 will extremely influences the solutions of the above equations . \n following @xcite , @xmath30 is taken as a free parameter ranging from 0 to 5 and the equations(6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8) are solved numerically . \n figure 1 shows @xmath20 as a function of @xmath22 for different @xmath30 and @xmath31mev . \n the time scales depend on @xmath30 remarkably while they are nearly independent of @xmath22 . \n the time scale for @xmath32 arrives at tens of times shorter than the case of @xmath33 . for a strange star with mass @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km \n , we find @xmath20 ranges from 4.24@xmath36s@xmath37 to 1.53@xmath38s@xmath39 . \n this is of great interest because this will significantly increases the critical rotation angular velocity for the onset of r - mode instability . \n the r - mode unstable ( or stable ) regime of the relativistic stars , neutron stars as well as strange stars , depends on the competition between the gravitational radiation and various dissipation mechanisms . to plot the instability window of r - mode or gain the critical rotation frequency for a given stellar model as a function of temperature , we need to acquire the characteristic timescales , damping and growing timescales of r - mode instability . due to \n the emission of gravitational waves , the r - mode grows on a timescale @xmath40 where @xmath41 is @xmath42s for @xmath43 polytropic eos , which was respectively studied by @xcite and @xcite . for the viscous damping timescales , we shall also consider the shear viscosity besides bulk viscosity discussed in the last section . in strange stars , the time scale for the shear viscous damping \n is given @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is @xmath46s corresponding to @xmath43 , @xmath47 is the strong coupling and we take @xmath48 in following calculation@xcite \n .    we can now evaluate the critical spin frequency as a function of temperature from the equation @xmath49    figure 2 shows the regions of r - mode ( in)stability in spin frequency - temperature(@xmath50)plane for a strange star with mass @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km . \n the shading between the two curves displays the effect of the medium modification of quark masses on critical rotation frequencies . \n the medium effect narrows the r - mode instability window . \n the dotted curve corresponds to @xmath33 , reduced to the madsen s result@xcite , and @xmath32 is assumed in the upper contour(the solid curve ) . \n the upper contour has a lowest limiting frequency denoted by @xmath51 as 558hz(the corresponding period is 1.78msec ) , which is more close to the two most rapidly spinning pulsars known , with frequencies of 642hz and 622hz ( the periods are 1.56 and 1.61msec ) , than the period of 2.5msec . \n this implies a strange star would slow down by gravitational wave emission when it reaches the instability window and spin around in 1.78msec instead of the 2.5@xmath523msec expected by madsen . \n figure 3 shows the results for 2sc stars . \n similar to figure 1 , the medium effect also increases the critical rotation frequency of 2sc stars , but it should be stressed that the medium effect leaves the most rapidly stars away from the instability window . \n figure 4 depicts the instability windows where the current mass of strange quark takes 100 mev . \n if the rapidly rotation pulsars could be regarded as strange stars , the medium effect would relax the stringent constraint on the choice of qcd parameters in contrast to the non - interacting medium case , for example , the 2sc stars for smaller current mass @xmath53 can safely exist due to the medium effect(see the upper dashed curve in figure 4 ) . \n we apply the bulk viscous coefficient including medium effect to reevaluate and discuss the viscous damping time . \n the time greatly depends on the strong coupling @xmath30 . \n we find the time scale @xmath20 , rather than non - interacting perfect fluid where @xmath20 is constant(the fact is that @xmath20 versus @xmath19 slowly increases for non - vanishing @xmath53 as shown in figure 1 ) , weakly decreases with increasing mass density of stars for the given larger @xmath30 . \n therefore , the medium effect due to strong interactions among quarks adds the viscous dissipation of instability modes . for a star with @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km \n , we numerically calculate the critical spin frequency as a function of temperature . \n the medium effect lead to a significant lift of the critical frequencies . \n we find that the largest critical period is reduced to 1.78msec from 2.5msec , appearing to be more close to the two most rapidly spinning pulsars known . \n we also study the 2sc stars and give our improved scenario . \n the current mass of strange quark in the model have a broader range taking the medium effects into account . \n finally , it should be mentioned that we here only consider weak coupling of strong interactions among quarks in mit bag . \n the long range unperturbation interactions are contained in the usual bag constant . \n although the mit bag constant is able to contribute to eos of sqm , the long range effects on dynamical quantities , such as viscous coefficient etc . \n , seem to be ignored due to the hiding of the microscopic processes into the bag constant . \n if the processes can be taken into account , we may conjecture that the limiting spin of strange stars would shift further upward . \n this is our future work . \n we would like to thank the partial support by national natural science foundation of china under grant no . \n 10175026 and natural science foundation of ccnu .    99 alcock c. , farli e. and olinto r. , 1986 , , 310 , 261 . \n andersson n. , 1998 , , 502 , 708 andersson n. , kokkotas k.d . and \n schutz b.f . , 1999 , , 510 , 846 andersson n. , kokkotas k.d . and stergioulas n. , 1999 , , 516 , 307 . \n andersson n. , jones d.i . \n , kokkotas k.d . and stergioulas n. , 2000 , , 534 , l75 . \n andersson n. and comer g.l . , 2001 , , 328 , 1129 . \n andersson n. , jones d.i . and kokkotas k.d . \n [ astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3590, "GeneratedTokens": 298, "SynthesizedBody": "astronomy is basically an observational science , and the development and advancement of the subject has relied heavily on surveys of the sky at optical wavelengths to expand our knowledge of the observable universe . \n however despite the considerable advances in optical detector technology very little improvement has been made in large scale surveys beyond those available in the 1950 s when the palomar sky survey was carried out . \n a photographic plate taken on a 1.2-m schmidt telescope is sky limited in about 1 hour but is only 1 - 2% efficient . \n thus our current best wide field optical sky surveys are equivalent to no more that a @xmath060 second glance at the universe with modern ccds using a 1 m telescope . in spite of the inherent limitations of photographic plates , \n they are still used for major scientific programs . in recent years , this has been primarily due to the availability of online digital atlas images and catalogues based on these photographic material eg http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~apmcat , http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/.    in an effort to rectify this apparently dismal situation , and to provide necessary underpinning imaging requirements for the 8 m telescope era , the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope on lapalma is being used to carry out a series of wide field imaging programs under the generic title of the int wide field survey(wfs ) project . \n the wfs project consists of a series of independent survey programs with distinct aims as we outline below . \n the wfs project takes into account both surveys like sdss ( gunn & weinberg 1995 ) which also uses a 2.5 m telescope and has an exposure time of @xmath060 seconds , and other ccd based surveys such as those that are being carried out by noao ( http://www.noao.edu/ ) and eso ( http://www.eso.org/ , nonino etal 1999 ) . \n the unique elements of the int survey are : ( i ) optimal choice of fields so that most are easily visible from telescopes in both hemispheres ; ( ii ) inclusion of u band ; ( iii ) large area ( iv ) temporal information ; ( iv ) good overlapping coverage with existing deep radio surveys ie first , wenss ; ( v ) wide ra coverage optimised for efficient follow -

sky time required is almost 600 nights . \n however , if the programs are combined they can be executed in around 100 nights . by merging the requirements of the various programs we end up with a highly efficient observing strategy . \n an important aspect of the reduced time requirements is that the projects will also be executed quickly . \n the limiting magnitudes and wavebands being used are summarised in table  [ table_was_nominal_limits ] . \n figure  [ fig_int_ao_gal_mags ] shows how these limits transform onto the observational plane for extragalactic studies . \n the main survey region are listed in table  [ table_was_major_survey_regions ] . \n a number of smaller regions are also being surveyed as determined by calibration requirements and the observing schedule . \n in addition , we are adding bands to other programs so that we can increase the areal coverage of multi - colour data at low cost . \n these fields are listed in table  [ table_was_supplemental_survey_regions ] . \n the was program is the umbrella programme for the wfs project and leads the coordination efforts with the other programmes on , for instance , field and filter selection , to maximise scientific return of the wfs project . \n all programs remain autonomous during this procedure so that the peer reviewed science goals are protected . \n some of the science goals of the was are outlined below :    @xmath3 * galactic studies : * including both halo and disk white dwarf luminosity function which are relevant to both dm models and to independent calibrations of the hubble time ; stellar density distributions towards the ngp , to improve extant k@xmath4 determinations of the local dm ; stellar counts towards the anti - centre and other widely spaced directions , to determine the stellar warp and refine models of galactic structure    @xmath3 * clusters of galaxies : * the aim is to determine the space density and cluster - cluster correlation function over the range 0.5@xmath5z@xmath51.0 . \n galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally - bound structures in the universe , and the study of their abundance and evolutionary history with look - back - time places strong constraints on cosmological parameters and the primordial power spectrum that gave rise to the observed large scale structure . \n @xmath3 * radio sources & radio galaxies : * deep optical identification of radio sources allows : accurate counts of different types of host along mjy tracks in the p - z plane , studies of radio source luminosity evolution ; multi - band investigation of giant - e standard candles ; the largest known sample of low - luminosity rgs with good photometry ; large - scale structure from photometric redshifts and cell counts in redshift slices ; accurate optical positions of first sources for wyffos/2df followup . \n @xmath3 * intermediate redshift type 1a supernovae : * whilst dramatic progress has been made in the determination of the fundamental cosmological parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in the last two years , the analysis is now limited by systematic errors . \n identifying @xmath020 type 1a supernovae in the critical range 0.1@xmath5z@xmath50.4 will allow a detailed treatment of these systematic errors . \n the was also incorporates two independent distinct science programmes in the spring semester centred on virgo and the north galactic pole . \n in fact , in the proposal submission procedure many co - i s of the was program submitted discrete proposals .    * * a multicolour survey of the virgo cluster : pi , davies * this aims to obtain the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) of the virgo cluster as a function of colour and position in the cluster . * * the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) : pi , driver * the mgc will provide a complete and local galaxy catalogue . \n this survey is being carried out in the b band and lies in a region of sky covered by the 2df redshift survey \n .      this programme is carrying out deep imaging of 10 deg@xmath1 to a limiting magnitude of b=26 and i=24.5 . \n it will enable the study of the evolution of galaxy clustering as a function of colour at faint magnitudes and provide a catalogue of rich galaxy clusters at intermediate red shifts . \n this programme is searching an area of @xmath010 deg@xmath1 , studying photometric and astrometric variability on scales of one hour to a year to a magnitude of v=25 . \n example areas of investigation include : the evolution of specific galactic populations ( e.g. cv s , rr lyraes , halo agb stars , brown & white dwarfs , kuiper - edgeworth belt objects , sdb stars ) , the structure of the galactic halo , statistics of optical transients related to @xmath8-ray bursts , and deep proper motion studies . \n in order to maximise the scientific value of the wfs data the was survey is concentrating on fields that are equatorial and hence follow - up can be carried out from telescopes on both hemispheres . \n this simple consideration doubles the scientific return of the survey . \n we also deliberately centred some of the fields on landolt photometric calibration fields ie sa95 and sa114 . \n the choice of photometric wavebands was relatively straight forward . \n we decided to use bands similar to the sdss bands(fukugita etal , 1996 ) . \n note our u and z bands are not identical to the sdss bands . \n see the wfs www pages for further details . \n the choice of the sdss bands means that the int surveys will be directly comparable with work carried out as part of the sdss . \n interestingly , the sdss g band is very close to the ukst @xmath9 band . \n however , manufacturing delays have meant that we had to start the survey using the standard int filter set . \n survey data is being obtained on a monthly basis and thus a summary of the data obtained will soon be out of date . \n a complete summary of observations obtained is kept on - line at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~wfcsur/status . \n the situation at the end of may 1999 was that @xmath060 deg@xmath1 had been observed in the first ten months of the survey . \n the data products currently available for access include :    * observing logs built from the fits headers * a sybase www user interface to access the raw and processed data * library bias frames , flatfield frames , defringing frames and non - linearity corrections * colour equations for all filters * processed 2d image maps , with a full record of processing steps in the fits headers * astrometric calibration , with the world coordinate system in the fits headers * photometric calibration  zero points and extinction    in the coming months the data products provided will be expanded after some quality control to include :    * object catalogues , generated using apm based routines ( irwin , 1985 ) and sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . \n further information about the int wide field imaging survey can be obtained at the isaac newton groups www page ( www.ing.iac.es/wfs ) or the uk mirror(www.ast.cam.ac.uk / ing / wfs ) . \n in addition , the wide angle survey has as a www page at www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rgm / int_sur/. further details of the pipeline processing are contained in a paper by irwin and lewis(these proceedings ) . \n the authors would like to acknowledge the unsung builders of the int wide field camera , the various peer review committee members who have guided the project since it inception in 1991 and the encouragement of their many colleagues during the long gestation period of the int wide field survey project . \n 999 bertin , e. , & arnouts , s . \n 1996 , a&a supp , 117 , 393 . \n fukugita , m. , ichikawa , t. , gunn , j. e. , doi , m. , shimasaku , k. , & schneider , d. p. 1996 , aj , 111 , 1748 . \n gunn , j.e . \n weinberg , d.h . \n , 1995 , ( astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3102, "GeneratedTokens": 119, "SynthesizedBody": "_ electrical _ spin injection , transport and detection in diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms)-nonmagnetic semiconductor ( nms ) based systems @xcite-@xcite are three crucial prerequisites for the successful realization of semiconductor spintronics . while the spin degree of freedom naturally is important , the charge degree of freedom plays a significant role in semiconductor spin transport as well , through electric field induced effects . \n several experiments@xcite-@xcite have recently shown that the spin injection efficiency is strongly dependent on both applied and intrinsic electric fields , caused by , e.g. , inhomogeneous doping . this was theoretically emphasized by yu and flatte(yf)@xcite within a drift - diffusion model from which it was shown that the magnitude and sign of an electric field strongly influences the spin relaxation length according to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a homogeneous electric field , and @xmath2 is an intrinsic ( electric field - independent ) spin diffusion length . according to eq . \n ( [ yf ] ) , the electric field enhances(suppresses ) the spin relaxation length @xmath3 in the direction anti - parallel(parallel ) to the direction of the electric field . however , the underlying assumption leading up to eq . \n ( [ yf ] ) was _ local charge neutrality _ , and thus homogeneous electric fields . \n the question is how spin polarized electrons propagate in , e.g. , inhomogeneously doped semiconductors where electric fields are inhomogeneous ?    in this paper , we use a similar approach as yf as well as self - consistent numerical calculations to study the effects of inhomogeneous electric fields . \n we find that , in an analogous drift - diffusion picture , a `` quasi - local '' spin relaxation length in the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields can be defined according to @xmath4^{-1}~ , \\label{ldu}\\ ] ] from which a strong electric field gradient dependence becomes evident . \n however , in order to understand the full influence of inhomogeneous electric fields one needs to have access to the self - consistent charge density and electric field profile . \n we have performed such self - consistent numerical calculations using a boltzmann - poisson equation approach for a dms - nms inhomogeneously doped semiconductor from which we demonstrate that electric field gradients indeed can play a crucial role in the propagation of spin polarized electrons . \n our findings may in particular highlight a possible difficulty in obtaining efficient spin polarized propagation at semiconductor interfaces between low - to - high doping concentration regions .    in the following we will show a derivation of the drift - diffusion model leading to eq . \n ( 2 ) ( section 2 ) , followed by our numerical model ( section 3 ) , and a discussion of our results ( section 4 ) . \n the current for spin - up and spin - down electrons can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the diffusion constants and conductivities for the spin - up(down ) species . here , the conductivities refer to @xmath8 , in terms of the mobilities @xmath9 and densities @xmath10 of spin - up(down ) electrons . \n the continuity equations for the two species require that @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the spin - flip scattering rates . in steady - state eqs . \n ( [ dd],[continuity ] ) result in @xmath13 for a nms @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . \n multiplying eq . \n ( [ ddc ] ) with @xmath16 and substracting them from each other we arrive to the following expression for the spin density imbalance @xmath17 @xmath18 where we have used the einstein relation @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the spin relaxation time @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 is the intrinsic spin diffusion length .    equation ( [ ddimbalance ] ) is a drift - diffusion equation for the spin density imbalance @xmath24 and contains terms depending on both the electric field , and the electric field _ \n gradient_. we note that in fact eq . \n ( [ ddimbalance ] ) resembles the corresponding equations in refs . \n @xcite , but with an _ additional term proportional to _ @xmath25 . \n similarly to refs . \n @xcite we can use the roots of the characteristic equation for eq . \n ( [ ddimbalance ] ) to define up- and down - stream spin diffusion lengths from eq . \n ( [ ddimbalance ] ) leading up to eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) . \n notice that eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) is only defined `` locally '' , over a region where @xmath26 can be considered constant , and where an average value of the electric field is used . \n note also that the above equations are also valid for ferromagnetic semiconductors provided the mobility and diffusion constant are replaced with the ones corresponding to the minority - spin species@xcite .    a comparison between eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) and refs . \n @xcite results in that eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) above contains an additional term @xmath27 in the square root . \n naturally , this term plays an important role in inhomogeneously doped semiconductors . \n we have performed self - consistent calculations and compared them with numerical fits using eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) to verify its applicability . \n our self - consistent approach is based on the solution of the boltzmann and poisson equations using numerical methods developed in ref . \n @xcite . working in a one - dimensional model ( choosing the @xmath28 direction ) , \n the transport of spin - polarized electrons is described by two bte equations according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electron distribution for the spin - up ( down ) electrons , @xmath31 is the momentum relaxation time , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the scattering rate for spin - up ( down ) electrons . the first term on the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of each nonequilibrium spin distribution to a local equilibrium ( spin - dependent ) , normalized electron distribution function @xmath34 , where @xmath35 k is the lattice temperature . \n the last term in eq . \n ( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of the spin polarization . from the distribution function @xmath36 \n we calculate the local spin density according to @xmath37 , the total charge density , @xmath38 , and the spin density imbalance , @xmath39 . in order to take into account inhomogeneous charge distributions and electric fields \n we solve eq . \n ( [ bte ] ) together with the poisson equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dielectric constant and @xmath42 is the donor concentration profile , using finite difference and relaxation methods@xcite . \n we have performed self - consistent , numerical calculations for an inhomogeneously doped dms - nms structure schematically depicted in fig . \n [ fig:1 ] using @xmath35 k , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ps , @xmath45 ns , @xmath46 m@xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 m and @xmath50 v.    at the interface between the two doping regions with concentrations @xmath51 and @xmath52 a built - in field is expected due to the diffusion of carriers from the region with higher to the region with lower doping concentration . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] where we show the electric field profile , as well as the gradient of the electric field ( inset ) around the interfacial regions , for different doping concentrations @xmath53 . \n the sign and amplitude of the electric field gradients naturally depend strongly on the doping concentration @xmath52 on a length scale of the order of the screening length .    while it is not possible to use eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) directly for a quantitative analysis of the spin transport properties , one can make preliminary estimates of the order of the spin relaxation length around a specific region using linear approximations of the electric field . \n for example , using a linear fit of @xmath1 for @xmath54 @xmath49 m for the @xmath55 curve yields @xmath56 v/@xmath49m@xmath57 . \n furthermore , using a mean value of @xmath58 kv / cm and @xmath59 @xmath49 m we obtain from eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) a spin relaxation length value @xmath60 @xmath49 m along the ( charge ) direction of transport . \n similarly , it is found that @xmath61 @xmath49 m . in comparison , \n an evaluation of eq . \n ( [ yf ] ) , i.e. without the electric field gradient term , using the same value of the electric field yields @xmath62 @xmath49 m , and @xmath63 @xmath49 m . \n thus , the spin relaxation length in the direction of the charge flow is predicted to be strongly influenced by the inhomogeneous electric field around the doping interface .    in fig . \n [ fig:3 ] , the numerically calculated spin density imbalance , @xmath24 , and total charge density , @xmath64 , are shown for the @xmath55 structure considered in the above estimates . \n the total charge density ( dashed line ) increases monotonically as expected within a screening length from the low to the high doping concentration region . \n the spin density imbalance ( solid line ) follows a similar increase , but is , however , _ \n significantly suppressed _ such that only a maximum of 0.5@xmath52 is reached around the interface region , beyond which @xmath24 decreases exponentially . the observed suppression is a consequence of the inhomogeneous electric fields . \n a crude estimate of the validity of the values for @xmath65 can be obtained by comparing our numerical calculations with @xmath66 $ ] . in fig . \n [ fig:3 ] we show the resulting fits for @xmath67 and 36 @xmath49 m , the first and latter values corresponding to the previously estimated values for @xmath65 and @xmath68 obtained from the numerically calculated electric field profiles . \n we see that the higher values of @xmath68 indeed yield that @xmath69 . \n in contrast , the @xmath68 values 0.16 and 0.3 @xmath49 m , which are of the order of the screening length , yield better fits to the numerically calculated data . \n our results and analysis shows that inhomogeneous electric fields can strongly influence the spin relaxation length , and that significant spin polarization suppression can occur as a result thereof . \n we have also high - lighted a possible mechanism that may inhibit propagation of spin polarized electrons from low - to - high regions of doping concentrations , such as encountered in future semiconductor spintronic devices . \n this work was supported by the indiana 21@xmath70 century research and technology fund . \n numerical calculations were performed using the facilities at the center for computational nanoscience at ball state university . \n 99 r.  fiederling _ et al . \n _ , nature * 402 * , 787 ( 1999 ) ; y.  ohno _ et al . \n _ , nature * 402 * , 790 ( 1999 ) \n . g.  schmidt _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n * 87 * , 227203 ( 2001 ) . \n g.  schmidt _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n rev.lett .  * 92 * , 226602 ( 2004 ) . \n van dorpe _ \n et al . _ , appl . \n , 3495 ( 2004 ) . \n m.  kohda , y.  ohno , f.  matsukura , and h. ohno , physica e * 32 * , 438 ( 2006 ) . \n c.  adelmann _ at al . \n _ , j.  vac . \n sci.technol . \n * 23 * , 1747 ( 2005 ) . \n s.  a.  crooker , and d.  l.  smith , phys.rev . \n lett .  * 94 * , 236601 ( 2005 ) . \n z.  g.  yu , and m.  e.  flatt , phys . \n b * 66 * , 201202(r ) 2002 ; _ ibid . \n _ 235302 ( 2002 ) \n . m.  e.  flatt , and j.  m.  byers , phys . \n 84 * , 4220 ( 2000 ) . \n d. csontos , and s. e. ulloa , physica e * 32 * , 412 ( 2006 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 686369661973, "RequestID": "24976f65fdb142b5acac751c10b2dc5f", "TotalTokens": 3221}

body problem is not integrable by the analytical method . \n as particular solutions , however , euler and lagrange found a collinear solution and an equilateral triangular one , respectively . \n the solutions for the restricted three - body problem , where one of three bodies is a test mass , are known as lagrange points @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . \n _ lagrange s equilateral triangular solution _ has also a practical importance , since it is stable for some cases . \n lagrange points @xmath2 and @xmath1 for the sun - jupiter system are stable and indeed the trojan asteroids are located there . for the sun - earth system , asteroids were also found around @xmath2 by the recent observations @xcite . \n recently , lagrange points have attracted renewed interests for relativistic astrophysics @xcite , where they have discussed the relativistic corrections for lagrange points @xcite , and the gravitational radiation reaction on @xmath2 and @xmath1 analytically @xcite and by numerical methods @xcite . \n it is currently important to reexamine lagrange points in the framework of general relativity . as a pioneering work , \n it was pointed out by nordtvedt that the location of the triangular points is very sensitive to the ratio of the gravitational mass to the inertial one @xcite . \n along this course , it might be important as a gravity experiment to discuss the three - body coupling terms in the post - newtonian ( pn ) force , because some of the terms are proportional to a product of three masses as @xmath3 . \n such a triple product can appear only for relativistic three ( or more ) body systems but can not for a relativistic compact binary nor a newtonian three - body system . \n it was shown by ichita et al . \n , including the present authors , that a relativistic equilateral triangular solution does not satisfy the equation of motion at the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) order except for two cases @xcite ; ( 1 ) three finite masses are equal and ( 2 ) one mass is finite and the other two are zero . \n hence , it is interesting to investigate what happens at the 1pn level for three unequal finite masses in lagrange s equilibrium configuration . for the restricted three - body problem , \n on the other hand , krefetz found a relativistic triangular solution by adding the corrections to the position of the third body @xcite . \n for three general finite masses , we shall look for a relativistic equilibrium solution that corresponds to lagrange s equilateral triangular one .    throughout this paper , \n we take the units of @xmath4 . \n first , we consider the newtonian gravity among three masses denoted as @xmath5 @xmath6 in a circular motion . the location of each mass is written as @xmath7 , where we choose the origin of the coordinates as the common center of mass , so that @xmath8 we start by seeing whether the newtonian equation of motion for each body can be satisfied if the configuration is an equilateral triangle . \n let us put @xmath9 , where we define the relative position between masses as @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 . \n then , the equation of motion for each mass becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the total mass @xmath15 . \n therefore , it is possible that each body moves around the common center of mass with the same orbital period . \n figure [ fig - tri - all ] shows a triangular configuration for general masses . \n ( [ n - eom ] ) gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the newtonian angular velocity . \n the orbital radius @xmath18 of each body with respect to the common center of mass is obtained as @xcite @xmath19 where we define the mass ratio as @xmath20 . \n for the restricted three - body problem , an inequilateral triangular solution was investigated @xcite . \n hence , for three finite masses , we study a pn triangular configuration . \n let us denote each side length of a pn triangle as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the non - dimensional correction at the 1pn order ( see fig . \n [ fig - tri - all ] ) . here , if all the three corrections are equal ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , a pn configuration is still an equilateral triangle , though each side length is changed by a scale transformation as @xmath41 . \n namely , one of the degrees of freedom for ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) corresponds to a scale transformation , and this is unphysical . in other words , \n we take account of only the corrections which keep the size of the system but change its shape . for its simplicity , we adopt the arithmetic mean of three side lengths in order to characterize the size of the system as @xmath45 , \\label{add}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see appendix [ length ] for possible choices of fixing the unphysical degree of freedom ) . \n this arithmetic mean of the pn triangle is chosen to be the same as a side length of the newtonian equilateral triangle as @xmath46 = a , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the degree of freedom for a scale transformation can be fixed . \n otherwise , a degree of freedom for a scale transformation would remain so that an ambiguity due to the similarity could enter our results . \n thus , we obtain a constraint on ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) as @xmath47 hence , we look for the remaining two conditions for determining ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) in the following .      furthermore , @xmath53 and @xmath54 also have pn corrections . however , these corrections multiplied by @xmath42 ( or @xmath44 ) make 2pn ( or higher order ) contributions in eq . \n ( [ m1-eom - c ] ) and hence they can be neglected . \n also in @xmath29 , 1pn corrections to @xmath53 and @xmath54 lead to 2pn , since they are multiplied by 1pn term as @xmath55 . \n we obtain the equation of motion for @xmath35 and @xmath36 by cyclic manipulations as @xmath37 . \n thus , we obtain the expressions for ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) as @xmath60 , \\label{d12 } \\\\ \n \\varepsilon_{23 } & = \\frac{1}{24 } \\frac{m}{a } [ ( \\nu_3 -

body problem @xcite . \n substituting eqs . \n ( [ d12 ] ) and ( [ d31 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ m1-eom - c ] ) , we obtain the angular velocity as @xmath61 where @xmath62 . \n \\label{omega - pn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using @xmath63 , one can immediately show @xmath64 , so that we find @xmath65 for the same masses and @xmath66 . \n in other words , for the same masses and angular velocity , the pn triangular configuration is always smaller than the newtonian one . \n table [ table1 ] shows the relativistic corrections of the distance between each body for lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) of solar system . \n here we choose @xmath27 and @xmath35 as the sun and each planet , respectively . in the case of the restricted three - body problem ( @xmath67 ) , it is convenient to use eqs . \n ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) rather than eqs . \n ( [ d12 ] ) - ( [ d31 ] ) , because it is natural to change not @xmath68 but location of @xmath36 . \n ( [ condition2 ] ) implies that the correction of distance between each planet and lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) is approximately @xmath69 of schwarzschild radius of the sun . \n hence , we obtain the same values of this correction for earth and jupiter . \n the similar corrections are mentioned also in the previous paper @xcite . \n the above pn effects , however , are so tiny that they could be neglected in the near - future measurements @xcite .    it is interesting to extend this 1pn work to higher pn orders for the gravitational wave physics ( see @xcite for the equation of motion and compact binaries ) . \n we reexamined the post - newtonian effects on lagrange s equilateral triangular solution for three - body problem . for three finite masses \n , it was found that a general triangular configuration satisfies the post - newtonian equation of motion in general relativity , if and only if it has the relativistic corrections to each side length . \n it was shown also that the post - newtonian triangular configuration is always smaller than the newtonian one for the same masses and angular velocity . studying the correction to stability of this configuration \n is left as future work . \n this work was supported in part ( k. y. ) by japan society for the promotion of science , grant -

{"ContextTokens": 2483, "GeneratedTokens": 64, "SynthesizedBody": "since gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were first discovered [ 1 ] , thousands of bursts have been detected by a wide variety of instruments , most notably , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , which detected 2704 bursts by the end of _ cgro _ s more than 9 year mission in 2000 june ( see , e.g. , [ 2 ] ) . \n however , the distance scale of the bursts remained uncertain until 1997 , when bepposax began localizing long - duration bursts to a few arcminutes on the sky , and distributing the locations to observers within hours of the bursts . \n this led to the discovery of x - ray [ 3 ] , optical [ 4 ] , and radio [ 5 ] afterglows , as well as host galaxies [ 6 ] . \n subsequent observations led to the spectroscopic determination of burst redshifts , using absorption lines in the spectra of the afterglows ( see , e.g. , [ 7 ] ) , and emission lines in the spectra of the host galaxies ( see , e.g. , [ 8 ] ) . to date , redshifts have been measured for 13 bursts . \n recently , [ 9 ] ( see also [ 10 ] ) , [ 11 ] ( see also [ 12 ] ) , and [ 13 ] ( see also [ 14 ] ) have proposed trends between burst luminosity and quantities that can be measured directly from burst light curves , for the long - duration bursts \n . using 1310 batse bursts for which peak fluxes and high resolution light curves were available , [ 9 ] have suggested that simple bursts ( bursts dominated by a single , smooth pulse ) are less luminous than complex bursts ( bursts consisting of overlapping pulses ) ; however , see [ 15 ] . using a sample of 7 batse bursts for which spectroscopic redshifts , peak fluxes , and high resolution light curves were available , [ 11 ] \n have suggested that more luminous bursts have shorter spectral lags ( the interval of time between the peak of the light curve in different energy bands ) . \n using the same 7 bursts , [ 13 ] have suggested that more luminous bursts have more variable light curves . \n these trends between luminosity and quantities that can be measured directly from light curves raise the exciting possibility that luminosities , and hence luminosity distances , might be inferred for the long - duration bursts from their light curves alone .    in this paper \n ( see also [ 15,16 ] ) , we present a possible luminosity estimator for the long - duration bursts , the construction of which was motivated by the work of [ 14 ] and [ 13 ] . \n we term the luminosity estimator `` cepheid - like '' in that it can be used to infer luminosities and luminosity distances for the long - duration bursts from the variabilities of their light curves alone . \n we also present a preliminary application of this luminosity estimator to 907 long - duration bursts from the batse catalog . \n we discuss the construction of our measure @xmath0 of the variability of a burst light curve  2 . in  3 , we discuss our expansion of the original [ 14 ] sample of 7 bursts to include a total of 20 bursts , including 13 batse bursts , 5 _ wind_/konus bursts , 1 _ ulysses_/grb burst , and 1 near / xgrs burst . \n also in  3 , we discuss the construction of our luminosity estimator . \n we present our preliminary application of this luminosity estimator in  4 . \n qualitatively , @xmath0 is computed by taking the difference of the light curve and a smoothed version of the light curve , squaring this difference , summing the squared difference over time intervals , and appropriately normalizing the result . \n we rigorously construct @xmath0 in [ 15 ] . \n we require it to have the following properties : ( 1 ) we define it in terms of physical , source - frame quantities , as opposed to measured , observer - frame quantities ; ( 2 ) when converted to observer - frame quantities , all strong dependences on redshift and other difficult or impossible to measure quantities cancel out ; ( 3 ) it is not biased by instrumental binning of the light curve , despite cosmological time dilation and the narrowing of the light curve s temporal substructure at higher energies [ 17 ] ; ( 4 ) it is not biased by poisson noise , and consequently can be applied to faint bursts ; and ( 5 ) it is robust ; i.e. , similar light curves always yield similar variabilities . also in [ 15 ] \n , we derive an expression for the statistical uncertainty in a light curve s measured variability , and we describe how we combine variability measurements of light curves acquired in different energy bands into a single measurement of a burst s variability . \n we plot the @xmath1 kev light curves of the most and least variable cosmological batse bursts in our sample in figure 1 . \n we list our sample of 20 bursts in table 1 of [ 15 ] ; it consists of every burst for which redshift information is currently available . \n spectroscopic redshifts , peak fluxes , and high resolution light curves are available for 11 of these bursts ; partial information is available for the remaining 9 bursts . \n we rigorously construct the luminosity estimator in [ 15 ] , applying the bayesian inference formalism developed by [ 18 ] . \n we plot the data and best - fit model of the distribution of these data in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane in figure 2 . \n we apply the best - fit luminosity estimator ( figure 2 ) to 1667 batse bursts , which are all of the batse bursts for which the necessary information was available as of the summer of 2000 . to remove the short - duration bursts \n , we conservatively cut the bursts with durations of @xmath4 sec from the sample , reducing the number to 907 . \n we plot the distribution of variability redshifts in figure 3 . \n a rigorous analysis of how statistical and systematic errors affect this distribution will be presented elsewhere , but the largest effect is the statistical uncertainty in the fitted slope of the luminosity estimator . \n we plot how reasonable variations of this slope affect the distribution also in figure 3 . \n although the original distribution has too many low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath5 bursts for comfort , reasonable variations appear to yield at least qualitatively acceptable distributions ( see figure 5 of [ 19 ] ) . \n we plot the joint redshift and luminosity distribution of the qualitatively acceptable redshift distribution of figure 3 ( dashed histogram ) in figure 4 . \n if systematic effects can be ruled out near batse s detection threshold , this distribution suggests that the luminosity distribution of the bursts is evolving , in which case no more than about 15% of bursts have redshifts greater than @xmath6 , in contrast to the results of [ 13 ] and [ 20 ] . \n klebesadel , r. w. , strong , i. b. & olson , r. a. 1973 , apj , 182 , l85 paciesas , w. s. , et al . 1999 , \n apj , 122 , s465 costa , e. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 387 , 783 van paradijs , j. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 386 , 686 frail , d. a. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 389 , 261 sahu , k. c. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 387 , 476 metzger , m. r. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 387 , 878 kulkarni , s. r. , et al . \n 1998 , nature , 393 , 35 stern . \n b. , poutanen , j. , & svensson , r. 1999 , apj , 510 , 312 stern . \n b. , svensson , r. , & poutanen , j. 1997 , in 2d integral workshop : the transparent universe , esa sp-382 ( paris : esa ) , 473 norris , j. p. , marani , g. f. , bonnell , j. t. 2000 , apj , 534 , 248 norris , j. p. , marani , g. f. , bonnell , j. t. 2000 , in gamma - ray bursts : 5th huntsville symposium , aip conference proceedings 526 , eds . \n r. m. kippen , r. s. mallozzi , & g. j. fishman ( melville , new york : aip ) , 78 fenimore , e. e. , & ramirez - ruiz , e. 2001 , apj , submitted ( astro - ph/0004176 ) ramirez - ruiz , e. , & fenimore , e. e. 1999 , contributed oral presentation at the 5th huntsville gamma - ray burst symposium reichart , d. e. , et al . \n 2001 , apj , in press ( astro - ph/0004302 ) reichart , d. e. , & lamb , d. q. 2001 , in procs . of gamma - ray bursts in the afterglow era \n : 2nd workshop , in press fenimore , e. e. , et al . \n 1995 , apj , 448 , l101 reichart , d. e. 2001 , apj , in press ( astro - ph/9912368 ) lamb , d. q. , and reichart , d. e. 2000 , apj , 536 , 1 , 1 schaefer , b. e. , deng , m. , & band , d. l. 2001 , apj ( letters ) , submitted ( astro - ph/0101461 )", "StartTimeOffset": 742195666025, "RequestID": "6ea43914d4f646cb9bdb1f5b9291ec1a", "TotalTokens": 2547}
{"ContextTokens": 3558, "GeneratedTokens": 82, "SynthesizedBody": "over the past several months , many results on event - by - event fluctuation and correlation observables have been made available by experiments at the sps and at rhic . \n this article will review the most recent results on three of these observables : net charge fluctuations , balance functions in pseudorapidity , and average transverse momentum fluctuations . \n each of these observables is designed to probe a specific property of the system : net charge fluctuations are sensitive to the charge distribution within the collision volume , balance functions are sensitive to the hadronization time of the system , and average @xmath0 fluctuations are sensitive to critical fluctuations of the temperature of the system which may be present during a phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . however , as with any measurement , the results can be contaminated by known processes such as charge conservation , resonance decays , elliptic flow , or even hard scattering processes . \n therefore , the contribution of any known processes must be thoroughly examined prior to formulating a reliable interpretation of the results . \n detailed background information on the theory behind various event - by - event observables can be found in other recent reviews @xcite . \n a promising signature for the presence of a qgp is the observation of event - by - event fluctuations in the net charge of produced particles . \n it is hypothesized that fluctuations in the net charge would be significantly reduced in a qgp scenario . \n this is due to the fact that in a qgp , the fractional electric charges of the quarks are more evenly spread throughout the qgp volume than the unit electric charges of the hadrons in a hadronic gas volume . as a result \n , the fluctuations of the net charge in a given region of phase - space would be significantly reduced in a qgp @xcite . \n there has been much debate on the choice of the most appropriate observable to quote for the magnitude of net charge fluctuations . \n a standard is yet to be agreed upon in the literature , so phenix @xcite quotes the normalized net charge variance , @xmath1 , star @xcite quotes a measure for dynamical fluctuations , @xmath2 , and na49 @xcite quotes the variable @xmath3 . \n the latter will be quoted here . \n fortunately , all of the variables listed above can be related to each other with some very reasonable assumptions @xcite . \n the baseline for the measurement of net charge fluctuations is that of independent particle emission ( where @xmath1 = 1.0 , @xmath2 = 0.0 , and @xmath4 = 0.0 ) . \n predictions for the magnitudes of these three fluctuation variables for a variety of physical scenarios are listed in table 1 . \n keep in mind that these values are valid only for small samplings of the total number of produced charged particles since charge conservation can contribute to any observed fluctuations . \n net charge fluctuation measurements can be corrected for charge conservation based upon the fraction of the total number of particles in the sample as follows @xcite : @xmath5    @lllll scenario&v(q)&@xmath2 ( star)&@xmath2 ( phenix ) & @xmath4 + independent emission&1.0&0.0&0.0&0.0 + resonance gas&0.75&-0.0013&-0.006&-0.125 + quark coalescence&0.83&-0.0008&-0.004&-0.084 + quark -

dependence and magnitude of the widths of the star data with @xmath18 0.5c , but without the inclusion of resonance decay contributions .    ) as a function of centrality for a ) @xmath6 = 17 gev pb+pb collisions from na49 @xcite , and b ) @xmath6 = 200 gev au+au collisions from star @xcite . in both cases , \n the balance functions are narrower for more central collisions . \n [ fig:2 ] ] \n event - by - event fluctuations in the average transverse momentum may be sensitive to temperature fluctuations near the qcd tri - critical point @xcite . \n there have been many recent results from the sps ( na49 @xcite and ceres @xcite ) and rhic ( phenix @xcite and star @xcite ) experiments . \n all experiments report a positive signal of non - random fluctuations , each with an apparent maximum in mid - peripheral collisions , as shown in figure 3 . as with the charge fluctuation measurements , \n a standard observable has not been agreed upon in the literature , and each experiment quotes a different variable to describe the magnitude of the fluctuations : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . \n fortunately , the variables can all be related with very reasonable assumptions @xcite . \n all of the variables measure the difference in the width of the event - by - event average @xmath23 distribution , @xmath24 , from a random expectation , which can be expressed as a gamma distribution that is directly calculable using the inclusive @xmath23 and number of particles per event , n , distributions @xcite . \n since a positive signal is observed and confirmed , contributions to the signal from known sources should first be studied . \n the various analyses have addressed this with respect to contributions from hbt , resonance decays , and elliptic flow . \n the contributions from all of these sources have been found to be very small or negligible , each confirmed by independent analyses . \n another possible source to the signal is that from hard scattering processes , which would be expected to produce correlations in @xmath23 with a stronger contribution at higher @xmath23 . in this context , \n both phenix and ceres observe that the majority of the contribution to the non - random fluctuations occur at high @xmath23 . \n phenix observes a large 243% increase in the signal when the maximum of the @xmath23 range over which the average @xmath23 is calculated increases from 1.0 to 2.0 gev / c . \n this very large increase can not be attributed to number fluctuations since the number of particles increases by less than 15% over that range .    in order to investigate possible contributions due to jet production \n , phenix has applied a two - component model consisting of 1 ) a simulation of soft processes by reproducing the inclusive @xmath23 and n distributions as a function of centrality , and 2 ) a simulation of hard scattering processes by embedding pythia jet events at a given rate per produced particle in step 1 ( while strictly conserving the n distribution so as not to introduce unnecessary number fluctuations ) . \n the simulation is performed as a function of centrality within the detector acceptance in two modes : a ) with the pythia event embedding rate kept constant for all centralities , and b ) with the pythia event embedding rate scaled by the nuclear modification factor , @xmath25 , for each centrality bin . \n the result of the simulation superimposed with the phenix data is shown in the bottom plot of figure 3 . \n the simulation with the @xmath25-scaled rate agrees with the centrality - dependent ( and also the @xmath23-dependent @xcite ) data trends remarkably well . within this simulation , the decrease of fluctuations in the most peripheral collisions \n is attributed to the fact that the signal begins to compete with the magnitude of the number fluctuations , while most of the decrease of fluctuations in the most central collisions can be attributed to the onset of jet suppression . when the simulation is performed at @xmath6 = 130 gev within the star acceptance with the same pythia event embedding rate that reproduces the phenix data , agreement with the star \n more central data is achieved within errors . \n the simulation predicts a 15 - 20% increase in the fluctuation signal from star at @xmath6 = 200 gev . \n although the jet production cross section is much reduced at sps energies , it is non - zero , and there may also be a residual jet contribution present . \n the identical simulation performed at @xmath6 = 17 gev within the na49 acceptance can also reproduce the trend of the na49 data as a function of centrality \n .    a promising method in which to directly compare the fluctuation measurements from all four experiments is to estimate the magnitude of any residual event - by - event temperature fluctuations present using the prescription outlined in @xcite . \n the most central fluctuation values thus correspond to temperature fluctuations of 1.8% in phenix , 1.7% in star , 1.3% in ceres , and 0.6% in na49 . \n the residual temperature fluctuations are small and do not significantly increase between sps and rhic energies . \n alternative interpretations of the observed average @xmath23 signal have been presented . \n one such interpretation is that the signal may be due to the onset of thermal equilibrium within the system @xcite . \n this model is successful in reproducing both the centrality - dependence of the fluctuation signal and the inclusive @xmath26 distributions from star and phenix . \n fluctuations as a function of centrality for a ) @xmath6 = 17 gev pb+pb collisions from na49 @xcite , b ) @xmath6 = 130 gev au+au collisions from star @xcite , and c ) @xmath6 = 200 gev au+au collisions from phenix @xcite . the error bars include statistical and systematic errors . \n the curves are the results of a model that estimates the relative contribution due to jet production as a function of centrality @xcite for a fixed pythia event embedding rate ( dashed lines ) and for an @xmath25-scaled embedding rate ( solid lines ) . \n uncertainties on the simulation are 0.3 mev / c for na49 , 2.1 mev / c for star , and 1.0 mev / c for phenix . \n [ fig:3 ] ] \n there has been nearly a doubling in the quantity of preliminary or published results on event - by - event fluctuation and correlation observables over the past year . \n long thought of as the exclusive domain of large acceptance detectors , the scope of the results are demonstrating that event - by - event physics is accessible to smaller acceptance experiments with only a small sacrifice in sensitivity . \n the development of event - by - event analysis techniques is continuing to mature at a rapid pace , including extensions to multi - dimensional correlations and methods to relate fluctuation observables directly to correlation functions . \n it is becoming clear from what we have learned so far that these methods can provide additional tools with which to study the underlying dynamics of the collision system .", "StartTimeOffset": 750124765766, "RequestID": "aa3163f223084615a81221fa344ed6e9", "TotalTokens": 3640}

markovian effects are taken into account \n the evolution of the system is different from the markovian case . to study non - markovian effects \n i use the quantum brownian motion model , describing a particle in a harmonic potential coupled to a quantized bosonic thermal reservoir @xcite . \n an exact solution to the master equation describing the time evolution of the system exists . of course \n the analytical form of the solution depends on the spectral distribution of the reservoir . in this paper \n i consider three different types of spectral distributions , ohmic , super - ohmic and sub - ohmic . \n this allows to compare the effects of different reservoirs on a given quantum system which correspond to different physical realization of , e.g. , a qubit . in this way we can clarify the microscopic processes underlying the dynamics of exemplary open quantum systems .    in this paper \n i consider an initially squeezed coherent state . \n the heisenberg uncertainty principle for the variances of the dimensionless quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 states that @xmath2 . \n squeezed states are the ones where the variance of one quadrature is smaller than that of the vacuum , i.e. , @xmath3 . \n the other quadrature will have a larger variance in order not to violate the uncertainty principle . \n previously we have studied the effects of an ohmic , super -

markovian regime only for the ohmic reservoir @xcite , where it was shown that the squeezing dynamics are a result of virtual processes between the system and the bath . \n the paper is organized in the following way . in section \n ii we present the model and master equation for the system . \n section iii introduces the different reservoir types used in the comparison . \n the main results of this paper are given in section iv . \n finally section v contains the conclusion . \n our model is the quantum brownian particle in harmonic potential which consists of a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators . \n the hamiltonian of the system and the bath , in units of @xmath4 , are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and the microscopic interaction hamiltonian is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the annihilation and creation operators of the system ( bath ) , @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath11 gives the coupling between the system and each individual environment oscillator , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the frequencies of the system and the @xmath14th environment oscillator , respectively . \n the total hamiltonian is then given as @xmath15 . \n in the weak coupling limit ( i.e. , when @xmath16 ) , assuming an initially factorized state ( @xmath17 ) and a thermal reservoir , we obtain the following secularly approximated master equation for the damped harmonic oscillator @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19\\\\ & \\times\\cos(\\omega\\nonumber t')\\cos(\\omega_0 t ' ) , \\\\ \n \\gamma(t ) & = 2\\int_0^{t}dt'\\ , \\int_0^{\\infty}d\\omega\\,\\frac{j(\\omega)}{2}\\sin(\\omega t')\\sin(\\omega_0 t'),\\label{eq : pikkugamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the diffusion and dissipation coefficients . \n @xmath20 is the average number of reservoir thermal excitations , with @xmath21 the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 the reservoir temperature , and @xmath23 is the spectral density of the environment defined , in the continuum limit , as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the masses of the environmental oscillators . \n no markovian approximation was done in obtaining equation ( [ eq : mainme ] ) so this equation describes accurately the environment memory . \n the memory effects of the reservoir are contained in the time - dependent coefficients , given by equations ( [ eq : delta ] ) and ( [ eq : pikkugamma ] ) . \n it has been shown that performing the secular approximation does not affect considerably the system dynamics , provided that we are in high @xmath22 weak coupling limit and restrict our attention to the parameter regime @xmath26 @xcite , where @xmath27 is a reservoir parameter introduced in section [ sec : reservoir ] . \n now we can proceed to the description of the reservoirs . \n the spectral densities i examine are of the form @xmath28 the exponential cutoff with cutoff frequency @xmath27 is introduced to eliminate divergencies in the @xmath29 limit . \n the parameter @xmath30 appearing in equation ( [ spectra ] ) is a constant that can acquire values @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 , corresponding to the so called sub - ohmic , ohmic and super - ohmic spectral densities , respectively . in this paper \n i consider some examples and fix the value of @xmath30 to @xmath34 , @xmath32 and @xmath35 . \n the three cases describe different physical contexts ( see discussion in @xcite ) . \n the spectral distribution gives full information on the reservoir properties and it is given by @xmath36 $ ] . \n in high @xmath22 this approximates to @xmath37 . \n the parameter @xmath38 characterizes the overlap of the system frequency with respect to the reservoir . \n [ fig : reservoirs ]   as a function of @xmath39 for @xmath40.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in this paper i focus on a parameter region where @xmath41 . from previous studies @xcite we know that this is the regime where non - markovian effects are most pronounced . in figure 1 \n all three reservoirs are shown for @xmath42 . with this choice of the parameters the time scale of the system dynamics , given by @xmath43 , \n is much shorter than the relevant reservoir time scales @xmath44 . \n for this reason one would expect the non - markovian effects to be strong . \n the wigner function is a phase space representation of the density matrix of the system and is thus a complete description of the state of the system . \n the solution of the master equation ( [ eq : mainme ] ) , based on algebraic properties of superoperators presented in @xcite , is used here because it provides a solution in terms of the quantum characteristic function @xmath45,\\ ] ] which can then be directly used to obtain the wigner function . here \n @xmath46 is the initial quantum characteristic function , @xmath47 is a complex variable , and @xmath48 we want to study initial squeezed coherent states . \n these states are obtained from the vacuum by operating first with the displacement operator @xmath49 to obtain a coherent state , and then with the squeezing operator @xmath50 , @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the squeezing parameter . \n the quantum characteristic function for an initial squeezed coherent state is @xmath53,\\label{eq : char}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . by taking the fourier transform of the quantum characteristic function ( [ eq : chi ] ) , with the help of equation ( [ eq : char ] ) \n , we obtain the wigner function for the initially squeezed and displaced vacuum state ( @xmath56 ) with squeezing angle @xmath57 @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 are the variances of the dimensionless quadratures @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a time - dependent normalization constant @xcite . \n [ fig : varianssit ]   for a ) ohmic , b ) super - ohmic and c ) sub - ohmic reservoir . \n markovian result is given by dashed line . in b ) \n the markovian dynamics is so fast it appears here as an almost vertical line . \n the parameters are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    at the initial time @xmath67 we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the following \n i consider the squeezing dynamics in the @xmath0 quadrature . \n the squeezing condition is @xmath70 . for larger variances \n the state is not squeezed . \n an example of the squeezing dynamics for the ohmic , super - ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir is shown in figure 2 .    oscillations in the squeezing for non - markovian times appear for ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs . \n they are induced by the temporarily negative values of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 which are known to occur at high @xmath22 and for @xmath73 , as in the case considered here . in this region , \n virtual exchanges of excitations between the system and the reservoir characterize the dynamics @xcite . \n these virtual processes are causing the non - markovian oscillations in the squeezing . \n the markovian behaviour of the squeezing is plotted for comparison as a dashed line . \n the markovian squeezing is obtained by inserting into equation ( [ eq : variance ] ) the markovian values of the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are given as @xmath74 and @xmath75 . \n the parameters affecting the squeezing oscillations are the reservoir type , reservoir temperature and initial squeezing @xmath76 . \n the reservoir type is mostly responsible for the form of the curve , while the temperature and initial squeezing merely shift the curve with respect to the squeezing  non - squeezing border , @xmath77 . \n the variance @xmath78 exhibits very similar behaviour when coupled to ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoir but is different in character for the super - ohmic case . \n the super - ohmic reservoir induces non - monotonic dynamics in the variance , but for the choice of parameters used in the figures the squeezing oscillations do not appear . from the form of the curves we see that for all parameters , the super - ohmic reservoir leads to a non - squeezed state in the shortest time . \n oscillations in the quadrature variance persist only as long as the decay rate @xmath71 attains negative values . \n for the super - ohmic reservoir and @xmath73 the decay rates attain positive values faster than the other two reservoirs @xcite . \n the differences between the squeezing for the super - ohmic reservoir and for the ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs can be traced back to the reservoir properties . by comparing the figure 1 of the reservoirs with the squeezing plots in figure 2 we can easily come to the same conclusion as in @xcite when considering the heating function . \n namely , that the low frequency part of the spectrum @xmath79 affects strongly the non - markovian features . \n this means that when the spectrum is more tightly confined to the low frequencies ( with respect to @xmath12 ) , longer lasting oscillations both in squeezing and heating are present . \n in this paper i have studied the non - markovian squeezing dynamics of an initially squeezed coherent state . \n analytic expressions for the variances of the quadratures depend on the reservoir structure . \n the effect of different reservoirs was studied for the system coupled to differently structured reservoirs . depending on the reservoir type and other parameters , the initially squeezed state showed non - markovian oscillations between squeezed and non - squeezed states . \n the quantum brownian motion model describes a large number of different physical systems @xcite . \n thus , understanding the short - time dynamics of this system contributes to a wide variety of experimental and theoretical scenarios . \n reservoir engineering techniques allow in principle to tune the reservoir parameters , especially the parameter @xmath80 , in order to reach the oscillatory regime @xmath73 here illustrated @xcite . \n the squeezing oscillations are connected to oscillations in the width of the wigner function @xcite , which can be measured with homodyne detection . \n therefore the experimental detection of the non - markovian squeezing dynamics is , in principle , possible . \n the fact that non - markovian dynamics are different for differently structured reservoirs may prove useful when considering implementing quantum devices with different physical setups , e.g. trapped ions or solid state materials . in any case understanding the effects of the environment on a quantum system is important also from a purely theoretical point of view . \n the author thanks sabrina maniscalco for helpful discussions and comments on the paper . financial support from the visl foundation \n is acknowledged . \n 9      quang t , woldeyohannes m , john s and agarwal g s 1997 _ phys . \n lett . _ * 79 * 5238 hope j j , moy g m , collett m j and savage c m 2000 _ phys . \n rev . a _ * 61 * 023603 alicki r , horodecki m , horodecki p and horodecki r 2002 _ phys . \n rev . a _ * 65 * 062101            furusawa a , srensen j l , braunstein s l , fuchs c a , kimble h j and polzik e s 1998 _ sciene _ * 282 * 706 bowen w p , treps n , buchler b c , schnabel r , ralph t c , bachor h -

mass and the luminosity distance @xmath24 @xcite . for @xmath25 of the multi - messenger sources we sufficiently constrain @xmath23 and @xmath26 to measure @xmath24 to within 20% , but astrophysical effects such as tides may impact the orbital evolution and thus bias the distance estimate . for the remaining systems in the gw catalog , we can use reasonable priors on the mass and mass ratio of white dwarf binaries to put meaningful constraints on @xmath24 from the amplitude measurement alone . \n using only the amplitude , frequency and priors on the masses constructed from the population synthesis simulation , we find that the distribution of the most likely ( ml ) luminosity distances @xmath27 is strongly peaked between 0 and 8 kpc  the distance to the galactic center  for the magnitude limited catalogs . \n the @xmath28 distributions for the full well - localized catalog with no magnitude cut is more uniformly distributed over a larger range . \n our final consideration pertains to the expected optical light curves for ucb systems identified in the gw catalog . \n the population synthesis galaxy in our study is restricted to detached white dwarf binaries , as opposed to interacting am cvn systems . without mass transferring from one star to the other in the binary , \n photometric variability is not guaranteed . \n the systems in the gw catalog that are best constrained are typically those at the high - frequency end of the population . \n this is to our advantage , because the shorter period binaries have a higher probability of eclipsing one another during an orbital cycle . \n we can put an additional cut on our em / gw catalog by requiring the binaries to be eclipsing . \n ( see the right - hand panel of figs . \n [ fig.numbersources1 ]  and  [ fig.numbersources10 ] ) . from simple geometrical arguments @xcite the minimum inclination angle with respect to our line of sight that will produce eclipsing light curves is @xmath29 assuming all binaries have mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 . \n if we only consider binaries in the multimessenger catalog with inclination angle less than @xmath32 , we reduce the total number of candidates by a factor of @xmath33 . \n nevertheless , we still find upwards of @xmath34 candidates for the large gw detector configurations and deep , wide field , optical surveys . \n requiring eclipsing light curves significantly degrades the multimessenger potential for the 1 gm configuration using catalogs limited to 20@xmath20 magnitude and dimmer  such em follow - up surveys could come up empty . \n we conclude that space - based gravitational wave detectors will be useful observatories for discovering new ucbs in the galaxy that could be observed electromagnetically , though deep , wide field , optical surveys may be required to produce large catalogs . \n we reach this verdict by considering a range of plausible near - future space - based gravitational wave detector concepts , and assess their measurement capabilities for magnitude limited catalogs of ucbs . \n magnitudes for the constituents of each binary were derived from the population synthesis simulations , and the gravitational wave measurement capabilities were estimated using the fisher information matrix . \n any ucbs that were brighter than our chosen magnitude limits ( 18 - 24 ) and located on the sky by the gravitational wave detector to within angular resolution @xmath35 were considered multi - messenger candidates . \n we estimated the multi - messenger catalog sizes for both @xmath36 and 10 deg@xmath0 .    at the pessimistic end \n , we consider magnitude 18 limited catalogs , and single - vertex interferometers with 1 gm arm - lengths . the best scenario considered the classic lisa design and an optical telescope limited at @xmath37 magnitude . \n the number of multi - messenger candidates was anywhere from a few to several hundreds over that range of detector capabilities . \n if we put on the additional constraint that the sources must be eclipsing to allow for electromagnetic observation the counts were reduced by a factor of @xmath33 . \n while most of the known verification binaries are am cvn type stars , our study only considered detached white dwarf binaries , thus providing a very complimentary catalog of ucb multi - messenger systems . \n this work considered a conservative approach to finding multi - messenger ucbs , with competing criteria that strongly affect the expected population of systems detectable in both spectrums . \n electromagnetic detections are most strongly affected by the magnitude limit of the detection survey , a function of telescope aperture . by contrast , the gravitational wave detection catalogs of ucbs are expected to have thousands of systems in them ; most will be too faint to be detectable by any electromagnetic survey . \n however the gravitational wave localization criterion is a strong constraint on the multi - messenger catalog . \n we find that wide - field surveys ( @xmath13 deg@xmath0 ) yield more candidates than more narrow fields of view ( @xmath38 deg@xmath39 ) by 50 - 100% for the full catalogs , and by a factor of 2 - 4 for the eclipsing binaries . \n we have estimated the number of ucb multi - messenger candidates without considering what could be done with joint gw and em observations . \n our follow - on effort will consider the science yield from joint observations of both the known verification binaries \n mostly mass - transferring systems  and the close , detached binaries that will be discovered by space - borne gravitational wave detectors . \n this work was supported by nasa grants 08- atfp08 - 0126 ( tbl ) , nnx12ag30 g ( sll ) , and nnx10ah15 g ( njc ) . \n gn acknowledges support from the dutch foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) . \n g.  nelemans maintains a wiki with the most up to date list of verification binary parameters at link:<www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans / dokuwiki / doku.php?id = lisa_wiki>[<www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans / dokuwiki / doku.php?id = lisa_wiki > ] ; cited 2 september 2011", "StartTimeOffset": 821406183043, "RequestID": "b7ea244e523e4e5f911a562f79a40ea2", "TotalTokens": 3259}

physicist . \n simple problems in mechanics often involve a spring of stiffness is also called force constant or spring constant . ] @xmath0 and negligible mass , with a weight of mass @xmath1 hanging at the free end . in the static case \n the extension of the spring is then @xmath2 . \n a real spring has mass which is evenly distributed along the unloaded spring . \n it is then natural to ask how such a spring deforms under its own weight in a force field . \n here we investigate this problem for two different force fields . \n first in constant gravity , then in the centrifugal force field due to rotation of the reference frame with constant angular velocity . \n we also investigate two different models for the finite mass springs . \n first a discrete model where the spring is assumed to consist of point masses connected by weightless springs \n . then the continuum limit of this model is considered . \n it is pointed out that the deformation in this limit should be given by the function that minimizes the potential energy . \n results are then easily obtained from the variational principle . \n various authors have considered similar problems involving springs of finite mass . \n statics of a slinky has been studied by mak @xcite . \n several authors have been interested in the effects on dynamics of the finite spring mass . \n rotating springs with @xcite and without @xcite finite mass , have also attracted attention . \n the approach and most results presented here are , however , either new or , at least hard to find in the literature . \n the discrete model could be taught at the elementary level . \n the continuum model should be useful in the teaching of variational principles as simple examples of their use . \n consider a light ( negligible mass ) spring of natural length @xmath3 and stiffness @xmath0 with one end fixed . \n a particle of mass @xmath1 hangs at the free end . \n the equation for static equilibrium is , @xmath4 along the spring in the downwards direction . here \n @xmath5 is the extension of the spring . \n the length of the loaded spring is thus , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the relative extension of the spring , @xmath8 a dimensionless quantity . \n assume now that the same light spring instead is rotating , in a smooth horizontal plane , with the fixed end on the rotation axis . \n a particle of mass @xmath1 at the other end will remain at a fixed distance from the rotation axis if , @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the constant angular velocity of the rotation and @xmath5 is the extension of the spring . \n the term on the left hand side is mass times centripetal acceleration . \n if it is moved to the other side it plays the role of the centrifugal force in the rotating system in which the spring and mass are at rest .    for the dimensionless relative extension of the spring , defined by @xmath11 , we find , @xmath12 in the rotating case . to compare this with the gravitational result we chose the angular velocity , @xmath13 , so that the centripetal acceleration at the end of the unloaded spring is @xmath14 . \n one then finds that , @xmath15 the relative extension is longer than in the gravitational case since the centrifugal force grows with distance from the rotation axis . \n below we will compare these elementary results for a light spring with the corresponding results for a heavy spring . \n consider a chain of @xmath16 particles , each of mass @xmath17 , connected by @xmath16 light springs of natural ( neutral , unloaded , uncompressed ) length @xmath18 , and stiffness ( spring constant ) @xmath19 , see fig . \n we must first establish the properties of the resulting finite mass spring of natural length @xmath20 and total mass @xmath21 . \n the stiffness or spring constant @xmath0 must be determined by the formula for the effective spring constant of springs in series . \n this means that , @xmath22 is the stiffness of the full chain . \n the first spring has a free end and we attach this end to a fixed point and let the chain hang vertically from this point . introduce a downward directed @xmath23-axis along the chain with origin at the point of suspension . \n the equilibrium equations for the @xmath16 particles are then , @xmath24 we see that the upward force on the @xmath16th particle is the same as the downward spring force on the @xmath25th particle . in this way \n one can easily work one self upwards and find that this system is equivalent to the set of equations , @xmath26 here we have introduced @xmath27 , the extension of the last spring in the chain . \n this , perhaps obvious , result says that each spring will carry the weight of all the particles below it , including the particle at its lower end . \n solving this system of equations successively for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and so on , one easily finds that : @xmath30 \\delta \\\\ \n \\ldots &   & \\ldots \\\\ \n \\nonumber   x_{n-1 } & = & ( n-1 ) a + [ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2 } ( n - i ) ] \\delta \\\\ \n \\nonumber   x_n & = & n a + [ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1 } ( n - i ) ] \\delta .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we therefore get , @xmath31 \\delta = na + \\frac{n(2n - n+1)}{2}\\delta,\\ ] ] as the general result for the @xmath32th particle s position . \n we note that when we turn off gravity , by letting @xmath33 , the particles are at their natural positions , @xmath34 . \n we can easily perform the sums indicated by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series . \n the position of the last ( @xmath16th ) particle will give the length of the hanging massive chain . \n the result is , @xmath35 here we can use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , to get @xmath40.\\ ] ] for a real coil spring with continuously distributed mass we must let @xmath41 . comparing to ( [ q.ext.g ] ) \n we then find that a heavy spring of mass @xmath1 and stiffness @xmath0 is extended half as much ( @xmath42 ) as the corresponding light spring with a weight of mass @xmath1 at the end . \n to find how gravity deforms a spring with continuously distributed mass we will now use that potential energy minimization determines the static equilibrium . to pass to the continuum one can follow a procedure by goldstein @xcite ( it can also be found in sakurai @xcite ) . \n he derives the wave equation for longitudinal waves along a one dimensional elastic continuum by first considering the discrete case of a horizontal chain of masses and springs . in the limit of infinitely many particles \n the sum which is the lagrangian for the discrete case is replaced by an integral of a lagrangian density . \n the euler - lagrange equation of the corresponding action is the wave equation . \n here we adapt to the static hanging case by skipping the kinetic energy and instead including the gravitational potential energy . \n the potential energy of the discrete system of the previous section is given by , @xmath43 where we assume @xmath44 . \n we rewrite this in the form , @xmath45 put @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and note that @xmath48 , to get , @xmath49,\\ ] ] here @xmath50 is young s modulus , that goes under this name in the theory of elasticity @xcite . ] and @xmath51 the linear mass density of the un - deformed spring . \n we can now pass to the continuum by the identifications : @xmath52 here @xmath53 represents the @xmath23-coordinate of points on the un - deformed spring , and @xmath54 is the @xmath23-coordinate of the same point on the spring deformed by gravity under its own weight .    for the continuum case \n the potential energy is now a functional of the function @xmath54 which is the limit of the sum ( [ eq.pot.energy.discrete3 ] ) as @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . \n the potential energy functional is thus , @xmath57 = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}x\\ , v(\\xi,\\xi ' ) = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}x \\left [ \\frac{y}{2 }   \\left ( \\frac{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}\\xi}{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}x } - 1 \\right)^2 - \\lambda g\\ , \\xi(x ) \\right],\\ ] ] where it is assumed that @xmath58 . here , \n @xmath59 , is a potential energy per unit length . \n variation of the functional ( [ eq.pot.energy.cont ] ) in the usual way @xcite gives , @xmath60 assuming that the functional is stationary . \n then one notes that @xmath61 is a derivative and takes advantage of integration by parts to get rid of this derivative . \n after this step one has , @xmath62_0^{\\ell}= 0 , \\ ] ] for the variation of @xmath63 . at this point one usually invokes the requirement that @xmath64 and thus arrive at the usual euler - lagrange equation . \n here we must have @xmath65 since the top end of the spring is fixed . at the lower end , however , this is not obvious . \n the variation @xmath66 therefore results in the equation , @xmath67 since both the function @xmath68 and its value at @xmath69 are arbitrary , apart from the condition @xmath65 , the only way to satisfy this equation is to have both the euler - lagrange equation , @xmath70 and the boundary condition , @xmath71 satisfied .    using the explicit form for @xmath72 of equation ( [ eq.pot.energy.cont ] ) we get , the simple equation , @xmath73 from the euler - lagrange equation . here the constant on the right hand side \n can also be written @xmath74 using the definitions above eq . \n ( [ eq.pot.energy.discrete3 ] ) . \n the boundary condition gives , @xmath75 since @xmath76 corresponds to an un - deformed spring this result has the simple physical interpretation that the spring is not stretched ( deformed ) at its lower end where there is no mass below that pulls on it . \n the solution of ( [ eq.eul.lgr.grav1 ] ) is trivial to find once the boundary conditions , @xmath58 and @xmath77 , are taken into account . \n one finds that the new @xmath23-coordinates of the particles of the spring are given in terms of the unloaded @xmath23-coordinates by , @xmath78 the total length of the hanging spring is then given by , @xmath79 in agreement with the discrete result ( [ eq.length.masive.chain.in.grav.1 ] ) when @xmath41 . \n we first consider the discrete case and assume that the first spring of the chain is attached to a fixed point and that the spring rotates , with angular velocity @xmath10 around this point , on a smooth horizontal plane . \n we choose @xmath80-axis in the rotating system to be parallel to the spring with origin at the fixed point . \n the fictitious centrifugal force on a particle of the spring is then @xmath81 . \n the equilibrium equations corresponding to the eqs . \n ( [ eqs.grav.equil ] ) in the gravitational case are then , @xmath82 where we have introduced @xmath83 . the trick used in the gravitational case to solve for @xmath84 does not work here . \n instead one might note that the typical equation of this sequence is the recursive relation , @xmath85 this is a so called difference equation that can be treated by standard methods , but here we chose to proceed directly to the continuum case . \n recalling that the potential energy of the centrifugal force is @xmath86 , we can take the result ( [ eq.pot.energy.cont ] ) for the gravitational case and get , @xmath87 = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}z\\ , v(\\zeta,\\zeta ' ) = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}z \\left [ \\frac{y}{2 }   \\left ( \\frac{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}\\zeta}{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}z } - 1 \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\omega^2\\ , \\zeta^2(z ) \\right],\\ ] ] for the centrifugal case . \n the euler - lagrange differential equation is now , @xmath88 if we introduce the notation @xmath89 , the solution obeying the boundary conditions , @xmath90 , is easily found to be , @xmath91 this function and the corresponding one for gravity ( [ eq.sol.grav ] ) are plotted and compared in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . \n the length of the spring in the centrifugal force field is , @xmath92.\\ ] ] for small angular velocity @xmath10 we get the approximate result , @xmath93 a light rotating spring with a mass @xmath1 at the end becomes longer by the amount given in eq . \n ( [ q.ext.omega ] ) , which gives , @xmath94 for small angular velocity @xmath10 . \n ( [ eq.zeta.length.approx ] ) shows that if the mass instead is distributed along the spring the extra relative length is reduced to @xmath95 , to first order in @xmath10 . \n this concludes our study of the rotating heavy spring . \n the study of the deformation of springs under their own weight presented above provides nice illustrations of some general principles of statics . \n the most important of these is the fact that static equilibrium often is given simply by minimizing potential energy . \n the most well known non - trivial example of this principle found in the literature is the catenary , which usually is presented , together with the brachistochrone , as a basic application of the variational calculus @xcite . \n unfortunately these classical examples yield quite difficult differential equations who s solution require considerable mathematical skill . \n the examples here , giving the deformation of heavy springs , provide simple but interesting , non - trivial , and easily understood results .",

called kretschmann configuration by internal reflection of a laser beam from a surface that is coated with a thin metal film kretschmann_radiative_1968 . \n particles that are close to or stick to the metal film can be detected via their optical properties which shift the surface plasmon angle @xmath1 under which a spp can be excited . in principle \n , such shifts can be detected very sensitively by measuring the phase of the reflected light beam which , at the plasmon angle , changes dramatically . \n however , the fact that the reflectivity is zero at the plasmon angle , i.e the power of the laser beam is completely transferred into a plasmonic excitation , broadens the detectable phase shift and limits the sensitivity @xcite . \n recently , a new excitation scheme has been introduced which avoids this problem by an electronic feedback on the phase of the incident laser field @xcite . in the work presented here , \n this scheme is used for the first time to actually measure the optical properties of a sample . the work is mainly motivated by recent progress in the field of surface quantum optics , atom chips and hybrid quantum systems . \n such tailored quantum systems made of cold atoms near nanostructured surfaces are expected to open up new opportunities for the construction of quantum sensors and for quantum information . in this context , we recently studied clouds of ultracold atoms coupled to evanescent waves near solid surfaces @xcite . \n the enhancement of such optial near -

optic modulator ( eom ) that controls the phase of the incident laser light @xcite . \n this locks the hnsch couillaud signal to zero such that the control - voltage at the eom is directly proportional to @xmath10 . \n the gold film on the prism surface has been fabricated by e - beam evaporation and has a thickness of approximately @xmath11 . \n below the gold film a very thin layer of titanium has been added for improving adhesion of the gold to the glass substrate . \n the prism is placed inside a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of @xmath12 and is mounted to a temperature controlled heating . \n the partial pressure of rb in the chamber is controlled by a resistively heated dispenser and can be raised within a few seconds up to several @xmath13 . \n laser induced desorption of rb atoms can be investigated with an additional blue laser beam at a wavelength near 406 nm and a maximum power of 20 mw ( laser 2)@xcite . \n the interpretation of our experiment is based on the observation that , according to brunauer , emmet and teller ( bet ) , only fractions of a monolayer can be adsorbed if the vapor pressure of an adsorbant is smaller than the saturation vapor pressure @xmath14 @xcite . \n thus the surface coverage @xmath15 only takes values between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 . \n we model the temporal change of the surface coverage by the rate equation @xmath19with a desorption constant @xmath20 , an inpinging flux of atoms on the surface @xmath21 , a typical area per adsorbed atom of @xmath22 and a sticking probability @xmath23 . \n the atomic flux hitting the surface is given by @xmath24 with the factor @xmath25 following from integrating the knudsen cosine law over a half sphere , the ideal gas vapor density @xmath26 and the thermal velocity of the atoms @xmath27 . \n for simplicity we define the flux per pressure @xmath28 in units of adsorbed monolayers via @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 . the sticking probability is taken from the langmuir model @xmath31 , with the initial sticking probability @xmath32 @xcite . \n note that @xmath23 vanishes for full coverage ( @xmath33 ) . \n this guaranties that only fractions of a monolayer can be adsorbed . with these definitions ( [ eq : rate_eq_1 ] ) reads @xmath34 in equilibrium ( @xmath35 ) the surface coverage is given by @xmath36the equilibrium coverage depends on the pressure in the chamber . \n if the pressure is rapidly changed the new equilibrium is exponentially reached within an @xmath37-timescale @xmath38as can be deduced from ( [ eq : rate_eq_2 ] ) . \n we measure the adsorption of rubidium with the above mentioned setup by two different methods . in the first method \n the incidence angle is scanned and from the obtained signal the position of the plasmon angle is determined . \n this method is applicable for a plasmon angle which changes only little during the scan time of approximately one minute . \n figure  [ fig : scans ] shows an example . \n the relation between the shift of the plasmon angle @xmath39 and the thickness of the adsorbed layer @xmath40 is taken from a four - layer matrix model ( layer 1 : glass substrate , layer 2 : gold film , layer 3 : rb adsorbate , layer 4 : vacuum ) which takes multiple reflections at the boundaries into account @xcite . with the dielectric constant of gold @xmath41 and rb @xmath42 @xcite \n the result is @xmath43 . \n the observed shift of the plasmon angle in figure  [ fig : scans ] of @xmath44 thus corresponds to an adsorbed rb layer thickness of @xmath45  nm . \n the second , more sensitive method records the phase @xmath10 with the incidence angle held fixed at the plasmon angle . \n adsorption and desorption of atoms can now be observed in real time by looking at the temporal change of the phase @xmath10 . for not too large variations of @xmath46 \n the relation between plasmon angle and phase is linear with a slope of @xmath47rad@xmath48 that is taken from the left curve in figure  [ fig : scans ] . \n note that after adsorption of rb ( right curve ) the slope is with @xmath49 slightly smaller . for large changes of the plasmon angle the working point \n is shifted from the linear regime to a regime where the phase change saturates . \n thus the second method can only be applied for small changes of the plasmon angle , unless the incidence angle is recalibrated . \n typical data are shown in figure  [ fig : adsorption_phase ] . in ( a ) \n the rb vapor pressure is quickly increased by activating the dispenser for about 80s ( curve ( ii ) ) . \n the pressure is determined with a standard ion -

induced desorption coefficient @xmath77 . with ( [ eq : rate_eq_2 ] ) and for @xmath78 and a pressure of @xmath79 \n mbar the total desorption coefficient amounts to @xmath80 . \n this results in a pure laser -

{"ContextTokens": 3495, "GeneratedTokens": 134, "SynthesizedBody": "the glasses and colloids are interesting examples of out of equilibrium systems where the relaxation towards the equilibrium may last much more than a reasonable observation time . \n one of the problem which has been widely theoretically studied is the definition of an effective temperature @xmath0 in these systems using the fluctuation dissipation relation ( fdr ) . \n this relation is an extension of the fluctuation dissipation theorem for an out of equilibrium system and @xmath0 is defined as the ratio between the correlation and the response function@xcite . using numerical simulations \n it has been shown that in several models for out of equilibrium systems the effective temperature defined via fdr is higher than the temperature of the thermal bath and it is a good definition of temperature in the thermodynamic sense . \n however the experimental results are more confused . \n it has been observed that @xmath0 in polymer , spin glasses and colloids may depend on the experimental conditions . \n for example in the dielectric measurements in polymer @xmath0 depends on the quenching rate and it may be huge because of the presence of intermittent bursts . the same behavior is observed on mechanical variables . instead in a colloid ( laponite ) during the sol - gel transition the electric observables give a @xmath0 which is quite large whereas measurements done on thermal rheometer indicate that within experimental errors there is no violation of the fluctuation theorem because the @xmath0 is always equal to the temperature of the thermal bath.(a discussion on the @xmath0 obtained from dielectric measurements and mechanical measurements can be found in ref.@xcite ) . \n the rheological measurement described in ref.@xcite was a global measurement and one may wonder whether an experiment of microrheology give or not the same results . \n this experiment can be performed using as a probe a brownian particle using active and passive microrheology . \n these kind of experiments are interesting also from another point of view because one may studies whether the properties of the brownian motion are affected by the fact that the surrounding fluid ( the thermal bath ) is out of equilibrium . \n several experiments of brownian motion inside a laponite solution have been done by different groups using various techniques . \n the results are rather contradictory . \n let us resume them . \n abou et al . \n find an increase and then a decrease of @xmath0 as a function of time @xcite . \n bartelett et al . \n find an increase of @xmath0 @xcite . \n in contrast jabbari - farouji et al . do not observe any change and confirm the results on the thermal rheometer of ref @xcite . \n the purpose of this article is to describe the results of the measurement of the brownian motion of a particle inside a laponite solution using a combination of different techniques proposed in previous references . \n all the techniques do not show , within experimental errors , any increase of @xmath0 which remains equal to that of the thermal bath for all the duration of the sol - gel transition . \n thus the result of this papers agrees with those of jabbari - farouji et al . @xcite and of bellon \n et al . @xcite . \n the article is organized as follow . in section 2 \n we describe the experimental apparatus and the various techniques used to measure response and fluctuations . in section 3 we describe the experimental results of the various experimental techniques . in section 4 \n we discuss the result and we conclude . \n we measure the fluctuations of the position of one or several silica beads trapped by an optical tweezers during the aging of the laponite . \n the laser beam ( @xmath1=980 nm ) is focused by a microscope objective ( @xmath263 ) 20 @xmath3 m above the cover - slip surface to create a harmonic potential well where a bead of 1 or 2 @xmath3 m in diameter ( @xmath4 ) is trapped . \n we can trap several beads if the laser is rapidly swept from a position to another to form a multi trap system . \n the laponite mass concentration is varied from 1.2 to 3% wt for different ionic strengths . \n these conditions allow us to obtain either a gel or a glass according to the phase diagramm found in the literature @xcite . \n the laponite is filtered with a 0.45 @xmath3 m filter to avoid the formation of aggregates . \n the aging time @xmath5 is measured since the end of this filtering process . \n particular attention has been paid in the cell construction indeed the properties of the laponite are very sensitive to the experimental conditions . first the laponite solution is prepared under nitrogen atmosphere and second the cell is completely sealed using gene frame adhesive spacers in order to avoid evaporation and the use of vacuum grease , used in other experiments . \n indeed this grease , whose ph is much smaller than 10 , quickens the evolution of the suspension . in order to measure @xmath0 for the particle motion two techniques \n have been used . the first one is based on the laser modulation technique as proposed in ref.@xcite . \n the second is based on the kramers - kronig relations with two laser intensities and it combines the advantages of two methods one proposed in ref.@xcite and in ref.@xcite .      following the method used in @xcite , the stiffness of the optical trap is periodically switched between two different values ( @xmath6 pn/@xmath3 m and @xmath7 pn/@xmath3 m ) every 61 seconds by changing the laser intensity . \n the position of the bead is recorded by a quadrant photodiode at the rate of 8192 hz , then we compute the variance of the position over the whole signal , @xmath8 , where the brackets stand for average over the time . to avoid transients , \n each record is started 20 seconds after the laser switch to be sure that the system has relaxed toward a quasi stationary state . assuming the equipartition principle still holds in this out - of - equilibrium system , the @xmath0 is computed as in @xcite the expression of the effective temperature and of the laponite elastic stiffness @xmath9 is the following : @xmath10 @xmath11    this technique , although quite interesting and simple , has the important drawback that , being a global measurement , it has no control of what is going on the different frequencies . to overcome this problem \n we have used the following method . \n this combines the laser modulation technique described in the previous section and the passive rheology technique based on kramers - kronig relations . \n the fluctuation dissipation relations relate the spectrum @xmath12 of the fluctuation of the particle position to the imaginary part @xmath13 of the response of the particle to an external force , specifically :    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the spectra measured with the trap stiffness @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . \n we recall that for a particle inside a newtonian fluid @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the fluid viscosity . in eq . \n [ eq : fdr ] the dependence in @xmath5 takes into account the fact that the properties of the fluid changes after the preparation of the laponite . if one assumes that @xmath0 is constant as a function of frequency ( hypothesis that can be easily checked a posteriori ) then the real part @xmath22 of the response is related to @xmath13 by the kramers - kronig relations @xcite that is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for principal part of the integral and assumed that @xmath25 to write the second equality using eq . \n [ eq : fdr ] \n . however it can be easily ( details will be given in a longer report ) shown that using the two measurements at @xmath17 and @xmath18 we get : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . \n it is clear that if one finds a dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath28 this method can not be used because @xmath29 is not simply proportional to @xmath30 as assumed in eq . \n [ eq : krkr ] . \n [ fig : spectra]a ) shows the power spectra of the particle fluctuations inside laponite at concentration measured at four different @xmath5 with the trap stiffness @xmath6 pn/@xmath3 m . \n we see that as time goes on the low frequency component of the spectrum increases . that is the frequency cut - off @xmath31 decreases mainly because of the increasing of the viscosity . at very long time \n this cut - off is well below @xmath32 . in fig . \n [ fig : spectra]b ) we plot the variance of the particle measured for the same data of fig . [ \n fig : spectra]a ) on time windows of length @xmath33 s. the variance remains constant for a very long time and they begin to decrease because of the increase o the gel stiffness . using these data and eq . \n [ eq : temperature ] and eq . \n [ eq : klap ] one can compute @xmath0 and @xmath9 . the results for @xmath0 and @xmath9 are shown in fig . [ \n fig : teff]a ) and [ fig : teff]b ) respectively . \n we find that @xmath0 is constant at the beginning and is very close to @xmath34 k , then when the jamming occurs , that is when @xmath9 increases , it becomes more scattered without any clear increase with @xmath5 , contrary to ref . \n we now make several remarks . \n first , we point out that the uncertainty of their results are underestimated . \n the error bars in fig . \n [ fig : teff]a ) are here evaluated from the standard deviation of the variance using eq .  2 in ref @xcite at the time @xmath5 . \n although they are small for short time @xmath5 , ( @xmath35 ) , they increase for large @xmath5 . \n this is a consequence of the increase of variabilities of @xmath36 as the colloidal glass forms . \n this point is not discussed in in ref . \n @xcite and we think that the measurement errors are of the same order or larger than the observed effect . \n the results depend on the length of the analyzing time window and the use of the principle of energy equipartition becomes questionable for the following reasons . \n first , these analyzing windows can not be made too large because the viscoelastic properties of laponite evolve as a function of time . \n second , the corner frequency of the global trap ( optical trap and gel ) , the ratio of the trap stiffness to viscosity , decreases continuously mainly because of the increase of viscosity . at the end of the experiment \n , the power spectrum density of the displacement of the bead shows that the corner frequency is lower than @xmath37 hz . \n we thus observe long lived fluctuations , which could not be taken into account with short measuring times . \n this problem is shown on fig . \n [ fig : teff]b ) . \n we split our data into equal time duration @xmath38 , compute the variance and average the results of all samples . \n the dotted line represents the duration 3.3 s chosen in @xcite . at the beginning of the experiment , \n the variance of the displacement is constant for any reasonable durations of measurement . \n however , we clearly see that this method produces an underestimate of @xmath39 for long aging times , specially when the viscoelasticity of the gel becomes important . \n long lived fluctuations are then ignored . \n this new method , using kramers - kronig relation , allows us to test the dependence of the effective temperature on the frequency . \n the figure [ fig : krkr]a ) shows the real part of @xmath40 , which corresponds to the global elastic modulus of the gel and of the laser , for both trap stiffness . \n this numerical method is very sensitive to the spectrum . \n thus , before computing the elastic modulus , we average the spectrum to obtain smooth curves . \n the uncertainties would then misplace the curve rather than produce a noisy curve . \n the increase with time is consistent with the increase of the strength of the gel . \n the elastic behavior of the laponite is also more pronounced at high frequency . \n the last decrease of the curves at very high frequencies is due to the numerical method . \n indeed , the frequency cutoff should be set at least a decade below the frequency of the data acquisition : data above 200 hz is not reliable . \n we see that the curves of each stiffness are well separated except at the end of the measurement , where the results are not accurate due to the large difference between the optical stiffness and the laponite stiffness .    from these data , we compute the ratio of the effective temperature to the bath temperature along the ageing process . \n these results are shown on fig . \n [ fig : krkr]b ) for three different frequencies ( @xmath41 hz , 10 hz and 100 hz ) . \n we first note that the three curves are almost identical . \n this means that the effective temperature does not depends on the frequency . \n second , the temperature ratio is close to 1 . \n the dispersion of the data is rather small at early times and again increases when the stiffness of the gel overcomes those of the optical trap . \n this comes from the uncertainties on the elastic modulus which become larger than the difference between the two curves . \n this dispersion may also give , for very long time , negative temperatures , not shown in fig . [ \n fig : krkr]b ) which is an expanded view . \n even if this method is here less accurate than the previous one , it allows us to verify that the effective temperature is the same for all frequencies . \n finally , a remark has to be made concerning the mean position of the bead during aging . \n when the stiffness of the gel becomes comparable to the optical one , the bead starts to move away from the centre the optical trap . \n we observe a drift of the bead position at long time , which could lead to the escape of the bead . \n moreover we have performed simultaneous measurements with a multiple trap using a fast camera showing that at very long @xmath5 the mean trajectories of beads separated by 7 @xmath3 m are almost identical . \n this proves that one must pay attention when interpreting such measurements , specially on the duration of measurements . \n we also have seen that the way the sample is sealed can accelerate the formation of the gel and the drift of the bead by changing the chemical properties in the small sample . \n we have used different types of cell , laponite concentrations , bead sizes , stiffness of the optical trap . in each case \n we do not find any increase of the effective temperature .    in conclusion , \n our results show no increase of @xmath0 in laponite and are in agreement with those of jabbari - farouji @xcite , who measured fluctuations and responses of the bead displacement in laponite over a wide range of frequency and found that @xmath0 is equal to the bath temperature . \n this work has been partially supported by anr-05-blan-0105 - 01 .", "StartTimeOffset": 883755140180, "RequestID": "890b699b178946b8b026bb09e9c80832", "TotalTokens": 3629}

fit value depends on various aspects of the calculations that are not fully constrained , and this introduces uncertainty in any extraction from data . \n although these uncertainties have been the target of significant investigation , it has so far been done in a piecemeal fashion  @xcite . \n no one has yet attempted to compile this information in a systematic study of all sources of uncertainty in order to place a robust and reliable upper bound on @xmath0 . \n in addition , the conjectured bound is now known not to be universal , so it is of great interest to determine if one can place a lower bound on the quantity . \n currently , there is no convincing evidence that measured data can not be reproduced with ideal hydrodynamics , and in fact most flow data can be reproduced quite well in such calculations  @xcite . in these proceedings \n we present a proposal for how to extract @xmath0 with the smallest uncertainty currently possible , as well as preliminary results on such an extraction including a quantitative error bar obtained by systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty . \n , mc -

ion collision , the asymmetric region of overlap in a collision between two nuclei results in a anisotropy in the transverse density of the system at early times . over time \n , this spatial anisotropy is transformed into a momentum anisotropy by a collective response that is well described by ( viscous ) hydrodynamics . \n in fact , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 is ( to a good approximation ) directly proportional to this initial eccentricity in a given collision event : @xmath4 . \n the proportionality constant depends sensitively on the viscosity of the medium , however , poor knowledge of the earliest stages of the collision result in significant uncertainty in @xmath5 see , for example , the top left panel of fig . \n [ ecc ] , which shows root - mean - square values of @xmath5 from a number of commonly - used models for initial conditions measurements are sensitive to the rms value of the event - by - event distribution of @xmath6 . \n the resulting uncertainty in @xmath3 has been the largest source of uncertainty when determining @xmath0 from data  @xcite . \n though there has been much recent study concerning the physics of the early stages of a collision  @xcite , it is not yet possible to make a reliable statement about what range of values of initial eccentricity are within the realm of possibility . \n it is now known that quantum fluctuations are also a significant source of anisotropy in the initial state , and therefore anisotropic flow . \n this is especially apparent from the presence of large odd harmonics , such as triangular flow @xmath7 , which is generated from a spatial `` triangularity '' , defined similarly to the eccentricity @xmath8 this would be zero at midrapidity in the absence of event - by - event fluctuations . \n the triangularity that one sees in a calculation is largely determined by the strength of these fluctuations . \n in contrast , the differences in particle production mechanisms that lead to very different @xmath5 in non - central collisions has very little effect on @xmath9 . \n compare , for example , the triangularities of the mc - kln model versus glauber ( discs ) in fig . \n [ ecc ] , which contain only fluctuations from random position of nucleons in the colliding nuclei , implemented in exactly the same way in the mc - kln code . \n the triangularity @xmath9 is very similar , despite the fact that the two pictures of particle production result in a very different eccentricity @xmath5 .    by comparing the results from other models , \n it is clear that there still remains some uncertainty due to different way fluctuations are implemented . despite the seemingly modest reduction in uncertainty ( as compared to the uncertainty in @xmath5 ) , one can reasonably argue that the results in the second panel of fig . \n [ ecc ] represent the full range of results that can be expected , in marked contrast to the results in the first panel . \n the models with the lowest triangularity are known to be missing important sources of fluctuations , while the large fluctuations in the models with the largest @xmath9 can not be reconciled with constraints from @xmath10 measurements  @xcite . \n one might thus propose to extract @xmath0 from measurements of @xmath7 to minimize uncertainty from the initial conditions . \n however , we can make use of more experimental constraints by noting that in the most central collisions , all harmonics are generated entirely from fluctuations , and the above discussion still applies . \n one further convenient factor is that , for ultra - central collisions , the approximate proportionality @xmath11 holds for all @xmath12  @xcite . \n this allows for a comprehensive parameter study with reasonable computing resources . \n thus , our proposal is to extract @xmath0 from a simultaneous fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements from ultra -

squares fit to find the preferred value . if a particular parameter is uncertain , one can vary that parameter within the allowed range and redo the fit . \n the shift of best - fit @xmath0 indicates the size of the resulting error bar in @xmath0 due to this particular source of uncertainty . \n if one then varies all possible aspects of the theory in all possible combinations , the smallest and the largest extracted values thus represent a robust , if conservative , upper and lower error bar for the quantity . \n this is the idea behind the preliminary results shown at this conference . \n details will be given in a forthcoming publication , but an example fit for a calculation using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters but different initial conditions is shown in fig . \n it is notable that hydrodynamics can , in fact , simultaneously give a good description of all @xmath13 . \n however , it is also interesting to note the tendency for tension in the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath7 for all initial conditions tested . \n we reported a preliminary result of @xmath16 , but a few comments are in order . \n first , the calculations used a constant value of @xmath0 during the hydrodynamic evolution . \n therefore , the result is an average value that corresponds to the viscosity at the typical time when flow is built up . \n the lower bound indicates that purely ideal hydrodynamic calculations can not describe these data . \n this is a significant result . \n however , it is technically possible that the viscosity could dip below our lower bound at some point during the evolution , so this result does _ not _ represent a lower bound for the viscosity of qcd over its entire temperature range . \n second , since it has never before been done , we want to be confident at every stage that we have a robust and reliable error bar . \n the preliminary result , therefore , is fairly conservative , and the error bar will likely be smaller in the final result after further study . \n we argue that at the current time , the most precise value for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 of the quark - gluon plasma can be obtained by a fit to @xmath1-integrated @xmath13 measurements in ultra - central collisions . \n we further report preliminary results such an extraction , including an error bar from a systematic study of all known sources of uncertainty . \n we thank the phobos collaboration , adrian dumitru , yasushi nara , and christoffer flensburg for providing their code to the public , which allowed us to calculate the eccentricities in various montre -

relativistic @xmath0-function potential , the relativistic problem gives rise to ultra - violet divergences that required regularization and renormalization . \n previously , we used dimensional regularization to show that the system has remarkable features . \n for example , the relatively simple system shares many features with some complex quantum field theories , like asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation in the massless limit , and it also possesses an infra - red conformal fixed point .    in quantum field theory \n it is well known that in some cases , different regularization methods give different results for the same problem @xcite . \n this is also the case for non - local quantum field theories @xcite . in @xcite \n , it was shown that for the non - relativistic @xmath0- function potential in odd @xmath2 , the dimensional regularization gives different results than the cutoff regularization , provided that the calculation is done in a non - perturbative setting .    in the case of the relativistic schrdinger equation , \n the hamiltonian is nonlocal unlike the non - relativistic case . \n a naive guess would tell us that for this case , and for a certain problem , different regularization methods give different results . \n however , in this paper we prove that this is not the case for the solution of the relativistic schrdinger equation for a point particle in an external 1-dimensional @xmath0-function potential . \n we study the solution in a non - perturbative setting using cutoff regularization . \n it gives exactly the same results from our previous calculations using dimensional regularization . \n this important because it is an evidence of universality . \n the rest of this paper is organized as the following : section 2 is for studying the bound state problem non - relativistically and relativistically using contour integrals . \n section 3 is for discussing the gap equation and cutoff regularization , and using the bound state energy to define a renormalization condition . \n section 4 for studying the scattering state problem non - relativistically and relativistically with the use of contour integrals , and defining the energy - dependence of the running coupling constant . \n section 5 is for the conclusions . \n the non - relativistic solution of the schrdinger equation for the @xmath0-function potential is a textbook problem . \n nevertheless , we discuss it briefly to highlight the similarities and differences between the non - relativistic and relativistic case , especially regarding the contour integration approach used to calculate the wave function in both cases . \n the schrdinger equation for this case is @xmath3 in momentum space , the above equation takes the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5 accordingly , in coordinate space the wave function for the bound state is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the binding energy , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the bound state energy . the value of @xmath10 in the above equation can be obtained using contour integral . \n the contour in this case has one pole inside the upper half circle at @xmath11 , as it is illustrated in figure.1 top panel . for the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential , \n the wave function of the bound state is finite at the origin , and it is given by the following equation @xmath12    1.6 cm    the relativistic time - independent schrdinger equation is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare coupling constant . in momentum space , the above equation is @xmath15 solving for @xmath16 , we get @xmath17 from the above equation , we express the bound state wave function in coordinate space as @xmath18 again here , the value of @xmath19 in the above equation can be obtained using contour integral . for a bound state @xmath20 , the contour in this case has one pole inside the upper half circle at @xmath21 . \n in addition , it has a branch cut along the positive imaginary axis starting at @xmath22 as it is illustrated in figure.1 ( bottom panel ) . for this case @xmath23 is @xmath24.\\ ] ] for a strong bound state when @xmath25 , and for an ultra - strong bound state \n when @xmath26 , the pole does not have a residue . \n for this case @xmath19 is @xmath27 both wave functions are logarithmically divergent at the origin .    in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath28 , the relativistic wave function of eq.([boundstate ] ) reduces to @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 . \n the wave function indeed reduces to the non - relativistic wave function of eq.([nonrelbound ] ) . \n however , the divergence of the relativistic wave function persists for any non - zero value of @xmath31 . on the other hand , the strong bound and the ultra strong bound states \n do not have a non - relativistic limit . \n they are purely relativistic states . \n from eq.([psip ] ) and eq.([fourier ] ) , we get @xmath32 the above equation gives @xmath33 where @xmath34 depends on the value of @xmath9 . \n the above equation determines the relation between @xmath14 and the bound state energy @xmath9 . \n the integral in eq.([gap ] ) is logarithmically ultra - violet divergent , therefore it needs to be regularized . \n we do this by using the momentum cutoff regularization . to proceed with this , \n first we must isolate the term that is causing the divergency . \n we do that by expanding the integrand in eq.([gap ] ) in powers of @xmath35 , and then we get @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the momentum cutoff . by integrating term by term , and then taking the limit @xmath38 \n , we find that all terms under the summation sign are finite , while the first term is logarithmically ultra - violet divergent . \n the resultant series from the second term converges for @xmath39 , and can be summed . \n accordingly , we can write @xmath34 as @xmath40 or @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the finite part of @xmath34 . in this case , @xmath43 for an ultra - strong bound state with energy @xmath44 the series diverges . \n still , the result can be obtained by directly integrating the convergent expression , and taking the limit @xmath38 @xmath45 as a renormalization condition , we fix the binding energy @xmath9 in units of the mass @xmath46 , such that the running bare coupling is given by @xmath47 at the non - relativistic limit , the binding energy @xmath48 is small compared to the rest mass . in this case , the running bare coupling is given by @xcite @xmath49 here it is very useful to compare the above equation with the non - relativistic contact interaction @xmath50 , which does not require renormalization , for the attractive delta @xmath51 , the bound state energy is given by @xmath52 , or @xmath53 . \n this suggests to define a renormalized coupling @xmath54 as @xmath55 \n for the non - relativistic scattering states , we assume that the solution in momentum space has the following ansatz @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 . after substituting eq.([generalansatznon ] ) into eq.([schrpnon ] ) , we get @xmath58 @xmath59 in the above equation , the value of @xmath60 can be obtained using contour integral . in this case \n , the contour has two poles on the real axis at @xmath61 as it is illustrated in figure.2 top panel . after calculating @xmath60 , \n it is straightforward to calculate @xmath62 , which is @xmath63.\\ ] ] for the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential , the wave function of the scattering state is finite at the origin .    1.6 cm    for the relativistic case , the ansatz takes the following form @xcite @xmath64 by substituting eq.([generalansatz ] ) into eq.([relschrp ] ) , and after solving for @xmath65 , we get @xmath66 where @xmath67 . from eq.([phirel ] ) , and by using momentum cutoff regularization , we can write @xmath68 the integral in the above equation is similar to the one in eq.([gap ] ) , with the exception that @xmath69 . therefore , we can write @xmath70 as in the case of @xmath34 , the term causing the divergency is @xmath71 . \n therefore , we can write @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the convergent part of @xmath74 for @xmath75 . it can be obtained from eq.([iebu ] ) after replacing @xmath9 by @xmath76 , and we get @xmath77 now , we substitute for @xmath78 from eq.([phizerodelta ] ) into eq.([phirel ] ) , and also substituting for @xmath14 from eq.([gap ] ) , we get @xmath79 from eq.([iebg ] ) and eq.([ie0 ] ) , it is obvious that ultra - violet divergences of @xmath74 and @xmath34 is canceled . \n therefore , we can say in this case that the problem is renormalizable . \n accordingly , eq.([phipdelta1final ] ) can be written as @xmath80 certainly @xmath81 is a finite quantity . \n the value of @xmath60 can be obtained from eq.([phipdelta1final2 ] ) using contour integral . \n the contour in this case has two poles on the real axis at @xmath82 , and it has a branch cut along the positive imaginary axis starting at @xmath22 as it is illustrated in figure.2 bottom panel . after calculating @xmath83 , it is straightforward to calculate @xmath62 , which is @xmath84 , \\ \n e = \\sqrt{k^2 + m^2}.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , the wave function is logarithmically divergent at the origin . to understand the meaning of the expression @xmath81 , we take the non - relativistic limit when @xmath57 , and @xmath85 , then @xmath86 and the non - relativistic limit of eq.([psiscat ] ) is @xmath87 , \\ \n \\delta e = \\frac{k^2}{2m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath88 reduces to the non - relativistic wave function of eq.([psiscatnon ] ) \n . however , the divergence of the relativistic wave function persists . nevertheless , comparing eq.([psiscatlimit ] ) with eq.([psiscatnon ] ) together with eq.([i - ieq ] ) is telling us that @xmath89 is nothing but the energy - dependent running coupling constant @xmath90 which is renormalized at the scale @xmath9 , and finite for @xmath38 . \n therefore , we have @xmath91^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] \n we proved that cutoff regularization gives the same results as dimensional regularization for the problem of the schrdinger equation for a relativistic point particle in an external 1-dimensional @xmath0-function potential . in both cases , \n the ultra - violet divergences have been canceled , and in both cases we get the same energy - dependent running coupling constant @xmath90 , which is renormalized at the scale @xmath9 , and finite . \n this means that the features that was obtained using dimensional regularization in @xcite are preserved when using cutoff regularization . \n this can be considered as an evidence of universality for a nonlocal hamiltonian . \n this publication was made possible by the nprp grant # nprp 5 -

{"ContextTokens": 3861, "GeneratedTokens": 255, "SynthesizedBody": "billiards play a predominant role in the study of classical and quantum chaos@xcite . \n indeed , the nature of quantum chaos in a specific system is traditionally inferred from its its classical counterpart . \n hence one may ask if quantum chaos is to be understood solely as a phenomenon that emerges in the classical limit , or are there some intrinsically quantal phenomena , which can contribute to irregular behavior in the quantum domain ? this is a question we raise in connection with quantum transport through ideal regular and irregular electron billiards . \n the seminal studies by mcdonald and kauffmann @xcite of the morphology of eigenstates in a closed bunimovich stadium have revealed characteristic patterns of disordered , undirectional and non - crossing nodal lines . here \n we will first discuss what will happen to patterns like these when input and output leads are attached to a billiard , regular or irregular , and an electric current is induced through the the billiard by an applied voltage between the two leads . \n for such an open system the wave function @xmath0 is now a scattering state with both real and imaginary parts , each of which gives rise to separate sets of nodal lines at which either @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath2 $ ] vanish . \n how will the patterns of nodal lines evolve as , e.g. , the energy of injected electrons is increased , i.e. , more scattering channels become open . \n could they tell us something about how the perturbing leads reduce symmetry and how an initially regular billiard may eventually turn into a chaotic one as the number open modes increase ? \n below we will argue that nodal points , i.e. , the points at which the two sets of nodal lines intersect because @xmath1=im[\\psi]=0 $ ] , carry important information in this respect . \n thus we will study their spatial distributions and try to characterize chaos in terms of such distributions . \n the question we wish to ask is simply if one can find a distinct difference between the distributions for nominally regular and irregular cavities . \n in addition , which other signatures of quantum chaos may one find in the coherent transport in open billiards ? \n the spatial distribution of nodal points play a decisive role in how the flow pattern is shaped . \n therefore we will also study the general behavior of streamlines derived from the probability current associated with a stationary scattering state @xmath3 the time independent schrdinger equation can be decomposed as@xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 the separate quantum streamlines are sometimes referred to as bohm trajectories@xcite . in this alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics \n it is thought that an electron is a `` real '' particle that follows a continuous and causally defined trajectory ( streamline ) with a well defined position @xmath6 with the velocity of the particle given by the expressions above . \n these equations imply that the electron moves under the action of a force which is not obtained entirely from the classical potential @xmath7 , but also contains a `` quantum mechanical '' potential @xmath8    this quantum potential is negatively large where the wave function is small , and becomes infinite at the nodal points of the wave function where @xmath9 . \n therefore , the close vicinity of a nodal point constitutes a forbidden area for quantum streamlines contributing to the net transport from source to drain . \n when @xmath10 does not vanish , @xmath11 is single valued and continuous . \n however at the nodal point where @xmath12 , neither @xmath13 nor @xmath14 is well defined . the behavior of @xmath13 around these nodal points is discussed in a @xcite . for our study \n the main important property of the nodal points of @xmath0 is that the probability current flows described by open streamlines can not encircle a nodal point . on the contrary , they are effectively repelled from the close vicinity of the nodal points , in a way as if these were impurities . \n the scattering wave functions @xmath0 are found by solving the schrdinger equation in a tight - binding approximation with the neumann boundary conditions outside the billiards , on a distance over which evanescent modes effectively decay to zero . \n the energy of the incident electron is @xmath15 where @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the fermi energy , @xmath18 the width of the channel , and @xmath19 the effective mass . \n an inspection of the two sets of nodal lines associated with the real and imaginary parts of the scattering wave function reveals the typical pattern of undirectional , self - avoiding nodal lines found already by mcdonald and kauffmann @xcite for an isolated , irregular billiard . \n however , in our case of a complex scattering function the nodal lines are not uniquely defined because a multiplication of the wave function by an arbitrary constant phase factor exp@xmath20 would yield a different pattern . \n the nodal points , on the other hand , appear to helpful in this respect . \n they represent a new aspect of the open system and will obviously remain fixed upon a change of the phase of wave function . here \n we conjecture that the nodal points may serve as unique markers which should useful for a quantitative characterization of scattering wave functions for open systems .    to be more specific , \n we have considered a large number of realizations ( samples ) of nodal points associated with different kinds of billiards and present averaged normalized distributions of nearest distances between the nodal points . \n [ fig1 ] shows the distributions for open sinai ( a ) , bunimovich ( b ) and rectangular billiards ( c , d ) . \n the distributions are obtained as an average over 101 different values of energy belonging to a specific energy window in which the conductance undergoes a few oscillations as shown by the insets in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . the cases ( a , b , c ) present two channel transmission through the billiards while the case ( d ) refers to five channel transmission . \n the rectangular billiard is nominally maximal in area with numerical size @xmath21 and with width of leads equal to 10 . \n it is noteworthy that the distribution of nearest neighbors is distinctly different from the corresponding distribution for random points in the two - dimensional plane @xcite @xmath22 where a density @xmath10 of random points is related to mean separation @xmath23 as @xmath24 . \n this distribution is shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a ) by the thin line indicating an underlying correlation between the nodal points of transport wave function through the sinai billiard . in this sense quantum chaos is not randomness .    with slight deviations the bunimovich billiard gives rise to the same distributions as the sinai as shown by fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) . \n analysis of the distributions for lower energies ( @xmath25 , one channel transmission ) gives quite similar universal forms as shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) , but with more pronounced fluctuations because the number of nodal points is less at lower energies . \n moreover the average over wider energy domains with a finer grid or for higher energies gives no visible deviations from the distributions in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) . \n we considered also the berry s wave function of a chaotic billiard which is accepted as standart measure of quantum chaos @xcite : @xmath26\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent random variables . \n we found that distribution of nearest distances between the nodal points of ( 2 ) has completely the same form as for the sinai billiard fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a ) . on the other hand an analysis of nodal points of wave function @xmath29 with \n @xmath30 distributed randomly leads to the distribution ( 1 ) of random points .    to supplement the averaging over energy we have also considered the positions of leads . \n [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows the normalized distribution of the nearest distances between nodal points for the sinai billiard obtained as an average over 101 positions of the input lead . as seen this distribution has the same form as the energy averaged sinai billiard in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( a ) . in the same way fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( b ) shows the corresponding case of the bunimovich billiard with an asymmetric input lead to be compared with fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( b ) . \n the unsymmetric arrangement of leads allows a larger number of eigenstates of the bunimovich to participate in the electron transport because symmetry restrictions are relaxed@xcite .    on the basis of figs . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] and comparison with the berry s wave function ( 2 ) we therefore argue that there is a universal distribution that characterizes open chaotic billiards . at this stage \n we conclude that the form of the distributions is not sensitive to the averaging procedure , to the number of channels of electron transmission and to the type of attachment of leads . \n the mathematical form of the universal distribution constitues an interesting problem that remains to be solved . \n so does a derivation of the random distribution associated with wave function in eq . \n let us now turn to the case of the nominally regular rectangular billiard . in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c ) the distribution functions are given for the case of two - channel transmission with the same energy averaging procedure as for the chaotic billiards . \n the nearest neighbor distribution clearly displays a peak corresponding to a regular set of nodal points in contrast to other billiards discussed above . \n this feature is found even for very high energies around 250 ( five - channel transmission ) . \n therefore the rectangular dot with the two symmetrically attached leads displays considerable stability with respect to regular nodal points in contrast to the chaotic sinai and bunimovich billiards . \n as indicated , symmetric leads impose restrictions on how states inside the billiard are selected and mixed on injection of a particle . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( c ) the result of averaging over the positions of the input lead is therefore shown for the rectangular billiard at a fixed energy chosen from the energy domain in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c ) . \n as may be expected the pronounced peak in the distribution function of nearest nodal points has now disappeared . \n moreover , the distribution is close to the case of the bunimovich billiard in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( b ) and fig .  [ fig2 ] ( b ) . \n evidently the non symmetrical positioning of leads disturb the nominally regular billiard in a much more profound way , effectively rendering it chaotic characteristics . to reconfirm this conclusion \n we have also performed calculations of distribution of nodal points within the same energy domain and the same number of energy steps as in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c ) but for non symmetrical positions of the input lead . \n in fact , the distribution function of nearest distances in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( d ) demonstrates the close similarity with the position average of the nodal points . \n therefore the non universal behavior of the distribution function of nodal points for the rectangular billiard shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( c , d ) is the result of only a few symmetrical eigenstates taking part in the transmission because of symmetry restrictions .    in order to give a quantitative measure of disorder of nodal point patterns we consider the shannon entropy @xmath13@xcite normalized for each specific billiard by the entropy of fully random points . \n numerical values for @xmath13 are specified in figs . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] . \n as may be expected there is a clear tendency towards maximal entropy for chaotic billiards for the same energy window . \n a similar tendency is clearly seen for the position average ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . a case of rectangular billiard with entropy 0.95 fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( d ) is beyond of this rule because for the five - channel transmission the number of nodal points substantially exceeds other considered cases irrespective of type of billiard . \n thus the shannon entropy of nodal points is important additional quantitative measure of quantum chaos for the quantum transport through billiards . \n as mentioned above streamlines are strongly affected by the positions of nodal points . \n superficially they play the role of impurities . \n it is therfore interesting issue if streamlines behave differently for regular and irregular situations and for this reason we will consider a few typical examples starting with two well defined systems , the nominally regular rectangle and the irregular sinai billiard . \n [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows the flow lines in the case of the rectangular billiard . \n the features of the flow lines connecting input and output leads are remarkable . \n it is clearly seen how the flow ( trajectories ) effectively channel through a nodal crystal avoiding the individual nodal points . \n this picture is evidently very different from semi - classical physics and periodic orbit theory@xcite . in fig . \n [ fig3 ] only contributions to the net current are displayed . \n in addition there are also vortical motions centered around each nodal point . \n the other extreme , the completely chaotic sinai billiard , is shown in fig . \n [ fig3 ] ( b ) . because the nodal distribution is now irregular also the streamlines form an irregular pattern when finding their way through the rough potential landscape . \n since a streamline can not cross itself fig . \n [ fig3 ] brings to mind the classical example of meandering rivers in a flat delta landscape . as well known , slight changes in the topography , for example , by moving only a few obstacles to new positions , \n may induce completely new flow patterns in a sometimes dramatic ways . in the same way slight variations of the energy , for example , \n may affect the quantum streamlines in the sinai billiard in an endless way , occasionally forming more collected bunches connecting the two leads in a more focused way than in fig . \n [ fig3 ] ( b ) . \n the same type of behavior has also been obtained for a two - dimensional ring in which a tiny variation of external magnetic flux induce drastic changes of the flowlines and , as a consequence , aharonov - bohm oscillations become irregular@xcite . \n this work has been partially supported by the intas - rfbr grant 95-in - ru-657 , rffi grant 97 - 02 - 16305 and the swedish natural science research council . \n the computations were in part performed at the national supercomputer centre at linkping university . \n j.o.hirschfelder , c.j.goebel , and l.w.bruch , j. chem . phys . * 61 * , 5456 ( 1974 ) . \n holland , `` the quantum theory of motion . \n an account of the de broglie - bohm causal interpretation of quantum mechanics '' ( cambridge university press , cambridge , 1993 ) . \n h. wu and d.w.l . \n sprung , phys . \n a183 * , 413 ( 1993 ) . \n p. exner , p. eba , a.f . \n sadreev , p. streda and p. feher , phys . \n lett . , * 80 * , 1710 ( 1998 ) . \n b.i.shklovskii and a.l.efros , `` elctronic properties of doped semiconductors '' , springer - werlag , 1984 , chapter 3 . \n j.r.eggert , phys . rev . * \n b29 * , 6664 ( 1984 ) . \n m.v . berry , phil . \n roy.soc a287 , 237 ( 1971 ) . \n i.v . zozoulenko and k .- f . \n berggren , phys . \n b * 56 * , 1 ( 1997 ) . \n a.garcimartin , a.guarino , l.bellon , and s.giliberto , phys . \n rev . lett.*79 * , 3202 ( 1997 ) . \n m. brack and r.k . \n badhuri , `` semiclassical physics '' , addison - wesley , 1997 ) k.n . \n pichugin and a.f . \n sadreev , phys . \n b , * 56 * , 9662 ( 1997 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 939555636581, "RequestID": "ba855571d2344d13a66a9a30ca140714", "TotalTokens": 4116}

the creation of multi - layer multi - state logical devices , exploiting combinations of polarization and magnetization ; and magnetoelectric sensors . \n however , most of the current multiferroics lack sufficiently strong polarization or magnetization , or sufficient magnetoelectric coupling , or the correct kind of magnetic order ( ferromagnets are desired , but antiferromagnets are much more common ) .    some of the difficulties of single - phase multiferroics are bypassed by `` metamultiferroics '' built of multilayer heterostructures of ferromagnets and ferroelectrics @xcite , as for example in multiferroic tunnel junctions ( mftj ) , where ferromagnetic electrodes are separated by a ferroelectric insulating barrier . \n the resistance against tunneling across the junction depends on the relative orientation of magnetization of the two electrodes ( magnetoresistance ) and on the direction of ferroelectric polarization of the insulating layer ( electroresistance ) . \n this enables in principle a 4-level switchable resistance using external electric and magnetic fields . \n of course , a further magnetic degree of freedom in the insulating - barrier material could potentially duplicate the number of states , and any chance of locally tuning the magnetization would add further design leeway . following this line of thought , in this paper we report an _ ab initio _ investigation strongly suggesting that pbtio@xmath0 ( pto ) doped with v ( v : pto ) is a ferromagnetic small - gap insulator , hence a proper multiferroic . \n this is particularly interesting in view of the giant electroresistance effect predicted in tunnel junctions with pto as ferroelectric tunnel layer @xcite . \n here we report the first principles prediction of a multiferroic state of lead titanate doped with magnetic vanadium . \n pto is a well - known tetragonal perovskite with a high spontaneous polarization ( 86 @xmath2c/@xmath3 ) of displacive origin . \n pbvo@xmath0 also happens to be tetragonal , and with an even higher spontaneous polarization ( 152 @xmath2c/@xmath3 ) . \n previous studies have shown its ground state to be an antiferromagnetic insulator ( c - type ) , making it not especially interesting as a multiferroic . \n motivated by our previous study of v - doped ferroelectric titanates @xcite , we examine the magnetic properties of vanadium diluted within the robust pto ferroelectric .    _ ab initio _ calculations are performed within density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew - wang using the paw method @xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . \n standard cutoff is used for the plane wave basis , and the k - point mesh for the bulk is 8@xmath48@xmath48 ( appropriately rescaled for defect super cells ) . the berry phase technique is used to calculate the polarization change upon v doping , using strings of 16 points in the polarization direction . \n density of states for v : pto . \n positive curve is majority spin , negative is minority spin . \n fermi energy is at 0 ev . \n inset shows a zoom of the gap peak . \n the dotted line is a v @xmath5-up . ]    after studying pto and pvo in the respective ferroelectric phases , we substituted v for one ti in a 2@xmath42@xmath42 tetragonal supercell of ferroelectric pto , i.e. dopant concentration @xmath612.5% . a selection of structure parameters ( lattice constants , distance of v or ti from neighbouring o along the polar axis ) \n are collected in tab . \n [ tab : table ] . \n v has one excess electron compared to ti , so it is , as expected , spin - polarized with a moment of 1 @xmath1 . \n orbital angular momentum is assumed to be quenched . \n [ fig : dos ] displays the key result , i.e. the density of states ( dos ) of ferromagnetic v : pto . \n as we can observe , a fully occupied peak appears in the gap of pto , placed so that a gap of about 0.2 ev survives . this dos feature is obviously related to the excess v electron occupying antibonding conduction states . \n indeed , as shown in the inset , the main contribution to that peak is that of spin - up _ d _ orbitals of v. thus , pto doped with vanadium is a small - gap ferromagnetic insulator thanks to the unpaired electron of dopant vanadium . \n the gap of pto is of course underestimated due to the known @xcite gap error of semi - local functionals ; it may well be that the small v - related gap be also somewhat larger than calculated due to the same effects ( self - interaction , xc discontinuity , etc . ) . \n .[tab : table]cell parameters for v doped pto , bulk pto and pvo . \n theoretical values are calculated for this work in gga approximation . \n experimental values are from ref . @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the cell just discussed , v is ferromagnetic by construction , being coupled to its periodic images . to study an antiferromagnetic configuration we consider two v s at the same concentration in a 2@xmath7@xmath42@xmath7@xmath42 tetragonal cell . \n the two v are placed in that cell as far as possible from each other . while the ferromagnetic configuration is stable , the antiferromagnetic configuration is not . \n the v moments disappear and the system converges to a metallic pauli paramagnet of zero moment , which is about 300 mev higher in energy than the ferromagnet . \n of course , this prevents the evaluation of a coupling parameter for magnetic models , but the ferromagnet seems quite stable nevertheless . \n @xmath8/@xmath9 ) . \n the state is anti - bonding with first - neighbor o s , has @xmath10-like nodal structure , and propagates through @xmath10-like ti states . charge paths along the vertical axis are negligible . ] \n inspection of the charge density of the impurity state ( fig . \n 2 ) suggests a @xmath10-like nodal structure and coupling of v s via v - o - ti - o- ... paths in the basal plane , whereas hardly any density is to be found along the vertical axis . \n while the v - centered state is , as expected , anti - bonding with first neighbors , the bonding o - v states ( which mimic those of the substituted ti ) appear to make for a larger charge accumulation in the v - o bond region ( fig . \n 3 ) , matching the shorter v - o bond length compared to ti - o ( 1.71 vs 1.79  ) .        following ref.@xcite , the equilibrium concentration is @xmath11$]=@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the density of ti sites and @xmath14 the growth temperature . assuming that the solubility limit for v in pto is pvo , i.e. that high v contents will eventually cause phase separation of pvo , the formation energy is e@xmath15(v)=e(v : pto)(@xmath161)e(pto)e(pvo)@xmath171.23 ev , involving the total energy of the doped supercell of v : pto comprising @xmath16 unit cells , and of the unit cells of pto and pvo . \n since @xmath13=1.25@xmath1810@xmath19@xmath20 , at a typical @xmath14=650 k we find a logarithmic concentration @xmath21\\approx$]13.4 , which may increase perhaps to about 16 due to vibrational entropy ( v is heavier than ti ) . \n this thermodynamic solubility limit is relatively low , but it may well not apply whenever kinetics or non - equilibrium phenomena become dominant , as it happens in modern epitaxial growth techniques .    finally , we estimated the changes in polarization induced by v doping . at 12.5% \n v we find a polarization increase of 8.3 @xmath2c/@xmath3 , which agrees nicely with 8.25 @xmath2c/@xmath3 obtained by linear interpolation between the bulk values of pto and pvo mentioned previously . \n therefore , in terms of polarization , v does not seem detrimental , but in fact benign . \n in summary , we presented an _ ab initio _ prediction of the proper multiferroicity of v - doped pto . \n the gap is about 0.2 - 0.3 ev and the magnetization is 1 @xmath1/v , or 1.5@xmath410@xmath22 spins / cm@xmath9 at our chosen v density . \n we predict the polarization to increase linearly with v concentration at the percentual rate of 0.7 @xmath2c/@xmath3 . \n presumably this will only apply at relatively low concentrations , since the antiferromagnetic character of pvo will eventually take over . \n + _ note _  during review we have become aware of a very recent study @xcite of transition - metal doping in a perovskite ferroelectric ( batio@xmath0 ) , reporting results in general agreement with the ones just presented . \n references                        see e.g. r. w. godby and p. garcia - gonzalez , in _ a primer in density functional theory _ , springer lecture notes in physics , c. fiolhais , f. nogueira , m. marques eds . \n ( springer , berlin 2003 ) , ch . 5 , p.185 .", "StartTimeOffset": 944918250511, "RequestID": "e8dead399e164970b3335c149a7eba8a", "TotalTokens": 2724}

de haas(sdh ) oscillations . \n the zo period allows one to extract the carrier density , whereas the temperature dependence of the zo amplitude is similar to that for sdh oscillations and gives the correct value of the carrier effective mass . \n in contrast to sdh oscillations , zo are skew -

field total resistance of the sample , and @xmath27 are the schottky resistances of contacts 1 and 2 , respectively . in the opposite case of a high applied voltage , \n the current - voltage characteristic is strongly nonlinear . indeed , in this case , the forward and reverse currents are limited ( see fig.2,a ) by the schottky diode saturation currents @xmath28 and @xmath16 , respectively . \n let us first seek the response of the 3d/2deg/3d system to an applied ac voltage @xmath29 . \n the ac voltage is provided by the generator shown in fig.1 . at low voltages \n @xmath30 , eq.(3 ) allows one to extract the current as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . according to eq.(4 ) , the in - phase response of the system to the applied ac voltage consists of the ohmic contribution and an , additional part , because @xmath33 . \n thus , we conclude that the widely used lock - in ac measurement method give [ 3 ] a sample resistance that is somewhat different from zero - field sample resistance @xmath34 .    we now intend to resolve the primary problem formulated in the present paper . \n let us investigate the dc response of the circuit(see fig.1 ) to an applied ac voltage . \n we emphasize that the second - order in voltage term in eq.(4 ) describes the rectification properties of the 2deg sample at @xmath35 . \n equation 4 yields the time - averaged current @xmath36 and , then , the voltage drop measured by dc voltmeter is given by : @xmath37 the polarity of the measured dc voltage is determined by the contact asymmetry . as expected , the transmission characteristic @xmath38 is quadratic law at @xmath39 . in the opposite case of a strong ac excitation @xmath40 , the dc response can be found qualitatively with the help of fig.2,c . \n indeed , the rectified current can be regarded as a rectangular meander sequence with linear fronts . \n the higher the applied ac voltage , the sharper the front of the current pulse . \n after simple averaging , we obtain the dc current and , finally , the rectified voltage as @xmath41 . \n \\label{average - high}\\ ] ] at a high input ac signal @xmath42 , the measured voltage saturates @xmath43 . \n one could expect that , at a moderate ac signal level @xmath44 , the low and high ac input cases merge , and , consequently , there could exist a certain part of the transmission characteristic which could be associated with a linear dependence[3,5 ] .    to confirm our qualitative predictions , we present in fig.3 the result of our numerical calculations . \n we use current - voltage characteristic specified by eq.(2 ) . reversing this equation with respect to current , \n we find numerically the dependence @xmath45 . \n the successive averaging of the current caused by the input ac signal gives the related dc voltage drop across the sample , and , hence the transmission characteristic . \n as expected , the transmission characteristic follows the asymptote given by eq.(5 ) at low excitations . at a high - level ac input @xmath40 , \n the dependence @xmath38 can be approximated with eq.(6 ) , and then levels - off . for intermediate voltages @xmath46 , \n the transmission characteristic exhibits a nearly linear behavior @xmath47 in accordance with the experimental findings[5 ] . \n main panel : the transmission characteristic for contact asymmetry @xmath20 and 2deg resistance @xmath21(upper curve ) . dotted lines a and b represent the low and high -

3 contacts ( see fig.1 ) when @xmath48 . \n inset : the observed [ 5 ] transmission characteristics correspond to those in the main panel . ] \n it is instructive to note that , in ref.[5 ] , the dc voltmeter was connected to the 1st(basic ) and intermediate probe contacts ( see contact 3 in fig.1 ) as well . in this case \n , the transmission characteristic must be multiplied by the factor @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the asymmetry of the intermediate contact with respect to the 1st one , and @xmath51 is the partial resistance of the 2deg related to the intermediate contact position . we emphasize that the lower the partial resistance @xmath51 , the smaller the differential slope @xmath52 of the transmission characteristic(see the lower curve in fig.3 , main panel ) . \n we now estimate the actual parameters of 3d/2deg/3d system experimentally studied in ref.[5 ] . for n - algaas \n / gaas sample ( 2deg density @xmath53@xmath54 , dielectric constant @xmath55 , effective mass @xmath56 ) we find the fermi energy as @xmath57mev , whereas the bohr energy @xmath58mev . as demonstrated in ref.[9 ] , the thermionic diode approximation is well justified when @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . at @xmath61 , the tunneling current across the schottky diode becomes higher than the thermionic current . \n for the typical equilibrium contact potential @xmath62ev and zero diode bias @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64k , and , hence , the observed data[5 ] can not be analyzed directly in terms of the thermionic mechanism[7 ] . \n nevertheless , even at low temperatures the current - voltage characteristic behaves similar to that described by eq.(1 ) . \n hence , the main assumption that the nonzero voltage results from rectification of the ac noise remains justified . \n we now estimate the resistance of the schottky contact . using the data from [ 5 ] , we find the total low - field resistance of the sample @xmath65 . \n then , in the insert of fig.3 we reproduce the transmission characteristic data[5 ] for the dc output measured across 1 - 2(upper curve ) and 1 - 3(upper curve ) contacts . \n both curves demonstrate a puzzling threshold behavior , which can be , in principle , attributed to the possible voltmeter zero - point shift . \n consequently , the low - voltage part of these curves can be approximated by the following equations @xmath66=-0.0002 + 12u^{2}_{0}[v]$ ] and @xmath67 respectively . \n note that , irrespective of the actual form of @xmath68 dependence , these curves differ by the factor @xmath69 which is equal to the ratio @xmath70 found above by fitting . assuming that the contact asymmetry is small , i.e. , @xmath71 we obtain the schottky contact resistance @xmath72 . \n we argue that the zero - oscillations observed in 2deg in strong magnetic fields originate from the noise rectification as well . \n indeed , at a fixed magnetic field strength , the transmission characteristic observed [ 5 ] for the zo amplitude is analogous to that reported for @xmath73 . \n we remind that the sign of the rectified voltage depends on the asymmetry of the schottky diode contact pair . if the the reverse current @xmath74 of the schottky contact oscillates in the magnetic field , the rectified dc voltage(zo ) will oscillate as well . \n the detailed examination of the zo oscillations will be made elsewhere . \n we demonstrate that the dc voltage observed at low - temperatures in a 2d electron sample @xmath0 external excitation is caused by the noise rectification by schottky diodes formed at the sample contacts . at low noise level the rectified voltage as a function of the noise amplitude follows the usual quadratic law . at higher noise magnitudes , \n the rectified voltage exhibits a nearly linear behavior , and , finally saturates . \n the rectified voltage is shown to depend on the contact pair asymmetry . \n we suggest that the shunting of the sample contacts by a capacitance is a powerful tool for suppressing the rectified voltage . \n veselago , v.n . \n zavaritskii , m.s . \n nunuparov and a.b . \n berkut , pisma zh . \n . fiz . * 44 * , _ 382 _ ( 1986 ) [ jetp lett . * 44 * , 490 ( 1986 ) ] . \n saidashev , i.g . \n savelev , and a.m. kreshchuk , pisma zh . \n teor . fiz . * 45 * , 95 ( 1987 ) [ jetp lett . * 45 * , 120 ( 1987 ) ] . \n kopev , m.yu . \n nadtochii , and v.m . \n ustinov , fiz.tekh . \n * 23 * , 1110 ( 1989 ) . \n . semicond . \n * 23 * , _ 694 _ ( 1989 ) ] . \n kadushkin , fiz.tekh . poluprovodn . * 26 * , 806 ( 1992 ) . \n v.i . kadushkin and s.i . \n fomichev , fiz.tekh . poluprovodn . * 26 * , 811 ( 1992 ) . m.i . \n dyakonov and m.v . \n cheremisin , unpublished . \n petrosyan and a.ya . \n shik , fiz.tekh . \n * 23 * 1113 ( 1989 ) [ sov . \n * 23 * , _ 696 _ ( 1989 ) ] . \n petrosyan and a.ya . \n shik , zh . \n . fiz . * 96 * 2229 ( 1989 ) [ sov.phys.jetp * 69 * , 1261 ( 1989 ) ] . \n l.v.asryan , s.g . \n petrosyan and a.ya . \n shik , sov . \n . semicond . \n * 24 * , _ 1316 _ ( 1990 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 958468676780, "RequestID": "cdce42c9e7a34c2c9d8850f9023173ad", "TotalTokens": 3645}

dependent , varying between @xmath20 for mexican - hat - shaped perturbations and @xmath21 for the gaussian curve . \n if , however , we define the control parameter @xmath1 as the additional mass inside @xmath17 in units of the horizon mass , we find strikingly similar values  @xmath22 ( mexican hat ) , @xmath23 ( gaussian curve ) , and @xmath24 ( polynomial )  for all three families of initial data in our study . \n this number is considerably greater than the previously employed threshold @xmath25 following from analytical estimates @xcite . given the qualitative difference of the functional forms of the different perturbation families , the result that @xmath2 of the gaussian perturbation lies in between the critical values of the mass compensated functions is surprising . \n our results suggest that @xmath4 ( with @xmath1 defined as above ) is a universal statement , i.e. , true for all perturbation shapes in the radiation - dominated regime . \n this remains to be verified by means of additional experiments . \n for a variety of matter models , it is well - known that the dynamics of near - critical collapse exhibit continuous or discrete self - similarity and power - law scaling of the black hole mass with the offset from the critical point \\{eq . \n ( [ scale ] ) @xcite}. in particular , evans and coleman @xcite found self - similarity and mass scaling in numerical experiments of a collapsing radiation fluid . \n they numerically determined the scaling exponent @xmath26 , followed by a linear perturbation analysis of the critical solution by koike et al . \n @xcite that yielded @xmath27 . until recently , it was believed that entering the scaling regime requires a degree of fine - tuning of the initial data that is unnatural for any astrophysical application . \n it was noted @xcite that fine - tuning to criticality occurs naturally in the case of pbhs forming from a steeply declining distribution of primordial density fluctuations , as generically predicted by inflationary scenarios . in the radiation - dominated cosmological epoch , \n the only difference with the fluid collapse studied by evans and coleman @xcite is the expanding , finite - density - background space \n time of a frw universe . assuming that self - similarity and mass scaling are consequences of an intermediate asymptotic solution that is independent of the asymptotic boundary conditions , eq . \n ( [ scale ] ) is applicable to pbh masses , allowing the derivation of a universal pbh initial mass function @xcite . \n figure ( [ f7 ] ) presents numerical evidence for mass scaling according to eq . \n ( [ scale ] ) in black hole collapse in an asymptotic frw space  time . \n all three perturbation families give rise to scaling solutions with a scaling exponent @xmath28 . \n this work discusses numerical collapse simulations of three generic families of energy density perturbations , one with a finite total excess mass with respect to the unperturbed frw solution and two mass compensated ones . among various possible definitions for the collapse control parameter @xmath1 , the total excess gravitational mass of the perturbed space  time with respect to the unperturbed frw background enclosed in the initial horizon volume is the only one that gives rise to a similar threshold value for all three shape families , @xmath29 . whether this result is an indication for universality of @xmath2 in this specific definition needs to be verified with the help of additional simulations using a larger sample of initial perturbation shapes \n .    the previously suggested @xcite scaling relation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 , based on the analogy with critical phenomena observed in near - critical black hole collapse in asymptotically non - expanding space \n times @xcite , is confirmed numerically for an asymptotic frw background . for the smallest black holes in this investigation , \n the scaling exponent is @xmath30 , which is identical to the non - expanding numerical and analytical results @xcite within our numerical accuracy . \n the parameter @xmath6 of eq . \n ( [ scale ] ) , needed in addition to @xmath7 to evaluate the two - parameter pbh imf derived in @xcite , ranges from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .", "StartTimeOffset": 966570339822, "RequestID": "94cb3c3c24fe46e5bba855eb15eb15c1", "TotalTokens": 2174}
{"ContextTokens": 2514, "GeneratedTokens": 203, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most important goals of high energy heavy ion physics is the formation and observation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . \n the discovery of a factor of @xmath5 suppression of high @xmath6 gev hadrons produced in central @xmath2 at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been interpreted as evidence for jet quenching of light quark and gluon jets . \n jet quenching was predicted  @xcite to occur due to radiative energy loss of high energy partons that propagate through ultra - dense qcd matter . \n the observed quenching pattern therefore provides a novel tomographic tool that can be used to map the evolution of the quark gluon plasma plasma ( qgp ) produced in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions . \n though the observed jet quenching for light partons strongly suggest that qgp has been formed at rhic , further detailed tests may provide the decisive proof for the discovery of qgp . \n it is believed that good test of qgp formation is the open charm suppression , which can now be measured at rhic by comparing @xmath7 distributions of @xmath8 mesons in @xmath9 and @xmath2 collisions .    the main effect which lead to open charm suppression is the radiative heavy quark energy loss in a dense qcd medium . \n the first estimates for heavy quark energy loss  @xcite proposed that similar quenching may occur for charm jets as for light partons . \n however , in ref . \n @xcite it was estimated that the heavy quark mass leads to a kinematical `` dead cone '' effect for @xmath10 that reduces significantly the induced radiative energy loss of heavy quarks . \n experimentally , the phenix data  @xcite on `` prompt '' single electron production in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 and @xmath11 agev provided a first rough look at heavy quark transverse momentum distributions at rhic . \n remarkably , no indication for a qcd medium effect was found within the admittedly large experimental errors . on the other hand , \n new star @xmath8 meson data may indicate large energy loss . \n fortunately , in the near future , data with much higher statistics and wider @xmath1 range will become accessible . \n in this proceedings we concentrate on the theory of heavy quark radiative energy loss , and how to use these results to present theoretical predictions that can be compared with upcoming experimental results . \n such comparisons may provide decisive test for qgp existence . \n only the main results for heavy quark energy loss are presented here . for more detailed version \n see  @xcite , and references therein . \n there are three important medium effects that control the radiative heavy quark energy loss in qcd matter .    here \n we first study the non - abelian analog of the ter - mikayelian  @xcite effect . \n the first estimates of the influence of a plasma frequency cutoff in qcd plasmas were reported in ref . \n @xcite using a constant plasmon mass . in our study \n , we extend those results by taking both longitudinal as well as transverse modes consistently into account via the frequency and wavenumber dependent hard thermal self energy  @xcite .    the detailed derivation of the qcd ter - mikayelian effect was presented in paper  @xcite . \n an important conclusion from  @xcite is that the effects due to the plasmon dispersion relation can be well approximated for high @xmath1 jets ignoring the longitudinal modes , and applying the asymptotic ( short wavelength transverse ) plasmon mass @xmath12 , where @xmath13 gev is chromoelectric debye screening . \n in addition to the ter - mikayelian effect , we also need to take into account that medium has finite size . \n additional radiation which occurs in the boundary between medium and vacuum has to be included . \n we will call this energy loss transition radiation . to estimate transition radiation we use the results from zakharov  @xcite , which assume of static medium . \n this calculation should be improved by considering the more realistic case of expanding medium .    on fig . \n 1 we show the numerical results for a medium characterized by a debye screening scale @xmath14 gev . \n we see that the transverse plasmon mass effect reduces the zeroth order energy loss by , @xmath15 , relative to the vacuum case . \n the gray region represents the additional energy loss which comes from transition radiation computed using  @xcite . \n this transition radiation lowers ter - mikayelian effect from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . \n therefore , these two effects would effectively _ enhance _ the yield of high transverse momentum charm quarks were it not for the extra medium induced radiation . \n the reduction of the zeroth order ( vacuum ) energy loss for charm quark due to the qcd ter - mikayelian and transition radiation effects is shown as a function of the charm quark energy . \n the upper curve shows the vacuum energy loss if gluons are treated as massless and transversely polarized . \n the lower solid curve shows medium modified ( but zeroth order in opacity ) transverse fractional energy loss . \n the dot - dashed curve shows the additional effect of transverse radiation .    the second part of our study is ( 1 ) to generalize the glv opacity series  @xcite to include massive quark kinematic effects and ( 2 ) to take into account the ter - mikayelian plasmon effects for gluons as described in  @xcite . \n the detailed study of this effect is presented in  @xcite . \n we have derived heavy quark medium induced radiative energy loss to all orders in opacity , @xmath0 . \n the analytic expression generalizes the glv opacity expansion for massless quanta to heavy quarks with mass @xmath17 in a qcd plasma with a gluon dispersion characterized by an asymptotic plasmon mass , @xmath12 . \n remarkably , we find that the general result is obtained by simply shifting all frequencies in the glv series by @xmath18 . \n the @xmath19 order in opacity fractional energy loss for heavy quarks is shown as a function of their energy . \n upper curve correspond to charm , and lower to bottom quarks in a plasma characterized by @xmath20 and @xmath21 fm . \n 4truemm    the numerical results for the first order induced radiative energy loss are shown on fig .  2 for charm and bottom quarks . \n we fix the effective static plasma opacity to be @xmath22 . \n we see that , in the energy range @xmath23 gev , the induced energy loss fraction is @xmath24 for charm quarks while only about half that is predicted for bottom . \n figure 3 shows the competition between the medium dependence of the induced energy loss and the zeroth order energy loss taking into account the ter - mikayelian effect and transition radiation . even in the absence of a medium \n ( @xmath25 , a charm quark with energy @xmath26 gev suffers an average energy loss , @xmath27 , due to the sudden change of the color current when it is formed in the vacuum . \n the dielectric plasmon effect reduces this to about @xmath28 . \n the additional transitional radiation lowers the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . \n the fractional energy loss for a 10 gev charm quark is plotted versus the effective static thickness @xmath31 of a plasma characterized by @xmath14 gev and @xmath32 fm . \n the dashed middle horizontal line corresponds to the energy loss in the vacuum taking into account the kinematic dead cone of radiation for heavy quarks  @xcite . \n the lower horizontal solid line shows our estimate of the reduction of the zeroth order energy loss due to the qcd analog of the ter - mikayelian effect . \n the dot - dashed middle curve shows the additional effect of transverse radiation . \n the upper solid curve corresponds to the net energy loss , @xmath33 .    by comparing the net energy loss in the medium ( @xmath34 ) with the naive vacuum value ( @xmath29 ) \n , we find that additional energy loss in the medium is approximately @xmath35 of initial energy of the quark .    to estimate the value of suppression that comes from this energy loss we use the method described in  @xcite . \n we assume that initial charm @xmath7 distribution is in the region @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constants , and that the medium opacity is in the region @xmath39 fm . \n charm @xmath7 suppression is shown as a function of @xmath7 .    from fig . \n 4 we see that the charm quark suppression will be small @xmath40 . \n such value is expected having in mind low value of additional energy loss @xmath41 . \n this prediction of suppression seems to be consistent with current phenix experimental single electron data  @xcite , but it is possibly inconsistent with star data . \n unfortunately , the problem with current data is that they have large error bars , and that single electrons are less sensitive to the heavy quark energy loss than @xmath8 mesons . \n therefore , high statistics @xmath8 meson data will allow us to make more reliable conclusions . \n the upcoming @xmath8 meson data for 200 gev @xmath9 and @xmath2 results will soon become available . according to our results , \n charm quark suppression should be small @xmath42 . \n therefore , this suppression should be definitely much smaller than the already observed pion suppression @xmath43 \n .    if our predictions are confirmed , then existence of qgp will pass another stringent test . \n together with already observed jet quenching and elliptic flow of light partons , this may provide decisive argument in the favor of the qgp production at rhic . \n we would like to thank r. vogt for carefully reading the paper and giving valuable suggestions . \n this work is supported by the director , office of science , office of high energy and nuclear physics , division of nuclear physics , of the u.s . \n department of energy under grant no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 3668, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "studying the charmed hadron production is a particularly useful tool to probe properties of hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions . the modern pattern of multi - particle production in ( most central ) heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc agrees with the formation of hot strongly - interacting matter with hydrodynamical properties ( `` quark - gluon fluid '' ) , which absorbs energetic quarks and gluons due to their multiple scattering and medium - induced energy loss ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . within such paradigm , a number of questions on heavy flavor production arises . \n are heavy quarks thermalized in quark - gluon plasma ? what is the mass dependence of in - medium quark energy loss ? \n are charmed hadrons in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium ? how the specific pattern of quarkonium suppression is related to the interplay between thermal and non - thermal mechanisms of @xmath1-meson production ? in this paper , some results of the phenomenological analysis of lhc data on momentum spectra and elliptic flow of charmed hadrons ( d , @xmath1 ) in pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev within two - component model hydjet++ are presented . the comparison with rhic results is also discussed . \n hydjet++ is the model of relativistic heavy ion collisions , which includes two independent components : the soft hydro - type state ( `` thermal '' component ) and the hard state resulting from the medium - modified multi - parton fragmentation ( `` non - thermal '' component )  @xcite . \n the soft component represents the hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from the parametrization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( the adapted event generator fast mc  @xcite ) . \n hadron multiplicities are calculated using the effective thermal volume approximation and poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value , which is supposed to be proportional to a number of participating nucleons for a given impact parameter of an aa collision . to simulate the elliptic flow effect , \n the hydro - inspired parametrization is implemented for the momentum and spatial anisotropy of a thermal hadron emission source . \n the approach used for the hard component is based on the pyquen partonic energy loss model  @xcite . \n the simulation of single hard nn sub - collision by pyquen is constructed as a modification of the jet event obtained with pythia@xmath36.4 generator  @xcite . \n it takes into account medium - induced rescattering , collisional and radiative energy loss of hard partons in the expanding quark - gluon fluid , realistic nuclear geometry and nuclear shadowing effect . \n the mean number of jets produced in an aa event is calculated as a product of the number of binary nn sub - collisions at a given impact parameter per the integral cross section of the hard process with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath4 . \n the partons produced in hard processes with the momentum transfer lower than @xmath4 , are considered as being `` thermalized '' . \n so , their hadronization products are included `` automatically '' in the soft component of the event . \n the input parameters of the model for soft and hard components have been tuned from fitting to heavy ion data on various observables for inclusive hadrons at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite . \n charmed meson production in hydjet++ includes soft and hard components as well . \n thermal production of @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 hadrons is treated within the statistical hadronization approach  @xcite . \n momentum spectra of charm hadrons are computed according to the thermal distribution , and the multiplicities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are calculated through the corresponding thermal numbers @xmath9 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the charm enhancement factor ( or charm fugacity ) , and @xmath12 is the number of charm quarks in a hadron @xmath13 . \n the fugacity @xmath11 can be treated as a free parameter of the model , or calculated through the number of charm quark pairs obtained from pythia and multiplied by the number of nn sub - collisions . \n non - thermal charmed hadrons are generated by pyquen taking into account in - medium energy loss of heavy ( b , c ) quarks within `` dead - cone '' generalization  @xcite of bdmps model  @xcite for radiative loss and high - momentum transfer limit  @xcite for collisional loss . \n some time ago it was demonstrated in  @xcite that if @xmath1-mesons are produced in hydjet++ at the same freeze - out parameters as for inclusive ( light ) hadrons , then simulated @xmath0- and @xmath14-spectra in 20% of most central auau collisions at rhic energy @xmath15 gev are much wider than ones measured by phenix  @xcite . \n however the assumption that the thermal freeze - out for @xmath1-mesons happens at the same temperature as chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities ) allows hydjet++ to reproduce the data . \n it turned out that the similar situation holds at the lhc . \n figure  [ jpsi_temp ] shows the comparison of hydjet++ simulations with the alice data  @xcite for @xmath0-spectrum of @xmath1-mesons in 20% of most central pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev . \n one can see that if thermal freeze - out for @xmath1 s happens at the same temperature as chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities ) , then simulated spectra match the data up to @xmath16 gev/@xmath17 . \n the discrepancy at high @xmath0 may indicate on the necessity to tune pythia for charmonium production in this kinematic domain . \n the @xmath0-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath18 measured by alice  @xcite is also reproduced by hydjet++ simulations in such a case ( figure  [ jpsi_v2 ] ) . \n the contribution of non - thermal component is important at high @xmath0 . \n thus we conclude that @xmath1-meson production in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc may be reproduced by hydjet++ model under the assumption that thermal freeze - out of charmonia happens appreciably before thermal freeze - out of light hadrons  @xcite , presumably at chemical freeze - out ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) . \n our interpretation of this is that the significant part of @xmath1-mesons ( up to @xmath16 gev ) is thermalized , but without being in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium . \n elliptic flow coefficient @xmath19 of @xmath1-mesons at rapidity @xmath20 for 2040% centrality of pbpb collisions at @xmath21 tev . \n the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black -

both components ) . ] \n at first we have checked that @xmath0-spectrum of d - mesons measured by star  @xcite in 10% of most central auau collisions at @xmath15 gev is reproduced by hydjet++ simulation with fugacity @xmath24 and the same freeze - out parameters as for @xmath1-mesons ( but not for inclusive hadrons ) . \n it means that d - mesons like @xmath1-mesons are not in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium at rhic . \n however the situation gets changed dramatically at the lhc . \n figure  [ d_pt ] shows the comparison of hydjet++ simulations with the alice data  @xcite for @xmath0-spectra of d@xmath22 , d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 mesons in 20% of most central pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev . \n the freeze - out parameters as for inclusive hadrons have been used , the fugacity value @xmath27 being fixed from @xmath1 yield . \n the model results are close to the data within the experimental uncertainties . \n note that @xmath0-spectra and nuclear modification factors @xmath28 ( the ratio of particle yields in aa and pp collisions normalized on the mean number of nn sub - collisions ) of d - mesons are reproduced by hydjet++ up to very high @xmath0 . \n so the treatment of heavy quark energy loss in hard component of the model ( pyquen ) seems quite successful . \n in addition , hydjet++ is able to reproduce the alice data  @xcite on @xmath0-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath18 ( figure  [ d_v2 ] ) . \n thus in contrast to rhic , thermal freeze - out of d - mesons at the lhc happens simultaneously with thermal freeze - out of light hadrons . \n therefore the significant part of d - mesons ( up to @xmath29 gev/@xmath17 ) seems to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium . \n momentum spectra and elliptic flow of d and @xmath1 mesons in pbpb collisions at the lhc are reproduced by two - component model hydjet++ including thermal ( soft ) and non - thermal ( hard ) components . \n thermal freeze - out of d - mesons happens simultaneously with thermal freeze - out of light hadrons . \n thermal freeze - out of @xmath1-mesons happens appreciably before freeze - out of light hadrons , presumably at chemical freeze - out ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) . \n thus the significant part of d - mesons ( up to @xmath29 gev / c ) seems to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium , while @xmath1 mesons are not . \n the production of charmed mesons at high transverse momenta is determined by non - thermal charm production mechanism and medium - induced heavy quark energy loss . \n discussions with l.v . \n bravina , v.l . \n korotkikh , l.v . \n malinina , a.m. snigirev , e.e . \n zabrodin and s.v . \n petrushanko are gratefully acknowledged . \n we thank our colleagues from alice and cms collaborations for fruitful cooperation . \n this work was supported by the russian scientific fund under grant no . \n 14 -

{"ContextTokens": 3739, "GeneratedTokens": 235, "SynthesizedBody": "effects of an electron - electron interaction in electronic systems have become a focus of the condensed matter physics recently . in a three or higher dimensions \n , it is widely believed that landau s fermi liquid theory is valid and the effect of the interaction is absorbed into several phenomenological landau parameters . \n the system is metallic even with the interaction since the ground state is adiabatically connected to the free fermi sea where the excitations are given by an electron - hole _ \n excitation across the fermi surface . in one dimension , however , the ground state is unstable against a perturbation of the interaction and the ground state is given by the so - called tomonaga -

electron interaction may bring an opening of the energy gap in electronic systems which is known as a mott transition . \n the opening of the energy gap implies a metal - insulator transition which has become a focus again recently in connection to new materials as metal - oxides , organic materials and the high-@xmath0 superconductors . \n as far as the conductivity of the electronic system is concerned , the mott transition can be understood as a freezing of the charge degree of freedom . \n there can be spin related phenomena in a small energy scale , however , the mott transition is a phenomenon of the order of the electron - electron interaction . \n noting this fact , we have focused on a charge degree of freedom and chosen a model hamiltonian of spinless fermions on a lattice    @xmath1    where the interaction can be long range . \n ( we set @xmath2 in the following . ) when the interaction is non - zero only for the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites , it is mapped to the spin @xmath3 antiferromagnetic xxz model by the jordan - wigner transformation . in this case , haldane investigated the model in detail by using the bethe ansatz solution of the xxz model@xcite . \n generic ground states of the nn model are the tl liquid without the energy gap except at a half filling where the model has a metal - insulator transition at @xmath4 . \n it is identified as an antiferromagnetic ising gap in term of the xxz spin model .    in this paper , we investigate the model , when the interaction is long range , with various filling factors of the fermion numbers . as shown later , it has a rich structure as a _ \n let us first consider a strong coupling limit @xmath5 of the model when the filling factor @xmath6 is rational where @xmath7 is the number of fermions and @xmath8 is the number of sites . \n we use a periodic boundary condition in the following . \n let us assume the interaction satisfies the downward convex condition , that is , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) to avoid a formation of charge clustering . \n ( see later . ) \n a possible form of the interaction which we use in the paper is @xmath11which reduced to a simple power law decaying interaction @xmath12 when @xmath13 in a sufficiently large system . \n the nearest neighbor interaction can be recovered also by taking @xmath14 and @xmath15 . when the interaction is sufficiently large , the ground state of the system for the rational filling @xmath16 with mutually prime integers @xmath17 and @xmath18 was known for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n it is given by a one dimensional wigner crystal with period @xmath18@xcite . \n although the ground state charge ordering ( crystal structure ) is complicated if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are large integers , it is explicitly given@xcite . in fig.[fig : chrg ] , shape of the charge ordering is shown for @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 as an example . as is expected for the formation of the charge ordering , there are some commensurate conditions to stabilize the system . \n this commensurability condition brings a fractal structure into the system as shown later . \n the chemical potential in the thermodynamic limit is evaluated by a similar consideration applied for the long range ising model@xcite . \n it is written as @xmath22 f_{[\\frac k\\rho]-1}^\\infty -   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]-1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]}^\\infty { \\rm \\ if\\ }   [ \\frac k\\rho ] = \\frac k\\rho   \\\\   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]+1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]}^\\infty -   [ \\frac k\\rho ]   f_{[\\frac k\\rho]+1 } ^\\infty { \\rm \\ otherwise }   \\end{array}\\right . \n \\nonumber   \\\\ \n e_-(k ) & = &    -[\\frac k\\rho ] f_{[\\frac k\\rho]+1}^\\infty +   ( [ \\frac k\\rho]+1 )   f_{[\\frac k\\rho ] } ^\\infty \\nonumber   % \\label{eq : chmpm}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath23 $ ] is a gauss symbol which denotes a least integer which is not larger that @xmath24 and @xmath25 is an order @xmath26 contribution mainly from the kinetic energy which is a smooth function of @xmath27 . in figs . \n [ fig : chem ] , the chemical potentials are evaluated for two different interactions . \n it is a devil s staircase which was first discussed by bak et al . in a context of the long range ising model@xcite . \n the discontinuity of the chemical potential , @xmath28 , which is a key quantity to judge whether the system is metallic ( @xmath29 ) or not ( @xmath30 ) is evaluated as @xmath31this is generically non - negative for the potential which satisfies the convex downward condition . \n ( if this condition is not satisfied , @xmath32 can be negative for some filling factor which causes an instability . \n it is identified as a charge clustering . ) \n it implies that the energy gap opens for any rational fillings if the interaction is strong enough . \n further , as can be seen from eq . \n ( [ eq : gap ] ) , the energy gap @xmath33 only depends on @xmath18 . \n its dependence is given by a power law @xmath34 . \n from the consideration in the strong coupling limit , to have a mott insulator phase in the system with filling factor @xmath19 , finite interaction range over @xmath18 sites is crucial . \n on the other hand , when the interaction is weak ( @xmath35 ) , the finite band width due to the lattice effect ( periodic potential ) is not so important . in this case \n , one can approximate the system as a continuous model with a long range @xmath36 interaction and with the periodic boundary condition@xcite . \n when @xmath37 , the continuum model is a sutherland model which has been studied extensively@xcite . if @xmath37 , the weak coupling model can be discussed using an information from the exact solutions . however , the strong coupling case , of course , neither the intermediate coupling case can not be discussed by the exact solutions . the ground state of the sutherland model is a tl liquid without an energy gap independent of the filling where the ground state is given by the jastraw wavefunction . \n noting that there is an energy gap in the strong coupling , it suggests that there is a finite value of the interaction where the energy gap opens . \n one possibility is that there is alway non - zero energy gap , that is , the critical value where the energy gap opens , @xmath38 . \n however , even in the nearest neighbor model where the energy gap can be most stable , there is a gapless tl phase ( xy phase in the xxz model ) . \n therefore we can expect that there are always finite regions of the gapless tl liquid phases in any filling factors and inevitably the mott transition . in the following , \n we give numerical results to confirm these consideration and study the critical region . \n as we have discussed , the ground state of the spinless fermions with long range interaction has two phases for any rational filling when the interaction strength is varied . \n the one is the tl liquid metallic phase and the other is the mott insulator phase . the transition between the two is a typical quantum phase transition at zero temperature . in this section \n , these phase transitions are demonstrated numerically . \n the main focus of the numerical calculations here is to investigate a critical behavior near the gap opening ( the transition point ) . \n our main strategy is to investigate the system from an insulator side . \n we use the exact diagonalization technique for systems with a periodic boundary condition . \n the hilbert space is divided into several sectors with different momentum quantum numbers and diagonalized within them to obtain the lowest few energies . for small systems , \n the full spectra are also obtained . \n due to the small system size available , it is not efficient to calculate the chemical potential directly . instead of it , \n we calculate an excitation gap @xmath39 which can be comparable with @xmath32 .    in fig . \n [ fig : disp1o2 ] and fig . \n [ fig : disp1o3 ] , lower parts of energy spectra are shown for systems with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively \n . when the interaction is sufficiently weak , one observes a behavior of the gapless tl liquid as shown in fig . \n [ fig : disp1o2](a ) and fig . \n [ fig : disp1o3](a ) . on the other hand , opening of the energy gap near @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath19 ) \n is clearly shown when the interaction is sufficiently strong ( see fig . \n [ fig : disp1o2](b ) and fig . \n [ fig : disp1o3](b ) ) . \n as is known from the strong coupling analysis , there is a discrete symmetry breaking ( translational symmetry ) in the strong coupling phase . for the @xmath19 case , \n this is a @xmath46 symmetry breaking . \n correspondingly there is almost @xmath18 degenerate ( ground ) states in a finite system . \n they have different total momentum @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) respectively . at these momentum sectors , \n the lowest energy state is given by one of the @xmath18 degenerate ground states . \n therefore the lowest energy gap , the energy difference between the lowest energy state at the momentum and the true ground state of the finite system ( usually @xmath49 ) , is related to an energy barrier between the degenerate @xmath18 ground states barrier as shown in eq . \n ( [ eq : gap - exp ] ) . the physical energy gap which we concern is the second lowest one as seen in the figures . in the fig . \n [ fig : soft1o3 ] , the lowest energy gap at @xmath50 for @xmath41 is plotted as a function of the system size for several values of the interaction strength . for @xmath51 , \n the gap size obeys a exponential law as @xmath52 which is a signature of the ( discrete ) symmetry breaking and @xmath53 is the order of the symmetry breaking potential . \n the discrete symmetry breaking is confirmed numerically for @xmath51 in fig .  [ \n fig : soft1o3 ] . to confirm the discrete symmetry breaking , \n we have also calculated a spectral flow , that is , the energy as a function of the aharonov - bohm flux through the periodical system ( ring)@xcite . in fig . \n [ fig : ab ] , the spectral flows of three different momentum sectors ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) for the @xmath41 system is shown where the @xmath56 symmetry breaking is expected . \n it is clearly shown that the @xmath57 low energy states are entangled with each other . \n that is , these three states are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit which is a signature of the discrete symmetry breaking . \n next let us investigate the critical region . \n for a nearest neighbor model at half filling , the behavior of the gap opening is known from the bethe ansatz solution and is given by @xmath58 which is essentially singular at the critical point@xcite . \n we have numerically investigate the behavior of the gap opening for several filing factors in our long range interaction model . in fig . \n [ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] , the excitation gap is plotted as a function of the interaction strength .    in the massless \n tl liquid phase and the mott insulator phase with @xmath59 symmetry breaking , @xmath60 converges to the true energy gap in the thermodynamic limit . \n therefore we extrapolate @xmath60 , the energy gap between the lowest energy at @xmath49 and @xmath61 to the infinite size limit by fitting them as a polynomial of the @xmath62 . \n an example of the fitting is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fit ] for @xmath41 case with several values of the interaction strength . \n the numerical results shown in fig . \n [ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] can be well fitted by the following essentially singular form as a function of the interaction strength @xmath63it implies that the transition is a generalized kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type . \n therefore the transition is of infinite order as a quantum phase transition . \n this kind of the singular behavior is expected in the conformal field theory for the off - critical behavior near the conformally invariant critical phase . in the @xmath64 invariant case , \n the exponent @xmath65 is evaluated by the renormalization group analysis to be @xmath66@xcite . at the critical point of the model \n has an apparent @xmath46 symmetry but may have higher symmetry . \n then one of the possible guesses for the exponent is @xmath67 . \n numerically it is difficult to determine @xmath68 and @xmath69 with sufficient accuracies due to the singular behavior of the energy gap . \n however one may use @xmath70 as a lower bound of the @xmath71 since it is plausible to expect the wigner crystal at the strong coupling melts near @xmath72 . \n this estimate agrees rather well with numerical results obtained ( figs . \n [ fig : gap1o2 ] ,  [ fig : gap1o3 ] , and  [ fig : gap1o4 ] ) . in figs . \n [ fig : phase ] , we have shown possible ground state phase diagram using the above estimate . in the figure , the interaction strength is plotted in a nonlinear scale . \n it shows that there is alway insulator phase for any rational filling . \n since the @xmath73 curve is the devil s staircase , @xmath74 shows a fractal structure . \n correspondingly , the ground state phase diagram of the spinless fermions with long range interaction has a clear _ \n fractal structure_@xcite . \n the author thanks y. morita , m. kohmoto , m. takahshi , k. maki and d. lidsky for helpful discussions . \n this work was supported in part by grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , science and culture of japan . \n spin model with inverse square exchange with anisotropy also has a similar fractal structure@xcite by the similar argument given in the manuscript . since _ \n only a part _ of the eigenstates is obtained analytically@xcite , the fractal nature of the system is not captured by the analytical solutions@xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1028552905819, "RequestID": "f88f9882c78b40e9a79ea31b9f6ff197", "TotalTokens": 3974}

scaling factors have been adjusted for the line component by the fit . \n the flux in the line is then derived by fitting a 3.7 kev fwhm gaussian to the spectrum resulting from the model fitting .    in both approaches \n , we do not detect the source . \n the results are presented in table [ tab : table ] . \n the upper limits are computed at a 2@xmath7 confidence level , for a line width of  3.7 kev ( the instrumental width of the galactic center 511 kev line as measured by spi ) . \n even if spi did not detect any 511 kev emission from the sdg , it should be remembered that the effective observation time accumulated during the two gcdes is only 80 ks . \n thus , the flux upper limits derived on the sdg are still above the predicted fluxes .    at this point \n it should be noted that the predicted fluxes are very optimistic . \n the calculation has been indeed performed assuming the most favourable hypotheses :    \\1 ) @xcite consider that the spatial extension of the sdg halo is less than 2 degrees and the shape of the halo profile for sdg is similar to that of draco . we know that the sdg is disrupted by tidal gravitational forces and that the visible matter has an extent of 3@xmath38@xmath4 . in this context , the profile of the dark matter halo and the extent of the gas where the positrons annihilate can be much larger than anticipated by the authors , leading to a size of the 511 kev source probably bigger than 2 degrees . \n in such a context , we can not further consider it as a point like source in our data analyses , the flux extraction will be more difficult , and the detection less favorable . \n \\2 ) @xcite choose an hydrogen density in the sdg of the order of @xmath8  @xmath9 . \n this parameter is critical for the computation of the thermalization time . \n the kinetic energy of the positrons is directly linked to the mass of the dark matter . for a dark matter mass greater than 10 mev \n , the thermalization time could be larger than the age of the sgd . \n \\3 ) in @xcite , the annihilation is supposed to occur directly on dust grains . if there is no dust , the line will be broadened and the line width will be equal to 10 kev @xcite . in this case again , the detection is less favourable . \n another interesting target would be palomar-13 @xcite provided this remote ( 24.3 kpc ) globular cluster is not in a process of tidal disruption . \n the expected flux of 511 kev photons normalized on the galactic bulge emission using different dark matter distribution , is sufficiently high to be detected with integral if palomar-13 is really a dense clump of dark matter . \n after two galactic center deep exposures , we have not detected a 511 kev emission from sdg , but this non - detection can not exclude the light dark matter hypotheses . \n the spi / integral effective observation time is today not sufficient to reach the adequate sensitivity . in the following months and years , by accumulating the data , the spi sensitivity in the direction of the sdg will reach the predicted fluxes . in this study we considered the 511 kev source as a point like source ( less than 2 degrees ) , in the future we will search for different source extent . \n moreover two parameters are very important for the prediction of the 511 kev emission as a signature of the light dark matter : the hydrogen density within the sdg and the dust fraction . \n future observations from fuse will provide a more accurate value of the gas density . with more spi data and more accurate parameters , the observation of the sdg in the 511 kev energy range could permit to put a relevant constrain on the mass of the light dark matter . \n atti , d. , cordier , b. , gros , m. , laurent , ph . , \n schanne , s. et al 2004 , a&a 411 , l71 boehm , c. , hooper , d. , silk , j. , casse , m. , & paul , j. 2004 , phys . \n 92 , 101301 cass , m. , cordier , b. , paul , j. , schanne , s. 2004 , apj , 602 , l17 hooper , d. , ferrer , f. , boehm , c. , et al 2004 , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3261, "GeneratedTokens": 220, "SynthesizedBody": "the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies form a sample of small galaxies which , due to their relatively nearby locations and close association with the milky way could in principle furnish crucial observational and theoretical information on a range of astrophysical phenomena . as these systems are eventually disrupted and incorporated into the milky way they illustrate locally one of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for the build up of large galaxies . thus comparing their stars and those now found in our galaxy we can obtain a first estimate of the relevance of late mergers ( unavane et al . \n dynamical studies of their stars have yielded valuable constraints on the nature and structure of dark matter halos at the smallest scales ( lin & faber 1983 , gerhard & spergel 1992 ) . \n their orbits probe the galactic halo in a range of distances not sampled by any other objects and can thus be used to study the outer galactic halo . \n additionally , their small sizes make them in principle the simplest galactic systems , where key processes such as star formation and gas flows can be studied under relatively well defined conditions . \n however , this situation is complicated by the fact that we not only lack a theoretical understanding of these systems , but also an observational record of their evolution ; only a present day snapshot of their physical parameters is available , as is the case with most galactic systems . whilst high redshift observations have recently opened up new areas of research as they begin to yield an statistical description of the evolution of bright galaxies , such an approach is likely to remain out of reach for these small systems for some time . \n fortunately , their neighboring locations allow the study of their individual stars , which offers the possibility of directly probing their evolutionary histories by inferring star formation rates as a function of time , @xmath2 . \n the recent availability of detailed colour - magnitude diagrams for several nearby systems has prompted the development and allowed the application of careful statistical methods aimed at reconstructing the star formation histories of these objects ( e.g. chiosi et al . \n ( 1989 ) , aparicio et al . \n ( 1990 ) and mould et al . \n ( 1997 ) using magellanic and local clusters , and mighell & butcher ( 1992 ) , smecker - hane et al . \n ( 1994 ) , tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) and mighell ( 1997 ) using local dsph s ) . \n although much has been learnt of the complex @xmath2 of these systems , existing studies have lacked two major ingredients : a homogeneous set of observations including several of the dsph galaxies does not exist , and different data sets are generally analyzed using different techniques . \n these two points make comparisons between the derived @xmath2 at best risky . \n a further difficulty lies in the fact that the available rigorous statistical studies approach the problem parametrically , which is something one should try to avoid when the actual structure of the function one is trying to recover can be crucial , as is the case when the underlying physics is unknown . \n an example of this last point is the case of the carina dwarf . \n hurley - keller et al . ( 1998 ) solve for the best fitting three discrete bursts solution to the @xmath0 and conclude that star formation has proceeded spasmodically , whilst mighell ( 1997 ) uses a non parametric star count approach , albeit not a fully consistent statistical method , to obtain a more gradual solution for carina s @xmath0 . \n in this paper we have attempted to improve on the determination of the star formation histories of local dsph systems by addressing the two points mentioned above . \n we use recent hst observations of the resolved populations of a sample of dsph galaxies ( carina , leoi , leoii , ursa minor and draco ) uniformly taken and reduced , to recover the @xmath0 of each , applying a new non - parametric maximum likelihood method . \n this allows meaningful comparisons to be made , as any systematics , at any level , will affect all our galaxies equally . \n the outline of our paper is as follows : in section 2 we discuss the observations , in section 3 we include a brief outline of our method , which was introduced in our paper i ( hernandez et al . 1999 ) . \n the results are presented in section 4 , and in section 5 we summarize our results . \n the main requirements of our observations were that they should comprise a homogeneous sample of local dsph galaxies , mostly in terms of the data reduction . \n only such an internally consistent data set allows robust comparisons between different galaxies , once uniform data reduction and analysis methods are adopted . \n we extracted available archive hst data for the carina , leoi , leoii , ursa minor and draco galaxies , and used standard data reduction methods and standard hst calibration numbers throughout the sample ( e.g. elson et al . \n 1996 ) . \n the currently available data cover only small ( and variable ) sections of the total extent of these systems . \n this fact clearly limits the inferences which can be drawn to the small observed fractions , the star formation histories of these regions might not by representative of the average for a whole galaxy . \n while this limitation introduces an extra uncertainty to our results , it highlights the interesting possibility of studying spatial variations in the evolutionary histories of dsph galaxies , if comprehensive hst studies where undertaken . in the above sense \n , our results for the different galaxies refer in the strictest sense only to the fractions covered by the observed fields .    as we did not require the hr diagrams to extend much fainter than the oldest turnoff points ( @xmath3 ) , or to be complete into the faintest limits ( the faintest stars were in fact excluded from the analysis ) the data reduction was straightforward . \n our resulting cmds do not show any systematic difference from comparable published ones for the galaxies we study . \n the technical details of the images used appear in the appendix . \n in this section we give a summary description of our hr diagram inversion method , which was described extensively in our paper i. in contrast with other statistical methods , we do not need to construct synthetic colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for each of the possible star formation histories being considered . \n rather we use a direct approach which solves for the best @xmath0 compatible with the stellar evolutionary models assumed and the observations used .          as the weak metallicity dispersions measured in the galaxies we are studying ( around 0.3 dex ) are comparable to the errors in the metallicity determinations themselves , we have not attempted to introduce any enrichment histories for any of our galaxies . \n in fact , as small internal metallicity spreads present in these galaxies would introduce only small differential age offsets in our inferred @xmath0 ( see table i ) , we shall in all cases use single metallicity isochrone sets . \n once a metallicity has been selected , we use the latest padova isochrones ( fagotto et al . \n 1994 , girardi et al . \n 1996 ) together with a detailed constant phase interpolation scheme using only stars at constant evolutionary phase , to construct an isochrone library having a chosen temporal resolution .    in this case \n we implement the method with a resolution of 0.15 gyr , sufficient for our present problem . \n it is one of the advantages of the method that this resolution can be increased arbitrarily ( up to the stellar model resolution ) with computation times scaling only linearly with it . \n our only other inputs are the positions of , say @xmath5 observed stars in the hr diagram , each having a colour and luminosity , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . starting from a full likelihood model , we first construct the probability that the @xmath5 observed stars resulted from a certain @xmath0 . \n this will be given by :        in the above expression @xmath10 is the density of points along the isochrone of age @xmath11 , around the luminosity of star @xmath12 , and is determined by the assumed imf together with the duration of the differential phase around the luminosity of star @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are a maximum and a minimum time needed to be considered , for example 0 and 15 gyr . \n @xmath15 is the amplitude of the observational errors in the colour of the stars , which are a function of the luminosity of the stars . \n this function is supplied by the particular observational sample one is analyzing . \n finally , @xmath16 is the colour the observed star would actually have if it had formed at time @xmath11 \n . we shall refer to @xmath17 as the likelihood matrix , since each element represents the probability that a given star , @xmath12 , was actually formed at time @xmath11 . since the colour of a star having a given luminosity and age can sometimes be multi - valued function , in practice we check along a given isochrone , to find all possible masses a given observed star might have as a function of time , and add all contributions ( mostly 1 , sometimes 2 and occasionally 3 ) in the same @xmath17 . in this construction we are only considering observational errors in the colour , and not in the luminosity of the stars . \n the generalization to a two dimensional error ellipsoid is trivial , however the observational errors in colour dominate the problem to the extent of making this refinement unnecessary . \n although the amplitude of luminosity errors is only a factor of @xmath18 smaller than colour errors , as can be inferred from the fact that cmd diagrams typically display a range of luminosities 5 times larger than in colour , in discriminating between isochrones , errors in colour are @xmath19 times as important as errors in luminosity . \n the absence of a colour dependence from @xmath10 is a direct consequence of having neglected errors in the luminosity of the stars . \n a star of a given observed luminosity and assumed age will thus have a colour determined by the isochrones used . \n equation ( 2 ) is essentially the extension from the case of a discrete @xmath0 used by tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , to the case of a continuous function ( continuous in time , but obviously discrete with respect to the stars ) in the construction of the likelihood . \n the challenge now is to find the optimum @xmath0 without evaluating equation ( 2 ) i.e. without introducing a fixed set of test @xmath0 cases from which one is selected . \n the condition that @xmath20 has an extremal can be written as @xmath21 and a variational calculus treatment of the problem applied . \n firstly , we develop the product over @xmath12 using the chain rule for the variational derivative , and divide the resulting sum by @xmath22 to obtain :                this in effect has transformed the problem from one of searching for a function which maximizes a product of integrals ( equation 2 ) to one of solving an integro - differential equation ( equation 4 ) . \n we solve this equation iteratively , with the boundary condition sfr(15)=0 . \n details of the numerical procedure required to ensure convergence to the maximum likelihood sfr(t ) can be found in our paper i , where the method is tested extensively using synthetic hr diagrams . \n the main advantages of our method over other maximum likelihood schemes are the totally non parametric approach the variational calculus treatment allows , and the efficient computational procedure , where no time consuming repeated comparisons between synthetic and observational cmd are necessary , as the optimal @xmath0 is solved for directly . \n the lower main sequence region of the cmd diagram is totally degenerate with age , and contains the lower brightness stars , where the errors are larger . \n we have seen from using synthetic hr diagrams that excluding this region produces a faster and more accurate convergence of the method , and have in analyzing real galaxies excluded stars of magnitudes fainter than @xmath28 . \n this last cut together with the fact that our isochrones only extend out to the tip of the red giant branch ( to go further would necessitate combining results from different physical models , which we preferred not to do ) leaves us with a mass range which actually varies as a function of time . \n to include also the fraction of the @xmath0 outside this region , we apply a minor correction factor to the result of equation ( 4 ) , which accounts for the fraction of mass outside the sampled range , as a function of time , as given by the imf used . \n .age offset in gyr between simulated and recovered populations as a function of input age ( in gyr ) and metallicity ( in solar units ) , for a @xmath29 0.2 dex metallicity mismatch [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                  the reddenings used are refined iteratively after the fitting of isochrones to the ms region . \n note , however , that because the reddenings are small , and the reddenings are restored to the data afterwards , even if the initial guess for the reddening is wrong by a substantial amount , very little effect is seen in the final photometry . \n ( e.g. a change of the reddening by 0.1@xmath34 changes photometry by less than 0.005@xmath34 . )      as holtzman et al . \n ( 1995 ) point out , there remain some aspects of the photometric calibration of wfpc2 which are uncertain . \n for example , holtzman et al.(1995 ) note discrepancies of @xmath35 0.05 magnitudes between long and short exposures , which are not understood . \n several more minor systematic and random effects at the level of a few percent ( corresponding to a few hundredths of a magnitude ) are not well understood . \n furthermore , the conversion that has been made here to standard v and i colours , introduces more minor uncertainties . \n it must be noted that the systematic effects in zeropoints may be as large as 0.1 magnitudes . \n any such uncertainties appear as an offset primarily in adopted distance modulus , and would affect most cmds in the same way . \n differentially , any effects should be minimal .", "StartTimeOffset": 1162911552008, "RequestID": "bed4057d0d6d4fd09268406bebe3d160",

{"ContextTokens": 3191, "GeneratedTokens": 260, "SynthesizedBody": "asteroid dynamical families are groups of asteroids in orbital element space ( gradie , chapman & williams 1979 , gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 , valsecchi _ et al . \n this clustering was first discovered by hirayama ( 1918 , for a review see binzel 1993 ) , who also proposed that families may be the remnants of parent bodies that broke into fragments . \n about half of all known asteroids are believed to belong to families ; recent work ( zappal _ et al . \n _ 1995 , hereafter z95 ) , applying a hierarchical clustering method to a sample of 12,487 asteroids , finds over 30 families . \n the contrast between families and the background is especially strong in the space spanned by the so - called _ proper _ orbital elements . \n these elements are nearly invariants of motion and are thus well suited for discovering objects with common dynamical history ( valsecchi _ et al . \n _ 1989 , milani & kneevi 1992 , hereafter mk92 ) . \n the current asteroid motion is described by _ osculating _ \n orbital elements which vary with time due to perturbations caused by planets , and are less suitable for studying dynamical families . \n asteroid clustering is much weaker in the space spanned by directly observed osculating elements than in the space spanned by derived proper elements . \n figure 1 compares the osculating ( top panel , bowell 2001 ) and proper ( bottom panel , mk92 ) orbital inclination vs. orbital eccentricity distributions of 1,720 asteroids from the outer region of the main asteroid belt ( proper semi - major axis larger than 2.84 au ) . \n this region contains all three major asteroid families : eos , koronis and themis , with approximate ( @xmath3 ) of ( 3.0 , 0.18 , 0.08 ) , ( 2.9 , 0.03 , 0.05 ) and ( 3.15,0.02 , 0.15 ) , respectively . here \n @xmath4 is proper semi - major axis , @xmath5 is the sine of the orbital inclination angle , and @xmath6 is eccentricity . \n the proper elements are derived from the osculating elements by an approximate perturbation method ( mk92 ) , and it is possible that the overdensities evident in the bottom panel are at least partially created by that algorithm ( valsecchi _ et al . \n _ 1989 , bendjoya 1993 ) . a firm proof that families are real therefore requires their confirmation by a method that is _ not _ based on dynamical considerations , for example , that dynamically selected groups have distinctive colors . while there is observational evidence that at least the most populous asteroid families have characteristic colors ( degewij , gradie & zellner 1978 , chapman 1989 ) , even the most recent studies of the colors of asteroid families include fewer than 50 objects per family ( florczak _ et al . \n _ 1998 , doressoundiram _ et al . \n _ 1998 , florczak _ et al . \n _ 1999 ) . the large number ( about 10,000 ) of color measurements for catalogued asteroids ( bowell 2001 ) recently made available by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york _ \n et al . _ 2000 ) allows a detailed investigation of this question . \n the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will cover one quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap and produce a smaller but much deeper multi - epoch survey in the southern galactic hemisphere ( stoughton _ et al . \n the survey sky coverage will result in photometric measurements ( smith _ et al . \n _ 2002 , hogg _ \n 2002 ) for about 50 million stars and a similar number of galaxies , and spectra for about 1 million galaxies and 100,000 quasars . \n although primarily designed for observations of extragalactic objects , the sdss is significantly contributing to studies of solar system objects , because asteroids in the imaging survey must be explicitly recognized to avoid contamination of the quasar samples selected for spectroscopic observations ( lupton _ et al . \n _ 2001 ) . the sdss will increase the number of asteroids with accurate five - color photometry ( fukugita _ et al . \n _ 1996 , gunn _ et al . \n _ 1998 ) by more than two orders of magnitude ( to about 100,000 ) , and to a limit more than five magnitudes fainter than previous multi - color surveys ( ivezi _ et al . \n _ 2001 , hereafter i01 ) . \n most of the asteroids observed by the sdss are new detections , because the sdss finds moving objects to a fainter limit ( @xmath7 ) than the completeness limit of currently available asteroid catalogs ( @xmath8 ) . \n however , sdss observations , which are obtained with a baseline of only 5 minutes ( lupton _ et al . \n _ 2001 , i01 ) , are insufficient to determine accurate orbits , and we consider only objects that have previously determined orbital parameters . \n the details of the matching procedure and a preliminary sample are described by juri _ \n _ 2002 ( hereafter j02 ) . \n here we extend their analysis to a significantly larger sample , and introduce a new method for visualizing the distribution of asteroids in a multi - dimensional space spanned by orbital parameters and colors . \n the currently available sdss moving object list ( ivezi _ et al . \n _ 2002 , hereafter sdssmoc ) includes over 58,000 observations ; 10,592 are detections of unique objects listed in the catalog of known asteroids ( bowell 2001 ) , and 2,010 detections are multiple observations of the same objects . for a subset of 6,612 objects from this list , \n the proper orbital elements are also available ( mk92 ) and are analyzed here . \n these samples are about an order of magnitude larger than used in previous studies of the colors of asteroids , and also benefit from the wide wavelength range spanned by sdss filters band extends to the near - infrared range and allows efficient recognition of vesta type asteroids ( binzel & xu 1995 ) . ] \n ( gunn _ et al . \n _ 1998 ) . \n sdss colors can distinguish asteroids of at least three different color types ( i01 , j02 ) . using four of the five sdss bands , \n we construct the color -

coded according to its position in this diagram ( note that these colors do not correspond directly to asteroid colors as would be seen by the human eye ) . as discussed by i01 , \n the asteroid distribution in this diagram is highly bimodal , with over 90% of objects found in one of the two clumps that are dominated by rocky s type asteroids ( @xmath12 ) , and carbonaceous c type asteroids ( @xmath13 ) . \n most of the remaining objects have @xmath14 color similar to s type asteroids , and distinctively blue @xmath9 colors . \n they are dominated by vesta type asteroids ( binzel & xu 1995 , j02 ) . \n figures 3 and 4 show two two - dimensional projections of the asteroid distribution in the space spanned by proper semi - major axis , eccentricity , and the sine of the orbital inclination angle , with the points color - coded as in figure 2 . \n the vertical bands where practically no asteroids are found ( at @xmath4 of 2.065 , 2.501 , 2.825 and 3.278 au ) are the 4:1 , 3:1 , 5:2 , and 2:1 mean motion resonances with jupiter ( the latter three are the kirkwood gaps ) . \n figure  5 is analogous to the bottom panel in figure  1 . \n a striking feature of figures 3 , 4 and 5 is the color homogeneity and distinctiveness displayed by asteroid families . \n each of the three major hirayama families , eos , koronis and themis , and also the vesta family at ( @xmath3 ) of ( 2.35 , 0.12 , 0.09 ) , has a characteristic color . \n this strong color segregation provides firm support for the reality of asteroid dynamical families . \n the correlation between the asteroid colors and their heliocentric distance has been recognized since the earliest development of asteroid taxonomies ( chapman , morrison & zellner 1975 , gradie & tedesco 1982 , zellner , tholen & tedesco 1985 , gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 ) . \n our analysis indicates that this mean correlation ( see e.g. figure 23 in i01 ) is mostly a reflection of the distinctive colors of asteroid families and their heliocentric distribution . \n when only orbital elements are considered , families often partially overlap each other ( z95 ) , and additional independent information is needed to improve their definitions . with such a massive , accurate and public database as that discussed here ( sdssmoc ) , it will be possible to improve the classification of asteroid families by simultaneously using both the orbital elements and colors . \n for example , the sdss colors show that the asteroids with ( @xmath15 ) about ( 2.65 , 0.20 ) are distinctively blue ( figure 3 ) , proving that they do not belong to the family with ( @xmath15 ) about ( 2.60 , 0.23 ) , but instead are a family in their own right . \n while this and several similar examples were already recognized as clusters in the orbital parameter space ( z95 ) , this work provides a dramatic independent confirmation . \n figures 3 , 4 and 5 suggest that the asteroid population is dominated by families : even objects that do not belong to the most populous families , and thus are interpreted as background in dynamical studies , seem to show color clustering . using the definitions of families based on dynamical analysis ( z95 ) , and aided by sdss colors , \n we estimate that at least 90% of asteroids are associated with families .    proper orbital elements ( mk92 ) are not available for asteroids with large semi - major axis and orbital inclination . \n in order to examine the color distribution for objects with large semi - major axis , such as trojan asteroids ( @xmath16 ) and for objects with large inclination , such as asteroids from the hungaria family ( @xmath17 ) , we use osculating orbital elements . \n figure 6 shows the distribution of all the 10,592 known asteroids observed by the sdss in the space spanned by osculating semi - major axis and the sine of the orbital inclination angle , with the points color - coded as in figure 2 . \n it is remarkable that various families can still be easily recognized due to sdss color information . \n this figure vividly demonstrates that the asteroid population is dominated by objects that belong to numerous asteroid families . \n we are grateful to e. bowell for making his astorb file publicly available , and to a. milani , z. kneevi and their collaborators for generating and distributing proper orbital elements . \n we thank princeton university for generous financial support of this research , and m. strauss and d. schneider for helpful comments . \n the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is a joint project of the university of chicago , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , the johns hopkins university , the max -

component _ polarization vector _ \n @xmath0 is assigned to each particle and characterises completely the polarization state of any lepton or photon . \n for the simulation of polarized media , a possibility to assign stokes vectors to physical volumes has to be provided in geant4 . \n this is handled by a new class , the so - called _ \n polarization manager_. it also allows the evaluation of stokes vectors in different frames of reference . \n the general procedure is very similar to the polarization extension to egs by flttmann @xcite . \n any interaction is described by a transfer matrix @xmath1 , which characterises the process completely . \n it usually depends on kinematic variables like energy and angle , but it can also depend on polarization states ( e.g. of the media ) . the final state polarization @xmath0 is determined via matrix multiplication with the incoming stokes vector @xmath2 , @xmath3 the components @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the incoming and outgoing intensities , respectively . in this framework \n the transfer matrix @xmath1 is of the form @xmath6 the matrix elements @xmath7 can be identified as ( unpolarized ) differential cross section ( @xmath8 ) , polarized differential cross section ( @xmath9 ) , polarization transfer ( @xmath10 ) , and ( de)polarization ( @xmath11 ) . in the flttmann extension the elements @xmath9 and @xmath11 have been neglected , thus concentrating on polarization transfer only . \n using the full matrix takes now all polarization effects into account . \n the structure is illustrated with a few examples in the following section . \n here , some preliminary results shall illustrate the field of application . \n the first process studied is compton scattering . \n this process possesses all basic features : a polarization dependent differential and total cross section , polarization transfer and depolarization effects . \n compton scattering is of great importance in polarimetry .    in figure \n [ fig : compton ] the angular distribution of the scattered photon is presented . for this simulation a 100% circularly polarized photon beam and a 100% \n longitudinally polarized iron foil is assumed% . ] . when flipping the electron spin from an anti - parallel configuration with respect to the photon spin ( blue ) to a parallel orientation ( red ) , the distribution changes drastically , and the total cross section decreases . for illustration , \n the case where both , target and beam , are unpolarized is also plotted ( black ) . \n a comparison with an analytic formula ( solid lines ) shows perfect agreement in all cases .    in a next step a more realistic simulation of target properties \n will be performed to study the effects of different polarized processes . \n the polarization transfer in a undulator based positron source has been investigated . since the target is unpolarized , the total cross section , \n i.e.  the interaction length , does not depend on the photon polarization . \n consequently it is sufficient to concentrate on the polarization transfer from incoming photons to outgoing positrons .    50 gev , undulator period @xmath122.4 mm and undulator strength parameter @xmath130.17 . \n the peak of the first harmonic ( dipole ) radiation is at 9.62 mev.,width=264 ]    the setup of the simulation consists of an incoming photon beam with the characteristic energy spectrum of a _ helical undulator _ , cf . \n fig.[fig : gammaenergy ] . as a first approximation \n , the polarization of the photon beam is assumed to be 100% . \n the degree of polarization of the positrons created in pair production depends also on the energies of the incoming photon and the outgoing positron . in general the degree of the positron polarization \n is increasing with the energy fraction of the created positron , see figure [ fig : posipol1 ] .    . \n each dot corresponds to a single answer of the transfer matrix . \n the mean degree of polarization is plotted as the ( blue ) profile histogram.,width=294 ]    a simple first check of the polarization routine is provided by assuming an equal mixture of left and right circularly polarized photons as incoming beam . in this case one expects to obtain an unpolarized positron beam . \n indeed , in figure [ fig : posipol2 ] this behaviour can be observed . \n now the polarization spectrum of the _ helical undulator _ as plotted in figure [ fig : gammapol ] will be included in the study . \n the simulation shows the marginal influence on the obtained degree of positron polarization . \n in particular , high energy positrons are nearly 100% polarized , see figure [ fig : posipol3 ] .        for a realistic simulation of a polarized positron source based on a _ helical undulator _ the effects of bremsstrahlung , multiple scattering , coulomb and screening correction have to be taken into account . in figure [ fig : posienergy ] \n the influence of these processes on the obtained positron energy spectrum is investigated . \n it is shown , that only a small fraction ( green ) of all produced positrons ( blue histogram ) will escape from the target . \n the energy spectrum of positrons that leave the target is shifted to lower values in comparison to their spectrum at the creation point ( red ) . \n consequently , the target acts as a filter for high energy positrons and the created positrons have suffered a substantial loss of energy . \n the effect of bremsstrahlung and multiple scattering on the degree of polarization of the produced positrons will be the subject of further investigations . \n in this report the current status of a project to implement polarization into the framework of geant4  has been presented . \n for this task the stokes formalism is employed , providing a systematic approach for a consistent treatment of polarized leptons and photons . \n some preliminary results demonstrate the applicability of this new extension to polarimetry ( compton scattering ) and polarization transfer studies ( positron source ) . \n these analyses represent the first steps toward a realistic target simulation of an undulator based positron source for the ilc . \n the authors are indebted to a.  stahl as the initiator of this project , and also like to thank t.  lohse for fruitful collaboration , and s.  riemann , p.  starovoitov and j.  suarez for helpful discussions . \n k.l . and a.s . \n are grateful for the assistance by k.  flttmann and j.  c.  liu concerning the egs polarization extension . \n r.d .  acknowledges support by the european community ( eurotev contract number rids  011899 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1212516115555, "RequestID": "aff6eb7c1edb43558a53f792a6521f85", "TotalTokens": 2611}
{"ContextTokens": 2804, "GeneratedTokens": 73, "SynthesizedBody": "axion like particles ( alps ) and hidden sector photons ( hsp ) belong to the family of weakly interacting sub - ev particles ( wisps ) , which can be probed by `` light shining through the wall '' ( lsw ) experiments , exploiting their weak coupling to ordinary photons . \n this allows an indirect proof of the otherwise hidden particles without relying on any cosmological assumptions . \n previous lsw experiments have been carried out with laser light at desy ( alps ) , cern ( osqar ) and fermilab ( gammev ) . \n the concept of an optical lsw experiment @xcite has been adapted to microwaves as shown in fig . \n [ fig : theexp ] . \n two identical microwave cavities with a diameter of 140 mm each are positioned in close vicinity to each other . \n one serves as emitting cavity and is excited on its resonant frequency with @xmath0 = 50 w of rf power at @xmath1 = 2.9565 ghz by an external microwave source . \n theory predicts that microwave photons from the emitting cavity can convert to hsps by kinetic mixing or to alps by the primakoff effect , penetrate the cavity walls and convert back to photons in the detection cavity @xcite . considering current exclusion limits , \n the probability for this process to happen is @xmath2 . \n if a small excitation of the detection cavity over the thermal noise level can be observed and if any direct electromagnetic ( em ) crosstalk can be excluded , this could indicate the existence of wisps . \n the detecting cavity is placed in a em shielding enclosure , together with a low noise amplifier ( lna ) and a vector signal analyzer ( vsa ) . \n the em shielding is a critical aspect of the experiment because it is not possible to distinguish between a signal originating from wisps and direct coupling between the cavities by em leakage . \n the nominal electric field strength inside the emitting cavity is 186 kv / m . \n the smallest detectable signal in a 12 h run corresponds to an electric field strength of 24 nv / m in the detection cavity . \n so the shielding must attenuate the em signal by at least 258 db . \n the cavity walls provide 110 db each , which was measured by a calibrated near field probe . \n the limiting factor is the contact resistance between the two half - shells . \n the additional em shielding box provides 90 db of attenuation . \n the overall screening attenuation thus is @xmath3 db , which is impossible to measure in its combined form , but which has been determined shell by shell . \n all analog and digital signals are transmitted by fibre optic transceivers , to ensure interference can not couple through the screening layer of coaxial cables . \n the vsa is remote controlled by a fibre optic ethernet link . to provide ac power within the shielding box , \n a lowpass feed - trough filter has been constructed for 50 hz mains , attenuating interference in the mhz region and above by @xmath4 90 db \n .    the resonant frequency of both cavities must stay close to the system frequency @xmath1 during the measurement run . \n we define half the 3  db bandwidth of the cavities ( 65  khz ) as the limit for the maximum amount of allowable drift . \n the emitting cavity dissipates 50  w of power by forced air cooling . \n it heats up and expands considerably . during a warm up period \n the drift of @xmath5  1  mhz is manually compensated by a tuning screw . \n after @xmath5  1 h , thermal equilibrium is reached , the cavity is stable and no further tuning adjustments are necessary . \n we monitor the reflected power from its coupling port continuously by a directional coupler and a detector diode , as long it is below a certain threshold , the cavity is considered to be on tune . \n the resonant frequency of the detecting cavity is monitored by observing a bump in its spectral noise power density . a low noise amplifier ( lna ) , based on a high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) is directly connected to the detecting cavity , it provides g = 44.7  db gain at @xmath6 = 32.4  k noise temperature . \n the noise temperature of the detection cavity is frequency dependent , its maximum is at resonance and equals the physical temperature of @xmath7 = 290  k. this can be observed as a significant peak over the noise floor of the amplifier , allowing us to determine the resonant frequency . \n the overall system noise temperature of the complete receiving chain , determined by friis formula is @xmath8 = 32.5  k.    since there is no energy loss associated with the wisp conversion process , the regenerated photons in the detecting cavity appear with the same energy as the photons in the emitting cavity . \n thus , the signal which is coupled out from the detecting cavity has the same frequency and bandwidth as the one which is generated on the emitting side . for this reason , \n data processing is a matter of detecting a sinusoidal signal of known frequency in the white background noise . \n the vsa records complex samples , representing a bandpass limited signal with up to 25 mhz span , centered at @xmath9 . \n the recorded data is evaluated by a python script , estimating the noise power spectrum . after applying a hanning window to reduce the effect of spectral leakage ( \n if the narrowband signal falls between two bins and no window is used , its amplitude can be reduced by up to 36 % @xcite ) , one fast fourier transform ( fft ) is calculated over the entire time trace , which can be up to several hundred millions of samples long . \n the `` fftw '' software library is used to implement the fft efficiently . \n r0.4        considering pure white noise as an input signal to the calculation , @xmath10 describes the 3 db bandwidth of one spectral bin . \n it depends on the length of the recorded time trace ( @xmath11 ) and the applied window function . \n the hanning window broadens the frequency response by a factor of @xmath12 . \n the average available noise power @xmath13 decreases proportionally with the length of the time trace @xmath11 . if a signal is observed , it will appear as a single line in the spectrum with constant power . \n the signal to noise ration should thus improve linearly with @xmath11 . \n for this to hold true , all oscillators must be synchronized and stay stable in frequency relative to each other within a tolerance given by @xmath14 . \n synchronization is achieved by a 10 mhz signal , which all instruments use as frequency reference . \n long - term frequency drifts in the order of few mhz can not be avoided during the @xmath15  h measurement time . \n however , with synchronization , they will affect all oscillators in the same way and cancel out in the measurement result . \n this way , each bin of the synchronized fft effectively corresponds to a lock - in amplifier , tuned to the bin s center frequency . to proof the setup is stable over 12 h , a test run has been conducted . for the evaluation \n , its time trace has been truncated to different lengths . in fig \n [ fig : signoise ] , the expected linear decrease of the average noise floor can be observed . \n a narrowband signal has been introduced by provoking electromagnetic leakage . \n once the signal emerges from the noise floor , it stays relatively constant in power . \n the signal peak never exceeded the width of two bins in the spectrum , which is the minimum dictated by the hanning window , showing that the frequency - locking with a relative accuracy in the @xmath16hz range has been achieved between all the involved oscillators . \n a 11.5 h measurement run for hsps has been carried out in march 2012 . no narrowband signal was detected and the data was interpreted as an exclusion result . \n details can be found in @xcite . \n we improved over the most sensitive exclusion limits from cosmic microwave background measurements , in the energy range of @xmath17ev .    for axion measurements , \n both cavities need to be placed in a strong magnetic field . \n thus modification of the setup was necessary and a smaller secondary shielding box has been constructed from non magnetic stainless steel . \n it contains the detecting cavity , the lna and a analog optical link with 4.5 ghz bandwidth . \n the optical fibre allows signal transmission from the secondary to the primary shielding box , containing the optical receiver and the vsa . \n the cavities were tuned to the tm@xmath18 mode , at 1.76 ghz , coupling well to axions @xcite . the hardware transfer function from the cavity port , through all cables , the lna , and \n the optical link has been carefully determined by a network analyzer to be 60.0 db at 2.95 ghz and 58.7 db at 1.76 ghz , allowing to normalize the measured noise spectra .    in june 2012 \n a magnet was available during a one week timeslot . \n the normal conducting dipole magnet is regularly used for material testing at cern and has a aperture of @xmath5  100  x  50  x  30  cm . \n it provides an average field strength of 0.51 t , which has been confirmed by a calibrated hall probe . \n we were able to record 3 measurement runs of 4 h , 4 h and 6 h length . \n the first run showed em leakage . \n a weak spot could be narrowed down with a near - field probe to the gasket between lid and flange of the enclosure and mitigated by copper mesh . \n no signal and only noise was observed in the second and third run ( see fig .  [ \n fig : exclsignal ] ) . \n the data of the second run was translated to an exclusion limit for axions and is shown in fig . \n [ fig : excldetail ] and fig . \n [ fig : excloverview ] as the red trace . in the third run , @xmath5 7 mm@xmath19 of cr@xmath20o@xmath21 crystals \n have been placed on the bottom of each cavity . \n one may speculate if cr@xmath20o@xmath21 interacts with axions because of its magneto - electric properties @xcite . \n however , despite a 2% reduction in q factor , no surprising effects were observed . \n although current exclusion limits could not be challenged , we gained experience on our measurement setup and successfully operated it within a magnet for the first time . this allows to utilize a stronger , superconducting magnet in a next step . \n we are planning to work together with an external partner , where a superconducting magnet with a wide enough aperture for our measurement setup is available . \n the projected sensitivity with this magnet ( 4.5 t ) and the current setup in a 8 h run is shown in fig . \n [ fig : excloverview ] as the blue trace . \n + the authors would like to thank r.  jones , e.  jensen and the be department management for encouragement and support . \n thanks to the organizers of the patras workshop for a very enjoyable and inspiring conference . \n supported by the wolfgang - gentner - programme of the bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ( bmbf ) . \n j.  jaeckel , a.  ringwald , _ \n `` a cavity experiment to search for hidden sector photons '' _ , physics b659 2008 g. heinzel et al . , `` _ _ spectrum and spectral density estimation by the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , including a comprehensive list of window functions and some new flat - top windows _ _ '' , max - planck - institut fr gravitationsphysik 02/2002", "StartTimeOffset": 1229349019231, "RequestID": "5c744f9e801c41a79cb4b4ed5fc592e6", "TotalTokens": 2877}

observations to determine the redshift of the burst and also potentially identify any emerging supernova . in addition , @xmath0 can also slew quickly to the gbm burst in order to observe the x - ray afterglow and obtain its light curve in x - ray wavelengths . \n based on @xmath0 observations about @xmath2 60% of grbs have optical counterparts  @xcite . \n these optical counterparts are detected by various observatories with r magnitudes ranging from 14 to 22 within few hours after the burst  @xcite . \n thus , it is reasonable to assume about 60% of the gbm detected grbs also have optical counterparts with similar brightness distribution . if we were able to cover the entire gbm ec within about 24 hours after the burst it is conceivable that we would be able to find optical afterglows of @xmath2150 grbs per year , which is more than the total number of burst @xmath0 detects per year .    due to the small energy range ( 15 - 150 kev ) of the @xmath0 burst alert telescope ( bat ) \n , @xmath0 measurements alone can not constrain the @xmath3 of all bat detected bursts  @xcite . in contrast , due to the wide energy range ( 8 kev - 40 mev ) of gbm , all grbs detected by gbm have fairly good @xmath3 measurements . hence \n , addition of possibly another @xmath2100 bursts per year with good @xmath5 and redshift measurements may allow us to explore the validity of various grb luminosity relations and to conduct detailed grb hubble diagram studies . \n we have investigated the feasibility of using a system to do coordinated monitoring of the bat field - of - view ( fov ) for prompt optical emission from grbs  @xcite . \n the study showed that with the current instrumentation , performing such a coordinated monitoring is not practical mainly due to the bat s very large fov . \n however , a similar coordinated observing campaign can be used to find the optical afterglow of gbm detected bursts . \n the gbm ec is much smaller than the bat fov and observers do not need to continuously monitor the field to detect the optical afterglow . \n this enables a given observatory to perform multiple observations inside the gbm ec and thereby increase the chance of a afterglow detection . \n the basic proposal is to design a system to facilitate scanning of the gbm ec for optical emission from grb afterglows . \n this observing program will be specially aimed at amateur astronomers around the world . \n proliferation of amateur telescopes with high quality ccd cameras has opened a new avenue to study optical emission from grbs . \n the basic objective of the system is to coordinate a significant number of ground based telescopes to scan different patches of the gbm ec in order to find the location of the optical afterglow . unlike the gcn system  @xcite which sends notices to large number of recipients , \n this system will send customized targeted messages to individual registered telescopes . \n these individual messages will be sent via email or socket connections and they will have one or more assigned pointing locations for each telescope . \n the target telescopes can be either robotic or non - robotic . \n the selection of various patches in the gbm ec will be done based on the number of available telescopes , individual telescopes physical location , field of view ( fov ) and sensitivity . \n it is also reasonable to assume that these telescopes can observe multiple patches of the gbm ec , which will increase the chances of detection significantly . \n some of the important impacts of the proposed project are :    1 . \n the project will significantly enhance the value of gbm as a grb discovery instrument . \n 2 .   potentially increase the number of burst with good timing , spectral and redshift measurements . \n the project will allow and attract the participation of amateur astronomers and their telescopes .            in order to investigate the feasibility of the project \n , we performed a monte carlo simulation to study the probability of detection of optical afterglows from @xmath1 gbm grbs . \n we assumed that gbm detects about 150 grbs with optical afterglows ( total rate is 250 per year ) per year distributed isotropically in the sky and throughout the year . \n we have distributed telescopes in such a way that they roughly trace the major cities in the world . \n then for each burst we tracked the path of the sun and selected a set of telescopes away from the sun and within few hours from the burst location to scan the gbm ec . \n we also calculated the illuminated fraction of the moon s disk ( @xmath6 ) at the time of each burst . \n the probability , @xmath7 , of finding a grb was estimated by @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the total number of independent attempts to observe , with probability of success , @xmath10 . in this case \n @xmath9 is equal to the product of number of available telescopes and number of patches each telescope can observe . \n we calculated the probability of success , i.e. , the probability of detecting a given burst afterglow per observation using the following equation . \n @xmath11 note that typically the one @xmath12 gbm ec is @xmath13 . \n we repeated this procedure for every simulated burst , while changing the total number of telescopes participating in the program , the fov of telescopes , and total number of patches a given telescope can cover . \n the results of our simulation are shown in figure  [ sim_results01 ] and figure  [ sim_results02 ] . \n for these particular simulations we have assumed that all the telescopes have the same fov and all telescopes can cover some constant number of patches in the gbm ec . \n furthermore , we assumed that these telescopes will be able to observe assigned sky patches within a few hours after the burst . \n hence , in the simulation we used only telescopes which are within a few hours ( @xmath2 6 hours ) of the burst location . \n the number of participating telescopes in the observing program was varied from 20 to 100 . \n figure  [ sim_results01 ] shows the number of localized bursts ( @xmath14 total number of bursts ) as a function of the fov of participating telescopes . \n here we have fixed the number of participating telescopes to 25 . \n various curves correspond to different number of patches that each telescopes can observe . \n figure  [ sim_results02 ] shows the number of localized bursts as a function of number of participating telescopes in the program assuming that each telescope can observe 20 patches . \n the six curves shown in the plot correspond to various field of views . according to the simulation , with 60 telescopes participating \n it is possible to detect about 40 grb optical afterglows per year using telescopes with fov of @xmath15 . \n this value is close to the value of a typical fov of an amateur telescope . \n it is also interesting to note that if we have about 10 telescopes participating with fov of @xmath16 , then it is possible to detect about 25 grb afterglows per year . in order to put these values into perspective we point out that thus far , no one has managed to observe optical afterglow of a grb based only on a gbm localization ( the gbm has been detecting grbs for more than three years ) . \n it is also worth noting that not all the gbm locations will have a statistical error of 3.3 degrees . about a third of the grbs \n will have a statistical error less than this value . \n about 10% will have error of 1 degree or less . \n in such cases the gbm ec radius will be less than 5 degrees and may be as small as 4 degrees . obviously , for those cases we have a much higher chance of detecting the afterglow .    a schematic block diagram of a potential software system is shown in the figure  [ diagram ] \n the system has two components : 1 ) a scheduling system that will assign various observing patches to participating telescopes , and 2 ) a online system that will let observers to upload their images and search for candidate transients . \n the algorithms in the scheduling system will check the gbm ec observability of each participating telescope and assign them to different parts of the gbm ec . in doing this \n the algorithm will consider individual telescopes fov , sensitivity and local weather conditions . \n in addition , it will also assign more than one patch for each astronomer . \n on average an amateur astronomer may receive about 40 notices per year . \n the exposure time for each patch depends on many factors such as aperture , seeing , type of ccd camera etc and typically may vary from 1 to 30 mins . \n the probability of success depends on the telescope configuration ( fov , sensitivity ) , local weather and sky conditions , and the number of patches observed . \n however , every amateur observer who submits an observation to the system will get credit for their effort by being a co - author of the subsequent gcn notice that results from a successful detection . \n the online system is envisioned to have a web interface where the participants can submit their observations . \n it will also have online tools that will compare the submitted observations with existing catalogs and search for the optical afterglow of the grb . \n if one of the observations has a positive detection then the system will initiate a follow up observation to establish whether the candidate source is fading . \n if the candidate is found to be fading ( telltale signature of a grb afterglow ) then the magnitudes of the two images will be determined and a gcn circular will be sent . \n we investigate the feasibility of implementing a system that will coordinate ground based telescopes ( both amateur and professional ) to scan the gbm ec in order to localize gbm bursts . \n unlike the gcn system , proposed system will send individual customized messages to telescopes to observe certain patches in the gbm ec . \n the scientific objective of the system is by localizing gbm detected burst , we will be able to increase the number of gbm bursts with mutil - wavelength followups potentially with redshifts measurements . \n these measurements are scientifically very important because there are hints that gbm bursts may represent significantly different burst population . based on our simulation \n , we can detect about 25 grb afterglows per year using just 10 telescopes with @xmath16 field - of - view . with more telescopes participating in the program \n , we should be able to detect many more afterglows and study a potentially interesting burst population that is currently inaccessible to the grb community .", "StartTimeOffset": 1246254390437, "RequestID": "6974e09b5937426e91d900c1f7a55374", "TotalTokens":

{"ContextTokens": 3018, "GeneratedTokens": 76, "SynthesizedBody": "there is no consensus regarding the generation of the magnetic field in neutron stars . \n the field could either be a fossil remnant from the progenitor star in the form of abrikosov fluxoids of the core proton super - conductor ( baym , pethick & pines 1969 , ruderman 1972 , bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) . \n or it could be generated after the formation of the neutron star in which case the currents would be entirely confined to the solid crust ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 ) . \n evidently , the nature of the evolution would depend very much on the internal field configuration . \n observations and statistical analyses of existing pulsar data , nevertheless , indicate that significant decay of magnetic field is achieved only if the neutron star is a member of an interacting binary ( bailes 1989 , bhattacharya 1991 , hartman et al . \n + the processes that are responsible for the field evolution in neutron stars in binaries are - a ) expulsion of the magnetic flux from the super - conducting core during the phase of propeller spin - down , b ) screening of the field by accreted matter and c ) rapid ohmic decay of the crustal field in an accretion - heated crust ( for a review see bhattacharya 2000 ) . \n diamagnetic screening of the field by accreted matter does not seem likely to have any long - term effect ( konar 1997 ) and we shall exclude it from the present discussion . \n the other models invoke ohmic decay of the current loops for a permanent decrease in the field strength . in either case \n , the effect of accretion is two - fold . \n the heating reduces the electrical conductivity and consequently the ohmic decay time - scale inducing a faster decay . at the same time \n the material movement , caused by the deposition of matter on top of the crust , pushes the original current carrying layers into deeper and denser regions where the higher conductivity slows the decay down . \n the mass of the crust of a neutron star changes very little with a change in the total mass ; accretion therefore implies assimilation of the original crust into the super - conducting core . \n when the original current carrying regions undergo such assimilation , further decay is stopped altogether . \n both the purely crustal model as well as the model assuming an expelled flux have been investigated by many authors ( see bhattacharya 2000 ) . the important difference between our work and that of the other investigators lies in our assumption of a _ flux freezing _ upon the assimilation of the original current carrying layers into the super -

induced field decay in accreting neutron stars * + ( konar & bhattacharya 1997 - kbi ) + 1 . in an accreting neutron star the field undergoes an initial rapid decay , followed by slow down and an eventual _ freezing_. + 2 . \n a positive correlation between the rate of accretion and the final field strength is observed , giving rise to higher final saturation field strengths for higher rates of accretion . \n * magnetic field and spin period *  we have investigated the nature of the final ` magnetic field - spin period ' combination . \n our results agree well with the observations and are summarised in table - i ( kbi , konar & bhattacharya 1999a - kbii ) . \n the nature of field evolution is similar for the model of spin - down induced flux expulsion ( konar & bhattacharya 1999b - kbiii ) . \n though there is one major difference as can be seen from fig.([f_lmxb ] ) . to produce millisecond pulsars in lmxbs for an expelled flux large values of impurities , in the prior - to - accretion original crust , are required . but this would result in extremely small surface fields in old isolated pulsars . \n this is in complete contrast to a purely crustal model and expectation from statistical analyses of pulsar data . \n the paradigm of field evolution that have emerged out of observations , statistical analyses and theoretical expectations have been summarized in fig . \n ( [ f_paradigm ] ) where the connection between the radio pulsars and their binary counterparts , namely the x - ray binaries is indicated . in table - ii we indicate the constraints on various physical parameters in the field evolution models placed by the requirement to match observed properties in a variety of systems ( kbii , kbiii ) . the parameters discussed here are - the density at which the initial crustal current distribution is located ( @xmath1 ) , the impurity strength in the crust ( @xmath2 ) , the duration of wind - accretion phase in different binary systems and the rate of accretion in the roche -

the present data can be made to fit scenarios with both a _ slow _ or an _ accelerated _ cooling . \n therefore , it is not clear which is the correct cooling behaviour of an isolated neutron star . \n accreting phase - the crustal temperature corresponding to a given rate of accretion has not been determined with any degree of certainty . also , the existing results are limited in their scope . \n post - accretion phase - no calculation exists for the thermal behaviour of this phase at all . \n * transport properties * - several factors affect the transport properties and hence both thermal and magnetic field evolution . \n prominent among them is the change in the * chemical composition * due to a ) accretion and b ) spin - down . \n recently it has been shown that the impurity content of the accreted crust for near - eddington accretion rates could be extremely large ( schatz et al . \n this , along with a temperature inversion near or beyond the neutron drip ( brown 1999 ) might modify the transport properties significantly . moreover \n the presence of dislocations , defects , non - spherical nuclei have so far not been taken into account in the calculation of transport properties . \n these are also expected to have an impact on the field evolution in isolated as well as binary pulsars . \n + * multi - polar structure * - all of our and similar investigations have been based on an assumption of a pure dipolar model for the magnetic field . \n though calculations for isolated neutron stars does not show any appreciable change in multi - polar structures ( mitra , konar & bhattacharya 1999 ) - the situation would change in presence of accretion or a very strong magnetic field ( geppert et al . \n 1999 ) due to the importance of the hall term requiring further investigation . + \n * the magnetar question * - amongst some of the more recent developments the magnetars pose a great challenge for the existing theories of field evolution since they require a very rapid field evolution in isolated neutron stars . though some work have already been done in this area ( heyl & kulkarni 1998 , geppert et al . \n 1999 ) -

plot of each individual resonant state that contributes in the @xmath41 decay . \n notice that being coefficients and the individual amplitudes complex quantities , interference effects will take place when all the pieces act together . \n the above described produces a quite stringent model and obtaining acceptable fits is usually a difficult task . to access the quality of each fit a fast monte carlo ( mc ) \n program was developed which produces dalitz plot event densities accounting for signal and background pdf s , including detector efficiency and resolution . comparing the mc density distribution generated using parameters extracted from a given fit with that for the data \n , it is produced a @xmath42 distribution . \n when comparing two possible models , the best discriminating power test requires ensembles of monte carlo `` experiments '' . in the @xmath2 discussion below \n we illustrate the technique . \n we have chosen to start the results sessions with the @xmath44 because of the extremely clear signal seen in the @xmath45 decay , figure [ fig2 ] . \n there are dozens of measurements listed in pdg@xcite for this state and they converge to a reasonably well defined mass , @xmath46 mev but the estimation for width is from 40 to 100 mev .    for the best e791 fit 5 resonant channels contributes significantly : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , plus a nr that contributed with a fraction of only @xmath52% . \n the fit have @xmath53 = 71.8/68 with a confidence level of 35% . \n the dominant contributions comes from @xmath49 , @xmath54% , and @xmath51 , 32.4@xmath557.9% from which they measure : @xmath56 mev / c@xmath57 mev / c@xmath58 and @xmath59 mev / c@xmath58 . \n there is no evidence of a third higher mass scalar state , @xmath60 . \n previous production experiments claim a large contribution of the @xmath61 channel by estimation a large value of the parameter @xmath62 @xcite@xcite . \n these results do not agree with the value measured by e791 that , in fact , finds that a simple breit - wigner [ e3 ] is sufficient to represent the data . from the small but clear preliminary signal bes collaboration measure @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 gev@xcite . in figure [ fig3 ] \n we compare various results and conclude that in charm decay the resonance @xmath65 presents a narrower signal . \n the 1999 the workshop on hadron spectroscopy @xcite devoted one entire session to the meson @xmath1 , `` what do we know about the @xmath66 ? '' . by that time e791 \n had not published their observation of the meson @xmath66 in the decay of @xmath67@xcite . \n today charm decay is viewed as a tool for studying the light spectroscopy .    in figure [ fig4 ] \n we show the projection of the e791 dalitz plot where a clear peak at low mass can be seen . \n the figure compares the best fit achieved with all possible well established resonances available at the time , @xmath68 ( fit 1 ) , to their solution including a low mass scalar state , @xmath69 ( fit 2 ) . \n they measured @xmath70 mev / c@xmath58 and @xmath71 mev / c@xmath58 and the inclusion of the state took them from an unacceptable solution of @xmath53 = 254/162 with a confidence level less than 10@xmath72 to a very good fit with @xmath73 = 138/162 and confidence level of 90% . in fit 1 \n the nr contribution is dominant with 38% and in fit 2 following the trend of charm decays it dropped to 7.8% whereas the @xmath74 dominates with 46% . \n e791 perform a series of alternative fits and tests to be sure that no other model would as well describe the data . \n studying the channel @xmath75 bes experiment observe a signal of the mesons @xmath66 and measure their parameters @xcite ; @xmath76 mev / c@xmath58 and @xmath77 mev / c@xmath58 . in figure [ fig5 ] \n we show their final fit and scans for the @xmath66 mass and width measurements . \n as a last result we consider the @xmath2 resonance observed in e791 cabibbo favored decay @xmath78 . despite the large statistics available in this channel , no previous experiment @xcite@xcite \n have been able to provide a convincing explanation for this decay . \n e687@xcite best model for their sample of almost 9000 events have @xmath79 = 87/29 . \n the solution have the nr contribution dominating with a fraction of 99% . \n large interference pattern is produced with all fractions summing 147% . \n in contrast to the @xmath66 where a clear bump is seen in the @xmath80 projection , no evidence for a missing piece in the low @xmath81 region can be easily observed ( figure [ fig6]b ) . \n on the other hand the very large statistics and small number of possible intermediate states provide strong evidence of the need for an extra low mass wide resonance contributing for the decay . \n the first approach tried by e791 @xcite was to include all established states ; @xmath82 plus a nr ( they have studied also the possibility of a non - flat nr contribution without success ) . in general the result \n agree with previous studies including the bad quality of the fit . at this point \n they measured mass and width of the scalar @xmath16 to be 1416@xmath5527 and 250 @xmath55 21 mev / c@xmath58 respectively , which agree with pdg values . \n next they include an additional scalar named `` @xmath2 '' for which they measure respectively mass and width of 797@xmath55 47 and 410@xmath55 97 mev / c@xmath58 . in the same fit \n the parameters relative to @xmath16 were measured to be 1459@xmath559 and 175@xmath5517 mev / c@xmath58 . \n this new model describes very well the data with a @xmath79 = 46/63 , confidence level of 95% . \n the contribution of the new state is dominant with 48@xmath55 12% of the total fraction and the nr contribution is of 13@xmath557 % . \n the sum of all fractions dropped from 134% in the fit without @xmath2 to 88% indicating a smaller degree of interferences . \n in the amplitude analysis described here one do not measure directly a breit - wigner phase , instead it is assumed and consistency tests have to be performed to verify if alternative models are able to represent the data . \n this was done for this analysis ; a toy - model ( consisting of a breit - wigner amplitude without a phase variation ) , a vector and a tensor alternative models were tried , none producing a satisfying solutions . when comparing two possible models @xmath83 and @xmath84 the best figure of merit to be used is given by the neyman - person@xcite lema : @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are the likelihood for a given set of events calculated with the parameters obtained from fits to the data with models @xmath83 and @xmath84 . \n ensembles of 1000 monte carlo `` experiments '' were generated with the parameters extracted from fits to the data for the two models @xmath83 and @xmath84 . \n for each of such experiments the quantity @xmath87 was calculated and plotted in figure [ fig7 ] , where the model with the scalar @xmath2 is compared with model without it ; with the toy - model @xmath2 or with the vectorial @xmath2 . \n the discriminating power of the exercise is obvious by the separation of the distributions . \n the value of @xmath87 for the data is signed by the triangle showing the clear preference of the data to the model of the scalar @xmath2 . \n in conclusion , charm decay is , as said by f.close and t@xmath4rnqvist , a new window for studying light mesons . \n we discussed some of its remarkable contributions . with the already available data sets and the richness of charm decays \n , we hope to see in the near future confirmations and better measurements for some of the resonances , like the @xmath2 \n .    99 frank e. close and nils a. t@xmath4rnqvist , scalar mesons above and below 1 gev , hep - ph/0204205 e791 collaboration , e.m . \n aitala _ et al . \n lett . * 86 * 765 ( 2001 ) . \n e791 collaboration , e.m . \n aitala _ et al . \n lett . * 86 * 770 ( 2001 ) . \n e791 collaboration , e.m . \n aitala _ et al . \n _ , hep - ex/0204018 . \n submitted to prl .", "StartTimeOffset": 1303282831637, "RequestID": "3de4054372434890b71f9ee90e8216d3", "TotalTokens": 3914}
{"ContextTokens": 3787, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "thales of miletus ( 6th century b.c . ) made the first observations of electricity by rubbing pieces of amber being biological in origin , thanks to macroscopic charge separation . \n spontaneous charge separation appears also with ferroelectric materials , where at the molecular level the positive charge center is shifted relative to the negative charge distribution . \n the perfect alignment of these individual electric dipoles gives rise to the ferroelectricity . \n thus , the ferroelectric state exhibits spontaneously a macroscopic electric dipole moment even in the absence of an external electric field . \n this occurs below a characteristic temperature , the curie temperature t@xmath0 , where the individual electric dipoles of the molecules get spontaneously aligned ; for comparison , to polarize a dielectric material to a similar value , one needs electric fields of the order mv / cm to gv / cm , and this distinguishes ferroelectricity . \n the consequence of the coherent single dipole alignment is the appearance of unpaired positive and negative bound charges on the two end - faces along the direction of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization @xmath1 . in the ideal case , a piece of ferroelectric material is equivalent to an empty capacitor of the same dimensions , each plate being charged with @xmath2 . \n assuming @xmath3 values by factor @xmath4 below those encountered often with crystals , the associated surface charge density ( @xmath5 ) can still be as much as @xmath6 charges/@xmath7 charges/@xmath8m@xmath9 . \n the maximum electric field strength inside matter is given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the dielectric constant of the medium . \n for example , for @xmath12=1 mc / m@xmath9 only , the associated electric field is of the order of @xmath13mv / cm . \n such electric fields exist only transiently , and , they can give rise even to the self - emission of energetic electrons ( @xmath14 kev electrons have been measured ( s. gundel et al . , 1989 ) ) ; depending on the actual conditions those electrons might ionize the surrounding , or , they can cause other related effects .    in this section , we present in short the main properties of ferroelectricity , \n a phenomenon which is also described in the text books , but we also refer to a few related articles , which can be read actually by non - specialists ( zioutas @xmath15 daskaloyannis , 1985 , gundel et al . , 1989 , riege , 1994 ) , or , modern theoretical ones ( resta , 1997 ) . \n it is worth remembering that ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism have at first sight many common properties . comparing both types of materials , the main difference comes from the ( at least practically ) non - existence of magnetic monopoles . \n the ubiquitous electric charges compensate the large polarization electric fields , and , they determine the transient ferroelectric behaviour during polarization change . \n thus , the ferroelectric state is completely described by its widely known static properties as well as its dynamical behaviour associated with a temperature change , or , applying externally pressure and/or electric pulses . \n in fact , every ferroelectric material is also piezoelectric and pyroelectric , but not _ vice versa_.    obviously , any change of the intrinsic spontaneous ferroelectric polarization ( @xmath16 is associated with a corresponding surface charge change ( @xmath17 ) . \n these bound polarization charges attract ( either from the surrounding or from the ferroelectric medium itself ) an equal number of charges , but opposite in sign , since no environment can stand those electric fields . in short , a ferroelectric in its static state \n consists of a polarized crystal or polycrystalline medium , and , quasi free screening surface charges , which partly migrate into the bulk of the ferroelectric . \n the time period needed , for this charge neutralization to be completed , defines the dynamical behaviour of ferroelectrics . in general , this transient time is much longer than the preceding switching time . \n depending on the applying electric field , temperature and the ferroelctric compound itself , transient times can be in the @xmath18sec to sec region . \n many ferroelectric properties during polarization change appear much more pronounced compared with those we know in the static case . \n for example , the dielectric constant takes enormous values around the phase transition temperature . \n in fact , a ferroelectric sample in its static state might remain unnoticed at first sight . \n it is only the change of its spontaneous polarization vector ( @xmath1 ) , which makes actually ferroelectricity visible . \n we mention here a few mostly encountered cases when working with such materials . \n * a ) *   let the temperature increase from the ferro- to the paraelectric state . during the phase transition , \n the intrinsic polarization disappears , and , one is left suddenly with the unpaired screening charges on each end - surface , which must be screened so to say , because of the associated strong electric fields . \n since those charges are quasi - free , the result will be : either a current flow through the bulk of the ferroelectric material with both charge polarities compensating each other , or , for sufficient high intrinsic resistance of the sample , those almost unbound charges will be removed from each end - surface by their own repulsive coulomb force ( i.e. self - emission ) .  * b ) *   in the opposite process , i.e. by lowering the temperature from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric state , the onset of the spontaneous polarization attracts screening charges from the surrounding , because usually those transient electric fields are far above the electrical breakdown limit of any material , including the ferroelectric sample itself , if one should consider this to happen in space .  * \n c ) *   reversal of the spontaneous polarization takes place , for example , by applying an external electric field ( @xmath19kv / cm is usually sufficient ) , being either alternating or pulsed . \n thus , during a hysteresis loop measurement two polarization reversals occur per cycle . in a complete reversal of the intrinsic spontaneous polarization , \n the new bound polarization charges on each end - face of the sample have the same polarity as the previous screening charges . \n this makes the associated transient electric fields even stronger than those appearing in the first two cases mentioned before . \n the result is finally a complete rearrangement of the old screening charges , giving rise to a more pronounced dynamical behaviour , depending on the conductivity of the sample and other factors . \n finally , we mention in short a few other known effects , which occur when changing the polarization vector by @xmath20 , or , much more enhanced during phase transition , which afterall can be of relevance for similar phenomena with the predicted _ biological _ ferroelectrics . \n these are : the flow of pyroelectric current through the sample , which occasionally takes the form of spikes ( barkhausen pulses ) , similarly to the self - emission of energetic electrons , or , bursts of microwave radiation ( caspers , riege @xmath15 zioutas , 1988 ) . \n we also like to mention here the antiferroelectric state , which is possibly of not minor importance . \n this is a peculiar polarized state , since it consists of quasi infinite many 180@xmath21 domains of opposite alignment each , which does not require screening charges . \n however , the transition ferroelectric@xmath22antiferroelectric gives also rise to a similar dynamical behaviour as for the mentioned paraelectric@xmath22ferroelectric phase transition . \n we like to focus now on a very specific family of hydrated ferroelectric crystals , with the widely investigated potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate ( k@xmath23fe(cn)@xmath243h@xmath25o ) , in short kfct ( helwig , klpperpieper , @xmath15 mser , 1978 ) , taken to be a representative case . \n we think that this type of ferroelectricity might serve as a model configuration in biology , with emphasis given to the microtubules , which no doubt play a fundamental rle in cell s functioning . \n in fact , these subcellular constituents have attracted the recent years the particular interest of biophysicists . \n microtubules have been predicted to posses oriented dipoles , assuming ferroelectric phase , which appears to be optimal for microtubule signaling and assembly / disassembly ( sataric et al . , 1993 , tuszynski et al . , 1995 ) . \n such processes are obviously of basic importance . in the light of previous work ( mavromatos and nanopoulos 1997,1998 ) , relating the ferroelectric properties to the appearance of mesoscopic quantum - coherent states in internal regions of the microtubule cylinders , playing the rle of ( thermally isolated ) electromagnetic cavities \n , ferroelectricity may also be important for quantum mechanical aspects of microtubular arrangements in the cell . \n specifically , it was suggested in [ mavromatos and nanopoulos 1998 ] that ferroelectricity in the dimer medium , strengthens isolation of the ` cavity regions ' , thereby leading to a larger probability for the coherent states to form and live long enough , so as to transport information and energy across the microtubular arrangement . \n the rle of the surrounding water molecules for the ferroelectricity in the dimer medium was emphasized .    in this latter respect \n we now mention that the interesting property of kfct is the origin of its ferroelectricty . \n in fact , the alignment of the water molecules by the surrounding crystalline structure ( @xmath26 ) causes the measured macroscopic spontaneous polarization @xmath27mc / m@xmath9 , which is compatible with the known microscopic water dipole configuration in kfct ( helwig , klpperpieper , @xmath15 mser , 1978 ) . to be more specific , \n the onset of ferroelectric behaviour is connected with the ordering of the hydrogen - bonded water - molecules ( taylor , mller , hitterman , 1970 ) . \n thus , one is tempting to conclude from this particular ferroelectric crystal that a similar mechanism might be at work with the microtubules . \n indeed , a typical microtubular arrangement consists of a quasi solid cylinder of tubulin dimers , which are arranged in 13 arrays ( protofilaments ) . \n the interior of the microtubules , of cross - section diameter @xmath28 , is filled with water molecules , being ubiquitous in biology . \n the dimers ( of extent @xmath29 in the direction of the protofilament axis ) are believed to have unpaired ( mobile ) electric charges , which lead to electric dipole moments ( sataric _ et al . \n _ , 1993 , tuszynski _ et al . \n _ , 1995 ) . \n in ( mavromatos and nanopoulos , 1997 , 1998 ) it was further conjectured that there are thin layers in the interior of the cylinders , of a thickness ranging up to few atomic scales ( angstrms ) , fairly isolated from their environment , which operate as cavities sustaining mesoscopic quantum coherent modes . in this scenario , \n the importance of the water molecules lies in the provision of the necessary coupling with the quantized elecgromagnetic radiation in the cavity , via their electric dipole moments , so that : ( i ) coherent modes appear in the interior of the cavity ( dipole quanta ) ( del giudice _ et al \n . _ 1988 ) , and ( ii ) a coupling exists between these coherent modes and the dimer dipole quantum oscillation modes ( mavromatos , nanopoulos , 1997 ) . \n the latter leads to coherent solitonic modes along the protofilament dimer chains , which have been argued to be responsible for dissipationless energy transfer across the microtubule .    in view of the existence of the afore - mentioned hydrated ferroelectric compounds \n , we may now conjecture that such configurations favour an alignment of the water molecules ( actually , not necessarily only those inside the tube ) . \n then , the sofar speculated polar properties of microtubules , and their connection to quantum physics , might exist in reality . \n because of the importance of such a ferroelectric property for these subcellular constituents , the next step is to establish or exclude it experimentally . a suggested sensitive experimental method to confirm the predicted ferroelectric behaviour of microtubules is via the four probe ac impedance spectroscopy ( z(@xmath30 ) ) \n . this technique is based on the measuremnt of the ac voltage to current ratio using 4-electrodes ( figure 1a ) in a quite broad frequency interval ( the so called _ frequency domain technique _ ( figure 1b ) ) . \n the experimental set up for the ac impedance measurement of the microtubules in liquid suspension is shown in figure 2 . \n this method has been recognised already as a valuable tool in the study of similar electrochemical systems ( macdonald , 1987 ) . \n there are practical advantages of this technique compared to the more simple and old one working in the so called _ time domain _ , which applies either pulse or step source signals ( macdonald , 1987 , bottelberghs , 1978 ) . \n in fact , the expected ferroelectric contribution of the suspended microtubules to the measured impedance z(@xmath30 ) can only be observed in the higher frequency domain ( s. figure 1b ) . \n otherwise , low frequency electrochemical phenomena , being certainly present in such a liquid suspension of microtubules , complicate the whole measuring procedure , which will suppress the appearance of a ferroelectric component inside the sample .    in practice , \n working with a suspension of microtubules additional experimental modifications might well become necessary . \n thus , in addition to a conventional dc polarization for the z(@xmath30 ) measurement one can also apply a pseudo - dc polarization , in order to avoid quasi - static complex electrochemical phenomena due to the electrode s polarization coming from slow and heavy ion transport inside the sample . \n the onset of ferroelectricity can be identified due to a resonance - like response in the phase and the amplitude diagram of the impedance ( s. figure 1b ) . \n we thank j. albers for discussions and for providing us with information on hydrated ferroelectrics . this work is based on presentations by n.e.m . and k. z. at the workshop ` biophysics of the cytoskeleton ' , banff , alberta , canada , august 18 -

{"ContextTokens": 3715, "GeneratedTokens": 108, "SynthesizedBody": "during the last years , many scientists have scrutinized the world around us looking for regularities . \n one of the most recent findings is the fact that many real systems can be cast into a common topological structure , called complex networks @xcite . \n examples include biological @xcite social @xcite and technological @xcite systems that exhibit similar patterns of interconnections @xcite . \n they are characterized by the existence of key elements in the network which drastically reduce the average distance between all of them , the so - called small - world property @xcite . \n additionally , it turns out that for a large number of real - world systems , the probability that any given element ( node ) of the system interacts with ( is linked to ) @xmath0 other components , follows a power - law @xmath1 , with and exponent @xmath2 usually estimated between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n these networks have been termed scale - free ( sf ) networks . \n the above property was soon shown to be at the root of distinct behaviours when several dynamical processes are placed on top of sf networks . \n these are the cases of percolation and epidemic spreading processes , intensively studied during the last years due to their practical relevance in different applications and the availability of analytical treatments @xcite . \n the peculiar topological properties of the underlying network for these two processes lead to the absence of any percolation or spreading threshold in the thermodynamic limit , a previously well - established result for regular and random graphs . \n it is then natural to ask whether or not and to what extent the topology of complex networks influences the behaviour of other dynamical processes . in particular , for biological and other applications , it would be relevant to consider the nodes of a given network as nonlinear dynamical systems . \n the behaviour of an isolated generic dynamical system in the long - term limit can be described by stable fixed points , limit cycles or chaotic attractors @xcite . \n however , we have learned in recent years that when many of such dynamical systems are coupled together , the details matter . in this way , the study of networks with both dynamical and structural complexity might shed light on a number of relevant open problems where nonlinearity and spatial complexity coexist . \n dynamical complexity may manifest itself through self - organization , synchronization , the emergence of order , etc .    in this paper , we study the emergence of collective phase synchronization @xcite in scale - free networks and in simple topological configurations such as triangles , squares and pentagons with a variable number of internal connections , called network motifs . to this end , we study the model proposed by kuramoto several years ago and show how a large number of the system s constituents forms a common dynamical pattern , despite the intrinsic differences in their individual dynamics . on a theoretical level , we point out that the fitness for synchronization of network motifs correlates well with their conservation in the evolution of protein motifs @xcite , which might hint at new connections between graph theory , dynamics on networks and biological systems . \n in order to study how topology influences collective dynamics , we assume that each network s component is an oscillator and that each interacts with the others following the kuramoto model @xcite . \n this choice is due to the remarkable prestige achieved by synchronization as a cooperative phenomenon within nonlinear science and to the seniority , elegance and universality of this model . \n specifically , each node @xmath5 is considered to be a planar rotor characterized by an angular phase , @xmath6 , and a natural frequency @xmath7 . \n linked nodes interact with a coupling strength @xmath8 according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of neighbors of the rotor @xmath5 as given by the actual architecture of the underlying graph . for the present work , \n the natural frequencies and the initial values of @xmath6 have been randomly drawn from a uniform distribution @xmath11 with mean @xmath12 in the interval @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . \n synchronization occurs when @xmath8 exceeds a critical value , at which clusters of frequency - locked oscillators appear . \n this state represents the emergence of cooperation between network s constituents . \n the original kuramoto model corresponds to the simplest case of globally coupled ( all - to - all ) , equally weighted oscillators where the coupling strength @xmath15 to ensure that the model is well behaved in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . for this model and without any interaction , @xmath16 , \n the oscillators follow their own dynamics as determined by their natural frequencies and thus the system is unable to synchronize . \n however , as @xmath17 increases the population of rotors becomes more coherent and few oscillators form a small cluster of ordered ( synchronized ) states . \n if @xmath17 is further increased , the synchronized pack tends to recruit more and more oscillators and eventually the system settles into a unique and totally synchronous state . \n the onset of synchronization occurs at a critical value of the coupling strength , @xmath18 . \n the second - order phase transition is characterized by the order parameter @xmath19 which behaves when both @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 for @xmath23 being @xmath24 .    in order to study the dynamics of the model on top of complex heterogeneous networks , we first generated sf nets using the ba procedure @xcite . in this model , starting from a set of @xmath25 nodes , one preferentially attaches each time step a newly introduced node to @xmath26 older ones . \n the procedure is repeated @xmath27 times and a network made up of @xmath28 nodes with a power law degree distribution @xmath1 with @xmath29 and average connectivity @xmath30 builds up . \n this network is a clear example of a highly heterogenous network in that the degree distribution has unbounded fluctuations when @xmath20 . \n we have performed extensive simulations of the model @xcite through numerical integration of the equations of motion eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) . in the case of random sf networks \n the global dynamics of the system is qualitatively the same as for the original kuramoto model . \n the phase diagram of the system is shown in fig .  [ figure1 ] for a network of @xmath31 nodes and several values of the average connectivity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the order parameter as given by eq.([eq2 ] ) . \n starting from small values of the coupling strength , the interactions do not overcome the tendency of each rotor to oscillate according to its individual dynamics . in this state , \n the behaviour of the system is completely incoherent and no synchronization is achieved . \n this picture persists until a certain critical value @xmath34 is crossed . at this point \n some elements lock their phase and a cluster of synchronized nodes comes up . \n this constitutes the onset of synchronization . beyond this value \n , there are several groups or clusters within which the nodes are either synchronized and locked in phase or still governed by their intrinsic dynamics and thus in an asynchronous state . \n the first groups add to @xmath33 and it departs from zero as @xmath8 is increased beyond @xmath34 . \n finally , after further increasing the value of @xmath8 , more and more nodes cluster around the mean phase and the system eventually settles into a completely synchronized state where @xmath35 .    on the other hand , fig . \n [ figure1 ] also provides evidence that the critical point at which synchronization is attained in these sf networks is not zero @xcite . \n this is more clearly appreciated if one eliminates the dependency observed in the figure of the parameter @xmath33 on the average connectivity of the network @xmath36 . \n if in eq.([eq1 ] ) the term @xmath8 is substituted by @xmath37 , the @xmath36-dependency is avoided and all curves in fig . \n [ figure1 ] collapse into a single one , showing a critical coupling strength @xmath38 signaling that even for large values of the average connectivity , @xmath34 is not equal to zero . \n additionally , finite - size scaling analysis @xcite shows that the transition remains of the second - order type as for the case of fully connected networks . \n let s now turn our attention to small geometrical structures known as motifs @xcite instead of looking at the whole network . \n these structures can be defined as graph components which are observed in a given network more frequently than in a completely random graph with identical @xmath39 . triangles and rectangular loops are among these graph components , also known as cycles . \n they are important because they express the degree of redundancy and multiplicity of paths among nodes in the topology of the network and reveal the existence of hierarchical levels . \n hence , the extension of the study of synchronization phenomena to motifs is also relevant . \n we have computed for all motifs up to @xmath40 nodes the probability , @xmath41 , that synchronization occurs . \n this probability is an increasing function of @xmath8 , and is calculated for each @xmath8 by randomly drawing the values of the natural frequencies @xmath7 from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath13 . \n starting from @xmath42 , one averages , for every @xmath8 , over many realizations of @xmath7 and computes the relative number of simulations where synchronization is accomplished , @xmath41 . \n we define @xmath43 , which varies from motif to motif , as the value of @xmath8 beyond which @xmath44 . \n the lower @xmath43 is for a motif , the better it synchronizes . in fig.[figure2 ] , we have represented @xmath41 as a function of @xmath8 for several motifs . \n the simplest case of the dimer ( @xmath45 in the table ) can be deduced analytically . using the same notation as in eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) , here we have :    @xmath46    to solve these equations , we introduce the new variables ,    @xmath47    thus , @xmath48 is the phase difference between the rotors , @xmath49 is the difference in the natural frequencies and @xmath50 is a dimensionless constant equal to twice the ratio @xmath51 . from eq.([eq3 ] ) we obtain ,    @xmath52    the integration of eq . \n ( [ eq7 ] ) leads to three solutions depending on the value of @xmath50 . \n the three distinct results of the integral in eq . \n ( [ eq7 ] ) indicate a different functional behaviour of the system when @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and when @xmath55 . \n in fact , @xmath54 is the critical point . in consequence , from the definition of @xmath50 in eq . \n ( [ eq5 ] ) , the critical coupling of this system corresponds to    @xmath56    recalling that the @xmath57s are drawn from a uniform probability distribution in the interval @xmath13 with a mean equal to zero , i.e. , @xmath58 , we have that the synchronization condition reduces to @xmath59 . \n the probability @xmath41 is then equal to @xmath60 , for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 . \n thus , for the dimer we have @xmath64 . for the other motifs , @xmath41 \n has been calculated numerically by means of a @xmath65-order runge - kutta method . \n the results are summarized in fig.[figure2 ] for several motifs ( see also table  [ table1 ] below ) .    from fig . \n [ figure2 ] , one realizes that for a fixed motif s size , the way in which connections are established determines the synchronization threshold of that motif configuration . \n for instance , configurations @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 correspond to motifs made up of four oscillators with a variable number of connections among them . however , their @xmath43 are quite different . \n this indicates that the details of the local and internal connections matter . in particular , we observe that the higher the interconnection between motif s constituents , the lower @xmath43 . \n we now show how the present study may provide useful hints to a better understanding of several experimental observations in biological systems . \n recent advances in network analysis and modeling have provided a promising approach to understanding basic biological organization @xcite . in this \n context , quantitative evidence has been recently reported @xcite that in _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ , the proteins organized in definite cohesive patterns of interaction , and these patterns themselves , are conserved in the evolution across species in a substantially higher degree than those that do not participate in such specific motifs . \n a second finding @xcite is that the conservation of proteins in distinct topological motifs correlates with their interconnectedness . \n these observations take place in the context of activities occurring within a living cell and which no doubt , are of extreme complexity . \n non - linear dynamics prevails at this level of organization , where units that interact according to simple rules can generate unexpected complex patterns @xcite . on a theoretical level \n , one may hypothesize that the observed persistence across evolution is due to some mechanism aimed at optimizing the cooperation between neighboring nodes \n . a first approach would then be to see if the same structures favor the synchronization as a cooperative phenomenon . \n table 1 summarizes the results found in @xcite and the values of @xmath43 for the kuramoto s model in the same motifs . \n it is surprising the existence of a possible correlation between conservation and fitness for synchronization of network motifs . \n namely , the lower @xmath43 , the higher the natural conservation rate . from table  [ table1 ] , one observes that : @xmath69 @xmath70 , for the chain - like motifs ; @xmath71 @xmath72 , for motifs ordered in increasing degree of complexity , i.e. , when one can go from the lower configuration @xmath73 to next one by adding a new link arbitrarily ; and @xmath74 @xmath75 , when interconnectedness between motif constituents increases . \n this may indicate that motifs displaying an improved fitness to develop cooperative activities are preserved across evolution with a higher probability . \n the results here obtained for topological motifs may be seen on a more general basis concerning the architecture of real biological and social networks . \n it is known that for most of these networks , the probability of finding cycles ( motifs ) in their structure is higher than that expected from a completely random graph with the same connectivity distribution . for social and biological networks , friendship or business relationships and natural selection \n seem to be at the origin of such cycles . from this perspective \n , one may assume that these networks have been shaped during their evolution by some kind of optimization mechanism that improves on a local level their ability to develop cooperation . \n if a new link is created and afterwards it reveals as not beneficial , then it is removed at later times .    in summary \n , we have studied the synchronization of kuramoto s phase coupled oscillators for the cases of scale - free networks and motifs . the results obtained indicate that the architecture of random sf networks allows synchronization at a small value of the coupling strength @xmath8 . \n additionally , motifs with high interconnectedness show the lower synchronization thresholds . moreover , the results presented here for the kuramoto s model hold for other non - linear dynamical systems , including chaotic oscillators @xcite . \n our results then lead to a twofold conclusion . on one hand \n , they suggest that non - linear mechanisms may be key ingredients for the understanding of the evolution of networks at a local scale . on the other hand , \n as recently unraveled for protein and other biological networks , the real topology of the systems under analysis is worth taking into account @xcite . \n finally , we point out that the kind of models studied here together with the spatial complexity of the underlying net is relevant for cell biology . \n a recent example can be found in the discovery that an ultradian clock ( oscillator ) shapes genome expression in the yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1331892688768, "RequestID": "30462fb8b54044978fff40afe8ba06d2", "TotalTokens": 3823}
{"ContextTokens": 3668, "GeneratedTokens": 188, "SynthesizedBody": "the kinematics of the large amplitude , oxygen - rich agb variables known as o - miras have long been known to give valuable clues to the ages and evolution of agb stars as well as being important for galactic structure studies ( e.g. feast 1963 ; feast & whitelock 2000 ) . \n until recently the galactic carbon - rich miras ( c - miras ) have been much less intensively studied . \n the present paper summarizes the results of a kinematic and photometric study of galactic c - miras leading to a determination of their absolute magnitudes and ages . \n it then goes on to discuss what c- and o - miras tell us about galactic structure and composition . \n the paper is based on three recently published papers ( whitelock et al . \n 2006 ; menzies , feast , & whitelock 2006 ; feast , whitelock , & menzies 2006 ) . \n it has been known for a long time that an optically selected sample of c - miras in the lmc shows a well defined @xmath0 - logp relation ( feast et al . \n it is now possible to extend this relation to longer periods using data for obscured c - miras ( whitelock et al . \n the relation which extends from about 160 to 1000 days has the form @xmath3 where the distance modulus of the lmc has been taken to be 18.50mag . \n the scatter about this relation is only 0.17mag . \n one aim of the present work was to derive the zero - point of this relation for galactic c - miras . \n multi - epoch jhkl observations were obtained of 239 c - rich variables allowing classification and period determination . \n mean bolometric magnitudes were obtained by combining these data with iras or msx observations ( details in whitelock et al . \n 2006 ) . combining these results with data in the literature and \n some new optical radial velocities we have available for analysis 177 c - miras with known bolometric magnitudes and radial velocities from optical or millimetre ( co ) observations ( details in menzies et al . \n 2006 ) . assuming a pl relation of the form given in eq . 1 \n , we found clear evidence of differential galactic rotation . \n the zero - point of this relation was then adjusted until , using a standard formulation of differential rotation , we recovered the oort constant @xmath4 derived from cepheid proper motions ( feast & whitelock 1997 ) . in this way we obtained a galactic zero - point of @xmath5 , not significantly different from that for lmc c - miras ( eq.1 ) . in the kinematic analysis \n , we used only stars within @xmath6 of the solar distance from the galactic centre . \n the data are not sufficient to allow us to derive an independent pl slope . \n cccccc group & period & @xmath7 & age & mass & n + & [ days ] & [ @xmath8 & [ gyr ] & @xmath9 & + all & 521 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & 149 + 1 & 373 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & 49 + 2 & 521 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & 50 + 3 & 655 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & 50 +    the residual velocities from differential rotation were then used to derive velocity dispersions . \n table 1 shows @xmath7 , the velocity dispersion radial from the galactic centre , for the whole sample and the sample divided by period , as well as the numbers ( n ) of stars involved . \n the ages and initial masses were derived using the relation between the kinematics and age of local dwarfs ( nordstrm et al . \n 2004 ) based on padova models ( girardi et al . \n there is some evidence of a trend of age with period , the longer period stars being younger . \n this is qualitatively similar to the trend of age with period shown by o - miras ( e.g. feast & whitelock 2000 ) . \n the results for the c - miras contrast with the younger ages and higher initial masses sometimes suggested for the bulk of c - miras . \n in recent years there has been a considerable amount of work based on the hypothesis that the relative frequency of carbon to oxygen rich ( m - type ) cool stars is a simple measure of the overall metallicity ( normally characterized by [ fe / h ] ) of the stellar system or part of the system in which they are found . \n the results of the last section allow one to test this in the limited case of the c- and o - miras and to extend the discussion to cool stars generally . \n ccc period & @xmath7 & n + @xmath22 $ ] & [ @xmath8 & + 175 & @xmath23 & 17 + 228 & @xmath24 & 24 + 272 & @xmath25 & 26 + 324 & @xmath26 & 40 + 383 & @xmath27 & 32 + 453 & @xmath28 & 15 +    table 2 shows the velocity dispersion radial from the galactic centre for local o - miras as a function of period . the data are derived from feast & whitelock ( 2000 ) and show the dependence of @xmath7 ( and hence age ) on period for these stars . \n a comparison of tables 1 and 2 shows that there appears to be no significant populations of c - miras with @xmath7 in the range 40 to @xmath29 whilst there are strong o - mira populations in this range . \n since age increases with @xmath7 , this implies that there are o - miras in an ( old ) age range where there is not a significant c - mira population . \n thus the ratio of c- to o - miras will depend on the age distribution of any population considered and not simply on [ fe / h ] . \n this result may be seen in a somewhat different way for miras in the solar neighbourhood . for an optically selected sample wood & cahn ( 1977 ) found that the ratio of the number of o - miras to c - miras was about 14 . however , in a local sample of dust enshrouded miras which is biased to longer period ( and hence younger ) stars this ratio is about unity ( olivier , whitelock , & marang 2001 ) . \n it is useful to consider in this connection the stellar population of the galactic bulge . \n with one possible exception , this contains no c - miras or any normal carbon stars . \n however , it does contain o - miras with a wide range of periods . \n these range up to 700 days in the sgri window ( glass et al . \n 1995 ) and to even longer periods near the centre ( wood , habing , & mcgregor 1998 ) . \n it has long been known that this implies a considerable age range in the bulge . \n the age range implied overlaps with that expected for c - miras ( table 1 ) . \n this suggests that the absence of c - miras from the bulge is not simply an age effect .    in fact , in the past it was usually assumed that the absence of carbon stars in general from the bulge was due to a high metal abundance . \n it is , however , now known that bulge k giants have a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath30 and m giants @xmath31 ( fullbright , mcwilliam , & rich 2005 ; rich & origlia 2005 ) . \n these values are close to the mean value for the local thin disc , [ fe / h ] = @xmath32 ( nordstrm et al . \n thus neither age nor metallicity can apparently explain the absence of carbon stars from the bulge . \n however , it has been know for some while ( glass et al . \n 1995 ) that the jhk colours of o - miras in the bulge differed from those in the lmc and this could be explained by a high oxygen abundance ( feast 1996 ) . \n recent work ( rich & origlia 2005 ) now shows that in bulge m giants oxygen is overabundant with respect to comparable local stars ( @xmath33 \\sim + 0.3 $ ] ) whilst several workers find @xmath34 \\leq 0 $ ] in relevant lmc populations . \n this suggests that oxygen abundance may be a controlling factor in the ratio of carbon to oxygen giants in stellar systems . \n the above does not rule out the possible dependence of the relative frequency of carbon stars on [ fe / h ] at a given [ o / fe ] . \n if that were the case we would expect that in a system with a spread in [ fe / h ] the carbon stars would evolve preferentially from the lower metallicity stars ( [ o / fe ] assumed constant ) . \n however , in the galactic disc the available work on carbon stars ( e.g. abia et al . \n 2001 ) suggests that their [ fe / h ] is near that of the mean of local disc stars and not skewed to lower abundances . but \n further work on this is desirable . \n two alternative interpretations of the kinematics of local disc stars are currently under discussion . \n nordstrm et al . \n ( 2004 ) found that the velocity dispersion of these stars increases steadily with age from 1 to 10 gyr ( see their fig 31 where their @xmath35 corresponds to the @xmath7 used in the present paper ) . on the other hand quillen & garnett(2000 , 2001 ) ( see also freeman & bland - hawthorn fig 5 where their @xmath36 corresponds to the @xmath7 of the present paper ) suggest that the velocity dispersion remains constant from 2 to 10 gyr at about @xmath37 and then jumps suddenly to about @xmath38 , the two regimes constituting the thin and thick discs . \n this latter interpretation apparently leaves no room for galactic components with @xmath7 in the range 35 to @xmath39 where , as table 2 shows there is a significant o - mira population . since o - miras are rare objects we expect them to be tracers of a large main sequence population . \n such a population is accounted for naturally in the nordstrm et al . \n interpretation of galactic kinematics . \n it is , however , difficult to see how it could be accommodated in the quillen and garnett model . \n \\1 . assuming the @xmath0 - period relation for galactic c - miras has the same slope as for those in the lmc , the zero - points in the two systems are the same within the uncertainties + 2 . \n galactic c - miras have ages of @xmath40 gyr and initial masses of @xmath2 . \n there is some evidence that the ages of c - miras decrease with increasing period . \n the ratio of c- to o - miras in a population depends on the age distribution of that population . \n the lack of carbon stars in the galactic bulge is connected to an oxygen overabundance . \n the galactic o - miras favour the interpretation of galactic kinematics of nordstrm et al . \n this paper is based on three papers mentioned in the text and i am grateful to my colleagues , patricia whitelock , john menzies , freddy marang and m.a.t . \n groenewegen for their contributions to this work . \n in particular , i am especially indebted to patricia whitelock and john menzies with whom the data were analysed and the conclusions formulated . \n abia , c. et al . \n 2001 , apj , 559 , 1117 feast , m. w. 1963 , mnras , 125 , 367 feast , m. w. 1996 , mnras , 278 , 11 feast , m. w. , glass , i. s. , whitelock , p. a. , & catchpole , r. m. 1989 , mnras , 241 , 375 feast , m. w. , & whitelock , p. a. 1997 , mnras , 291 , 683 feast , m. w. , & whitelock , p.a . \n 2000 , mnras , 317 , 460 feast , m. w. , whitelock , p. a. , & menzies , j. w. 2006 , mnras , 369 , 791 freeman , k. , & bland -

ir spectroscopic study with vlt / sinfoni ( eso program 078.d-0200 ) will clarify their nature . \n , @xmath7 being the standard deviation of the background surface density . \n this map demonstrates the existence of statistically significant concentrations of pms stars outside the main body of the association ngc  346 ( located at the center ) . \n such pms clusters are suspected to be the product of sequential star formation triggered by the action of the ob stars in ngc  346 , which shape the southern part , and a supernova , which affects the northern part of the region @xcite . \n [ fig - cmap ] ]      a spatial behavior similar to the pms population of lh  95/n  64 is seen in pms stars of the association ngc  346 in the smc @xcite , from observations with acs / wfc . \n ngc  346 is located in the brightest h  ii region of the smc , n  66 , and acs uncovered the richness of this region in pms stars @xcite , @xcite . \n the surface density map of the region of ngc  346/n  66 constructed from star counts of the pms stars in the observed field is shown in figure [ fig - cmap ] . \n apart from the association itself ( seen as the central large concentration ) there are at least five distinct concentrations of pms stars with surface stellar density  -2.truept  3@xmath7 above the background ( where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of the background density ) , which fit the description of `` pms clusters '' . \n the size of each cluster is defined by the isopleth corresponding to the local mean density around it , and the time - scale within which each pms cluster was presumably formed is defined by their individual cmds . \n although the loci of the pms stars in the cmd exhibit a broadening , which prevents an accurate estimation of their age , it was found that the pms clusters located away from ngc  346 to the north , represent the most recent star formation activity in the region @xcite .    , @xmath3 cmd of all stars detected with acs / wfc imaging in the area of ngc  346 ( 06 around its center ) . pms isochrone models by for ages 0.5 to 15  myr are overplotted to demonstrate that the observed broadening of the pms stars can be easily misinterpreted as an age - spread . \n simulations showed that this spread can be explained as the result of interstellar reddening of @xmath8  mag alone , or of two star formation events ( a true age - spread ) @xmath15  myr apart if the reddening is lower . \n typical photometric uncertainties in brightness and color are also shown @xcite . \n [ fig - pms ] ]      the loci of pms stars in the cmd often show a widening , which could be evidence for an age - spread @xcite . \n the low - mass population in subgroups within ob associations of the mw exhibits little evidence for significant age - spreads on time - scales  -2.truept  10  myr @xcite . \n although this time - scale is in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and cloud dissipation , age differences of the order of 10  myr may be very important for understanding of how sequential star formation proceeds . \n moreover , there are several factors apart from age - spread , such as variability and binarity , which can cause considerable deviations of the positions of the pms stars in the cmd @xcite . \n a broadening in the cmd is also observed for the pms stars of ngc  346/n  66 ( figure [ fig - pms ] ) . \n simulations showed that apart from photometric uncertainties , binarity and variability , reddening seems to play the most important role in the observed widening of the pms stars , providing false evidence for an age - spread if the region suffers from high extinction @xcite . \n young stellar systems , which host newborn pms stars , naturally provide the testbed for a comprehensive study of the stellar imf . \n a coherent sample of pms stars is found with _ hubble _ from acs imaging in the vicinity of another smc association , ngc  602 , located in the h  ii region n  90 @xcite . \n the region of ngc  602/n  90 includes no distinct subgroups , and therefore , being less complicated than ngc  346/n  66 , is more suitable for the investigation of the low - mass imf . for the construction , \n though , of this imf a mass - luminosity relation derived from evolutionary models can not be used due to the spread of the pms stars , also apparent in the cmd of ngc  602 . \n instead , counting the pms stars between evolutionary tracks , which represent specific mass ranges , seems to be the most accurate method for the construction of their mass spectrum ( figure [ fig - imf ] ) .    ] \n the coexistence of h  ii regions and pms stars in stellar associations of the mcs indicate that star formation may be still active in their vicinity . \n indeed , observations with the _ spitzer _ space telescope revealed objects classified as candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ) in such regions @xcite , @xcite , and _ hubble _ \n s contribution has been very important in disentangling their nature @xcite . \n the region of ngc  602/n  90 is also found with _ \n spitzer _ to host possible ysos , and the comparison of the loci of these ir - bright sources with the _ hubble _ images interestingly showed pms stars to be their optical counterparts @xcite . \n a variety of objects is discovered to coincide with these candidate ysos , such as single highly embedded sources , small compact pms clusters , as well as features similar to `` elephant trunks '' , all located at the periphery of ngc  602 , along the dust ridges of the molecular cloud presumably blown -

d - c ] we plot disequilibrium and lmc complexity versus time . \n 0.35     0.35 \n we have found that when a particle tunnels through a barrier in a dswp , the heisenberg product of uncertainties and information entropy form a periodic function , which take their minimum values when the particle is located in one well , and their maximum when the particle is in the middle of the penetration region . despite the absence of the tunneling effect in iswp case \n , heisenberg relation shows qualitatively the same behavior as in dswp case . on the other hand , information entropies , disequilibrium and lmc \n complexity show slight but crucial qualitative differences , formulating a criterion , whether the tunneling effect is present or not in a quantum - mechanical system . \n our results also verify the main differences between shannon and fisher information entropies . \n fisher s information reflects the localization characteristics of the tunneling effect more sensitively than the shannon information entropy , while the first one resembles to an exponential rise , and the latter to a logarithmical one . \n moreover , shannon s information entropy @xmath38 reflects the behavior of probability density in position space @xmath5 , while the fisher information the behavior of probability density in momentum space @xmath48 . \n this can be observed from the results in both dswp and iswp cases . in this sense , \n shannon information entropy is complementary to fisher information .    in conclusion \n , it is worth mentioning that generally dswp and ammonia molecule in particular , are of great interest in the field of quantum computation and information . \n recent experimental and theoretical research @xcite has shown that dswp can be used to make quantum logic gates for ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices , while the ammonia molecule provides a nice vibrational system , which can be a promising candidate for achieving molecular quantum computation . \n gadre , reviews of modern quantum chemistry , a celebration of the contributions of robert g. parr , vol . \n 1 , world scientific , singapore , 2002 , ch . information theoretical approaches to quantum chemistry , pp \n . 108147 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1397955242220, "RequestID": "0b6907c2386f41ce9c2c557ea91924cf", "TotalTokens": 3501}

band voltage shift can be tracked quasi - real - time for small changes in the flat - band shift by using a digital feedback loop that eliminates the need of tracing the whole c - v curve to estimate the value of the flat - band voltage shift . during write \n / erase pulses , the loop can be momentarily turned off . \n this method allows rapid monitoring of the changes in the flat - band voltage shift ( within few tens of msec ) after a write or erase pulse or during retention . \n dynamic c - v measurements have been performed on nc - mos capacitors , by measuring the c - v as a function of time near the flat - band voltage between applied pulses of varying voltage and durations . \n the discharge currents have been measured through time decay of flat - band voltage shift for three devices as shown in fig . \n [ dischargedensities ] . \n the measured @xmath0 is used to calculate the stored charge using eq . \n [ hysteresisvoltage ] and divided by the time duration between measurements to calculate the current . \n the discharge current is seen to increase with increasing flat - band voltage shift ( or stored charge ) . \n curves for different nanocrystal sizes show a cross - over behavior . \n this feature is a strong evidence for size related discharge of the nc - mos elements . \n smaller ncs decay faster due to higher quantization energy and reduced tunnel barrier at low charging ratios of @xmath37 . \n however , if the flat - band voltage shift is close to @xmath9 or @xmath38 , the quasi - fermi level increases rapidly as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ dosnc ] . \n as @xmath9 is proportional to nc density @xmath39 , smaller ncs have higher density and @xmath9 . at a given @xmath0 , stored charge per nc \n is larger for lower density ( large diameter ) ncs . \n therefore , they may have a larger quasi - fermi energy for large ncs than smaller ncs at a given @xmath0 . since carriers near the quasi - fermi level dominate the discharge , the discharge current increases rapidly when @xmath40 as is clearly seen in the data for the device with 7.4 nm diameter ncs , for which @xmath41 v. this is in accordance with the numerical solution shown in solid curves of fig.[dischargedensities ] . \n the cross - over behavior shows that nc size and density as well as total stored charge play an important role in determination of the charge decay rate . \n nanocrystal discharge currents have been measured as a function of erase pulse voltage . \n after nc - mos devices with nc diameters of 2.5 nm and 2.8 nm have been charged by 5 v write pulses to a flat - band voltage shift of 1.6 v , erase pulses of duration @xmath42 sec have been applied and flat - band voltage shift has been recorded . \n the discharge currents are shown in fig . \n [ discharge ] . \n the increased currents for smaller ncs quantitatively confirm the prediction of numerical calculation . \n the data of fig . \n [ discharge ] suggest that the discharge is indeed dominated by direct tunnelling . \n the decay of the charge stored in the ncs has also been recorded for the nc - mos capacitors with different nc diameters as a function of time . \n the decay of the flat - band voltage shift is fitted using numerically calculated discharge currents as seen in fig . \n [ retexample ] . as can be seen \n , the model predicts the decay of charge for both short and longer time scales . \n it is seen in the time domain also that smaller ncs decay faster than larger ncs . \n in conclusion , we have proposed a charge storage and retention model for nanocrystal mos memory devices and compared it with experimental results . \n the model envisions storage of carriers in quantized energy levels of ncs . \n the escape of carriers is modelled by direct tunnelling out of the ncs to the substrate . \n the model can be used to predict the effect of various design parameters such as nc size and density on retention time . \n the model also correctly predicts the super - exponential charge decay commonly observed in nc memory devices . for nc - mos capacitors containing ge ncs fabricated by the pecvd technique , nc size related quantum confinement \n is found to play a role in the retention of charges . \n this is an alternative model to surface trap related carrier storage . \n the model agrees well with the experimental results , and gives useful insight to nc -

{"ContextTokens": 2714, "GeneratedTokens": 162, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the motivations for establishing a computational grid is the ability to exploit unused computing cycles at remote facilities . in canada , there has been a significant injection of new funding for mid - size capability and capacity computational facilities . \n one of the conditions of the funding is that these facilities must make 20% of the resources available to outside users . \n a number of these facilities are associated with high energy physics ( hep ) centers or groups . \n however , the majority are facilities that are shared between many research fields . \n we would like to exploit these unused cycles for hep applications such as monte carlo simulations . \n this paper describes the grid canada testbed which consists of resources at both hep and non - hep sites . \n we demonstrate that hep simulations can be run without installing application - specific software at the remote site . \n we discuss the results of a series of tests we have run over the testbed and conclude with a discussion of our plans for the future . \n grid canada ( www.gridcanada.ca ) is an organization established by canarie inc . \n ( www.canarie.ca ) , who provide the national research and educational network in canada ; the c3.ca association ( www.c3.ca ) , which is an organization that represents the user community of high performance computing ( hpc ) facilities in canada ; and the national research council of canada ( nrc ) ( www.nrc.ca ) . \n the goal of grid canada ( gc ) is to foster collaboration on grid activities in canada . \n gc is responsible for the canadian certificate authority and has helped coordinate a number of demonstration activities such as the 1 tb high - speed file transfer project between the triumf laboratory in vancouver and cern @xcite and a grid test using a number of hpc ( shared memory machines ) computers across canada . \n in addition , gc has helped to establish the linux testbed that will be described in this paper . \n the gc linux testbed involves researchers at the university of victoria who are members of the babar and atlas collaborations . \n in addition , personnel at the nrc institute for information technology , canarie inc . and the british columbia ministry for management services have also made significant contributions to the testbed . \n the testbed currently includes 12 sites in canada ranging from a number of sites in british columbia to those 3000 km away in ontario . \n typically each site has between 1 and 8 computers . \n all sites are required to run globus 2.0 or 2.2 @xcite on their computers except for the victoria site which is described in the next paragraph . \n in addition , sites must also run an openafs client @xcite . \n latencies between the two most - distant sites vary between 50 and 100 milliseconds . \n the remote sites access the application - specific software and , for some tests , read the input and write the output data via afs . \n the victoria grid testbed is shown in fig  [ uvictb ] . \n it consists of two servers for afs and objectivity @xcite . a head node ( grid.phys.uvic.ca ) \n runs the globus software with a series of processing nodes ( grid1 , ... , grid6 ) hidden behind a firewall . \n jobs are distributed to the processing nodes using condor @xcite although pbs @xcite has been tested . \n the processing nodes have the ability to access the afs server through the firewall . \n access to the software via afs by many remote machines can cause significant degradation in the cpu utilization to the server and subsequently reduce the efficiency of the remote processing machines . \n afs has a faster , more efficient method of reading clones or read - only volumes . \n for example , if a volume is read - only , then the client only has to contact the afs server once to cache the volume . \n we tested afs performance using two clones and two replicated volumes on two separate machines . \n the afs server machine ( basilisk.phys.uvic.ca ) held the master and a cloned volume , with the objectivity server machine ( objy.phys.uvic.ca ) holding a replicated and a cloned volume . \n this configuration appeared to be sufficient for the size of the testbed so that no bottlenecks occurred as a result of the afs servers . \n initial tests of the atlas software using a local machine and a machine 1200 km distant showed that using a cloned volume increased the access to the software at the remote machine . \n real execution time at the remote machine dropped by about 40% whereas ( as expected ) no change was observed at the local machine . running simultaneous multiple jobs over the grid \n did not degrade the afs performance . we concluded that having cloned volumes significantly increased the afs performance . \n we plan to continue to monitor the afs performance as we continue to scale up the size of the gc testbed . \n jobs were submitted from victoria using simple scripts . \n no resource broker or portal was used however , we are examining the available tools ( such as gridport @xcite ) and plan to incorporate them into the testbed . \n monitoring of the gc testbed was done using the cacti package @xcite providing network traffic and cpu utilization . \n detailed descriptions of the victoria testbed can be found at http://grid.phys.uvic.ca . \n hep simulation applications begin by the generation of events which are collections of 4-vectors representing the trajectories of particles from an initial collision of two incident particles . \n the 4-vectors are then passed through a program that simulates the response of the experimental detector . \n the output is in a format that is usually identical to the format used to store the real collision data , but includes additional simulation information . \n after the detector simulation , the data is passed through an application that reconstructs the data into physical quantities such as tracks in the tracking chambers and energy in the calorimeters . \n it is now common practice to inject background events ( either real or simulated ) on top of the simulated physics events . \n we chose to examine the performance of the gc testbed using the simulations of the babar and atlas experiments . \n the main difference between the atlas and babar simulation applications is the manner in which they store their data . \n atlas uses conventional files in a zebra format developed at cern while babar uses the commercial objectivity database . in the following subsections \n we describe the results of running the babar and atlas simulations on the gc testbed . \n it is worth pointing out that neither the babar or the atlas simulation are optimized for operation over a wide - area grid .      the babar collaboration studies electron - positron collisions at the slac facility . \n in addition to collecting data from the experiment , the collaboration generates a significant amount of monte carlo simulated data in order to model the response of the detector and to help assess efficiencies and systematic errors in the physics studies . \n the simulation application is run in 3 phases for event generation , detector simulation and reconstruction . \n data is written to objectivity by the event generation application . \n the detector simulation reads the output of the event generation and writes output that is then used by the reconstruction . \n the reconstruction application writes out data that can be used for physics studies . \n the babar application accesses the database multiple times per event . \n the handshaking required between the database and application combined with the large latency resulted in relatively poor utilization of the remote processors . for example , we observed that cpu utilization was approximately 10% at sites 3000 km away from the objectivity server . \n a series of 1 day tests were run involving many of the gc testbed sites . \n a total of approximately 50,000 events were generated per test . \n the babar software was accessed from the afs server . \n the network traffic to the objectivity and afs servers is shown in figure  [ f1 ] . \n approximately 0.5 mb / s of data was constantly read and written to the database . \n afs traffic was generally only a few kb / s with a peak during the start of the application . \n our initial tests showed that one of the areas that had to be addressed was the issuing and releasing of database locks . \n for example , a remote application locks the entire federation during a creation of a container . \n if a remote machine lost network connectivity while a global database lock was present then this resulted in the entire testbed being halted as none of the sites would be able to write to the database . as a result we developed a series of monitoring and cleanup utilities that would eliminate any problems associated with the database locks . \n we consider the test a success in that we could run the babar application on non - hep resources . \n it is clear that the efficiency at the remote sites was low and we believe a number of modifications to the babar application could improve the throughput . however , given the plan by babar and the lhc experiments to move away from the objectivity database , it was decided not to pursue this application further . \n the atlas collaboration will study high energy proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider at the cern laboratory . \n atlas is expected to produce large volumes of data starting in 2007 . \n the atlas data challenge ( dc ) is a project to test and develop the ability to exploit remote computing resources for monte carlo simulation . for our tests \n , we used the application that generates background ( called pile - up ) events . input and \n output data are standard files in a zebra format . \n future atlas dc will use the root data format@xcite ; such a change will make no difference to the way in which the current test was performed . \n we tested three modes of operation on the testbed :    1 . \n both input data and output data transferred using afs 2 . \n input data transferred using gridftp and output data transferred using afs 3 . \n both input and output data transferred using gridftp    all software and log files use afs . \n it has been recognized that afs was not an ideal protocol for transfering large data files , however , we felt it was important to quantify the differences . \n we found afs to extremely slow for reading input data and resulted in cpu utilizations being less than 5% . \n afs caches its output ; as a result we tested a mode where the input was sent via gridftp to the remote site and let afs control the output . \n the results of this mode of operation were more encouraging , however the performance of afs is comparable to single stream ftp and using gridftp is a much more effective solution . \n the mode of operation we chose was one where the input files were tarred and compressed , and sent via gridftp to the remote site . at the remote site , the files would be untarred and uncompressed , and the job executed . at the end of the job , the output files would be tarred and compressed , and then transferred via gridftp back to the victoria disk server . \n this was found to be a successful mode of operation . \n access to software via afs proved to be reliable and efficient . \n we chose an application that would run extremely quickly on the processing nodes ( 30 minutes on a 2 ghz cpu ) . \n compression , transfer and uncompression was approximately 20 minutes for a 2 gb file . \n although the overall utilization of a remote cpu could be considered to be low if one includes the compression and transfer times , a more realistic application , such as simulation or reconstruction , would take hours rather than minutes to process data files of the same size . \n in this situation , we believe the cpu utilization would significantly improve . \n we have demonstrated that hep applications can be run on generic computing resources with relatively high efficiency . with ( modest ) design changes in the applications we expect that further gains in efficiency would be possible . \n further tests are planned using a sites with significantly larger resources with the aim of establishing a production level grid resource in canada .", "StartTimeOffset": 1417760348522, "RequestID": "bb675130b5f445d7b0fc43bac492c689", "TotalTokens": 2876}
{"ContextTokens": 2507, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "astrophysical noise introduces spurious spectroscopic signals that hinder the achievable radial velocity ( rv ) precision . \n such noise sources include starspots , plage / faculae , and magneto - convection , as well as oscillations , meridional flows , and potentially variable gravitational redshift @xcite . \n even magnetically quiet stars , which may lack the large amplitude signals induced by starspots , still exhibit inhomogeneities due to stellar surface magneto - convection , as long as they have an outer convective envelope . in the convective envelope , hot bubbles of bright plasma ( known as granules ) rise to the stellar surface where they eventually cool , darken and sink down into the intergranular lanes . \n as the plasma bubbles rise through the stellar photosphere , and therefore move towards the observer , they are blueshifted and as they disperse and fall downwards into the stellar interior they are redshifted with respect to the observer . since the granules are brighter and cover more surface area than the intergranular lanes the result is a net convective blueshift , which introduces asymmetries into the observed stellar lines ( the result is a ` c'-shaped absorption line bisector for solar - type stars ) \n . the exact ratio of granules to intergranular lanes is constantly changing as the granules evolve and interact with their surroundings , which in turn means the observed line asymmetries are constantly changing . for sun - like stars , the net result from these induced line changes \n is rv shifts at the level of several 10s of cm s@xmath0 @xcite . \n it is clear that an understanding of convection on solar - type stars , and indeed for all low - mass stars with convective envelopes , is essential if we are to reach cm s@xmath0 rv precision . in these proceedings \n , we report on our study of the effects of stellar photospheric magneto - convection using state - of - the - art 3d magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) solar simulations and detailed spectroscopic diagnostics . \n our goal is to disentangle and remove the convective induced rvs from stellar absorption lines . \n we simulate the solar photosphere using the muram code @xcite with a simulation box measuring 12 @xmath1 12 mm@xmath2 in the horizontal direction and 1.4 mm in the vertical direction . \n stokes-@xmath3 profiles for the @xmath4 fei absorption line were calculated for 190 simulated photospheric model snapshots using the spinor code @xcite . due to computational constraints , and a desire to breakdown the underlying physics , \n we parameterise the granulation signal using an @xmath5 80 minute time - series from the mhd simulation @xcite . \n this is done by separating the pixels , and their corresponding stokes-@xmath3 fe i 6302 @xmath6 absorption line profiles , within each snapshot based on continuum intensity and magnetic field limits . \n the result is four granulation component line profiles ( representing granules , non - magnetic intergranular lanes , magnetic intergranular lanes , and magnetic bright points ) that can be used to generate stokes-@xmath3 profiles with convection induced asymmetries as long as the appropriate filling factors are used ( see figure  [ fig:4comp_l ] ) . since granulation is naturally corrugated , observations at different line - of - sight ( los ) angles view different aspects of the granulation . as one views granulation toward the stellar limb the granular walls become visible and some of the intergranular lanes are obstructed by the granules . furthermore , once horizontal flows at disk center now have components along the los and hence the four component profiles experience both line shape changes and relative velocity shifts . to incorporate these variations \n , we incline the mhd snapshots from 0 - 80@xmath7 in 2@xmath7 steps and repeat the parameterisation at each inclination step ( computing the simulations beyond 80@xmath7 was computationally unfeasible ) . \n an example of the variations in the four component profile shapes is shown on the right side of figure  [ fig:4comp_l ] , whereas the rvs induced across the stellar limb due to the corrugated nature of granulation is shown in figure  [ fig : rv0dgr_l2 ] . \n this rv dependency on the convective blueshift term as a function of limb angle could be important for current methods of removing activity signals .    to ensure that our parameterization is representative of the mhd simulations we use the filling factors from the aforementioned time - series in conjunction with the four component profiles to reconstruct the average absorption line profiles from the simulation snapshots . \n the average relative error is measured to ensure the line shape of the reconstructed profiles matches the original profiles from the simulation . \n the velocity shifts due to granulation are also measured in each instance ( @xcite provides more details on this process for disk center  note this process remains the same for each inclination across the disk ) . for all inclinations \n the reconstructed profiles agree with the original profiles to better than 0.8% . \n the average rv residual ( the difference between granulation rvs from the original simulation and those from the reconstruction ) only varies from @xmath5 3 to -5 cm s@xmath0 on a 100 to 20 m s@xmath0 signal . as a result \n , we are confident that our granulation parameterisation is representative of the more computationally expensive mhd simulations . \n we used the granulation component filling factor distributions and relationships determined from the mhd simulations to generate new line profiles that are representative of those produced by the simulation itself . to begin \n , we randomly selected a granule filling factor based on the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) from the original time - series . from the mhd simulations we found a strong linear relationship between granules and non - magnetic intergranular lanes , and thus we used this relationship to then select the non - magnetic intergranular lane filling factor . \n unfortunately , there were no strong correlations between these two components and the magnetic components so the magnetic bright point filling factors were selected at random based on their cdf from the original time - series . \n finally , the fourth component ( magnetic intergranular lanes ) was determined by the fact that all four component filling factors must sum to one . \n kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and wilcoxon rank - sum tests were performed to ensure that the generated filling factors belong to the same population as that produced from the mhd simulation ( all components passed at all stellar limb angles , except the magnetic intergranular lanes at @xmath8 20@xmath7 , but this component contributes very little to the total profiles at these angles and thus this effect is likely negligible ) .    to simulate a sun - as - a - star model observation , we tiled a stellar disk with 12 @xmath1 12 mm@xmath2 regions , with the appropriate projected area , and randomly assigned each tile a newly generated line profile . \n note that stellar limb darkening was accounted for within the original simulations and therefore also in the four component line profiles ; however , we did linearly interpolate between stellar limb angles to correct for the odd inclinations and those inclinations greater than 80@xmath7 ( due to computational constraints , tiles between 80 - 90@xmath7 were all assigned a line profile based on the four components at 80@xmath7 \n note this effect is likely negligible due to the small projected area and heavy limb darkening in this region ) . once all the tiles were assigned an appropriate line profile we then integrated over the entire disk to simulate a model observation . \n this process was repeated 1,000 times to build up a statistically significant sample size to study . \n each observation is independent and therefore relates to the physical case where each observation was separated by at least one convective turnover timescale . in \n future work we aim to incorporate the effects of a non - zero exposure time . \n the disk - integrated line profiles and their line bisectors are shown in the left side of figure  [ fig : diskint_vasy ] . \n finally , we examined the sun - as - a - star disk - integrated line profiles for any correlation between line shape change or asymmetries and convection induced rv . to begin , we inspected numerous characteristics of the line bisector ( including bisector inverse slope , bisector curvature , velocity displacement , and bisector amplitude [ @xcite ] ) , as well as line depth and line width at various depths . \n we also investigated diagnostics that addressed the entirety of the line profile , such as bi - gaussian fitting and v@xmath9 @xcite . \n finally , we integrated the area under the line profile to create a proxy for photometric brightness . \n v@xmath9 and the proxy for photometric brightness produced the strongest correlations with rv and largest noise reduction ( determined by subtracting off the correlation and comparing the standard deviation of the rvs before and after ) , a @xmath5 50% noise reduction in total . \n a 50% reduction in convective noise meant the overall noise level was around 10 cm s@xmath0 in these quiet star simulations . \n the right side of figure  [ fig : diskint_vasy ] shows the excellent correlation between v@xmath9 and granulation induced rv . \n the next best correlations were with the line depth and bisector curvature , which are able to remove @xmath5 35% of the noise . \n the remaining diagnostics either remove less than 20% of the noise ( velocity displacement , bisector amplitude , equivalent width ) or actually result in an increase of the overall noise ( bisector inverse slope and bi - gaussian fitting ) .    these initial results indicate hope that we will be able to empirically measure the convective induced line shape variations and use them to remove the convective induced rvs in high precision studies . \n it is important to note that we are currently working on an updated version of the radiative mhd solar simulation ( with updated equation of state and opacities etc . ) to try to match the disk integrated line profile more closely with solar observations . \n initial results from the updated mhd simulation indicate there is a slight change in bisector shape and in some of the diagnostics , but strong correlations are still present and we anticipate similar overall results in noise reduction . we are also working to incorporate lower magnetic field strengths , additional sources of noise , finite exposure lengths , and the effects of planets . \n additionally , we plan to extend the simulations across a suite of stellar lines ( with a wide range of formation heights , absorption strengths , excitation and ionisation potentials ) and various spectral types ( m - f ) . \n simultaneously , we are also working to test these results observationally with the sun and with the highest precision stellar targets available with the overall aim to remove magneto - convective noise to a sub 10 cm s@xmath0 level in time for the espresso spectrograph to come online .", "StartTimeOffset": 1466529410142, "RequestID": "ce466b65894248a38eb378f43d8e75db", "TotalTokens": 2648}

\n all types of clusters are included in the studied sample ? \n some type of cluster is over- or under- represented in the sample ? \n the above questions are closely related to the following one : can a result found to hold on a sample of unknown representativity ( the studied sample of clusters ) be generalized to the parent distribution ( i.e. to clusters ) ?

end electronics . the forward region layout foreseen for the ild detector \n is shown in figure  [ fig : forward_structure ] . \n prototype detector planes assembled with dedicated fe and adc asics for * lumical * and for * beamcal * have been built . in this paper , results of the * lumical * performance following tests in a mixed particle and in an electron beam are reported . \n during 2014 and 2015 , the * fcal * collaboration has successfully commissioned and operated , in the t9 experimental area at the cern ps facilities and in the 21 beam line area at the desy ii synchrotron , the first * lumical * multi - layer prototype . a multi - plane module with four sensor planes \n was investigated in a mixed particle and in an electron beam . \n different detector configurations were used during the testbeams , with the active sensor layers always separated by one or two absorber layers . \n the testbeam was performed in october 2014 at the cern ps facilities using a secondary beam with muons , pions , hadrons and electrons with momentum of 5gev / c . \n the beam momentum can be fixed by the magnetic field of the beam delivery electromagnets while the horizontal spatial spread is reduced by a set of collimators . \n the simplified overall ( without magnets ) of the ps facilities is presented in figure  [ fig : ps_line ] .        in order to enable the particle track reconstruction , a multilayer tracking detector , so - called telescope , \n was developed by the aarhus university . \n the telescope utilizes the mimosa26 chips , a maps with fast binary readout @xcite . \n the mimosa26 utilizes a binary readout indicating the pixel signals exceeding the preset discrimination level . \n the pixel matrix is read continuously ( without triggering ) providing a complete frame every 115.2  @xmath0s . \n the data are gathered , triggered and stored by a custom daq system , based on the pxi crate , developed by the aarhus university in collaboration with strasbourg university . \n four telescope planes , each comprising one mimosa26 chip , were set upstream of the * dut * as shown in figure  [ fig : cern_set - up ] . \n the trigger system consists of three scintillators with compact photomultipliers . \n two solid 5@xmath15mm@xmath2 scintillators were placed upstream and downstream the telescope and one , with a 9  mm diameter circular hole , was placed just before the last telescope plane . \n the * dut * ( lumical detector prototype ) , was prepared using four detector planes always separated by two absorber layers as shown in figure  [ fig : dut_cern ] . \n the complex mechanical structure developed by cern allows to install the tungsten absorber or active sensor layer with a precision of a few tens of micrometers . \n a fully assembled detector plane is shown in figure  [ fig : pcb_old ] @xcite . \n the prototype system consists of a silicon sensor covered by kapton fanout and front - end electronics \n .    21  cm@xmath2.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    due to high energy depositions in the * lumical * calorimeter , standard 320  @xmath0 m thick silicon sensors were chosen as a compromise between the capacitance and the amount of generated charge . * \n lumical * sensors have been designed at the institute of nuclear physics pan in cracow @xcite and manufactured by hamamatsu photonics . \n the sensor is made from a n - type silicon , with p@xmath4pads with a thin aluminum metalization . \n the sensor tile , as the smallest sensor unit produced , includes 256 separate sensor pads . \n for this experiment 32 channels readout module was used .      during october 2015 \n , four detectors were installed on the tungsten layers and installed inside the same frame as we used during the 2014 test beam as shown in figure  [ fig : desy_dut ] . \n the whole system was installed in 5 gev electron beam at desy . \n the beam line was composed of scintillators for the trigger and six planes of silicon used as a telescope @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : desy_exp_set_up ] . \n a crucial point in the measurements was the synchronization between the data acquired with the detectors under investigation and that of the tracker . \n the latter was used to measure the local detection efficiency and evaluate the level of cross - talk between neighboring pads as function of the particle impact location . \n this was effectively achieved employing the rd51 scalable readout system ( srs ) . \n the data acquisition of both systems ( silicon tracker and lumical detector ) was triggered by the same scintillator signals and performed with a single srs front - end card ( fec ) @xcite . \n for each triggered event , the charge accumulated by all channels was stored . for each channel \n , the charge was sampled in 25 bins of 25 ns each . \n the mmdaq1 online data acquisition software was used to store the synchronized data on a pc for further analysis . using the online , it is possible to visualize events . on the figure  [ fig : adc_256 ] \n , we can see a typical event : the adc counts ( pedestal subtracted ) as a function of the channel number ( between 1 and 256 ) and the time ( between 0 and 500 ns ) . \n the aim of the test beam was to fully equipped four silicon sensors and installed these sensors in between two tungsten planes , namely within one mm . \n we modified the read out kapton foil including two 130 pin connectors ( figure  [ fig : ch_fanout ] ) so we will be able to read all the pads of a sensors . \n the high voltage was originally injected from on the 3.5 mm pcb but to cope with the one mm , we designed a thin high voltage kapton foil as shown in the figure  [ fig : hv_fanout ] .            in order to mechanically support the sensor and the two kapton foils , we designed an envelope , which should also fit within 1 mm . \n we used two different techniques to produce the envelope : 3d printing and carbon fiber . \n it appears that the 3d printed envelop is not rigid enough so we finally choose the carbon fiber option , which allows thickness of  200  @xmath0 m and a good rigidity . \n the whole detector ( see figure  [ fig : desy_sensor ] including the carbon fiber , the two kapton foils and the sensor ) thickness was measured in different positions around 900  @xmath0 m . \n an important effort has been realized on the gluing layers thickness and on the wire bonding loop size : some tools have been developed in order to be able to apply glue layers of 20 to 30  @xmath0 m . \n we developed an expertise to maintain the wire bonding loop size around 50  @xmath0 m .    in order to read all the pads of each sensor ( 128 channels ) we used the apv25 chip . \n one hybrid contains 128 channels , which each are ac coupled to one read - out strip of the detector . \n each channel contains a pre - amplifier , cr - rc shaper with adjustable shaping time and has a spark protection system implemented . \n the hybrid records the value of the shaped signal every 25 ns and stores it in an analog memory consisting of a 192 celled pipe - line . \n the signal is read out upon a trigger signal . \n the number of samples in one acquisition window is user defined , and the trigger time delay must hence be adjusted by the user to synchronize the trigger with the acquisition window . \n the apv hybrids are connected to the adapter boards using commercial hdmi cables . \n one cable can serve two apv hybrids ( a master and a slave card ) that can be connected through a 16-lead flat cable . \n the hybrid cards are connected to the detector ground through two low - ohmic low - profile rf coaxial connectors , which also serve to fix the hybrid card mechanically . \n the testbeam campaigns were done to investigate the performance of the calorimeter prototype . \n data were taken for different pads and also for regions covering pad boundaries . \n the impact point on the sensor is reconstructed from the telescope information . using a color code for the signals on the pads \n the structure of the sensor becomes nicely visible , as seen in figure  [ fig : impact_points ] .        during the test beam , \n the response of the readout chain to electromagnetic shower was studied . in order to analyze the electromagnetic shower development \n the energy deposited in each sensor plane from all configuration were obtained . \n the shower can be therefore sampled up to the 10@xmath5 layer with the target spatial sampling resolution of one radiation length , by combining the data obtained in all three configurations . \n the measurement results from october 2014 test beam were compared with prediction of geant4 monte carlo simulations where the experimental setup was implemented . \n a good agreement was found between them as shown in figure  [ fig : long_shower ] . \n data taken in tests beam were processed using various algorithms to investigate the response of large - area pad sensors assembled with a full readout chain . \n a first * lumical * multi - layer silicon - sensor prototype was tested at the ps cern facilities with a mixed - particle beam and at the desy ii synchrotron with a 5 gev electron beam . \n the mc simulation of the testbeam was performed with a fair level of detail and the experimental data are in good agreement with mc simulations . \n the obtained results indicate an excellent working performance of all components ( silicon sensors , front - end and readout electronics ) and fulfilled the requirements for * lumical * calorimeter . using new technology and expertise and each construction step , we succeeded to develop , produce and test detector less than 1 mm thick modules ( 900  @xmath0 m ) . \n the first results of a four layers fully equipped have started and results are promising . \n this work was partially supported by the romania uefiscdi agency under pn -

{"ContextTokens": 3416, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "the analysis of fine structure lines is crucial to interpret ir observations of ultra - compact  regions , giant  regions and starburst galaxies in terms of their stellar content . through photoionization modeling the nature of the ionizing sources of  regions and properties of starburst regions such as the age and the imf ( slope , upper mass - cutoff ) \n can in principle be determined . \n considerable progress has been made in the recent year in this respect through the use of new stellar fluxes , spectral energy distributions appropriate for evoling stellar populations at different metallicities and including detailed observational constraints ( e.g.  garcia - vargas et al . \n 1995 , 1997 , stasiska & leitherer 1996 , stasiska & schaerer 1997 , gonzlez - delgado et al . \n none of these studies have , however , focussed on ir observation which are now becoming widely available thanks to iso .    in this contribution we present exploratory results regarding predictions of ir lines from two sets of recent photoionization models : _ 1 ) _ single star  regions using the latest ionizing fluxes from non - lte , line blanketed atmospheres including stellar winds (  models , schaerer & de koter 1997 ) and , _ 2 ) _ photoionization models for evolving starburst populations based on the leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) synthesis models . \n detailed results from new photoionization models for starbursts including the  models and updated stellar tracks will be presented elsewhere . \n in figure 1 we illustrate the behaviour of the line ratios of some important fine structure lines observable in the sws range and with isocam / cvf . \n this figure , based on the model calculations of stasiska & schaerer ( 1997 , hereafter ss97 ) , shows the dependence of the line ratios on the stellar temperature and  importantly  also on the ionization parameter . \n the comparison between the top and bottom row shows the differences obtained using either the recent  atmosphere models or kurucz plane parallel lte models . due to the harder spectrum predicted by the  models above @xmath0 35 - 40 ev ( schaerer & de koter ) a _ higher excitation _ \n is generally predicted for a given  than with kurucz models ( see ss97 ) . \n evidence supporting such an increase of the hardness of the ionizing flux comes from the kao observations of rubin and coworkers ( cf.simpson et al . \n 1995 ) . indeed , the  models including stellar winds , non - lte effects and line blanketing are thereby able to provide a satisfactory description of the ne@xmath1/o@xmath1 ionic fractions ( see ss97 , also sellmaier et al . \n 1996 ) .    encouraged by these successes atmosphere models including the most relevant physical processes ( stellar winds , non - lte , blanketing ) continue to be improved . \n see e.g.  pauldrach ( 1997 ) and schaerer ( 1997 ) for recent progress reports . \n in addition more stringent tests using iso observations of nebulae with well known ionizing sources would be extremely valuable . \n detailed photoionization modeling including constraints on the nebular geometry and likely also their dust content will be necessary to achieve such a goal .    in fig .  2 we plot the predictions for single star  regions for some quantities of interest for the interpretation of integrated populations discussed later . \n the middle and right panels show the ratio of luminosity in the lyman continuum ( assuming an average photon energy of 16 ev ) @xmath2 to the  and  line luminosity respectively . \n it is useful to understand the behaviour of the /  12.8/33.5 ratio ( left ) since either of these lines is sometimes used as a proxy in case the other line is unobservable ( cf . \n genzel et al .  1998 ) . \n indeed for a given  one obtains a relatively small variation ( @xmath0 1 dex ) of /  with the ionization parameter . in all our `` reference models '' ( constructed assuming a gas density of 10 @xmath3 ) we predict /  @xmath4 1 . for stars with  @xmath5 36 \n kk the differences between the  and kurucz fluxes become non - negligible for /. \n some implications of these finding are briefly discussed below . \n ir fine structure lines provide a new tool to study the hot star population of obscured starbursts . through comparisons with photoionization modeling this allows in particular to constrain the star formation history and the upper end of the initial mass function ( e.g.  lutz et al .  1998 ) . \n empirical diagnostic diagrams based on ir lines also allow the distinction between starburst and agn powered sources ( genzel et al . \n theoretically these diagnostics remain , however , to be understood and quantified .    to address such questions photoionization models representing evolving starbursts at different metallicities are nowadays required . in the following \n we will briefly illustrate some predictions from such models for fine structure lines in the iso lws range . \n the predictions shown here are drawn from the models of stasiska & leitherer ( 1996 , hereafter sl96 , available by anonymous ftp from ftp.obspm.fr/pub/obs/grazyna/cd-crete ) . \n detailed results from new photoionization models for young starbursts based on the most recent evolutionary synthesis models of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) including the latest geneva stellar tracks and  model atmospheres ( cf.above ) will be presented elsewhere .    in figure 3 \n we show the computed temporal evolution of the line ratios of /  12.8/15.5 , /  8.9/6.9 , and /  10.5/18.7 ( all top row ) for an instantaneous burst at 1/4 solar metallicity with a salpeter imf and @xmath6  surrounded by a gas cloud of density n=10 @xmath3 . \n different symbols represent models with different ( initial ) ionization parameters : typically one has @xmath7 ( circles ) to @xmath8 ( crosses ) . \n note that in photoionization models of evolving starbursts , the dependence of @xmath9 with time is a function of the adopted geometry , as stressed by stasiska ( 1998 ) . in the models of sl96 , @xmath9 decreases slightly with time . \n as expected the excitation decreases with the age of the burst . \n it must , however , be reminded that the considered lines also strongly depend on the ionization parameter ( see fig . \n 3 ) . indeed \n the line ratios shown here vary typically by three orders of magnitudes for variations of @xmath9 of 4 orders of magnitudes . for comparison a change of the upper mass - cutoff from 50 to 100 increases the same line ratios by less than one order of magnitude ( e.g.  lutz et al . \n 1998 ) . in general @xmath9 is poorly constrained . \n although optical spectra of  galaxies can be reproduced with models covering only a fairly small range of @xmath9 ( @xmath0 1 dex , sl96 ) this is not necessarily the case for iso observations of starburst galaxies . \n this question needs a careful analysis before meaningful results can be derived on the imf , age etc . \n genzel et al . \n find an empirical value of + /  @xmath10 1.7 @xmath11 1.3 ( or 1.2 @xmath11 0.6 excluding the two largest outliers ) from their sample of 10 starbursts . \n the sl96 models constructed with a density of n=10 @xmath3 typically predict  @xmath4 ( this is true also for solar metallicity models , not shown here ) . \n however , the sl96 models with n@xmath12 @xmath3 reach /  of 1.5 , due to collisional deexcitation of . \n the electron densities deduced from  18.7/33.5 for a subset of starburst galaxies from the genzel et al . \n sample are typically @xmath13 , so it seems that collisional deexcitation is not sufficient to explain the large /  observed . \n among possible factors to reduce the discrepancy are an ne overabundance ( which however needs to be understood in more detail ) , or a softer ionizing radiation field . \n we conclude that the empirical value /@xmath0 1.7 for starbursts used in the diagnostic diagrams of genzel et al . \n ( 1998 ) is theoretically not well understood yet . for comparisons of the lyman continuum luminosity @xmath2 to the bolometric luminosity of starbursts , ulirgs , etc . \n it is interesting to be able to derive @xmath2 from the ir fine structure lines . \n this requires , however , some empirical calibration or the use of models . `` empirical '' values of @xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath14@xmath16 are obtained from the starburst sample of genzel et al .  excluding ngc 5253 , which shows much larger values . \n it must be reminded that @xmath2 is derived from the brackett recombination lines assuming case b and an average photon energy of 16 ev , and neglecting the absorption of lyc photons by dust . \n our model predictions show in fig .  3 ( mid / right bottom panels ) for the instantaneous burst model show quite a wide range for the @xmath17line ratios , depending on age and ionization parameter . \n although these idealised models ( instantaneous burst ) are not necessarily representative for the average starburst population observed through the iso aperture it is instructive to compare our predictions with the `` observed '' values of genzel et al . in any case the predicted values of @xmath14@xmath18 are systematically larger than the empirical starburst value even for the oldest age considered here . using the  model atmospheres will even further increase the predicted value given their harder energy distribution with respect to the kurucz ones . \n the @xmath14@xmath18 ratio shows a better agreement with the average value from genzel et al . \n this is consistent with the discrepancy between the model predictions for /  and the observations discussed earlier . \n most probably , the lyc luminosities derived from the observations are underestimated because they do not take into account dust absorption of lyc photons . \n more detailed analysis are required to obtain consistent a consistent picture of the fine structure lines in such objects . \n we have illustrated the impact of the recent  ionizing fluxes on ir fine structure lines for single star  regions and shown predictions of ir lines for evolving starbursts resulting from calculations of extensive grids of photoionization models ( see sl96 , ss97 ) .    as shown earlier , \n ionizing fluxes from non - lte , line blanketed atmospheres including stellar winds predict a harder spectrum ( schaerer & de koter 1997 ) leading to higher excitation in the nebula . \n these predictions are supported by comparisons with optical and pre - iso ( kao ) ir observations of  regions ( ss97 and references therein ) . \n detailed models of ultra - compact  regions or  regions with well - known stellar content based on iso observations and other observational constraints will be extremely useful to better constrain the atmosphere models and probe the importance of other effects ( e.g.  dust ) usually neglected in photoionization models . \n such studies also provide important tests for our understanding of more complex objects like starbursts .    for starbursts \n we have illustrated the behaviour of line ratios which can in principle be used to constrain burst properties such as the age , imf slope and upper mass - cutoff . \n we have also studied the behaviour of the /  ratio and diagnostics of @xmath2 from fine structure lines extensively used by genzel et al . \n we have shown that a thorough analysis of the properties of the _ nebular _ gas ( ionization parameter , geometry , dust content , total amount of gas ) is needed for reliable determinations of the _ stellar _ content of the nebulae observed by iso . \n garca -

mills in landau gauge for the ansatz using power and logarithmic expansion . \n contrary to the fermion sd case , the bare vertex approximation can not reproduce the uv solution consistent with the uv perturbation and the uv ope . \n we have found the consistent solution by considering the uv higher order corrections .    using the same vertex ansatz ( 4 ) determined as above , we have obtained also the ir solutions which have the same form as the power -

{"ContextTokens": 2448, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "hidden sectors are often predicted in string theories and contained in various supersymmetric models as the source of susy breaking . as the hidden sector ( hs ) \n is not charged under the standard model ( sm ) gauge groups and vice versa the two sectors are not directly connected and only interact via messenger particles . \n an example for a messenger is the hidden photon @xmath0 which is a frequent feature of sm extensions as extra hidden u(1 ) symmetries for example often remain in the breaking of larger gauge groups or appear in string compactifications . \n on the other hand there are several observations in indirect and direct dark matter detection experiments like pamela , fermi , dama and cogent which favour dark matter ( dm ) models with light messenger particles . \n such a messenger , despite mediating the dm scattering on nuclei , most importantly ensures that the dm annihilation is at the same time leptophilic and greatly enhanced by the sommerfeld effect . \n a gev - scale mass for the hidden photon can be obtained quite naturally both through the stckelberg and the higgs mechanism . \n the former , being the simplest mechanism to give mass to abelian gauge bosons , can give for example in certain string compactifications with d7-branes a mass to the hidden photon according to @xmath1 , which depends on the volume of the extra dimension , i.e. the string - scale @xmath2 , and the planck scale @xmath3  @xcite . \n for intermediate string - scales @xmath4 gev , which are preferred by the axion decay constant and susy breaking scales , this leads to @xmath5 gev - scale . in the case of the higgs mechanism where the symmetry breaking is transferred by the kinetic mixing from the visible to the hidden sector the hidden photon mass \n can be estimated by @xmath6  @xcite . \n assuming that the kinetic mixing @xmath7 is generated supersymmetrically at high scales , without light fields charged under both u(1)s , it is of the order of a loop factor  @xcite and we impose the following relation with the hidden gauge coupling @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 factor leading typically to @xmath12 and thus @xmath5 gev - scale . \n we consider the most simple hidden sector containing only an extra u(1 ) symmetry and the corresponding hidden photon @xmath0 which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon . \n the most general lagrangian for such a scenario , including a mass - term @xmath13 for the hidden photon and the kinetic mixing between @xmath14 and @xmath0 parameterized by @xmath7 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the field strength of the ordinary electromagnetic field @xmath17 and @xmath18 the field strength of the hidden u(1 ) field @xmath19 . \n the hidden photon can be constrained by and searched for in experiments through its coupling to sm fermions which is possible due to the kinetic mixing with the photon . \n sm precision measurements ( sm pm )  @xcite , the muon and electron anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath20 )  @xcite and a reinterpretation of the babar search for the @xmath21 decay to a pseudoscalar in the process @xmath22s \n @xcite exclude large values of kinetic mixing as shown in grey in the left plot of fig . \n [ fig -

target experiments at jlab ( apex  @xcite , hps  @xcite , darklight  @xcite ) , mainz ( mami , mesa  @xcite ) and desy ( hips  @xcite ) . \n the expected sensitivities of those experiments are shown as coloured lines in the right plot of fig . \n [ fig - hplimits ] . \n the results of this section are based on an analysis that has been presented in detail in  @xcite . \n the simplest possible extension of the hidden sector studied in the previous section is the addition of a dirac fermion as dark matter candidate ( cf .  @xcite ) . as the hidden photon mediates both the dm annihilation and the dm scattering on nuclei it is essential for the determination of the dm relic abundance and direct detection rate respectively . \n r0.34        using relation  ( [ eq - kappa ] ) with @xmath26 we find that for a dm mass of 6 gev the correct relic abundance can be obtained on the dark green stripe in fig . \n [ fig - hdm - hplimits ] while in the light green area the contribution to the total dm density is only subdominant . \n the spin - independent ( si ) scattering on nuclei of the dirac fermion dm can explain the cogent  @xcite signal in the purple band ( 90% cl lighter 99% cl darker purple ) . \n the plotted cross section @xmath27 has been rescaled by the relic abundance for subdominant dm and fits the one found in  @xcite to be compatible with cogent for a standard halo model . \n constraints from cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite are not shown as they do not apply to dm masses as light as 6 gev . \n the excluded grey areas and coloured lines for sensitivities of future experiments are the same as in fig . \n [ fig - hplimits ] . \n a scan over the dm mass allows to fill the complete parameter space as shown in fig . \n [ fig - scattplot ] on the left for @xmath28 where dark green corresponds to the correct relic abundance , light green to subdominant and purple to cogent allowed points ( all points are compatible with other direct detection limits ) . \n the effects of varying the dm mass , the parameter @xmath10 and the details of the halo model have been studied in more detail in  @xcite .      as a more sophisticated and better motivated model \n , we consider three chiral superfields @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 charged under the hidden u(1 ) . taking the superpotential @xmath32 and the dimensionless coupling  @xmath33 \n this is the simplest anomaly - free model possible without adding dimensionful supersymmetric quantities . \n while we assume the mssm in the visible sector , the dm phenomenology of the hs depends on the details of the susy breaking . \n -2 ( dash -

{"ContextTokens": 2780, "GeneratedTokens": 101, "SynthesizedBody": "the totem roman pot system  @xcite has been designed for measuring very forward protons originating from elastic or diffractive scattering processes . with different beam optics , four - momentum transfers down to @xmath0 \n can be reached , corresponding to scattering angles of a few @xmath1rad . \n the proton detection is accomplished by stacks of 10 silicon sensors placed in movable beam - pipe insertions  so - called `` roman pots '' ( rps )  that can approach the beam . in some \n special runs the distance from the beam centre has been smaller than 1 mm . \n the system consists of 24 rps arranged in 4 stations at 147 m and 220 m on either side of lhc s ip5 . \n each station is composed of 2 units separated by a distance of 2  5 m . \n a unit consists of 3 rps , two approaching the outgoing beam vertically and one horizontally , allowing for a partial overlap between horizontal and vertical detectors , which is useful for the alignment . \n the rp movement control system  @xcite has been derived from the one of the lhc collimators . \n the top level user interface , a modified version of the central collimation application  @xcite , is operated from the ccc . \n it allows the operator to send rp position requests and critical position limits to the middle level control ( see below ) and to read back the measured positions . \n a graphical display shows the time evolution of requested and measured rp positions , the position limits , and the dose rates measured by beam loss monitors downstream of the rps ( see example screenshot in fig . \n [ fig : interlocktest ] ) . \n the middle level is the fesa - based  @xcite collimator supervisor system  @xcite , providing the link between the collimation application and the low level motor control running on a pxi  @xcite crate . \n the pxi cpu controls the stepping motors of the individual rps and manages the position read - outs from the stepping motor encoder ( step counter ) and from the independent lvdt system ( see next subsection ) . \n the pxi computer also interfaces to fpga cards which independently from the cpu accomplish the interlock - relevant comparison between actual rp positions and their critical limits ( see later subsection ) . \n the fpga cards have direct connections from the microswitches and the lvdts and to the beam interlock logic card . \n note that from the totem control room no rp movements can be triggered , except emergency retractions via mechanical springs . \n this policy enforces centralisation of controls in the ccc and enhances communication between totem and the lhc operators . \n however , the totem detector control system monitors passively all operations .      r50 mm     the rp mechanics has a series of microswitches  @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig : microswitches ] ) tagging certain positions in the rps movement range and triggering appropriate responses . \n the in and out electrical stoppers define the range of motion and stop the pot at its first point of electrical contact with their spring test probes . \n these probes have an elastic travel of 3.18 mm beyond the first point of contact . \n the out microswitch beyond the electrical stopper acts as a redundant motor stopper . \n the out stopper also serves as absolute position reference ; its on - off transition point has been surveyed by laser calibration . \n the home switch is relevant for interlock purposes . \n the home flag is active in all retracted pot positions beyond the first contact point with the home switch . \n the anticollision switch stops the motors if a top and a bottom pot come too close to each other . \n the rp system has two redundant position measurements : 1 . \n the motor encoders , i.e. step counters , are used for active movement control . \n each step of the stepping motor corresponds to about 5@xmath1 m . due to a small position dependence of the step size \n , step calibration curves are measured for each rp at least once per year . \n the encoder measures the position relative to the out electrical stopper ; it has no absolute position memory . in a fast extraction of a pot with the springs , \n the mechanical coupling between the pot and its motor is removed , leading to a loss of the absolute position information . \n hence , to ensure a correct calibration , each rp insertion is preceded by an encoder reset at the out stopper . \n 2 . the lvdts  @xcite provide an absolute position measurement but are subject to small drifts and need to be periodically recalibrated . \n these measurements are used for the position interlock and as an independent cross - check of the encoders . \n like all lhc experiments and many machine components , the totem rp system has an input to the lhc beam interlock system to avoid beam operation when a rp is in a position where it would represent a danger . \n this logic is implemented in the programmable totem interlock card that receives beam mode information ( smp parameters ) from the general machine timing ( gmt ) , rp position validity information from the fpga cards comparing each rp s lvdt position with its beam - mode dependent critical limits , and simple electrical contact information from the rp home microswitches . \n the output signals , injection_permit and user_permit are transmitted by hardware links to the beam user interfaces ( `` cibf '' and `` cibu '' ) ; copies are sent to the detector control system . \n the key functions of the interlock logic  @xcite are the following : 1 . withdrawal of injection_permit : prevention of any beam injection when at least one rp does not touch its home microswitch . \n withdrawal of user_permit : beam dump and automatic rp extraction if either ( a ) at least one rp is away from its home switch in a beam mode where rp operation is not allowed , or ( b ) at least one rp is outside the position range defined by beam - mode dependent critical limits .    an example sequence of an interlock test performed with the collimation application in the ccc is shown in fig . \n [ fig : interlocktest ] .    39.7 mm ) . \n the step counter , however , stays at 37 mm because in the emergency extraction with the springs the motor coupling is lost . \n a reset at the mechanical reference point ( out stopper ) is needed . \n , width=313 ] \n the beam - based alignment of the rps is performed with a technique established for the collimators  @xcite : a reference beam edge is produced by closing the horizontal and vertical primary collimators ( tcps ) until they scrape the beam halo at an aperture @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the beam size at the collimator , calculated for nominal optics functions and for a given normalised emittance . \n this beam edge is then used as a reference for the rps : the pot approaches the circulating beam in steps as small as 10@xmath1 m . \n when it reaches the edge , a beam loss is measured in a beam loss monitor ( blm ) downstream ( fig . \n [ fig : collim ] ) . in this condition , \n the rp and the primary collimator are at the same normalised distance @xmath4 from the beam orbit with an accuracy given by the step size . at the contact position , \n the rp scrapes slightly into the beam . to refine the scraped beam edge , \n the primary collimator in the appropriate plane is moved further towards the beam until it becomes again the aperture bottleneck . \n the average of the two normalised reference distances @xmath4 of the primary collimators is used to compute the normalised distance @xmath5 of the rp .      note that this procedure only establishes the distance between the _ thin window _ of the rp and the beam centre . \n the alignment of the different _ silicon detector planes _ , both relative to each other and to the beam , is determined by software , using real particle data .        a detailed discussion of the software alignment methods is given in  @xcite . \n most degrees of freedom of the relative alignment between the rp sensors can be obtained from the reconstructed tracks . \n the underlying idea is that sensor misalignments give raise to residuals , i.e. the distances of the measured hit positions from the fitted tracks . \n this technique is sensitive to shifts ( along the sensor read - out direction , i.e. perpendicular to the microstrips ) and rotations of individual detector planes relative to each other , but not to global shifts or rotations . \n the transverse overlap between vertical and horizontal detectors ( fig . \n [ fig : stationscheme ] ) establishes the alignment between the mechanically independent 3 pots of a rp unit . \n [ fig : trackbasedresult ] shows a comparison of the track - based alignment results for an example rp with the optical metrology data . \n the global misalignment modes ( e.g. common shifts or rotations of entire stations w.r.t . \n the beam ) are inaccessible to the track - based techniques but can be constrained by exploiting known symmetries of certain physics processes . \n a prominent example is elastic scattering with its clean hit distribution in the vertical detectors ( fig . \n [ fig : elasticprofile ] ) . \n the horizontal and vertical symmetries of the distribution lead to an alignment precision of better than 10@xmath1 m horizontally and about 20@xmath1 m vertically .    . \n the symmetry line of the vertical distribution ( indicating the position of the beam centre ) is found by inverting the sign of the @xmath6 part ( excluding the region near the acceptance cut ) and shifting it until it coincides with the @xmath7 part.,width=317 ]    9 totem collaboration : technical design report , cern -

these cover the low - energy peak of the sed . \n the gamma - ray points assume a week s worth of sky survey observations with the lat .    as figure \n [ fig : mrk 501 ] shows , joint lat and and veritas observations of markarian 501 , and of other high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects , will cover the entire high - energy peak of the sed . \n this is an extremely powerful measurement for understanding the origin of the high - energy emission , and such broad high - energy coverage will not be possible until the launch of glast . in the context of leptonic models , \n the lat coverage of the low - energy half of the sed can constrain @xmath21 and @xmath23 , unlike the previous modeling of @xcite . \n if simultaneous x - ray data are also available that cover the low - energy peak of the sed , then the overall energetics of the inner jet are known . \n we can directly measure the relative contributions of synchrotron and inverse - compton cooling in the jet . \n this type of complete , simultaneous coverage constrains all of the parameters of simple ssc models : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath25 . \n the ssc models in high and medium states from @xcite ( solid lines ) are used to predict the lat counts from a week of observations in survey mode . \n the points show the predicted lat and x - ray counts from a binned likelihood analysis , and the shaded band indicates the @xmath29 lat error from an unbinned likelihood analysis . \n the u - shaped line indicates the veritas sensitivity expected from 15 hours of observations ( courtesy of r. ong ) . ] \n we have described the two glast instruments and explored the constraints that lat observations can make on leptonic emission models of agn jets . \n we emphasize that none of the results shown require pointed lat observations ;

{"ContextTokens": 2570, "GeneratedTokens": 327, "SynthesizedBody": "the interaction of soft substrates with fluid interfaces is common to many biological , medical , and industrial processes . for this reason , the field of elastocapillarity @xcite , \n in which one studies how surface tension forces couple to the deformations of elastic substrates , has been the subject of much recent attention . \n even the most basic characterization of the wetting forces at the three - phase contact - line remains in dispute , especially for soft viscoelastic materials @xcite that have both liquid and solid properties . \n for such materials , the young - dupr law for a liquid wetting a hard solid , neumann s law for a liquid wetting another liquid , or some hybrid thereof may apply @xcite . \n theoretical efforts have been made to bridge the gap between the hard solid and liquid regime , such as introducing the concept of solid surface tension @xcite . \n alternative methods employ computational approaches such as density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations @xcite to gain a more thorough understanding of the wetting forces acting at the contact - line .    in general , the elastic resistance must be comparable in magnitude to the surface tension forces applied to the elastic medium for many elastocapillary phenomenon . \n the elastocapillary number @xmath1 is a typical measure of the relative importance of capillarity to elasticity . here \n @xmath2 is the surface tension , @xmath3 the elastic modulus and @xmath4 a characteristic length scale . in experiments , \n it is typically easiest to adjust @xmath4 , as seen in the wrinkling of elastic sheets @xcite , capillary origami @xcite and buckling of elastic fibers @xcite . \n however , it is also possible to use a gel as the solid phase @xcite , which permits @xmath3 to be tuned over several orders of magnitude .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we end this section with a comment on the failure criteria . \n the results presented in this section have assumed that the substrate is always weak enough to generate deformations that exceed the failure threshold for agar gel . as such \n , we have focused our study on identifying a critical wavenumber and not the failure threshold . \n additional experiments would be needed to extract such information . \n the model developed above captures the central feature required to generate a starburst with a particular number of arms : a critical wavenumber @xmath5 for which the tangential displacement is maximal . in experiments \n , we observe that for a given set of experimental conditions , a narrow range of wavenumbers are selected ; this is not surprising given that values of @xmath6 can have a maximum displacement similar to @xmath5 . \n however , the failure criteria does not provide a failure mechanism . in physical gels such as agar or gelatin , \n the stiffness of the material is provided by a network of entangled polymers @xcite . under strain \n , these polymers are stretched further away from equilibrium , although not necessarily to the point of failure . \n because polymers are subject to thermal fluctuations , even a sub - critical strain can be triggered by a sufficiently large thermal fluctuation . \n this is the mechanism behind delayed fracture , whereby there is an exponential distribution of waiting times ( indicating a poisson process ) before which a strained material fractures . this has been directly observed in both stiffer gelatin rods ( @xmath7  kpa ) @xcite and in vibration - controlled experiments in this system . \n ( color online ) definition sketch of a fluid - filled crack of length @xmath4 driven by a pressure head @xmath8 . \n , scaledwidth=37.0% ]    once a fracture is initiated , fluid begins to flow into the crack tip and the crack propagates outward ( away from the central droplet ) until the reservoir of fluid is exhausted . \n we develop a two - dimensional model for the asymptotic propagation of a mode i fracture driven by a pressure head @xmath8 . a schematic \n is shown in figure  [ fig : fracture ] . \n to begin , we consider an incipient crack of length @xmath9 , filled with an inviscid fluid of density @xmath10 , propagating into an elastic solid.in this section , we model the solid as either i ) a linear elastic material or ii ) an incompressible neo - hookean material , as is typically used for polymeric gels , and contrast the computed propagation rates . \n we assume the capillary pressure head @xmath11 at the fluid reservoir @xmath12 is greater than the elastic stress in the solid in front of that reservoir , so as to drive fluid into the crack tip . \n the flow @xmath13 of this inviscid fluid is governed by bernoulli s law , @xmath14 and , hence , driven by the gradient in fluid pressure @xmath15 , which is related to the elastic stress induced by deformations of the crack surface . \n here we assume there is no ambient stress field in the elastic solid , or the substrate is not pre - stressed \n . the localized stress ( pressure ) field near the crack tip @xmath16 of a linear elastic solid has the well - known asymptotic form @xcite , @xmath17    for an incompressible neo - hookean solid , the asymptotic stress field is given by @xcite , @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are stress intensity factors for a linear elastic and incompressible neo - hookean solid , respectively . \n in general , @xmath19 is a function of the crack geometry and far - field loading conditions , but we may simplify our model by utilizing several experimental observations . \n recent experiments have demonstrated self - healing behavior of fluid - filled cracks in soft substrates @xcite . \n this observation is characteristic of stable , or transport - limited , crack growth . \n that is , the speed of crack growth is limited by the extent to which the fluid can be supplied ( transported ) to the crack tip . for reference , unstable crack growth \n would be controlled by the speed of an elastic wave in the solid , a characteristic which is not observed experimentally . \n hereafter , we assume the crack propagates in the marginal state @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fracture toughness , consistent with stable crack growth . \n we apply bernoulli s law ( [ bernoulli ] ) using the crack tip ( state 1 ) and a point upstream ( state 2 ) to derive an equation relating the crack - tip velocity @xmath23 to the pressure gradient in the linear elastic solid ( [ fstress ] ) :    @xmath24    whose solution gives @xmath25 this predicts a characteristic exponent of @xmath26 for the growth of the arm . \n a similar relationship is derived for an incompressible neo - hookean solid by applying the respective stress field ( [ nhstress ] ) instead : @xmath27 for this system , the characteristic exponent is instead @xmath28 : @xmath29    note that both constitutive models predict power law behavior , but the neo - hookean model is able to reproduce the universal exponent @xmath30 observed experimentally @xcite . \n we attribute this result to the observation that the gel substrate is incompressible and that the large scale deformation of the soft solid are more aptly described by the nonlinear neo - hookean constitutive law . \n ( color online ) histogram for the crack length exponent @xmath31 with mean @xmath32 . \n , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    because the gels are spatially - heterogeneous , cracks nucleate with different widths and propagate at varying rates . \n we fit the length of each fracture arm to the form @xmath33 and examine the distribution of @xmath31 values observed . \n no systematic variation with material parameters was found for the values of @xmath31 , but the width of the crack determines the pre - factor @xmath34 @xcite . \n for this same data set of @xmath35 individual arms , we find that @xmath36 ( standard error ) . \n the full probability distribution is show in figure  [ fig : alpha ] , which allows for comparison to the @xmath37 ( neo - hookean ) and @xmath38 ( linear elastic ) constitutive models . \n we have analyzed the deformations of a soft elastic substrate induced by the liquid / solid interactions with a liquid droplet , as well as the propagation of a fluid - filled crack in a soft elastic medium . \n the deformations associated with a corrugated contact - line yield a critical disturbance with wavenumber @xmath5 that generates the largest elastic response within the substrate . \n we quantify the response with the tangential displacement , a failure criteria which we correlate with the initiation of a starburst fracture ( see figure  [ fig : intro ] ) . \n computations reveal that the location of the unbalanced contact - line force is the most important parameter in wavenumber selection . \n our theoretical predictions compare favorably to i ) previously - reported experiments with fixed volume droplets @xcite and ii ) experiments where the contact - angle @xmath39 is fixed and the droplet volume @xmath40 is varied , thereby confirming our interpretation of the initiation process . \n our model also predicts that the substrate thickness @xmath41 is also an important parameter in wavenumber selection , an observation which we see in experiments . for the crack propagation problem \n , we develop a model by considering the transport of an inviscid fluid into the crack tip of either a linear elastic or incompressible neo - hookean solid . \n while both elastic models yield power law growth , the neo - hookean model predicts the crack length grows with universal exponent @xmath0 and does not scale with any material parameters , consistent with experimental observations @xcite . \n studies on fracture necessarily take place on materials which are strong enough to resist fracture until the point when the measurement is made . however , many biological materials are soft enough that conventional fracture measurements are not possible because the material is too weak to support its own weight . \n the present study suggests that by depositing a droplet of known size and wettability , it could be possible to use starburst fractures to measure the fracture toughness of very soft materials so long as they remain fully supported by the dish . furthermore , because the growth rate of fractures is sensitive to whether or not the material is linear - elastic , this could also provide a new method for materials characterization . \n the authors are grateful for support from the national science foundation under grant number dms-0968258 , as well as nc state s undergraduate research office , to michael shearer for valuable discussions , and to mark schillaci for preliminary experiments useful in formulating the model . \n tadashi kajiya , adrian daerr , tetsuharu narita , laurent royon , francois lequeux , and laurent limat . \n advancing liquid contact line on visco -

21  kev and an optical depth of @xmath13  2 , without any thermal component . according to our present understanding , the black - body component in the soft state could originate at both the neutron star surface or boundary layer and the surface of an optically - thick accretion disk . \n the comptonization component in the hard state may arise from a corona above the disk and/or between the disk and the stellar surface and accretion probably assumes the form of a truncated outer accretion disk ( olive et al . \n the origin of these spectral changes is not clear , the thermal temperature ( @xmath00.3 - 0.5 kev ) confirm that the accretion disk is ionized and should not be subject to the standard ionization instability ( done et al . \n 2007 ) . \n the far - ultraviolet photometry obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ has shown the same periodicity described here ( zurek et al . \n these timing properties seen in uv / optical observations and the eclipse observed in the x -

and binary phase detector is activated for small phase error , to avoid the dead zone issue . \n adaptive gain feature allows filter gain to be changed , according to input phase error magnitude .          during loop transient in hybrid pll , \n linear pfd is active as error - detection block for major portion of settling time . \n this results in loop settling curve to follow linear response , as per eqn . \n ( [ eqn : adpll_tf ] ) ( which represents system response for linear pll system ) . \n so , in case of hybrid pll also , linear trade - off between settling time and jitter is observed in behavioral simulation with varied @xmath23 , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : a1_pll_dco_tradeoff ] .      in hybrid pll , non - linear bang - bang phase detector is activated only when loop reaches near to locked state . \n therefore , reducing loop filter gain in bang - bang phase detection mode , can reduce jitter without significant linear increase in settling time . \n this overall performance improvement is verified by simulating hybrid pll verilog - a model , with varied filter coefficients in binary phase detection mode . \n simulation results in fig . \n [ fig : a1_pll_filt_tradeoff ] shows that jitter reduces with reduced filter gain ( while binary phase detector is active in settled state ) , without significantly increasing settling time ( since , lock time is mainly governed by loop parameters while pfd is active ) . \n so , this kind of pll design , wherein all the specifications ( lock time / jitter / power ) could be simultaneously improved , can be benchmarked as having higher figure of merit . \n pll performance analysis for different pll architectures , in sec . \n [ sec : bbpll]-[sec : hybrid_pll ] , shows inverse relation that settling time and jitter holds with loop gain . considering lock time vs. jitter performance observed in linear pll system , \n it is proposed to include settling time in figure of merit equation , in same ratio as jitter , as shown in eqn . \n ( [ eqn : fom_adpll ] ) . \n @xmath31\\ ] ] \n table-[tab : result_cmp ] uses results of existing pll architectures ( designed in 180nm-90 nm technology , with output frequency in 0.5ghz-1.8ghz range ) , to compare performance benchmarking done with commonly used figure of merit versus proposed figure of merit in this work .    in table-[tab : \n result_cmp ] , performance comparison for 130nm/90 nm designs , indicates that for pll @xcite@xcite achieving lowest jitter at the cost of large settling time , existing fom@xcite proves as an inadequate benchmark by ignoring lock time performance degradation . \n similarly , performance comparison for 180 nm designs , indicates that pll@xcite having lowest settling time at the cost of increased jitter is benchmarked for having lowest performance with fom defined in @xcite ( which does not considers reduced lock time as improved pll performance parameter ) . \n proposed figure of merit , on the other hand , correctly marks pll designs for their overall performance , by considering inverse relation existing between settling time and jitter ( as indicated in table-[tab : result_cmp ] ) . \n .perfomance benchmarking for pll architectures [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig . \n [ fig : new_fom ] shows performance of existing pll designs , with consideration to lock time , along with output jitter and power dissipated by pll system . \n in this work , with analysis and behavioral simulation of different pll architectures , trade - off between settling time and jitter is shown . since \n , most pll designs are able to achieve low jitter only at the cost of increased settling time , therefore , it is proposed to include lock time also as performance parameter in figure of merit for pll . \n xiang gao ;

{"ContextTokens": 3844, "GeneratedTokens": 218, "SynthesizedBody": "the first known supernova observed with vlbi was the type ii supernova 1979c , which was only the second supernova detected in the radio , and bartel ( 1985 ) reported a determination of its angular size . \n the first vlbi image identified as that of a supernova was one of 41.95 + 575 in m82 by wilkinson & de bruyn ( 1984 ) , although the recent results have cast some doubt on the identification as a supernova ( mcdonald et al . \n bartel et al .  ( \n 1987 ) published a higher resolution image of 41.95 + 575 , and then bartel et al . \n ( 1991 ) published an image of sn  1986j . \n since then , radio imaging of approximately ten supernovae has been carried out ( see table  1 below ) , where i use the word `` imaging '' somewhat loosely , meaning supernova for which we have some morphological information , including size determinations , from radio observations . \n i will attempt to briefly summarize the state of radio supernova ( rsn ) imaging . \n radio imaging is an important tool for the study of supernovae , at least those that are radio bright , ie . \n if fact , vlbi radio observations are presently the only means to directly image the expanding shell of any supernova much farther away than sn  1987a . the radio emission is generated as the expanding shell of supernova ejecta interacts with the progenitor star s circumstellar medium ( csm ) which generally consists of its stellar wind . \n the expanding shell of ejecta generates two shocks , a forward shock which propagates into the csm and a reverse shock which propagates into the stellar ejecta . \n chevalier ( 1990 and references therein ) showed that in the case of density distributions for the csm and the ejecta that are power laws in radius , the solution is self - similar and the supernova shell expands such that its radius , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is time since the explosion and the parameter @xmath3 is commonly known as the deceleration parameter . \n the value of @xmath3 will depend on the density distributions of both the csm and of the ejecta , and @xmath4 indicates free expansion . \n = 0.60    = 0.86    the interaction region between the ejecta and the csm is an important laboratory for studying shock acceleration , since supernovae are thought to be responsible for the majority of cosmic rays \n . we can also learn about both the supernova and the csm . \n furthermore , since the speeds of the ejecta are usually several orders of magnitude faster than those typical of red giant winds , the supernova shock over - runs the wind , and thus the interaction region acts like a time - machine , and has the potential to reveal the last thousands of years of the progenitor s wind history . finally , by equating the angular expansion velocity measured with vlbi with the radial expansion velocity measured spectroscopically , a direct , geometric distance determination can be made ( see bartel & bietenholz , this volume ; bartel 1985 ) . \n the early vlbi observations of sn  1979c and sn  1986j allowed measurement of their sizes and determination of their expansion curves . figure  [ bieten_f86exp ] shows the expansion curve to date of sn  1986j ( see bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2002 ; for sn  1979c , see bartel & bietenholz , this volume ) . \n a power law , as suggested by the chevalier mini - shell model , indeed provides a good fit to the data , with @xmath5 ( but see prez - torres et al . \n 2002 for a different result ) . \n a radio image of sn  1986j is shown in figure  [ bieten_fgallery ] . \n several decades - old supernovae have been observed in m82 ( see e.g. , mcdonald et al . \n 2001 ) , and images of two are shown in figure  [ bieten_fgallery ] . for 43.31 + 592 , \n @xmath3 could be determined to be 0.7 . \n radio images of sn  1987a have been obtained using the australia telescope ( see manchester et al . \n 2002 ) and are also shown in figure  [ bieten_fgallery ] . \n its expansion can be shown to have been strongly decelerated . \n = 0.85    = 0.93    by far the best studied rsn so far is sn  1993j in the nearby spiral galaxy m81 . \n two independent vlbi campaigns have observed it extensively ( see bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2003 ; bartel et al . \n 2000 ; and marcaide et al . \n 2002b , 1997 ; and references therein ) . \n the quality of the data allowed both vlbi groups to independently determine departures from simple power - law expansion , with bartel et al . \n ( 2002 ) reporting that @xmath6 was near unity early on , decreased to @xmath70.8 by @xmath8  d , and then increased slightly after that ( see figure  [ bieten_f93exp ] ) . \n mioduszewski , dwarkadas , & ball ( 2001 ) performed simulations of an expanding supernova shell , based on a particular model of the ejecta profile , and found changes in @xmath6 remarkably similar to those in fact observed for sn  1993j ( e.g. , bartel et al . \n after 10 years , sn  1993j has slowed to less than half its original expansion velocity , which implies that the swept up material is now comparable in mass to the ejecta , and for reasonable mass - loss rates of the progenitor , suggests that the ejecta have a relatively low mass of @xmath9 , and that the progenitor had lost most its envelope mass to a binary companion prior to the supernova explosion . \n the images of sn  1993j , shown in figure  [ bieten_f93img ] show a wealth of detail ( see http://www.yorku.ca/bartel/snmovie.html for a movie of the expanding supernova ) . in projection \n , the supernova has remained very circular , and phase referencing has shown that it expands isotropically from the explosion center to within 5.5% ( bietenholz , et al . \n 2001 , 2003 ) . \n the shell structure is clearly visible in all the adequately resolved images . \n there are , however , distinct departures from circular symmetry even at the earliest resolved epochs , where there is a pronounced minimum to the west and a maximum to the east - southeast ( fig . \n [ bieten_f93img ] ) . even after 10 years \n , no sign of a pulsar nebula has yet been seen at the center . \n however , it seems probable that the ejecta in the interior of the shell are dense enough that the radio optical depth due to free - free absorption will remain large for several decades , and hence obscure any emerging pulsar nebula . \n l l c c c c l c name & host & distance&type & expansion & @xmath10 & morphology & ref.@xmath11 + & galaxy & & & speed & + & & ( mpc ) & & ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath0 ) & + sn 1979c & m100 & 16 & ii & 12 & 0.95 & circular & 3 + sn 1980k & ngc6946 & 6 & ii & @xmath13 & & & 1 + sn 1986j & ngc891 & 10 & ii & 6 & 0.7 & distorted shell & 5 + 41.95 + 575@xmath14 & m82 & 3 & & @xmath15 & & asymmetric & 7 + 43.31 + 592 & m82 & 3 & & 9.7 & 0.7 & circular shell & 7 + 44.01 + 596@xmath14 & m82@xmath16 & 3 & & & & circular shell & 7 + sn 1987a & lmc & 0.05 & iipec & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & circular shell & 6 + sn 1993j & m81 & 4 & ii & 8.5 & 0.81 & circular shell & 2 + sn 1994i & m51 & 8 & ic & @xmath19 & & & 4 + sn 2001gd & ngc5033 & 13 & ii & @xmath20 & & & 8 +    table  1 gives an overview of the characteristics of the rsne for which we have some morphological information . of the well - resolved supernovae , all but 41.95 + 575 , whose identification as a supernova is uncertain , show a discernible , fairly circular shell morphology . \n the observed shell structures are clear evidence that the bulk of the radio emission originates from the interaction of the expanding shells with their surroundings , rather than from nebulae around the young pulsars , as had also been suggested . despite the relatively circular shells , \n significant intensity modulation with position angle seems the norm . \n none of the imaged rsne show a clear case of bisymmetric structure , as might be expected from axisymmetric stellar winds . \n there is evidence , however , most compelling from sn  1986j , for some more asymmetric structure , possibly in the form of protrusions or jets . \n the origin of the asymmetries and protrusions is not yet well understood . \n the observed mostly circular morphologies , do , however , suggest mostly spherical shells , which allow direct distance determinations to be made ( e.g. , bartel & bietenholz , this volume ; bartel 1985 ) . \n power - law expansion curves , with @xmath21 , provide a first order fit to all supernovae whose sizes have been determined over a reasonable time baseline except for sn  1987a , which is probably in a much lower density environment than the other radio - bright supernovae . \n however , at least in the case of sn  1993j , distinct departures from strict power - law expansion can be seen , implying significant structure in the ejecta and/or the csm . in both \n sn  1993j and sn  1986j , the source structure has been shown to change non self - similarly as the supernova expands . \n there is an intriguing change in the radio spectrum of sn  1986j , with a new spectral component that peaks at @xmath2220  ghz emerging after @xmath2210  yr , possibly related to a new compact component in the images , that may perhaps be related to a pulsar nebula ( see bietenholz et al . \n 2002 ) . \n there is still considerable scope for the more detailed understanding of supernova shell dynamics , and for determining the structure of the csm and of the ejecta through hydrodynamic simulations , particularly in the case of sn  1993j where exceptionally good data are on hand . \n currently , there are only a couple of rsne per decade that are close enough and bright enough to image . \n future improvements in sensitivity , e.g. , the mark  iv vlbi recording system , the evla , and the ska , will allow us to image somewhat more rsne , but will only enable a modest increase in the resolution available to global vlbi ( by going to higher observing frequencies ) . \n the practical distance limit is on the order of 30  mpc , where global vlbi at 22  ghz gives a linear resolution of @xmath238000  au . \n there have been approximately 8 rsne per decade with a 22-ghz flux density @xmath24  mjy since 1980 , so even with the ska , the number of rsne available for imaging will be limited . \n it will therefore be important to image those rsne that are available to us , since they will provide us with direct distance estimates , test our understanding of the supernova process , which may be crucial to understanding the distant , un - resolved supernovae upon which cosmological results are based , and allow us to probe the circumstellar environments and thus the wind - history of evolved stars , and allow us maybe to see the birth of a pulsar nebula . \n bartel , n. 1985 in supernovae as distance indicators , lecture notes in physics , ed . \n n. bartel ( berlin : springer verlag ) , 107 bartel , n. , et al . \n 1987 , , 323 , 505 bartel , n. , rupen , m. p. , shapiro i. i. , preston , r. a. , & rius , a. 1991 , nature , 350 , 212 bartel , n. , et  al . \n 2000 , science , 287 , 112 bartel , n. , et al . \n 2002 , , 581 , 404 bartel , n. , & bietenholz , m. f. 2003 , , 591 , 301 bietenholz , m. f. , bartel , n. , & rupen , m. p. 2001 \n , , 557 , 770 bietenholz , m. f. , bartel , n. , & rupen , m. p. 2002 \n , , 581 , 1132 bietenholz , m. f. , bartel , n. , & rupen , m. p. 2003 \n , , 597 , 374 chevalier , r. a. 1990 , in supernovae , ed . \n a. petschek ( berlin :  springer ) , 91 manchester , r. n. , et al . \n 2002 , publ .  the astr .  soc . of australia , 19 , 207 mcdonald , a. r. , et al . \n 2001 , , 322 , 100 marcaide , j.  m. , et  al . \n 1997 , , 486 , l31 marcaide , j. m. , et  al .  2002a , , 384 , 408 marcaide , j.  m. , et  al . \n 2002b , in proc . \n of the european vlbi network symp . \n , eds .  e. ros , r. w. porcas , a. p. lobanov & j. a. zensus , 239 mioduszewski , a. j. , dwarkadas , v. v. , & ball , l. 2001 , , 562 , 869 pedlar , a. , et al . \n 1999 , mnras , 307 , 761 prez - torres , m. a. , et al . \n 2002 , , 335 , l23 prez - torres , m. a. , et al . \n 2003 , in proceedings of iau coll.192 : supernovae , _ in press _ \n wilkinson p. n. , & de bruyn , a. g. 1984 , , 211 , 593", "StartTimeOffset": 1648347079879, "RequestID": "303774602a41441d814d0f135912b56c", "TotalTokens": 4062}

see also chapter 26 of misner et al . \n 1973 and the references therein ) , and have been applied to several equations of state ( see for example meltzer & thorne  1966 ) . \n these works were mainly motivated by consideration of stellar stability because general relativistic effects tend to destabilize stellar models @xcite .    on the other hand , \n the effect of rotation on stellar oscillations is less well understood in a general relativistic context . as in the non - axisymmetric mode case , \n the slow rotation approximation has been the only accessible way for investigating the eigenmode behaviour of rotating stars @xcite . \n recently , numerical relativistic hydrodynamic codes have been developed by several authors and some numerical simulations of rapidly rotating stars have been carried out . \n stergioulas et al .   and font et al . \n have shown that initial small perturbations around an equilibrium star evolved to a superposition of normal mode oscillations ( note that their hydrodynamic simulation is done in the fixed background spacetime . \n on the other hand , shibata et al .   have solved the full system of einstein equations to investigate the dynamical stability of rapidly rotating stars . ) . \n although the excitation and evolution of these modes in realistic situations should be investigated by time dependent hydrodynamic simulations , it is also important to study the mode behaviour along rotational equilibrium sequences by using linear perturbation theory . \n so far we have studied a few sets of non - axisymmetric eigenmodes of rotating stars in general relativity ( f - modes by yoshida & eriguchi  1997,1999 ; p - modes by yoshida  1999 ( unpublished ; presented at the 9th yukawa international seminar black holes and gravitational waves - new eyes in the 21st century- ) ) . \n these results have been obtained within the cowling approximation in which euler perturbations of the metric coefficients have been neglected ( see mcdermott et al . \n 1983 and finn  1988 for a definition ; see lindblom and splinter  1990 for the accuracy of the method when applied to non - radial modes of spherical stars ) . \n apart from some low order modes , these results are in good agreement with those of the full perturbation theory including metric perturbations ( for comparison of the eigenfrequencies for slowly rotating stars , see yoshida & kojima  1997 ; for comparison of the neutral points of the cfs instability , see yoshida & eriguchi  1999 which compare the results with the one obtained by full computation of stergioulas & friedman  1998 and morsink et al . \n 1999 )    it is therefore natural to expect that the cowling approximation could also be successfully applied to the _ quasi - radial _ modes which are the smooth extensions of the radial modes of spherical stars to rotating stars . in the present paper , we study quasi - radial modes by using the cowling approximation . \n contrary to the expectations , our results indicate that _ computations with this approximation can not reproduce the relativistic instability of spherical stars . \n _ this is plausible because the instability is essentially caused by the loss of balance between gravity and the pressure gradient , and in calculations of it even the small corrections of gravity can not be neglected . moreover \n , the phase cancellation of the perturbed gravitational potentials , which may be effective in the case of non - axisymmetric modes , can not be expected to happen for radial modes . \n see the appendix of the present paper for the comparison of two methods in the case of radial modes of non - rotating stars . \n although the validity of cowling approximation for rotating stars is not fully assessed , we here _ expect _ that at least a qualitative picture of the eigenmode dependence on stellar rotation could be studied by this approximation . \n the equation of state used here is the polytropic one , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the rest mass density , energy density and pressure of the stellar matter , respectively . \n geometrized units , @xmath4 , are adopted in this paper as well as @xmath5 , following font et al .  . \n the constant @xmath6 is the polytropic index . \n the adiabatic exponent of the perturbed matter is assumed to coincide with @xmath7 . \n the factor @xmath8 is another constant . \n each equilibrium sequence is computed with @xmath8 and @xmath6 fixed .    in the present study \n polar - like coordinates are used and the metric components are written as : @xmath9 the rotational axis is located at @xmath10 . \n the coordinates used in the actual numerical computation are surface - fitted ones @xmath11 which are defined as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the form of the stellar surface in equilibrium . \n the numerical method used here is basically the same as that in yoshida & eriguchi   where non - axisymmetric modes were investigated . \n a minor modification is needed to obtain the axisymmetric modes . in the case of non - axisymmetric modes , \n the eulerian variable @xmath14 is explicitly set to zero at the centre of the star ( @xmath15 is the eulerian variation of the pressure ) . in the case of axisymmetric modes , however , this is not the case since the regularity of the solution requires @xmath16 to be zero at the stellar centre . \n therefore we simply modify the finite - difference scheme at the innermost grid points in our numerical code . \n moreover to avoid the coordinate singularity on the rotation axis , points on the axis are excluded from the computational region . \n most of the results shown in this paper are computed with a resolution of 40 uniformly distributed gridpoints in the radial @xmath17 direction and 10 in the angular @xmath18 one . \n the computational region is a quarter of the meridional section of stars , thus the range of the radial and the angular coordinates are @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    in figs . \n [ n05freq ] and [ n15freq ] the eigenfrequencies of the axisymmetric modes are plotted against the rotational frequency of the equilibrium model . \n the model parameters are tabulated in table [ eqmodel ] . \n .parameters of the stellar model . here \n @xmath21 is the rest mass density at the stellar centre , which is fixed as constant along the sequence . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gravitational mass and the mass - to - radius ratio , where @xmath24 is the circumferential radius . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ compare1d ]      comparing with the eigenfunctions of non - axisymmetric modes , we notice that the eigenfunctions of quasi - radial modes change their shapes significantly along rotational equilibrium sequences . \n for example , the radial distributions of the eulerian pressure perturbation and the radial component of the velocity perturbation change considerably near the equatorial plane of the star . the number of radial nodes of these functions increases as the stellar rotation rate increases . on the other hand , \n the overall radial dependence of the @xmath25-component of the velocity perturbation changes little as the star spins up . \n therefore we can use the shape of this function as a tracer of the selected mode along the equilibrium sequence . \n the nomenclature of mode sequences is based upon the behaviour of the mode of a non - rotating star to which the sequence is continued smoothly . \n in addition to the polytropic case presented here , we have tried to compute quasi - radial modes of realistic neutron stars by using some of the candidate zero temperature equations of state . \n however it was rather difficult to obtain full sequences of these modes with our method . \n as the star begins to rotate , the convergence to the quasi - radial modes suddenly becomes much more difficult \n . this may partly be due to the fact that these modes are sensitive ( as compared with the non - radial modes ) to the surface condition of the equilibrium star . \n unfortunately , in the case of more realistic eos , the adiabatic exponent is subject to large oscillations , becoming negative in some parts . \n these large variations decrease considerably the accuracy of our method which then becomes inadequate . \n we thank luciano rezzolla for detailed comments on the manuscript , and john miller for his help to improve it . \n we also thank kji ury for useful discussions . \n bardeen j. m. , thorne k. s. , meltzer d. w. , 1966 , apj , 145 , 505 chandrasekhar s. , 1964 , phys . \n , 12 , 114 , 437 clement m. j. , 1986 , apj , 301 , 185 finn l. s. , 1988 , mnras , 232 , 259 font j. a. , stergioulas n. , kokkotas k. , 2000 , mnras , 313 , 678 fowler w. a. , 1964 , rev . \n 36 , 549 and 1104 hartle j. b. , friedman j. l. , 1975 , apj , 196 , 653 lindblom l. , splinter r. j. , 1990 , apj , 348 , 198 mcdermott p. n. , van horn h. m. , sholl j. f. , 1983 , apj , 268 , 837 meltzer d. w. , thorne k. s. , 1966 , apj , 145 , 514 misner c. w. , thorne k. s. , wheeler j. a. , 1973 , gravitation . \n freeman , san francisco morsink s. , stergioulas n. , blattnig s. r. , 1999 , apj , 510 , 854 shibata m. , baumgarte t. w. , shapiro s. l. , 2000 , phys . rev . , d61 , 44012 stergioulas n. , font j. a. , kokkotas k. , 2000 , in aubourg , e. , montmerle , t. , paul , j. peter , p. , eds , proceedings of the 19th texas symposium on relativistic astrophysics , nucl \n , 80 ( in cd -

{"ContextTokens": 3116, "GeneratedTokens": 171, "SynthesizedBody": "gravitational microlensing can be used to detect extra - solar planets orbiting distant stars @xcite with relatively large photometric signals as long as the angular planetary einstein ring radius is not much smaller than the angular size of the source star @xcite . for giant source stars in the galactic bulge , however , the signals of earth - mass planets are largely washed out by their large angular size , but galactic bulge main sequence stars are small enough to allow the detection of planets with masses as low as @xmath2 .    this fact has led to suggestions that ground - based microlensing surveys might be able to measure the abundance of earth - like planets @xcite . however , the initial estimates of the sensitivity of such a survey neglected the blending of main sequence source stars in the bulge that is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig - image ] . \n the brightness of the source stars was over - estimated , and it was not realized that the actual source stars were blended with several other stars of similar brightness in ground - based images . \n more realistic estimates of the sensitivity of the proposed ground - based extra - solar planet searches indicated very poor sensitivity to terrestrial planets @xcite , and suggested that only a space - based survey @xcite could discover a significant number of earth - like planets .    in this paper \n , we simulate the most capable ground - based microlensing survey that could reasonably be attempted : a network of three 2-m class wide field - of - view telescopes spanning the globe in the southern hemisphere that are dedicated to the microlensing planet search survey for four years . \n many of the details of our simulations have been described in @xcite , but there are additional details that must be added to describe the observing conditions at ground - based observatories . \n i assume that the microlensing survey telescopes are located at the best existing observatory sites in chile ( paranal ) , south africa ( sutherland ) , and australia ( siding springs ) . for paranal , actual seeing and cloud cover records are available from the eso web site . \n the sutherland site in south africa has conditions similar to la silla in chile ( peter martinez , private communication ) , so the eso records for la silla ( offset by 1 year ) were used as a proxy for sutherland . \n standard airmass and wavelength correction formulae @xcite were used to convert the eso seeing data to seeing estimates for bulge observations in the i - band , and the sky brightness was calculated following @xcite .    for the observations from australia , \n the 1997 - 1999 seeing records from the macho project have been used since the mt . \n stromlo observatory and siding springs have very similar seeing . to compensate for the optical effects of the macho telescope , 0.8 \n was subtracted in quadrature from all the macho telescope seeing values . \n the number of clear nights was adjusted slightly to meet the long term averages for each site as listed in @xcite . \n an important input to this simulation is the systematic crowded field photometry errors that are assigned . \n the ogle - iii ews data @xcite provides a set of photometry for stars with brightness varying in a predictable way ( due to microlensing ) using the most accurate crowded field photometry method devised to date @xcite . by fitting to point - source , \n single - lens light curves to the 2002 ogle - iii ews data for stars brighter than @xmath3 , we find an assumed systematic error of 0.7% of the total flux at the psf peak of each star seems to give fit @xmath4 . \n the systematic errors appear to be larger for fainter stars or for other data sets , but i adopt this as a systematic error estimation formula . \n this systematic error implies a limit to the useful size of a microlensing planet search survey telescope . \n once the systematic error dominates , it is no longer useful to go to a larger telescope . \n our simulation results yield an optimal telescope aperture of about 2-m with a 6 sq . \n deg .  field - of - view ( fov ) . \n larger telescopes could detect some more planets by cycling between two or more fields , but the gain is not large because of the rapid decrease in the microlensing rate away from the central galactic bulge . \n [ fig - bad - lc1 ] shows an example of two light curves that would be considered planet detections by the criteria of @xcite for a space - based survey ( a @xmath5 improvement for the planetary lensing model over the best single lens model ) . \n but the uneven data quality due to seeing variations and cloud cover imply that the planetary parameters can not be constrained . \n thus , while the planetary signal is detectable for these events , terrestrial planets can not be discovered with data like this . \n the situation is only slightly better for the events shown in fig . \n [ fig - bad - lc2 ] , where the poor seeing in australia , and low s / n of the planetary deviation conspire to prevent determinations of the planetary masses . \n of course , sometimes a planetary signal will be seen during good observing conditions , yielding light curves that can accurately determine the planetary parameters . \n this is the case for the two events shown in fig . \n [ fig - good - lc ] . \n generally , such events have planetary deviations that occur at high magnification , such as the event on the left or have large amplitude deviations like the event on the right . \n intermediate between the poorly covered planetary detections shown in figs . \n [ fig - bad - lc1][fig - bad - lc2 ] and the well covered planetary discoveries shown in figs . \n [ fig - good - lc ] are the light curves shown in fig .  [ fig - fair - lc ] . in both cases , \n the planetary parameters can be formally determined . \n however for the event on the left , the source star brightness is only @xmath6 . \n if the photometry errors are not random , as is likely for systematic errors , then the brightness of the source star can not be determined from the light curve fit . \n hence , the planetary parameters will be poorly constrained . for the light curve on the right \n , the parameters can be determined despite the relatively poor coverage of the deviation because the deviation shape contains redundant information . \n however , the poor light curve coverage means that the redundancy can not be used to confirm the interpretation of the event . \n this is a serious drawback because the planet discovery can not be confirmed in any other way . \n it is clear from figs . \n [ fig - bad - lc1]-[fig - good - lc ] it is sensible to consider two different categories of detected planetary events : `` detected '' planets and `` discovered '' planets . \n the `` detected '' category includes all planets with planetary signals that provide at least a @xmath7 improvement over the best single lens fit . \n clearly , the events shown in fig .  [ fig - good - lc ] should be in the `` discovered '' while those shown in figs . \n [ fig - bad - lc1 ] and [ fig - bad - lc2 ] should not be in this category . \n we define the planet `` discovered '' category with the following criteria . \n each planetary light curve deviation is split up into 1 - 3 separate deviation regions of positive or negative magnification with respect to the single lens curve with the same parameters . \n the first and last regions are considered be begin and end when the deviation reaches the with 10% of the maximum planetary deviation or 0.3% of single lens magnification . for a planet `` discovery '' , each the observations must cover at least 40% of each planetary deviation region , and at least 60% of each total deviation . \n all measurements are considered to contribute the light curve coverage unless their error estimates are larger than one third of the maximum planetary deviation . \n also , because a significant component of the error estimates is a systematic error , we also require that each  discovery \" light curve have at least one measurement that detected the stellar microlensing event by @xmath8 and one measurement that detects the planetary deviation by @xmath9 . with these definitions , about one third of the detected planets \n pass the planet discovery threshold including both the events in fig . \n [ fig - good - lc ] and the light curve on the left side of fig . \n [ fig - fair - lc ] . \n [ fig - det_sep ] compares the sensitivity of a 3-site network of 2m - class ground - based microlensing planet search telescopes vs.  a space - based microlensing planet search telescope that would be appropriate for nasa s discovery program @xcite . at present \n , the cost cap for a discovery mission is $ 360 m , and the ground - based network that i have simulated would be roughly one fifth that cost , including all software development and operational expenses . \n the ground - based survey does the best at separations of 23 au where the planet is near the einstein ring and is detectable in high magnification events . \n the ground - based survey would have about 30 times fewer planet discoveries and 10 times fewer raw detections of terrestrial planets at these separations . at 1 au \n , the advantage of space for planet discoveries is a factor of 100 . \n the number of planet detections as a function of planetary mass fraction are shown in fig . \n [ fig - det_eps ] for planets in earth - like orbits and planets in all orbits . \n the left hand panel indicates that even if earth - like planets in earth - like orbits are quite abundant , the 3-site ground - based survey would only expect to find one with good light curve coverage . \n the ground - based results in fig .  [ fig - det_eps ] are somewhat misleading for @xmath10 because these events can generally be detected with giant source stars , which have not been included in this simulation . \n these would add significantly to the ground - based detections , but would add little to the space - based detections . \n so , for planets with mass fractions about ten times that of the earth , the ground - based survey may have an advantage . \n i have carried out detailed simulations of the most capable ground - based microlensing terrestrial planet search program that could plausibly be attempted . \n the simulated survey employs three 2 m class telescopes spanning the globe in the southern hemisphere which observe the galactic bulge whenever possible for a period of 4 years . \n such a network is about 100 times less sensitive than a space - based survey which might only cost 5 times as much . \n so , without some dramatic improvement in ground - based crowded field photometry , it will not be possible to conduct a microlensing survey to determine the abundance of terrestrial planets in the inner galaxy .    for a gravitational census of terrestrial planets \n , a space - based survey will be required @xcite . as fig . \n [ fig - n_vs_sep ] indicates , such a mission would complete the survey for terrestrial planets that will be started by the kepler mission @xcite which is sensitive to earth - like planets at separations @xmath11au using the transit method . \n a space - based microlensing survey would overlap kepler with sensitivity at @xmath12au , and extend sensitivity to terrestrial planets to all separations including free - floating planets , which may have been ejected from their parent stars during the planetary formation process . \n alard , c. , & lupton , r. h. , 1998 , , 503 , 325 albrow , m. d. , et  al . \n 2001 , , 556 , l113 alcock , c. , et al .  2000 , , 541 , 734 ; ( e ) 557 , 1035 bennett , d. p. , & rhie , s. h. , 1996 , , 472 , 660 bennett , d.  p.  & rhie , s.  h. , 2002 , , 574 , 985 bennett , d.  p. , et  al . \n 2003 , spie , 4854 , 141 borucki , w. j. , et  al . \n 2003 , spie , 4854 , 129 gould , a. , & loeb , a. 1992 , , 396 , 104 krisciunas , c. , & schaefer , b. 1991 , , 103 , 1033 mao , s.  & paczyski , b.  1991 , , 374 , l37 peale , s. j. 2003 , , 126 , 1595 sackett , p. d. , 1997 , astro - ph/9709269 tytler , d. 1996 , in  a road map for the exploration of neighboring planetary systems ( exnps ) , \" jpl report , chap . 7 . \n udalski , a. , 2003 , acta astronomica , 53 , 291 walker , g.  1987 ,  astronomical observations \" , cambridge university press .", "StartTimeOffset": 1661698958759, "RequestID": "461467c665244845bca20c92af337e2f", "TotalTokens": 3287}

channel plate pmts ( mcp - pmt ) and large area avalanche photodiodes ( laapds ) . \n the sipm is another very promising device , which can detect a small amount of light with a very good single photoelectron detection capability . \n here we summarize our first attempt to detect liquid xenon scintillation light with a small sipm immersed in liquid xenon . \n the lxe detector used for the test of the sipm is the same one used for testing different light sensors , including the hamamatsu metal channel pmt@xcite and the laapd@xcite . \n the detector consists of a 6 cm diameter stainless steel electrode with a radioactive alpha source @xmath1am deposited in its center . \n the @xmath8 sipm ( type z , serial number 217 ) was mounted on a teflon support plate facing the source plate . \n a blue led was also mounted on the teflon plate . \n the distance between source and sipm was 4.7 mm . \n the detector was pumped down to a vacuum level of @xmath9 and baked out for 36 hours before filling with lxe . \n xe gas , purified through a saes getter , was condensed in the detector vessel , cooled by a bath of liquid nitrogen and alcohol mixture at @xmath10 . \n fig.[fig : nevis ] shows a schematic of detector , gas system and electronics . \n a scope trace of the blue led signal as detected by sipm is shown in fig . \n [ fig : signal ] . \n the scintillation photons , absorbed by the sipm , produce photoelectrons which are consequently amplified inside the silicon via a geiger mode avalanche . \n the sipm electrical signal is fed into a charge sensitive pre - amplifier , followed by an ortec 450 shaping amplifier . \n a test pulse generator is used to calibrate electronics chain system . \n the great advantage of a sipm is that it is self - calibrating , since its single photoelectron sensitivity can be used for calibration . the resulting low amplitude part of the @xmath2-source spectrum is shown in fig . \n [ fig : lowamp ] . \n note the excellent resolution ( low excess noise factor ) that allows up to 11 photoelecton peaks to be clearly distinguished . \n each single photoelectron peak is fitted using a gaussian function . \n the fitted mean value is plotted versus peak number ( number of photoelectrons ) in fig . \n [ fig : calibr ] , clearly showing a linear behavior . \n am particle scintillations . \n low amplitude part of the spectra.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     is subtracted.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      we have estimated the sipm gain @xmath11 with a calibrated test pulse signal as follows :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the test pulse amplitude and channel number in the mca spectrum , respectively . \n @xmath15 is the capacitance of the charge sensitive pre - amplifier . \n @xmath16 is number of channels corresponding to a single photoelectron and @xmath17 is the elementary electronic charge . \n @xmath18 is the gain of the amplification system used in this measurement . \n based on these values , the sipm gain is estimated to be around @xmath3 at the operation voltage of 52 v.      in fig .

{"ContextTokens": 3958, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "type i ( thermonuclear ) x - ray bursts from six bursters have been found to have episodic , strong oscillations , without any significant evidence of harmonics . for sources from which multiple bursts have been observed , \n not all bursts have exhibited the oscillations . \n the oscillations were first seen in a burst from 4u 1728 - 34 @xcite . in an observation of 200 ksec duration when the source was bursting , \n 12 bursts were seen , 6 of them exhibiting oscillations at about 363 hz . \n so far , when a source has multiple bursts with oscillations , the frequencies are almost the same , so that a frequency identifies the source . \n it is likely that some bursts from many other bursters also exhibit oscillations . in most cases \n , we have no way , yet , of knowing whether a burster is burst active , so that we have not been able to choose to observe it at such a time . \n we also do not know for sure why sometimes the oscillations are not seen , although this seems to be correlated with the strength of the bursts and whether they result in radius expansion of the neutron star .    to display properties of the burst oscillations it is convenient to compute the power spectra of 2 s intervals with a new interval sampled \n every 1/8 s. figure 1 shows an example of a burst with a typical appearance of the oscillations during the course of a burst , with a slight rise in frequency of about 2 hz to a value that stays approximately constant during the decline of the burst . \n sometimes only a portion of this kind of pattern can be seen . even with the change of frequency in some bursts , @xmath0 . in the tails of the bursts \n , it can be @xmath1 .    among the six bursters with burst oscillations \n four also exhibit twin `` kilohertz '' quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) , which drift in frequency with inferred mass accretion rate during an observation . \n table  [ tab : periods ] gives their burst oscillation periods and figure 2 summarizes the relations between oscillation frequencies that have been reported to date . \n the frequencies are plotted with respect to estimated persistent luminosity @xcite , to emphasize that they are approximately independent of it . for 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1702 - 43 \n the difference frequencies of the twin kilohertz peaks are close to the burst frequencies . for 4u 1636 - 53 and ks 1731 - 44 , the difference frequencies are closer to half the burst frequencies . for aql x-1 and a burster in the galactic center , x1743 - 29 , possibly the same as a burster seen previously ( mxb 1743 - 29 ) @xcite , it has not been possible to date to identify two oscillation frequencies in the persistent emission from which to compute a difference . \n .burst oscillation periods [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     neither of the variable persistent emission qpo frequencies is a candidate for the rotation frequency of the neutron star , but the difference frequencies have been linked to the spin frequency @xcite despite the variations in difference frequencies seen for sco x-1 and 4u 1608 - 52 . a strong case has been made that the burst frequencies are directly related to the stellar spin frequency @xcite . for the burst oscillations the variations in frequency for a given source are rather small and explanations appear plausible , as we will discuss . in either case a model in terms of rotation of a neutron star with \n a non - uniform temperature distribution appears reasonable \n . there could be a single hot ( or cold ) spot giving rise to rotational modulation or perhaps a spot associated with each magnetic pole , even if the magnetic fields are much smaller than the @xmath2 g fields of high mass binary accreting neutron stars . in this paper \n we discuss the evidence that the burst frequencies are the rotation frequencies of the neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) . \n other explanations might have been , a priori possible . when a neutron star is hot because of a thermonuclear flash , oscillations in the inner part of a remnant disk , not blown back by the explosion , could obscure part of the glowing star periodically . \n we will see , however , that there are associated oscillations in the temperature , rather than the area , making this explanation less probable . \n the explosion and the transfer of heat to the surface , by a combination of diffusion and convection , could excite oscillation modes of the neutron stars . \n such modes have been studied theoretically @xcite and some have frequencies in the observed range . \n however , there is no compelling reason why the frequency spectrum of the modes would be so simple and estimates of the amount of energy that would be in these oscillations are a small fraction of the amplitudes actually observed . \n we report on our studies of properties of the burst oscillations that tend to confirm interpretation in terms of rotation : the sinusoidal pulse shape , the very high amplitude which can occur at the onset of bursts , the correlation with a temperature oscillation , and coherence of the oscillations through the bursts . \n we have expected theoretically that these neutron stars are rotating fast and the large population of millisecond radio pulsars has implied the existence of progenitors such as lmxb , so that the theoretical implication that we should find such objects is very strong . finally , we address briefly the neutron star properties that the burst observations can strongly constrain . \n the data allow the pulsed amplitude to be tracked during bursts as a function of energy @xcite . \n the spectra of the bursts during the rise can be fit every 0.125 s and yield a color temperature and an apparent radius to better than 10 % during a period when the apparent radius changes by @xmath3 50 % . \n expected corrections to the spectra would make the scale of radius increase larger .    in some bursts \n the oscillations are seen very close to the beginning of the rise in flux , within the first 100 ms . within such time intervals , \n the oscillations are coherent and can be folded on the period . \n fractional amplitudes near and exceeding 50 % are seen both in bursts 4u 1728 - 34 , in which the difference frequency of 363 hz is about the burst frequency , and in bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 , in which the difference frequency of about 255 hz is closer to half the burst frequency of 581 hz . the fractional amplitude decreases strongly as the burst flux rises to the peak . \n this suggests that the thermonuclear burning starts as a localized hot spot on the neutron star and from there spreads around the neutron star . \n calculations have suggested the burning is inhomogeneous @xcite . \n simulations of emission from the surface of a neutron star show that this model can reproduce the observed behavior of the fractional amplitude . \n because the neutron star gravitational field bends light around it the intensity of radiation emitted from a surface hot spot on the neutron star depends on the rotational phase of the spot and the compactness , @xmath4 of the neutron star . here \n @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the stellar mass and radius , respectively . \n this is taken into account in simulations of the expected pulse growth and decay @xcite . \n the more compact the neutron star , that is , the higher is m / r , the more severe is the bending of light , the more smeared the pulse , and the lower would be the modulation of radiation from the surface @xcite . \n thus the high level of modulation of the flux that is observed puts a strong constraint on the compactness of the neutron star . \n the neutron stars must be fairly large . if the intensity is actually from opposing poles of a neutron star , these constraints become almost impossible for known and tested equations of state of nuclear matter . \n this suggests that the hypothesis of two antipodal spots may be untenable . \n we have found no substantial differences between the behavior of the burst oscillations for 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1636 - 53 to contradict the hypothesis that the mechanisms are the same . \n the similarity of the burst rise behavior thus argues in favor of both being the neutron star spin . \n interpretation of the oscillations at the beginning of a burst in terms of a spreading hot spot raises the question of what mechanism causes the oscillations that appear during the decays of bursts . \n there would have to be a remnant or recurring inhomogeneity on the surface of the neutron star . \n possibly what was hot first is now a cooler spot , although conductivity might tend to make the star homogeneous . \n so far at least , there is no evidence there are different numbers of hot spots arising on the neutron star . \n this suggests that the occurrence is not random and a magnetic pole is an obvious candidate .      in cases where the duration of coherent oscillations is long enough and \n the amplitude strong enough , pulse phase spectroscopy is possible . in a burst from 4u 1636 - 53 shown in figure 3 , \n the pulsations for 5 s in the burst decay produce a 6 % modulation in the derived blackbody kt . \n for the burst oscillations to represent the rotation period of the neutron stars , there must be an explanation for the 1 - 2 hz change in frequency observed during bursts , since this can not represent a real change in the angular momentum of the entire neutron star on such a short time scale . \n a model which has been discussed @xcite is that the heated burning layer expands on the order of 10 - 30 m and is not rigidly attached to the neutron star , so that conservation of angular momentum causes the expanded hot material to rotate more slowly than material deeper in . \n it might then wrap around the neutron star about once during the initial second of the burst rise . \n a crude estimate of the height above the surface that the material would have to rise in order to produce such an effect is given by equating the angular momentum of a thin shell at the stellar surface , @xmath6 , and at a slightly higher altitude , @xmath7 , including the correction introduced by the gravitational time dilation from different radii . \n @xmath8    here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the frequencies measured near burst onset and burst decay , respectively . \n an observed frequency lower by 1 hz than a final frequency of 500 hz would correspond to a 10 - 20 m expansion during the rising part of the burst in comparison to the tail of the burst . \n whatever the exact explanation , this serves to illustrate that modest changes in the source of a modulation near the neutron star surface could cause the amount of frequency change observed .    in this model , gradual changes in the pulse peak phases would be seen . \n given a frequency during the tail of the burst and a frequency at the beginning , a frequency derivative can always bridge a gap . but for a given frequency change , the pulses need not remain in phase . \n in fact , zhang et al . \n @xcite apply the frequency derivative seen in a burst from aql x-1 , correct the times to that of the neutron star and find that almost all of the power in the oscillation is recovered , consistent with coherence of the underlying clock . \n the lmxb are part of the old population of stars in the galaxy . \n they have been accreting for a long time compared to high mass x - ray binaries @xcite . \n it was speculated when the low magnetic field millisecond radio pulsars were found that they were recycled pulsars spun up by accretion in lmxb . \n the periods we find are certainly in the approximate region of the periods of the millisecond radio pulsars as shown in figure 4 . \n we do not have firm measurements of the magnetic fields but they have been expected to have surface fields of @xmath11 g and the current data can be interpreted in terms of upper limits on the field of that order @xcite . however , careful estimates of the number of low field millisecond radio pulsars @xcite ( @xmath12 ) imply a birthrate about 10 times the birthrate of lmxb . the long time needed for lmxb to spin up the neutron star ( @xmath13 ) yr \n when accreting at the observed luminosities of only @xmath14 of the eddington limit imply a birth rate insufficient to be responsible for the observed millisecond radio pulsars . \n a large part of that population may have a different origin , perhaps accreting low mass binaries which have a phase of accretion so strong that they are not seen as x - ray sources ( @xcite ) , perhaps actually formed with low magnetic fields . \n a radius expansion burst from 4u 1820 - 30 illustrates the possible information that can be obtained from the bursts . \n spectral fits per 0.125 s show the pattern of temperature and radius changes associated with the flux rising to the eddington limit for hydrogen poor material and then a decay at approximately constant apparent radius after the photosphere has presumably returned to the surface of the neutron star . taking the flux at the start of this decay to give the observed eddington limit at the neutron star radius , the flux and color temperature run during the decay can be fit to the relation calculated by ebisuzaki and nakamura @xcite for the value of the effective temperature at the eddington limit . \n this temperature constrains the mass and radius :    @xmath15^{1/4 } ( 1 - 2gm / rc^2)^{3/8}\\ ] ]    figure 5 shows the results . \n many , but not all bursts from some sources show possible coherent strong oscillations . \n a correlary is that bursts that are observed without oscillations do not imply that oscillations will not be seen on other occasions . \n the period range of @xmath16 ms is about right for these sources eventually becoming some of the recycled millisecond radio pulsars . \n the behavior at onset of the burst suggests probably a single expanding hot spot . in all cases \n so far analyzed , the burst tail frequency is no more than a couple of hz different from the rise frequency , so that the geometry of the emission region must remain essentially the same . \n spectral analysis indicates the parameter varying is the average temperature in view . \n coherence during the burst and the rationale for the small frequency changes needs further study to answer outstanding questions . \n the possibility of using burst spectra and the oscillations to constrain the mass , radius , composition , and distance of the neutron stars holds great promise . \n 9 t. e. strohmayer , w. zhang , j. h. swank , a. p. smale , l. titarchuk , & c. day , apj 469 ( 1996 ) l9 . \n d. j. christian & j. h. swank , apj , 109 ( 1997 ) s177 . \n t. e. strohmayer , k. jahoda , a. b. giles , & u. lee , apj 486 ( 1997 ) 355 . n. e. white & w. zhang , apj , 490 ( 1998 ) l87 . \n t. e. strohmayer , w. zhang , j. h. swank , n. e. white , & i. lapidus , apj , ( 1998 ) in preparation . \n t. e. strohmayer , apj , 388 ( 1992 ) 138 . \n l. bildsten , a. cumming , g. ushomirsky , & c. cutler , in a half century of stellar pulsation interpretations , asp conf . \n 1998 ) in press . t. e. strohmayer , w. zhang , & j. h. swank , apj , 487 ( 1997)l77 . l. bildsten , apj 438 ( 1995 ) 852 . \n w. zhang , k. jahoda , r. l. kelley , t. e. strohmayer , & j. h. swank , apj , ( 1998 ) in press . \n d. battacharya , in x -

{"ContextTokens": 2894, "GeneratedTokens": 75, "SynthesizedBody": "following the well known _ rhetoric _ , photons are weakly coupled to the strongly interacting quarks and gluons . \n photons emitted in a qgp will immediately escape without further interactions in the plasma . \n this immediate `` escape '' will carry useful information on the nature of the supposedly formed plasma , at the emission stage . \n hence the comparison between the _ calculated _ photon spectrum from a qgp and that from a hadron gas medium with the measured photon spectrum in heavy ion collision , after background subtraction , will constitute an evidence in favor of either state of matter . \n + in an optimistic scenario , the plasma will live long enough for thermalization to occur . at a suitable high temperature ( @xmath2 ) , which is not so realistic in present heavy ion collisions , \n the running strong coupling constant @xmath0 will be small . \n + the above framework can be summarized as follows : we have a system in thermal equilibrium with an exact microscopic description in terms of quarks and gluons . in the small coupling constant regime \n , the calculation of the photon spectrum seems to be a straightforward application of perturbation theory . \n this is seemingly a simple situation compared to photon production in proton - proton collision where form - factors show up . \n although photons are weakly coupled to the plasma this description is oversimplified , since the quark that emits the photon is affected by medium effects such as debye screening ; it also acquires a thermal mass which plays a central role in screening infrared divergences . \n medium effects are well described by the hard thermal loop ( htl ) effective theory @xcite . \n so , the htl theory is the natural scheme for calculating the photon production rate in a thermalized qgp . \n + for present ( rhic ) , and near future ( lhc ) , heavy ion collision experiments a more realistic prediction should go beyond the small coupling constant regime . \n this will be briefly discussed at the end of this article . \n in a qgp in local thermal equilibrium , the photon production rate or the number of photons , with momentum @xmath3 , produced per unit time and per unit volume is conveniently expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the photon two point function , calculated in the plasma @xmath4 this formula is valid at lowest order in the electromagnetic coupling , and to all orders in the strong coupling constant . in other words , \n the two point function encodes the essential physics of the plasma , relevant for photon emission . + as mentioned in the previous section , to obtain the photon two point function in a perturbative procedure , the htl theory should be used . the one loop calculation in the effective theory \n was performed some time ago @xcite . \n it was believed that the one loop result gave * the * leading order @xmath0 photon spectrum . \n this belief was based on the success of the effective theory . \n the essence of the effective theory is to reorder the perturbation theory to give a meaning to the equivalence between the loop - wise expansion and the successive orders in the coupling constant . \n the loophole in this equivalence comes from collinear configurations . \n the effective theory does not incorporate a ready - to - use remedy for collinear problems . \n collinearity is kinematical , _ \n i.e. _ it depends on the particular problem of interest , so it is not surprising if the effective theory fails to treat such problems systematically . \n +    it worth mentioning that the underlying physical processes in the one loop diagram are the @xmath5 processes , compton and annihilation . however , it was shown @xcite that bremsstrahlung and the new process of annihilation of an off - shell quark ( on the left of figure [ fig : processes ] ) contribute to leading order . \n these processes appear only at the two loop level in the effective theory . \n the breakdown of the effective theory , two loop is of the same order as one loop , is traced back to the appearance of collinear divergences ( _ i.e. _ the collinear emission of the photon by a quark ) . \n this collinearity is soften by the use of the effective theory which gives a kinematical cutoff denoted by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thermal mass of fermions , provided by the effective theory , and @xmath8 is the quark energy . \n the present form of the cut - off is valid for real and small mass virtual photons ( the real photon case is obtained for @xmath9 ) . \n the dependence of this cut - off on the coupling constant , although it regularizes what would be a collinear singularity , renders the two loop diagrams equally important as the one loop contribution . since , after phase space integration the cut - off @xmath10 appears linearly in the denominator , its @xmath11 dependence cancels the extra powers of the couplings in the two - loop diagrams . \n + it is thus natural to ask whether this breakdown of the effective theory does not propagate to higher loop orders ? \n + simple power counting @xcite indicates that the collinear configuration persists for all ladder diagrams . as a consequence , higher loop diagrams do contribute to the leading @xmath0 order for real photon production . \n hence a resummation of a whole set of gauge invariant diagrams is mandatory . \n in attempt to focus on the underlying physical mechanism which renders higher loop diagrams equally important as the one loop diagram , we calculated @xcite the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor at two loop level with quarks having a finite width . \n this study leads to a simple physical picture . \n photon emission from a quark gluon plasma gives rise to two natural physical scales ( figure [ fig : lpm ] ) :    * the formation length ( time ) @xmath12 , also called the coherence length @xmath13 : @xmath14\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the quark transverse ( compared to photon momentum ) momentum , * the mean free path ( width)@xmath16 : @xmath17    the interplay between these two scales leads to the emergence of different physical regimes :    * the perturbative regime ( @xmath18 ) , where the dominant mechanisms of photon production are compton and annihilation appearing at one loop order in the htl effective theory . \n high dilepton mass spectrum is a typical example of this regime . * \n the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal regime ( @xmath19 ) : it is the region where the formation length is much longer than the mean free path . \n inelastic processes like bremsstrahlung should be considered . \n this leads to coherent photon production , which is responsible for the lpm suppression of the photon spectrum . in this region \n a further resummation is needed to include rescattering . \n real photon production exemplifies this regime . \n the finite width study cited in the previous section , although it provides a nice physical picture , is far from giving the complete photon spectrum . \n a correct approach would consist in re - summing the ladder diagrams mentioned above together with quark propagators with a finite width ( self - energy corrections ) . \n this has been recently carried out @xcite . \n the authors of @xcite showed that important cancellations of long ranged interactions occured between vertex and self - energy diagrams and derived an integral equation with a simple physical interpretation . \n the bottom line of their resummation is to consider the rescattering of an almost on - shell quark in a random gaussian background field . \n the imaginary part of the two point function was found to be : @xmath20\\ ; { { p_0 ^ 2+(p_0+q_0)^2}\\over{2(p_0(p_0+q_0))^2 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\times{\\rm re}\\,\\int { { d^2{\\bf p}_\\perp}\\over{(2\\pi)^2}}\\ ; { \\bf   p}_\\perp\\cdot{\\bf f}({\\bf p}_\\perp ) \\nonumber \\label{eq : amy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath22 is the same as the inverse of the formation time defined before . \n this integral equation reflects the following features :    * the combination @xmath23 $ ] guarantees the cancellation of all infrared behavior ( _ a priori _ non - perturbative ) when @xmath24 . \n * iteration is equivalent to rescattering in the medium with a collision term @xmath25 . * \n the width , discussed in the previous section , could be seen as a part of the collision term . \n we notice again that multiple scatterings are important when the collision integral is of the same order as the @xmath22 term , as was predicted by the model discussed in the previous section . \n the above equation is solved numerically and it is found that rescattering leads to about 25 % suppression of the photon spectrum coming from bremsstrahlung and off - shell scattering . \n hence , although the `` next to one loop '' processes are not as enhanced as was thought originally @xcite they still give important contribution which should be included beside the strict one loop processes to obtain the complete order @xmath0 photon spectrum . + \n recently the collision term was obtained analytically using new sum rules at finite temperature @xcite . \n the collision term is found to be @xmath26 this analytical form allows to circumvent the evaluation of complicated integrals in the original form of the collision term . \n it is also useful for the extension of the above study to the production of low mass dileptons . \n photon production nowadays is known to complete order @xmath0 . \n it is among the rare theoretical calculations going beyond the leading logarithm approximation . \n the resummation done by arnold _ et al _ leads to a picture where one averages over a gaussian background field which goes beyond the classics of static scattering centers extensively used in the literature to model rescattering . \n + it must be emphasized that bremsstrahlung and off - shell annihilation are among the dominant mechanisms for photon production . \n although the resummation has led to a 25 % suppression , the next to one loop processes still give significant contributions which will enhance the photon production rate in a quark - gluon plasma . \n thermal photon production is not the unique source of photons . \n pions , for example , decay into photons giving a very important background . this background should be subtracted in order to isolate the thermal photon production and compare it to photon production in a hadron gas model . on the other hand \n , dilepton production has a different background to be subtracted . \n hence a compilation of photon and dilepton will constitute a tractable mean for `` plasma detection '' . \n + the resummation done in @xcite includes only the transverse photon polarization . \n however , dilepton could receive contributions from the longitudinal polarization sector , hence the extension of the above resummation to dilepton case requires some precautions . \n the necessary resummation for low mass dilepton leads to @xcite ( preliminary results ) @xmath27\\int   \\left[2{\\bf p}_{\\perp}.{\\bf f}({\\bf p}_{\\perp})\\oplus q^2 g({\\bf p}_{\\perp})\\right]\\ ] ] the new scalar function @xmath28 satisfies an equation analogue to that satisfied by @xmath29 . \n the preliminary results for the dilepton rate indicates an lpm type suppression which does not rule out the contribution coming from bremsstrahlung and off - shell annihilation found recently in @xcite . \n + we should stress that the small coupling constant regime is an idealized situation . \n a more realistic coupling constant should not be so small . \n recall that photon emission is dominated by collinear emission , this occurs for almost on - shell quarks . hence quarks can be treated to a good approximation in a quasi - particle model , with masses derived from lattice calculation . \n this is under investigation @xcite .    9 , nucl . phys . * b * * 337 * , 569 ( 1990 ) ; e. braaten , r.d . \n pisarski , nucl . \n * b * * 339 * , 310 ( 1990 ) ; j. frenkel , j.c . \n taylor , nucl . \n * b * * 334 * , 199 ( 1990 ) ; j. frenkel , j.c . \n taylor , nucl . phys . \n * b * * 374 * , 156 ( 1992 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1701346143386, "RequestID": "4c038b06dc4f4875a201c26f8642dea1", "TotalTokens": 2969}
{"ContextTokens": 3759, "GeneratedTokens": 299, "SynthesizedBody": "in constraining the negative energy contribution to the friedmann equation , a variety of astronomical observations were used , such as snia data @xcite , friib rg data @xcite , baryon oscillation peak and cmbr observations . although we can obtain the bounds on the sum of density parameters for all fluids scaling like radiation , it is impossible to determine the contribution coming from each component . in particular \n it is impossible to determine the negative energy density arising from the casimir effect or dark radiation and positive energy density arising from radiation because they scale with respect to redshift in the same way in the friedmann equation . \n we note that the cmbr and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) offer stringent conditions on this term , which can be regarded as an established upper limit on any individual components of negative energy density , and therefore on the casimir effect , global rotation , discreteness of space following loop quantum gravity or brane dark radiation . \n we argue that even if the precise value of the density parameter for fictitious fluid is known from observations , it is still not possible to determine the nature ( or , say , the origin ) of the global rotation of the universe using measurements basing on geometrical optics only , i.e. null geodesics @xmath2 . \n for example , if we consider the origin of this negative radiation - like term from global rotation effects , then it is not possible to come up with different forms of contribution leading to the same expression of @xmath3 type . \n there are , in principle , three different interpretations of the presence of the negative radiation term in the @xmath4 relation , as follows . \n the casimir effect is a simple observational consequence of the existence of quantum fluctuation @xcite . \n the casimir force between conducting plates leads to a repulsive force , like the positive cosmological constant . \n moreover , different laboratory experiments were designed to measure the casimir affect with increased precision and thus strengthen the constraints on corrections to newtonian gravitational law @xcite . for a survey of recently obtained results in casimir - energy studies see @xcite . for our purpose , it is important that the effect of casimir energy , which scales like radiation , can contribute into the @xmath4 relation  crucial for any kinematical test . \n it is also interesting that the same type of contribution to the effective energy density can be produced by loop quantum theory effects in semi - classical quantum cosmology @xcite . \n these effects give rise to an evolutionary scenario in which the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce . \n it is worth mentioning that the casimir - type contributions arising from tachyon condensation are possible @xcite .    in the brane world scenario , \n our universe is a submanifold which is embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime , called ` bulk space ' . in the randall and sundrum scenario @xcite , \n the einstein equations restricted to the brane reduce to a generalization of the frw equation with additional terms . \n one of these terms , called dark radiation , is of considerable interest because it scales like radiation @xcite . \n this term arises from the non - vanishing electric part of the five dimensional weyl tensor . \n dark radiation strongly effects both bbn and cmbr . \n ichiki et al . \n @xcite gave limits on the possible contribution as @xmath5 from bbn and @xmath6 at the @xmath7 confidence level from cmbr measurements . \n let us note that a small negative contribution of dark radiation can also reconcile the tension between the observed @xmath8 and @xmath9 abundances @xcite . \n let us consider newtonian cosmology following senovilla et al . \n . then we can define , following the authors , a homogeneous newtonian cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 having no spatial dependence , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and we require that the velocity vector fields depends linearly on the spatial coordinates . \n then the equation , which represents shear - free newtonian cosmologies with expansion and rotation , well known as the heckmann - schcking model @xcite takes the following form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rotation scalar and @xmath16 is an integration constant . \n we interprete it in terms of curvature constant although in the newtonian spacetime the curvature is zero . for our purpose , it is important that the effect of rotation produces a negative term in the newtonian analogue of the friedmann equation .    in the newtonian cosmology in contrast to general relativity rotation \n can appear in homogenous and isotropic space . \n in general relativity the effect of rotation are strictly related to non - vanishing shear . \n the homogeneous universe with non - vanishing shear may expand and rotate relative to local gyroscopes . \n the relation between the rotation of the universe and the origin of the rotation of galaxies was also investigated @xcite . \n additionally , the role of rotation of objects in the universe , their significance and astronomical measurements was recently addressed by @xcite ) . \n usually the fundamental test of a cosmological model is based on the luminosity distance @xmath17 as a function of redshift @xcite . for the distant snia \n , one can directly observe their apparent magnitude @xmath18 and redshift @xmath19 . because the absolute magnitude @xmath20 of the supernovae is related to its absolute luminosity @xmath21 , the relation between distance modulus @xmath22 , the luminosity distance @xmath17 , the observed magnitude @xmath18 and the absolute magnitude @xmath23 has the following form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n the luminosity distance of a supernova can be obtain as the function of redshift : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , respectively . \n we assumed @xmath32 @xcite . \n daly and djorgovski @xcite ( see also @xcite ) proposed the inclusion of radio galaxies in the analysis . to accomplish this , it is useful to use the coordinate distance defined as : @xmath33    daly and djorgovski @xcite have compiled a sample comprising the data on @xmath34 for 157 snia in the riess et al . \n @xcite gold dataset and 20 friib radio galaxies . in our data sets \n we also include 115 snia compiled by astier et  al . \n @xcite . \n the coordinate distance @xmath34 does not depend on the value of @xmath1 from definition . \n however , when we compute the coordinate distance from the luminosity distance ( or the distance modulus @xmath22 ) the knowledge of the value of @xmath1 is required . for each sample \n we choose the values of @xmath1 which were used in original papers . \n we used the distance modulus presented in ref . \n @xcite for the calculation of the coordinate distance . for each sample \n we choose the values of @xmath1 apropriate to the data sets . for riess \n et al.s gold sample we fit the value of @xmath35 as the best fitted value and this value is used for calculation of coordinate distance for snia belonging to this sample . in turn \n the value @xmath36 was assumed in the calculations of the coordinate distance for snia belonging to astier et  al.s sample , because the distance moduli @xmath22 presented in ref . \n 8) was calculated with such an arbitrary value of @xmath36 . \n the error of the coordinate distance can be computed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the statistical error of distance modulus determination ( note that for astier et  al.s sample the intrinsic dispersion was also included ) and @xmath39 km / s mpc denotes error in @xmath1 measurements . \n recently eisenstein et al . \n have analysed the baryon oscillation peaks ( bop ) detected in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminosity red galaxies @xcite . \n they found that value of @xmath40 @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) is equal @xmath44 . \n the quoted uncertainty corresponds to one standard deviation , where a gaussian probability distribution has been assumed . \n it is also possible include in our analysis the so called the ( cmbr ) `` shift parameter '' @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xcite .    in our combined analysis , \n we can obtain a best fit model by minimizing the pseudo-@xmath47 merit function @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes value of @xmath40 and @xmath52 obtained for particular set of the model parameter . for astier \n snia @xcite sample additional error in @xmath19 measurements were taken into account . here \n @xmath53 denotes the statistical error ( including error in @xmath19 measurements ) of the coordinate distance determination .    in order to constrain the cosmological parameters , \n one can minimize the following likelihood function @xmath54 . however , to constrain a particular model parameter , the likelihood function marginalized over the remaining parameters of the model should be considered @xcite . \n our results are presented in table  [ tab:1 ] , table  [ tab:2 ] and fig . \n [ fig:1 ] . \n table  [ tab:1 ] refers to the minimum @xmath47 method , whereas table  [ tab:2 ] shows the results from the marginalized likelihood analysis . \n we obtain as the best fit a flat universe with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . \n for the dark radiation term , we obtain the stringent bound @xmath58 at the 95% confidence level ( @xmath59 at the @xmath60 confidence level ) . \n please note that if @xmath61 , then we obtain a bouncing scenario @xcite instead of a big bang \n . for @xmath55 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 bounces ( @xmath64 ) appear for @xmath65 . in this case \n , the bbn epoch never occurs and all bbn predictions would be lost .    to obtain stronger constraints on the model parameters , \n it is useful to use the cmbr observations . \n the hotter and colder spots in the cmbr can be interpreted as acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma during the last scattering . \n it is very interesting that the locations of these peaks are very sensitive to variations in the model parameters . \n therefore , they can be used as another way of constraining the parameters of cosmological models . \n the acoustic scale @xmath66 which gives the locations of the peaks is defined as @xmath67 where , for the flat model , equation  ( [ eq:12a ] ) reduces to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the speed of sound in plasma . knowing the acoustic scale we can determine the location of the @xmath18-th peak @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the phase shift caused by the plasma driving effect . \n the cmbr temperature angular power spectrum provides the locations of the first two peaks @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xcite . using three years of wmap data , spergel et  al . \n obtained that the hubble constant @xmath74 km / s mpc , the baryonic matter density @xmath75 , and the matter density @xmath76 @xcite , which are in good agreement with the observation of position of the first peak ( see fig . \n [ fig:2 ] ) but lead ( assuming the @xmath77cdm model ) to a value @xmath78 . \n there is also disagreement between @xmath1 values obtained from snia and wmap . \n we compute the location of the first peak as a function of @xmath79 assuming @xmath80 km / s mpc ( @xmath55 ) . \n now we obtain agreement with the observation of the location of the first peak for non - zero values of the parameter @xmath79 ( fig . \n [ fig:2 ] ) . \n we obtain @xmath81 at the @xmath7 confidence level . \n please note that our limit is stronger than that obtained by ichiki et  al . \n @xcite , which provides bounds of @xmath82 ( in the case of the bbn ) and @xmath83 ( in the case of the cmbr ) . \n all these values of @xmath79 are in agreement with the result obtained from the combined analysis because the @xmath84 confidence interval for this parameter obtained from the snia data contains the area allowed from the cmbr . while the combined analysis gives the possibility that @xmath79 is equal to zero , the cmbr location of the first peak seems to exclude this case for @xmath63 .     and @xmath85 confidence levels ( obtained from the combined analysis of sn+rg+sdss+cmbr ) on the plane (

]     [ tab:2 ] \n in our paper we analysed the observational constraints on the negative @xmath0-type contribution in the friedmann equation . \n we discussed different proposals for the presence of such a dark radiation term . \n although it is not possible , with present kinematic observations , to determine the energy densities of individual components which scales like radiation , we show that some stringent bounds on the value of this total contribution can be given . \n our detailed conclusions are the following .    1 . \n the combined analysis of snia data and friib radio galaxies using baryon oscillation peaks and cmbr `` shift parameter '' give rise to the almost flat universe with @xmath92 . \n 2 .   from the above - mentioned combined analysis \n , we obtain an upper bound @xmath93 at the @xmath7 confidence level . \n this is a stronger limit than obtained previously by us from snia data only @xcite . \n we find new stringent limits on a negative component scaling like

.   from the limit @xmath95 \n we obtain that @xmath96 . \n this implies that @xmath4 is always greater than zero ( @xmath97 ) and the bounce does not appear which means that the big bang scenario is

{"ContextTokens": 2073, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "when observing a nearby elliptical or bulge of a spiral galaxy , there are two distinct characteristics in the galaxy s surface brightness . \n the first is the most obvious : the galaxy is brightest in the center and grows fainter with increasing radius . \n the second characteristic is only apparent in good seeing conditions : the surface brightness is clumpy on the scale of the seeing disk . these clumps , which can be a few percent of the mean surface brightness for the nearest galaxies like m  31 and m  32 , arise from poisson statistical fluctuations in the number of stars per seeing disk . \n historically , this effect was known as `` incipient resolution . '' in the modern context , they are called surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) . \n tonry & schneider ( 1988 ) devised a technique to quantify sbfs and to use them as a distance indicator for undisturbed early - type galaxies . specifically , they proposed using the ratio of the 2@xmath2 moment of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) to the 1@xmath3 moment as a standard candle : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of stars of type @xmath6 with a luminosity of @xmath7 . \n @xmath8 has units of luminosity and is expressed in astronomer s units as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the absolute and apparent sbf magnitude , respectively . \n since @xmath9 is an intrinsic property of the lf , sbfs can be useful for studying the stellar populations of early - type galaxies . \n the potential parameter space to explore is very large , since the `` age '' and `` metallicity '' of the stars can be a complex combination of formation epoch and subsequent history ( e.g. , kaufmann , in this volume ) . \n sbfs provide data _ unique _ from the integrated light / spectra of these galaxies . because of their @xmath11 dependence , sbfs are very sensitive probes of the most luminous stars , the cool red giant stars ( figure  1 ) . \n modeling these stars interior structure and emergent spectra is very challenging . \n also , since bright rgb and agb stars evolve quickly , only a handful of each are present in any star cluster in the milky way or magellanic clouds . \n therefore , sbf measurements , which arise from the stellar population of entire galaxies , provide one of the best observational tests of our current understanding of these stars . \n recent observational and theoretical advances make now a ripe time to revisit and expand sbf stellar population studies . \n past modeling ( tonry et al .  1990 ; buzzoni 1993 ; worthey 1993 ) used the previous generation of evolutionary tracks ( vandenberg or revised yale isochrones ) based on older stellar opacities . the optical sbf dataset has been expanded and improved considerably ( tonry et al . \n 1997 ) , and a growing body of ir data has widened the spectral coverage . \n figure  2 presents @xmath12-band sbf data for fornax cluster ellipticals from liu et al . \n ( 1999b ) and jensen et al . \n ( 1998 ) . \n fornax is appealing since it is close enough to have a cepheid distance measured with hst ( silbermann et al . \n 1999 ) and is compact on the sky , implying the galaxies basically lie at the same distance . \n predictions from bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) single - burst models are overplotted ; these use padova evolutionary tracks , stellar spectra of lejeune et al.(1997 ) , and a semi - empirical agb prescription ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ) . \n ( see bruzual , in this volume . ) \n the good agreement between data and models means the lifetimes , luminosities , and colors of the bright rgb and agb stars are roughly correct , or else multiple errors are cancelling each other out ( e.g. , charlot et al . \n 1996 ) . \n the bc98 models agree worse with the @xmath13-band empirical sbf calibration ( tonry et al . \n 1997 ) than with the @xmath12-band data , which has lead us to revise the most evolved stars in the models ( liu et al . \n this illustrates the usefulness of sbf tests . \n although the models agree reasonably well with integrated colors of elliptical galaxies and local group globular clusters , it is the sbf comparison which reveals possible weaknesses in the modeling of the most luminous stars . \n in old populations , @xmath9 is expected to be very metal - dependent , since it strongly tracks the rgb and agb , whose colors are governed by metallicity ( frogel et al . \n 1983 ) . therefore , sbf data are potentially very useful in characterizing the stellar content of ellipticals . \n broad - band colors are degenerate in age and metallicity , with changes of @xmath14 preserving the color ( worthey 1994 [ w94 ] ; worthey , this volume ) . \n absorption line indices can be more age- or metal - sensitive , e.g. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are age - sensitive ( @xmath17 ) and mg@xmath18 and c@xmath184668 are metal - sensitive ( @xmath19 ) . in comparison , \n ir sbf magnitudes are predicted by the bc98 and w94 models to have in old populations . \n this suggests ir sbf data combined with balmer absorption indices could effectively disentangle age and metallicity effects in ellipticals . \n developing accurate models is critical for measuring distances to galaxies from sbfs . \n optical / ir sbf distances can be measured to @xmath20  km / s and therefore to obtain @xmath21 , but accurate distances rely on accurate @xmath12-corrections to account for the redshifting of the galaxy spectrum . \n moreover , models can guide us to better observations . \n for instance , @xmath13-band sbf distances use the @xmath22 integrated galaxy color to account for stellar population variations from galaxy to galaxy ( tonry et al . \n both the bc98 and w94 models suggest that @xmath23 or @xmath24 colors , which are more metallicity - driven , would lead to a better correction , reducing the scatter by @xmath2550% . \n the wider spectral ranges of these colors also lead to greater tolerance of errors in photometry or reddening than @xmath22 . \n finally , accurate models could provide a purely theoretical calibration for sbf distances , independent of any cepheid calibration . \n buzzoni , a. 1993 , , 275 , 433 bruzual , g. & charlot , s. 1998 , in preparation ( bc98 ) charlot , s. & bruzual , c. 1991 , , 367 , 126 charlot , s. , worthey , g. , & bressan , a. 1996 , , 457 , 625 frogel , j. a. , cohen , j. g. , & persson , s. e. 1983 , , 275 , 773 jensen , j. b. , tonry , j. l. , & luppino , g. a.  1998 , , 505 , 111 lejeune , th . , \n cuisinier , f. , & buser , r.  1997 , , 125 , 229 liu , m. c. , charlot , s. , & graham , j. r. 1999a , in preparation liu , m. c. , graham , j. r. , & charlot , s. 1999b , in preparation silbermann , n. a. et al .  1999 , , 515 , 1 tonry , j. l. & schneider , p. 1988 \n , , 96 , 807 tonry , j. l. , ajhar , e. a. , & luppino , g.  1990 , , 100 , 1416 tonry , j. l. , blakeslee , j. p. , ajhar , e. a. , & dressler , a.  1997 , 475 , 399 worthey , g. 1993 , , 409 , 530 ;

mckean et al . \n , in preparation ) . furthermore , our spectrum of g1 has sufficient signal - to - noise for the stellar velocity dispersion to be measured . \n these observations will provide additional constraints for a future mass model . \n the other interesting feature of class b2108 + 213 is the possible detection of a third lensed image . \n although the observations presented here show that this is almost certainly not the case , this conclusion could be confirmed by measuring the flux - density , polarization and size of the radio emission from each component as a function of frequency . \n if scattering of a third lensed image is occurring then we would expect the high frequency spectrum of each radio component to be identical . \n the vla and vlba are operated by the national radio astronomy observatory which is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc . \n merlin is a national facility operated by the university of manchester on behalf of pparc . \n the results present herein were based on observations collected with the nasa / esa _ hst _ , obtained at stsci , which is operated by aura , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 . \n jpm , man , pmp and tdy acknowledge the receipt of pparc studentships . \n rdb is supported by nsf grant ast-9900866 . \n tt acknowledges support from nasa through hubble fellowship grant hst - hf-01167.01-a . \n this work was supported by the european community s sixth framework marie curie research training network programme , contract no . \n mrtn - ct-2004 - 505183 `` angles '' .", "StartTimeOffset": 1752425316168, "RequestID": "6326d3ada36b45c6b8af78db3a1d9c7d", "TotalTokens": 2215}

{"ContextTokens": 3195, "GeneratedTokens": 219, "SynthesizedBody": "atmospheres of old and cool white dwarfs deliver valuable information on stellar and planetary evolution . \n this is because of relatively simple cooling physics that allows for accurate cosmochronometry @xcite and of the stratified nature of a white dwarf star , which allows for tracing the content of acreted planetary - like material @xcite . \n however , in order to properly asses this information , atmospheres of these stars must be well characterized and understood . \n this is often difficult with the standard models that are based mainly of the ideal - gas description of physics and chemistry . \n the atmospheres of helium - rich stars reach densities of fluid ( up to a few g / cc @xcite ) and there are severe problems in proper characterization of such old stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n impact of the dense atmospheres on stellar spectra are illustrated by the pressure distortion of @xmath1 bands @xcite and also with some problems with fitting the metal lines profiles @xcite . \n the former problems in fitting the uv spectra and u and b photometric bands of less extreme hydrogen - rich white dwarfs @xcite , solved by introduction of the ly-@xmath2 red wing opacities @xcite , also show the importance of proper modeling , accurate fitting and characterization of spectra of cool white dwarfs , for correct understanding of these stars @xcite .    in the last two decades various high - pressure improvements \n have been introduced to the modeling . \n these include the non - ideal equation of state @xcite , the opacities @xcite , the refraction @xcite and the chemical abundances of species @xcite . \n the further tests of ly - alpha red wing profiles validated this absorption mechanism for a sample of cool stars @xcite . \n while the less extreme atmospheres of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs are now well reproduced by the current models , the modeling of more extreme helium - rich atmospheres still encounters difficulties @xcite . in spite of significant work devoted to improvement of high density chemistry and physics description , \n no conclusive models describing dense , helium - rich atmospheres exist . \n in particular , a group of so - called ultracool white dwarfs , which are believed to be helium - rich stars , have rather vague atmospheric parameters assignment @xcite . \n we suspect that the pressure - distortion of ir opacities , namely the collision induced absorption ( cia , @xcite ) , contributes to much of these difficulties .    having steady improvement in the performance and availability of the computational power and quantum chemistry simulation software and techniques , \n many dense helium problems could be tackled by atomistic simulations @xcite . \n the ir opacities could be directly simulated using _ ab initio _ methods of quantum chemistry @xcite . \n recently we attempted such simulations and the first results are briefly discussed here in the context of interpreting the near- and mid - ir spectra of ultracool stars . \n recently , using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics technique , @xcite simulated the cia opacities of pure , dense helium and found significant absorption resulting from triple collisions between helium atoms . \n this absorption mechanism was postulated ( e.g. @xcite ) , but had been never before observed experimentally or computed . the obtained absorption coefficient for a representative temperature of 5000 k is given in figure [ f1 ] . \n although the intensity of this absorption mechanism is about four orders of magnitude lower that the relevant h@xmath0/h - he cia opacities , because he atoms are the dominant species it becomes a significant ir absorption mechanism in the atmospheres with @xmath3 ( see fig . \n [ f2 ] ) . when we applied the new absorption mechanism to the spectrum of lhs1128 star , which is broadly discussed by @xcite ( fig . \n [ f2 ] ) , we obtained much better fit to the irac fluxes . \n this opacity source thus explains a flat - like behavior of the observed ir fluxes , as opposite to the @xmath4 flux suppression and the @xmath5 flux excess predicted by the current models ( fig . \n using the same simulation method as @xcite used for simulation of the he - he - he absorption ( see also @xcite in this volume ) we have simulated the @xmath6 cia opacities . as indicated in fig . 2 of @xcite we found a significant distortion of this absorption mechanism for densities @xmath7 . \n the obtained profiles for the low and high densities are compared in figure [ f3 ] . as indicated in the figure \n , there are three main pressure effects . \n ( 1 ) the rototranslational band peak at @xmath8 becomes more pronounced and ( 2 ) shifted towards higher frequencies . \n we interpret this as a result of triple collisions @xcite and decrease in the separation between hydrogen atoms in h@xmath0 with increase in density , and related decrease of the h@xmath0 rotational inertia , as illustrated in fig . \n [ f4 ] . at the same time , ( 3 ) the @xmath9 main vibrational band shifts to the higher frequencies and splits into two peaks due to an interference between the dipole moments induced in the successive collisions of h@xmath0 and he atoms @xcite . \n this splitting has been experimentally observed before @xcite and in figure [ f5 ] we compare those results with these simulated by us . \n we obtained larger splitting because simulations were performed at much higher temperature , thus with higher thermal collisions energy than in the experiments performed at ambient conditions . \n the obtained results could be used for the interpretation of difference between the modeled and the observed spectra of ultracool white dwarfs , such as lhs3025 . \n compared to the synthetic spectrum computed using the standard cia opacity description of @xcite , the observed spectrum does not show the clear minimum at @xmath10 and the flux excess at @xmath11 that are predicted by models , and indicates more absorption in the near - ir . \n this is consistent with the simulated broadening and the redistribution of the main vibrational peak and the enhancement of rototranslational peak . \n the absorption spectrum simulated at @xmath12 ( fig . \n [ f3 ] ) indicates maximum of absorption at @xmath13 and more absorption in the near - ir , which is consistent with the observed spectral energy distribution of lhs3025 , and also other ultracool white dwarfs @xcite . \n more elaborate analysis requires more complete set of simulated spectra , including investigation of the temperature dependence , derivation of the relevant distortion model , calculations of a grid of atmosphere models and their usage for subsequent fitting of spectra and analysis of ultracool white dwarfs . \n this work is currently in progress . \n we have showed the results of simulations of he - he - he and h@xmath0-he cia infrared opacities and their impact for the interpretation of spectra of cool , helium - rich stars , including ultracool white dwarfs . \n we discuss the impact of the newly found he - he - he cia opacity from pure helium on the spectra . by improved fit to the spectrum of lhs1128 star we show that this opacity mechanism could be responsible for a flat - like infrared spectral energy distribution of these stars , which could not be reproduced with previous models . \n the subsequent simulations of h@xmath0-he cia opacities show significant pressure - distortion of this absorption mechanism with the simulated intensity change being consistent with the one deducted from the mismatch between the current models prediction and the observed spectral energy distribution for star lhs3250 . \n however , more complete simulations of the ir opacities and subsequent computation of new models are required for complete analysis and refitting the spectra of cool , helium - rich stars , which is currently in progress . \n last but not least , the simulations conducted here and the subsequent analysis show that the modern atomistic modeling methods could be successfully applied to modeling condensed stellar atmospheres and that , on the other hand , the atmospheres of white dwarfs represent excellent laboratories for testing the physics and chemistry of matter at extreme conditions . \n abel , m. , frommhold , l. , li , x. , & hunt , k. l. c. 2012 , the journal of chemical physics , 136 , 044319 bergeron , p. , leggett , s. k. , & ruiz , m. t. 2001 , , 133 , 433 bergeron , p. , ruiz , m. t. , & leggett , s. k. 1997 , , 108 , 339 blouin , s. , dufour , p. , & kowalski , p. m. 2017 ( astronomical soc . of the pacific ) , \n this volume dufour , p. , bergeron , p. , liebert , j. , harris , h. c. , knapp , g. r. , anderson , s. f. , hall , p. b. , strauss , m. a. , collinge , m. j. , & edwards , m. c. 2007 , the astrophysical journal , 663 , 1291 farihi , j. , barstow , m. a. , redfield , s. , dufour , p. , & hambly , n. c. 2010 , mon . not . \n r. astron . \n soc . , 404 , 2123 fontaine , g. , brassard , p. , & bergeron , p. 2001 \n , , 113 , 409 frommhold , l. 1993 , collision -

? ? * for a complete description of the extrapolations and results ) . \n the light green field lines on both sides of the filament represent the fields in the positive ( upward arrow ) and negative ( downward arrow ) faculae . \n this figure is from @xcite . ] \n based on the vector magnetograms , we constructed the sketch presented in fig . \n the cartoon shows a gray - scale continuum image from the dutch open telescope ( dot ) on 2005 july 5 . in the middle of the image , \n the aforementioned pores and orphan penumbrae that started to appear on july 4 are seen . \n the reconstruction of the filament is represented as a black structure which was extracted from the corresponding dot h@xmath1 image . \n the filament follows the pil . \n the positive ( negative ) polarity is at the right ( left ) side of the pil when viewing the figure from the lower right corner . \n there are three different magnetic field lines represented in the cartoon . \n ( 1 ) the dark red field lines are based on the photospheric vector magnetograms . \n these field lines are aligned along the pil where pores and orphan penumbrae are seen . \n however , outside the orphan - penumbrae region , the field lines have an inverse polarity configuration ( pointing from negative to positive polarity ) . \n ( 2 ) the light blue field lines were derived from the chromospheric vector magnetograms . in this case , the field lines are parallel to the filament axis outside the orphan - penumbrae region , whereas inside , the field lines show a normal configuration ( the field lines point from positive to negative polarity ) . \n ( 3 ) the green field lines , close to the corners of the image , represent the positive ( upward pointing arrow ) and negative ( downward pointing arrow ) polarity of the faculae .    to shed light on the formation of the flux rope it was crucial to infer the los velocities . \n calibrations using two telluric lines and corrections related to orbital motions and the gravity shift were carefully carried out ( see * ? ? ? \n the motions of the transverse magnetic fields in the photosphere , in the orphan - penumbrae area , show , on a seven - hour average , a slow upward trend . \n above , in the chromosphere , the filament moves on average downward . nevertheless , there are clearly localized upflow areas ( see fig . 3 in * ? ? ? * ) . \n this indicated , when looking at the orphan - penumbrae area in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , that the axis of the flux rope is slowly rising . \n half of the flux rope is below the surface , which seems to be responsible for the formation of the orphan penumbrae . \n the upper part of the flux rope reaches the chromosphere where groups of field lines produce the upflow patches detected in the chromosphere . the portion of the filament that does not have orphan penumbrae below behaves differently . \n out of seven maps , the first four show on average upward motions of the transverse fields . \n the other three show on average velocities close to zero . \n the chromospheric counterpart shows downward motions . \n the initial formation phase of this ar filament can not be described with the presented data sets because the filament was already present prior to our observations . \n however , we have shown that ar filaments can have extremely low - lying flux rope structures ( even as low as the photosphere ) that support the filament . \n this structure can eventually emerge from below the photosphere , as seen in our data sets , generating pores and orphan penumbrae along the pil . \n therefore , ar filaments can have a photospheric counterpart . in the chromosphere , \n the filament s plasma is being pushed upward by the magnetic field that expands from the emerging flux rope structure . at the same time \n , the emerging flux rope supports the filament material against gravity . \n altogether , the present results favor a flux rope emergence scenario . \n ck greatly acknowledges the travel support received from the iau . \n the vtt is operated by the kiepenheuer - institute for solar physics in freiburg , germany , at the spanish observatorio del teide , tenerife , canary islands . \n the national center for atmospheric research ( ncar ) is sponsored by the national science foundation ( nsf ) . \n the authors would like to thank c. denker for carefully reading the manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 1812060457571, "RequestID": "cb45cce290954242891a7ec7d94dce31", "TotalTokens": 2404}
{"ContextTokens": 3940, "GeneratedTokens": 315, "SynthesizedBody": "the supernova ( sn ) that occurred in 1987 in the nearby large magellanic cloud was the first object of its kind whose evolution in the radio to x - ray range has been resolved as a function of time . \n the study of sn  1987a continues and includes , in particular , extensive observations in very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath3  gev ) @xmath4-rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n the present work is a critical re - examination and extension of the studies by @xcite and @xcite(referred to as bkv11 in the following ) concerning the properties of the nonthermal emission of sn 1987a . as in those previous investigations , \n our framework is a nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic - ray ( cr ) acceleration in sn remnants ( snrs ) . \n this theory couples the particle acceleration process with the hydrodynamics of the thermal gas @xcite and connects it with the gamma - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n the application of this theory to individual snrs ( see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for reviews ) has demonstrated its ability to explain the observed snr properties and radiation spectra . combining the theoretical model with the _ \n observed _ synchrotron spectra predicts new effects like the large degree of magnetic field amplification that leads to the observed concentration of the highest - energy electrons in a very thin shell just behind the forward shock into the circumstellar medium ( csm ) . \n the evolution of radio and x - ray emission at earlier times , also implied in the present paper , has been described by , e.g. bkv11 , who showed , in particular , that the evidence for strong shock modification comes primarily from radio data . \n efficient acceleration of the cr proton component is needed to produce significant shock modification leading to a soft and concave cr electron spectrum in sn 1987a , which well fits the observed nonthermal radio emission and x - ray spectra if the downstream magnetic field strength @xmath5 is as high as @xmath6  mg . \n such a high field leads to significant electron synchrotron losses that cut off the high - frequency x - ray part of the synchrotron spectrum , consistent with x - ray observations . \n the required magnetic field strength can presumably be attributed to its nonlinear amplification near the snr shock by the cr acceleration process itself @xcite .    as a consequence of the efficient production of the cr nuclear component , which is accompanied by strong magnetic field amplification , \n sn  1987a is expected to be a potential source of @xmath4-rays for the h.e.s.s . \n however , the flux of tev emission predicted in bkv11 exceeds the upper limit obtained by h.e.s.s . \n it is suggested here that this inconsistency is the result of an overestimate of the csm gas density , in particular , of the mass of the equatorial ring ( er ) . \n the present work uses the same canonical values ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) for the stellar ejecta mass , @xmath7 , distance , @xmath8 , hydrodynamic explosion energy , @xmath9 , and ejecta velocity distribution as in bkv11 , but takes into account the detailed radio continuum observations by @xcite and @xcite . in particular \n , the present work makes use of recent extensive csm modeling in terms of three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite ( in the sequel referred to as potter14 ) . \n an approximate prediction of the future nonthermal emission from sn  1987a for the coming decades is given . \n the densest part of the csm , which lies within the range @xmath10 of the elevation angle @xmath11 around the equatorial plane , is then considerably less dense than what was adopted in bkv11 . \n this is the main reason for the re - examination of the cr production in sn  1987a and the associated nonthermal emission . \n to study the propagation of the sn shock through the csm , the results of potter14 for the angular range @xmath10 relative to the equatorial plane are used . \n the most efficient cr and nonthermal emission production presumably takes place within this region . \n this is roughly consistent with radio observations @xcite . \n the adopted radial profile of the gas number density @xmath12 in this region is represented in figure  [ f1 ] . within the selected elevation range , it consists of several different morphological structures : ( i ) the wind bubble of the blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor star @xcite at @xmath13  cm with gas density @xmath14  @xmath15 , ( ii ) the h  ii region @xcite at @xmath16  cm with @xmath17  @xmath15 , ( iii ) the so - called hourglass region at @xmath18  cm with @xmath19  @xmath15 , and ( iv ) the free red supergiant ( rsg ) wind region at @xmath20 with @xmath21  @xmath15 ; \n the properties of structures ( iii ) and ( iv ) directly follow from potter14 . within the smaller elevation angle region of @xmath22 , \n the same radial profile includes the equatorial ring inside the h  ii region ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . \n its gas number density is chosen here to be distributed according to the relation @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the central ( maximal ) density of the er , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denote the total mass , radius , and width of the er , respectively . \n below , the values @xmath28 , @xmath29  cm , and @xmath30 are used . \n these parameter values are taken in order to fit the observed shock and radio - emission dynamics . \n they turn out to be consistent with the values used by potter14 . \n the csm described above differs significantly from the csm adopted in bkv11 . \n first of all , the er mass , albeit that of the ionized material only , @xmath28 @xcite , is considerably smaller than that used by bkv11 ( @xmath31 ) . \n second , the csm behind the er is less dense . \n these factors , as demonstrated below , lead to a considerable reduction of the expected nonthermal emission , in particular , of the @xmath4-ray emission , compared with the results of bkv11 . \n the propagation of the forward sn shock through the csm is modeled in the spirit of a spherically symmetrical approach . \n it approximates the shock and its effects as the weighted sum of two independent spherically symmetric shocks , propagating into , respectively , two different radial gas number density profiles of the csm , shown in figure  [ f1 ] : the first profile ( region 1 ) belongs to an azimuthally symmetric region of elevation angles @xmath11 near the equatorial plane @xmath32 , and the second , analogous profile ( region 2 ) , corresponds to the innermost @xmath22 . \n then , each quantity q , characterizing the number of accelerated crs and the amount of emission produced by these crs , is determined by the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the spherically symmetric values corresponding to the profiles that characterize the two regions 1 and 2 , respectively , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the filling factors in the solid angle of these regions .    cr production by the sn shock at high latitudes @xmath37 is neglected here because the gas density in this region is considerably lower ( see potter14 ) . \n we also neglect cr production at the reverse shock for the reasons given in bkv11 . \n the question is , of course , to what extent such an approximate treatment remains consistent as a function of time with the real snr shock sweeping across the real csm to reach larger and larger radial distances . \n a priori the decrease of the gas density with elevation angle , symmetric to the equatorial plane , suggests this to be a roughly stable process . \n however , effects like the engulfment of the er clearly imply some non - radial shock propagation aspects . such effects are also apparent in the three - dimensional simulations of potter14 . \n in addition , the ring is clumpy , even though @xcite found indications that these hot spots are now gradually dissolving . \n this type of effect should primarily influence the detailed time dependence of the particle acceleration and hadronic @xmath4-ray emission rather than the global acceleration properties of the system . \n therefore , in a gross sense , the used mosaic of spherical shocks appeears to be an adequate overall approximation .      as in bkv11 , the magnetic field strength , @xmath38 , given by the expression @xmath39 is used . here \n , @xmath40 denotes the sn shock speed and @xmath38 is the field far upstream , presumably amplified by the crs of the highest energy . in the same sense , @xmath41 is the mass density far upstream . \n the high downstream magnetic field @xmath42  mg , where @xmath43 denotes the total shock compression ratio , is required to reproduce the observed radio and x - ray spectra @xcite . \n the calculation of the shock radius @xmath44 and speed @xmath40 again follows the scheme of @xcite , but see also bkv11 , as does the evaluation of the proton injection rate @xmath45 and of the electron - to - proton ratio @xmath46 . \n figure  [ f2 ] shows @xmath44 and @xmath40 , as the shock propagates in the csm corresponding to region 2 , together with the latest radio data @xcite . in the case of region 1 \n , the shock speed time profile @xmath47 does not contain the local minimum around @xmath48 days ; this is the main difference from the results presented in figure  [ f2 ] . \n iteratively fitting the theoretical quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 to the spatially integrated radio synchrotron spectra up to the year 2013 @xcite leads to a constant value for @xmath51 , whereas the value @xmath52 at @xmath53 year ( figure  [ f3]a ) is due to the assumption that , leaving the h  ii region , the nuclear injection fraction should , after @xmath54 year , go back to its value before the age of 10 years . during the ages between about 10 and 30 years \n the compressed and largely azimuthal magnetic field of the h  ii region should have depressed nuclear injection , consistent with the softening of the spatially integrated radio spectrum ( with index @xmath55 ) as shown in figure  [ f3]b . \n this figure also shows that outside the h  ii region , the shock is significantly modified relative to a pure gas shock for which the total shock compression ratio @xmath43 and the subshock compression ratio @xmath56 would both have a value of 4 . \n the adopted value of @xmath49 determines the amount of shock modification , in particular , the decrease of the subshock compression ratio @xmath57 relative its value of 4 for an unmodified shock . since crs with relatively small energies \n are produced near the subshock , the value @xmath57 directly determines the shape of the electron energy spectrum at energies below @xmath58  gev  which produce synchrotron emission in the radio range  and vice versa . \n therefore , as in all similar cases , the proton injection rate @xmath49 is inferred from a fit of the resulting theoretical spectral index @xmath55 of the integrated radio synchrotron emission to the observed value . \n the quality of this fit can be ascertained from figure  [ f3]b , where the best calculated time profile @xmath55 is presented together with the observational data .    from the epoch \n @xmath59 year onwards the value of @xmath55 decreases until the epoch @xmath60 year @xcite and is assumed to start to increase again at @xmath61 year . \n this appears to be consistent with recent measurements by @xcite and , especially , @xcite . \n however , the increase is not as fast as one would expect from the behavior of the local @xmath57 . \n this occurs because at subsequent epochs , the gas number density and , consequently , also the amount of freshly injected electrons and the magnetic field strength , are much smaller than when the shock was in the h  ii region . \n therefore , the synchrotron emission of those latter electrons , convected downstream in that higher magnetic field , remains dominant . \n for similar reasons , the variation in the shock compression ratio @xmath43 at an age 10,00012,000 days , caused by the rapid decrease of the upstream gas number density @xmath62 , does not significantly affect the integrated radio synchrotron emission flux , and the spectral index @xmath63 remains essentially independent of @xmath43 .    using these educated guesses for @xmath64 and @xmath46 the calculated flux of radio emission @xmath65 at frequency @xmath66  ghz \n is presented in figure  [ f4 ] together with the observational data obtained with the atca instrument @xcite . for those times where the radio flux has also been measured , the calculation is perfectly consistent with the observations . according to the calculation , the rapid growth of radio emission in the epochs @xmath67 year is due to the increase of the number of accelerated cr electrons , which is proportional to the swept - up mass within the h  ii region . for the adopted value of the outer boundary of the h  ii region , @xmath68  cm , the snr shock reaches this boundary after @xmath54 year , and the peak of radio emission is reached . even at later epochs , \n @xmath69 years , the radio synchrotron emission will still be dominated by the contribution of the swept - up matter of the h  ii region . \n the flux of radio emission is expected to decrease gradually by a factor of about 10 during the 10 years after 2017 . \n due to its considerably lower gas density , the contribution of the swept - up hourglass matter will become essential only for @xmath70 year , when the radio emission starts to grow slowly again . \n the calculated @xmath4-ray energy flux density above 3 tev as a function of time , shown in figure  [ f5 ] , is dominated by the @xmath71-decay component at all energies . since a significant part of the shock surface \n is expected to be tangential , and therefore to not efficiently inject / accelerate nuclear crs , the overall number of accelerating crs is normalized by a factor of @xmath72 , as previoously argued by @xcite and bkv11 .    as is clear from figure  [ f5 ] , the region 1 , which contains the er , the densest structure , contributes dominantly only during the shock propagation through the er , which is during days 700010,000 . \n according to figure  [ f5 ] , the maximal energy flux density of tev emission @xmath73  ev @xmath1 s@xmath2 was achieved at day 9000 , and after that epoch it decreased continuously due to the decrease of the csm gas density . since the radial gas density profile is much thinner compared with the one used earlier bkv11 , the peak value of the expected flux of tev emission is now lower and the tev emission expected for the future is considerably lower .    the most recent upper limit for the tev emission obtained by the h.e.s.s . \n telescopes during the period 2005 - 2012 @xcite ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) is roughly consistent with this prediction .    according to the calculation ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) , the most promising time for the detection of sn \n 1987a in tev @xmath4-rays is the 10 year period from 2008 to 2018 . at later epochs \n , sn  1987a should be detectable in the vhe range only by an instrument with a higher sensitivity than that of h.e.s.s . \n this work has been supported in part by the russian foundation for basic research ( grants 13 -

{"ContextTokens": 3637, "GeneratedTokens": 256, "SynthesizedBody": "echocardiography plays an important part in diagnostic aid in cardiac diseases . \n it relies on the use of ultrasound images to reflect the information about the heart of a patient . in the process of diagnosis \n , images are captured from specific views of heart , which are commonly named _ \n heart views _ or _ \n standard planes_. standard planes tend to provide promising views to present different heart structures that are benefit to diagnosis . \n the task for standard plane location ( spl ) exactly refers to selecting 2d planes from a candidate list considering both static and dynamic characteristics from different views of heart . \n automatic recognition of standard planes have been extensively studied in recent works . \n most of them focus on ultrasound images with 2d static images , 3d static volumes and 2d - temporal sequences . for 2d static images , ebadollahi et.al  @xcite deal with view classification of echocardiograms based on spatial layout of 2d static frames . \n @xcite propose an approach by applying local detectors sequentially on the pre - selected locations with selective search . \n for 3d volumes , lu et.al  @xcite proposed an automated supervised learning method to detect standard multiplanar reformatted planes ( mprs ) from a 3d echocardiographic volume with coarse - to - fine strategy . \n chykeyuk et.al  @xcite build a class - specific random forest regression model for standard plane classification based on 3d static volumes . for 2d - temporal sequences , qian et.al  @xcite employed bag of visual words based on spatial - temporal features . \n sparse coding and max pooling are used in a codebook to generate the representation . \n previous works usually regard the standard plane location as a classification problem based on individual frames or a set of sequences . in this paper , the data used in our work are 4d stic volumes where all slices have been captured including both 3d position and temporal information . \n the task for standard plane location is to select a specific or small set of 2d planes from 4d volumes according to different preferences of views . \n different from the previous works , the spl task on 4d image introduces the following problems :    1 .   restricted by the facility performance , the image quality of 4d stic volume is often poor \n . the spatial plane is generated by interpolation and the noise is inevitably introduced . \n the standard plane of abnormal cases can be quite similar to the plane which is not the standard plane in normal cases . \n 3 .   given the 4d stic data , the searching space for * 2d plane * is considerably large . \n the real - time location is in urgent demand . \n considering the issues above , we propose a novel framework for spl task in 4d stic volume .    * different from the disease diagnosis \n , it is observed that the spl tasks focus more on the boundary characteristic but not the fine - grained information . \n therefore , we use an @xmath0 smoothing algorithm  @xcite which removes the noise and preserves the boundary simultaneously ( for problem 1 ) . * \n static sift  @xcite and spatial - temporal sift ( stip )  @xcite are deployed to model the feature of standard plane ( for problem 2 ) . * \n based on sift and stip , we propose a supervised method to learn the discriminative subspace and to generate the compact feature which can obviously reduce the searching consumption ( for problem 2&3 ) . \n the main framework of the proposed method is shown in fig  [ fig::framework ] . given \n the 4d stic volume data , a large set of candidate 2d planes are generated to identify the standard plane . \n each 2d plane is featured with a sequence of grey - scale images indicating the cardiac motion . \n an @xmath0 smoothing filter is firstly deployed to remove the noise in each image . \n sift and stip features are extracted to capture both static and dynamic information . in order to learn compact representation , a low - dimensional subspace is obtained by embedding sift and stip features via supervised semantic correlation . finally a support vector machine  ( svm ) classifies the candidates into different views . \n we deploy the fast @xmath0 smoothing algorithm  @xcite to generate the filtered image and detect the sift points as shown in figure  [ fig::imagevis ] . \n as shown in figure  [ fig::imagevis ] , the boundary of original frame is perfectly preserved while the noise is largely reduced in the filter image . \n we can also find the sift points detected in the filtered image mostly distributed along the boundary and the number of points is much smaller than the number in the original image . \n as mentioned above , it is observed that the contour is more discriminative to locate the standard planes other than fine grained local features . \n the 4d stic volume data naturally involves the spatial - temporal information . in order to present both dynamic and static features , \n sift @xcite and stip@xcite are used in our work . for each frame , we extract sift points as static features that are used to indicate local features and invariant to scale and rotation transforms . \n @xcite demonstrates that the dynamic feature ( stip ) is powerful in standard plane location which takes both spatial invariant and temporal structure into consideration . however , the classification accuracy of standard plane is not promising enough according to our experiments on real datasets . \n stip prefers to select the interesting points based on spatial - temporal structure . \n although stip performs well in action recognition based on video captured in natural scenes , the quality and sampling rate of ultrasound image sequence is poor without preprocessing . \n moreover , the stip feature can not fully capture the static information which is also important for standard plane location . \n therefore , we aim at learning the common space between dynamic and static features .      many strategies are designed for learning the representation from multiple features including multiple kernel learning  @xcite , subspace learning  @xcite , etc . as mentioned in section  [ sec::introduction ] , \n the searching space is considerably large in standard plane location . \n therefore , we tend to learn the feature that integrates both dynamic and static information as well as in compact form . in this section , \n we follow a supervised embedding scheme to generate the subspace feature based on sift and stip .    given a 2d plane @xmath1 with @xmath2 grey - scale frames @xmath3 , the plane is represented by bag - of - words feature with sift ( denoted by @xmath4 ) and stip ( denoted by @xmath5 ) . \n each plane is labeled with semantic information including plane description @xmath6 and diagnosis result @xmath7 . \n @xmath6 is a vector with @xmath8 elements @xmath9 where @xmath10 if current plane belongs to @xmath11th type of standard plane , otherwise , @xmath12 . if current plane is not a standard plane , the last element @xmath13 . \n the diagnosis result label @xmath14 indicates whether current plane supports the diagnosis of specific disease . following the similar scheme of plane description , \n the first @xmath15 elements shows the existence of specific disease ( i.e. @xmath16 supports @xmath11th disease . \n otherwise , @xmath17 ) . for normal cases , \n the last element is set to be @xmath18 . \n based on the labels , the semantic similarity between two planes can be measured as follows : @xmath19 according to the definition of @xmath20 , when two samples belong to different types of standard planes , the similarity is zero . \n however , the diagnosis information is taken into consideration when samples belong to the same standard plane . \n based on the pair - wise similarity , the task for multi - view feature embedding is to learn @xmath21 and @xmath22 mapping @xmath23 and @xmath24 into common latent space that maximizes the semantic similarity as defined in eq.([eq::semantic_sim ] ) . \n therefore , we have the objective function as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the length of the compact codes to learn . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are set of features of all training samples . \n after learning @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the original feature @xmath23 and @xmath24 are transformed into @xmath27 and @xmath28 which is compact ( @xmath29 ) and more discriminative than original feature . in order to obtain the solution of eq.([eq::c_loss ] ) , we impose orthogonality constraints , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and then expand the original problem into the following form : @xmath32 problem in eq.([eqn::conver1 ] ) with orthogonality constraints is equivalent to a generalized eigenvalue problem that has closed - form solution . \n the embedded feature @xmath33 or @xmath34 is finally fed into a support vector machine ( svm ) to determine whether current plane belongs to specific standard plane . in order to address the problem of nonlinear cases , a histogram intersection kernel ( hik ) \n is adopted in this paper . for each class of standard plane \n , we use one - vs - rest strategy to train binary svm classifier . \n to evaluate the performance of the proposed embedded feature , a 4d stic volume dataset is collected by xinhua hospital from ge e8 and the data is exported and stored in the dicom format by 4dview software from ge . \n the dicom image has the size of four dimensions with three - dimensional structure and frame numbers ( @xmath35 with 40 frames ) . to simplify the cases of disease , \n the volume data are divided into two parts with 92 normal cases and 93 abnormal cases . as shown in figure  [ fig::standardplane ] , \n three standard planes including four chamber section ( a4c ) , three vessel view ( tvv ) and transverse abdominal section ( tas ) are selected for evaluations . for each volume \n , we uniformly generate 400 planes as candidate list and , for each standard plane , three candidates are labeled by expert as ground truth . in training step , \n we randomly select 46 normal cases and 46 abnormal cases from the full dataset . in testing step , we construct two evaluation settings :    * * synthetic data : * for standard planes , we randomly select 75 planes from abnormal cases and 184 from normal cases . for non - standard planes , \n the numbers of samples from abnormal and normal cases are 1392 and 1304 respectively . \n therefore , the evaluation on synthetic data is equivalent to a conventional classification problem . \n the performance can be directly measured by classification accuracy . * \n * real volume : * we regard spl task as a retrieval problem . for each volume , the query of specific standard plane is conducted by classifying all candidate planes in the same volume . \n the final performance can be measured by f1-score of standard planes averaged over all volumes .    for visual representation , we extract sift and stip interesting points from the sequential image series of planes where the final feature is 5000d bag - of - words sift and 1000d bag - of - words stip . \n the dimension of the proposed multi - view feature is 32d . \n three baseline methods are implemented for comparison :    * * single view feature*. only sift ( denoted by `` sift only '' ) or stip ( denoted by `` stip only '' ) feature is deployed for visual representation for each plane . * \n * direct concatenation*. the sift and stip feature are concatenated into a new vector as visual representation ( denoted by `` direct concate '' ) . \n the dimension of feature is 6000d . * * unsupervised cca*. sift and stip are mapped into a latent space with unsupervised canonical correlation analysis ( denoted by `` cca '' )  @xcite . \n the dimension of feature is 32d . \n all experiments are conducted on a pc with intel 2.4ghz cpu and 16 gb ram . \n methods are implemented with matlab . \n we use libsvm package  @xcite for svm classifier . \n .classification accuracy on synthetic data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab::runningtime ] shows that the running time of training and testing steps . for cca and the proposed method , \n the training part is comprised with the learning of multi - view embedding matrix and svm parameters . \n we can observe that the time consumption is much smaller than learning svm parameters . \n since the dimension of the embedded feature is 32d which is much smaller than original feature , the testing time is only 0.14s which is much faster than the rest of approaches while the training time is also acceptable . \n the real -

{"ContextTokens": 1683, "GeneratedTokens": 266, "SynthesizedBody": "why the stars and galaxies are rotating ? what is the origin of the angular momentum ? it is known that the planets in our solar system show a remarkable scaling relation between the angular momentum @xmath1 and the mass @xmath2 for each planet , @xmath3 where the unit mass and the angular momentum are measured respectively by the planck mass @xmath4 g  and the reduced planck constant @xmath5erg@xmath6sec . \n only exceptions are the mercury and the venus whose rotations are locked with their orbital rotation around the sun . although the sun by itself deviates from the above scaling , the whole solar system is also on this line . because the relation eq.([jmplanets ] ) \n holds for the conserved quantities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it strongly suggests some fundamental origin of the planet system .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ] \n we summarize our study and discuss on further extension and possible applications of it . \n we started our study from an interesting scaling law but @xmath7 within the cluster series . \n the same index is suggested for star series . \n see below . ] \n @xmath8 which holds for angular momentum @xmath1  and the mass @xmath2  of astronomical objects from the scale of planets toward that of clusters of galaxies . focussing on the cluster series , such as globular clusters , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , we extracted the nature of the fully non - linear stage of dark matter , after the formation of caustic surface , in analogy between sgs and the fluid turbulence . \n the essential kolmogorov laws were rederived from the fourier transformed navier - stokes equation and equations for sgs , by demanding the existence of a steady energy flow characterized by a single parameter @xmath9 . \n this is an analogue of the case of smoluchowski coagulation equation , which admits scaling solution by demanding the steady mass flow . \n then we tried to test our considerations in several cosmological observations , such as the velocity dispersion , mass - luminosity ratio , @xmath10 relation , power spectrum of density fluctuations , and the cosmic magnetic fields . \n they all point the concordant value for the constant energy flow per mass : @xmath11@xmath12sec@xmath13 .      1 . \n we would like to evaluate the energy flow @xmath9 for dm , which may be associated with the hierarchical coalescence process in which smaller clusters continuously form larger clusters . \n this process provides the bottom - up scenario for the formation of large scale structure especially in the cold dm model . \n we would like to check whether the value we used @xmath14@xmath15 $ ] is consistent with the hierarchical coalescence evolution of dm . \n roughly estimated , this accumulation rate of kinetic energy yields a galaxy within about @xmath16 years . \n if the above is the case for dm , then we would like to apply the same analysis to our planet system , which is also considered to have the coalescence evolution as its origin [ 35 ] . \n actually in the left half of figure [ fig3 ] , the planet and star systems seem to admit the fitting line with the same slope @xmath17 as the case for dm but with larger parameter value for @xmath9 . \n it turns out that the appropriate value for @xmath18  becomes of order @xmath19 , which seems to be too large to be explained from a simple coalescence process as in the case for dm . some violent mechanism , which allow huge energy transfer rate or catastrophic coalescence , is expected in the case for planet formation process . \n 3 .   in the fluid turbulence \n , there holds another relation often called kolmogorov 4/5 law @xmath20which is essential to explain the energy flow takes place from low frequency modes to high frequency modes on average . \n then what is the analogous relation for sgs and how is it relevant in the universe ? \n although we do not know the answer , it will be important to notice the fact that sgs [ 36 ] shares some common properties with the fluid turbulence [ 37 ] , such as the negative skewness and the exponential distribution function of the velocity - difference , etc . \n these common properties will be a good starting point for further discussion . \n 4 .   it would be interesting if we could actually transform eq.(ftjeans2 ) into the smoluchowski form like eq.([smoluchowski ] ) which directly expresses the coalescence evolution of sgs . \n if this is the case , the possible scaling solution , which may asymptotically realize , may correspond to the schechter function [ 3 ] which has a typical form , @xmath21where @xmath22 represents the frequency of the object of luminosity @xmath23 . if the cosmological objects are formed after many coalescence processes , then the smoluchowski equation will be more appropriate than the press - schechter theory [ 3 ] , in which a single collapse determines the population of objects at the corresponding scale \n . if this is the case , the index @xmath24 for the kernel @xmath25 ( see just below eq.([smoluchowski ] ) ) should be about @xmath26 . \n the exponential factor @xmath27 seems to be a natural tail of the distribution which is gradually evolving without runaway coalescence . \n we could not complete the argument on the velocity - luminosity ( or mass ) relation [ 38 ] which holds within a single species of object , from our point of view . \n if we simply apply our argument for luminous objects , we would have , from @xmath28 , the luminosity @xmath29as a function of the velocity @xmath30 or the velocity dispersion @xmath31  at that scale , provided appropriate reference ratio @xmath32 is given . \n for dm , we have , from @xmath33 , the mass expression @xmath34on the other hand , several tight relations are obtained for each type of galaxies . for spiral galaxies , tally - fisher relation of the form eq.(lv - rel ) holds with the variation of index from 3 for b - band to 4 for k band observations . for elliptical galaxies , a tight relation on the fundamental plane \n is established , @xmath35const.@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average surface brightness . \n although we can simply apply our argument to yield @xmath38which is almost consistent with the above , we can not obtain the relation in the form of a plain among three independent parameters ; all quantities are functions of only @xmath39 in our case . \n the authors would like to thank osamu hashimoto , hidenori takahashi for relevant discussions on the turbulence , osamu iguchi , yasuhide sota , and tohru tashiro for discussion on the local virial relation , nozomi mori for the cosmic magnetic fields and dynamo theory , masaaki morita , hideaki mouri for turbulence and fate of cosmic vorticity , kiyotaka tanikawa for showing us his paper before publication and providing us relevant references on @xmath10 relation , takayuki tatekawa for higher - order density perturbation theories . \n all of their help has been crucial for the completion of this paper .", "StartTimeOffset": 1854941609065, "RequestID": "2da3ee2b189640f8b9fe4e7585c02525", "TotalTokens": 1949}
{"ContextTokens": 1453, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "the two most frequently applied early - type galaxy distance indicators are the fundamental plane ( fp , and the related @xmath0-@xmath1 ) and surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) methods . in a recent study ( blakeslee  2001,2002 ) \n , we used @xmath2- and @xmath3-band data from the ground - based sbf survey ( tonry  2001 ) to calculate fp photometric parameters for 170 galaxies with velocity dispersions available in the homogenized smac catalogue ( hudson  2001 ) . to our knowledge , this is the largest galaxy - by - galaxy comparison of different standard candle / rod distance methods to date . \n fig.1a shows the comparison . \n overall the distance agreement was good , but several low - luminosity , s0 galaxies had systematically low fp distances , probably due in part to younger ages and lower mass - to - light ratios , although aperture effects may also contribute . \n the sbf distances are tied to the cepheids via measurements in spiral bulges , while the fp distances are tied to the hubble flow via distant clusters ; the hubble constant that results from this comparison is @xmath4 . \n however , we also derived independent distances for these galaxies based on their velocities and the gravity field inferred from the redshift - space galaxy density ; the resulting comparison with sbf yields @xmath5 ( fig.1b ) , formally discordant at the 2@xmath6 level with the fp - sbf result , but within the range of the systematic uncertainties in the various ties . \n another interesting facet of this work relates to the `` fluctuation number '' @xmath7 , which measures the galaxy luminosity in units of the weighted mean stellar luminosity . \n correlates tightly with stellar velocity dispersion ; it also correlates with galaxy color and is independent of galactic extinction . \n interestingly , sbf distances calibrated using the properties of , such as those shown in fig.1b , can be viewed as a hybrid of sbf and fp distances , and may be more accurate than those calibrated from galaxy color alone . \n we plan to investigate these issues in more detail . \n cepheids occur only in spirals and other late - type , star - forming galaxies . however , the most massive virialized structures in the nearby universe ( e.g. , the virgo , fornax , and centaurus clusters ) , are overwhelmingly dominated by early - type galaxies . although some spirals appear in projection against the virgo core , \n the various secondary indicators tied to the cepheid scale indicate that these galaxies are not at the same distance as the core ellipticals ( e.g. , tonry  2000 ; ferrarese  2000 ; kelson  2000 ; blakeslee  2002 ) . \n alternatively , it may be that the secondary indicators are yielding systematically different results for the calibrating spirals and the target ellipticals . \n we have an ongoing cycle  10 wfpc2 program to calibrate the early - type galaxy distance scale via cepheid distances to late - type galaxies that are physically associated with ellipticals . \n the target galaxies are the ngc4647/ngc4649 pair ( fig.2a ) and ngc5128 ( cena ) , an elliptical with a central dust lane and associated star formation , apparently resulting from the incursion of a gas - rich dwarf . \n the cena cepheid observations have yielded more than 60 superb cepheids , making this one of largest high - quality hst cepheid data sets . at present \n , we are still finalizing the analysis , but fig.2b shows some example light curves ; differential extinction within cena is a major issue for this program . \n sbf and type ia supernovae ( sneia ) studies have in the past disagreed on @xmath8 at the @xmath920% level , which is surprising for two methods that routinely achieve 510% internal accuracy . \n the excellent resolution of hst provides an enormous advantage over ground - based data for sbf studies , and we have recently used wfpc2 to measure high - quality hst / wfpc2 sbf distances to seven early - type galaxies that have hosted well - observed sneia ( ajhar  2001 ) . \n the results showed excellent agreement in the relative distances , but an offset of @xmath90.25 mag in zero points , which we traced to the different , and indeed dissonant , compilations of cepheid distances used in the past for the respective zero - point calibrations of the two methods . \n when calibrated consistently , sbf and sneia also agree in an absolute sense ( fig.3a ) and give @xmath10 . \n this is the first time the agreement has been demonstrated through a direct comparison of statistically significant samples of sbf and sneia galaxy distances . \n the most pressing problem in the measurement of extragalactic distances appears to be systematic uncertainties in the zero points . \n we have seen that there is significant uncertainty in the zero - point tie of the early - type galaxy distance scale to cepheids , but perhaps even greater is the uncertainty in the cepheid zero point itself , in part due to the poorly - constrained lmc distance . \n stellar population models can be used to predict sbf magnitudes and colors for a large range of metallicities and ages ( e.g. , blakeslee , vazdekis , & ajhar 2001b ) . \n these models reproduce the observed sbf colors and behaviors very well , but predict an sbf zero point fainter than the cepheid - calibrated one by @xmath11mag in @xmath3 ( the only band in which sbf is directly tied to the cepheids via spiral bulges ) . \n however , the model and empirical zero points would come into close agreement if the cepheid scale were revised to agree with the dynamical distance to the ngc4258 water maser ( herrnstein  1999 ) , for example , by changing the assumed lmc distance modulus from 18.5 to 18.3 mag . \n further refinements of the models should provide more stringent tests of the distance scale and guide future sbf programs ( fig.3b ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1868167811033, "RequestID": "6d414c425fde42b39918a8256b7c1c51", "TotalTokens": 1603}
{"ContextTokens": 2342, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "in this paper we present a summary of the r@xmath1d results and expected performance of a hadron blind detector ( hbd ) which has been developed as an upgrade of the phenix detector at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl \n . the hbd will allow the measurement of electron - positron pairs from the decay of the light vector mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and the low - mass ( @xmath5 1 gev / c@xmath6 ) pair continuum in au+au collisions . \n dileptons are valuable probes to diagnose the hot and dense matter formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . \n the physics potential of this probe is fully confirmed by results from lower energy experiments . \n the most prominent result is the strong enhancement of low - mass electron pairs observed by the ceres experiment @xcite at the cern sps and recently confirmed by the na60 results @xcite . \n this enhancement triggered a wealth of theoretical activity and was quantitatively reproduced only by invoking the thermal radiation from a high density hadron gas ( @xmath7 ) with in - medium modification of the intermediate @xmath2 meson which could be linked to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . \n the measurement of electron pairs is however a very challenging one . \n the main difficulty arises from the huge combinatorial background , i.e. uncorrelated pairs formed by tracks from unrecognized @xmath8 conversions and @xmath9 dalitz decays . for example \n , the analysis of run-4 data taken with the present phenix configuration @xcite shows that the signal to background ratio , s / b , at the invariant mass of m @xmath10  500  mev / c@xmath6 is approximately 1/500 , making the measurement of the low - mass pair continuum practically impossible . \n an upgrade of the phenix detector is therefore necessary for this measurement . \n the present paper is focussed on the comprehensive r&d program that we have carried out over the past two years to develop such an upgrade @xcite . \n the upgrade consists of two elements : a ) installation ( foreseen in the original design of phenix ) of an inner coil which results in an almost field - free region close to the vertex , extending out to @xmath10 60 cm in the radial direction ; b ) the major and challenging element of the upgrade is a hadron - blind detector ( hbd ) located in this field free region . fig . \n [ fig : hbdinphnx ] shows the layout of the inner part of the phenix detector together with the location of the coils and the proposed hbd . \n the main task of the hbd is to recognize and reject @xmath8 conversions and @xmath11 dalitz decays . \n the strategy is to exploit the fact that the opening angle of electron pairs from these sources is very small compared to the pairs from light vector mesons . in the field - free region , this angle is preserved and by applying an opening angle cut one can reject more than 90% of the conversions and @xmath11 dalitz decays , while preserving most of the signal . \n based on monte carlo simulations , the main hbd specifications are : electron identification with a very high efficiency ( @xmath12 90@xmath13 ) , double hit recognition at a comparable level and moderate @xmath14 rejection factor of @xmath10100 . \n we analyzed possible realizations of the hbd detector and finally adopted the following scheme : a windowless erenkov detector , operated with pure cf@xmath0 in a proximity focus configuration and directly coupled to a triple gas electron multiplier ( gem ) @xcite detector with a csi photocathode evaporated on the top face of the first gem foil and with pad readout . \n the concept described in the previous section exhibits a number of very attractive features : a ) the choice of cf@xmath0 both as radiator and detector gas in a windowless geometry results in a very large bandwidth ( 6 - 11.5 ev ) and consequently in a very large figure of merit n@xmath15 ( @xmath10800  @xmath16 ) . with these unprecedented numbers , \n the number of photoelectrons n@xmath17 is expected to be of the order of 35 for a 50 cm long radiator ; b ) the readout scheme foresees the detection of the erenkov photoelectrons in a pad plane with hexagonal pads of size slightly smaller than the blob size ( @xmath1010 cm@xmath6 ) such that the probability of a single - pad hit by an electron entering the hbd is negligibly small . on the other hand , whenever a hadron gives a signal in the hbd , it will produce a single pad hit with an almost 100% probability . \n this will provide a strong handle in the hadron rejection factor of the hbd ; c ) the relatively large pad size results also in a low granularity and therefore a low cost detector . \n in addition , since the photoelectrons produced by a single electron will be distributed between at most three pads , one can expect a primary charge of at least 10 electrons / pad , allowing operation of the detector at a relatively moderate gain of a few times 10@xmath19 . \n this is a crucial advantage for the stable operation of a uv photon detector . \n however , many elements of the proposed hbd were new and had not been tested before in the laboratory . \n a number of issues and questions were raised which required dedicated investigation . to address these questions and to demonstrate the concept validity , \n a comprehensive r&d program was needed . \n the results of this effort are summarized below @xcite :    * we have shown that a triple gem detector with a reflective csi photocathode operates in a stable mode at gains up to 10@xmath20 in pure cf@xmath0 . * \n a charge saturation effect occurring in cf@xmath0 when the total charge in the avalanche reaches 4@xmath2110@xmath22  e makes the hbd relatively robust against discharges . \n * we carried out a test of a triple gem detector operated with pure cf@xmath0 at the proposed location inside the phenix central arm spectrometer . \n the detector performed smoothly in the presence of au+au collisions exhibiting no discharges or gain instabilities . \n * we have studied the basic parameters which determine the hbd performance . in particular , we measured the device response to mip s and to electrons . \n large hadron rejection factors , well in excess of 100 , can be achieved while preserving an electron detection efficiency larger than 90% . \n * we confirmed measurements of the csi quantum efficiency over the bandwidth 6 - 8.3  ev and extended them up to 10.3  ev . \n extrapolation to the expected operational bandwidth of the device ( 6 - 11.5 ev ) gives a figure of merit n@xmath15=822 @xmath16 . \n * aging studies of the gem foils as well as the csi photocathode revealed that there is no significant deterioration of the detector for irradiation levels corresponding to @xmath10  10 years of normal phenix operation at rhic . \n these results demonstrated the validity of the proposed hbd concept and paved the way to the incorporation of such a device in the phenix experiment . \n the mechanical design of the hbd has been developed and construction procedures have been exercised and optimized on a full - scale prototype . \n the hbd consists of two identical arms ( see fig .  [ \n fig : hbd-3d_qm2005 ] ) , each one covering 135@xmath23 in azimuth and @xmath240.45 units of pseudorapidity . in each arm \n the detector element is subdivided in 12 detector modules , 6 along the @xmath4 axis @xmath21 2 along the z axis , with a module size of @xmath25 cm@xmath6 . \n the signals are collected in the anode plane consisting of 1152 hexagonal pads in each arm . \n the detector vessel has a polygonal shape made of panels glued together . \n the full - scale prototype design has been integrated into the phenix standard simulation package . \n realistic simulations have been performed using hijing central au+au collisions at @xmath26 gev with embedded @xmath4 mesons . \n we chose a very narrow centrality window : impact parameter b  @xmath27 2  fm ( top 2@xmath13 ) which corresponds to an average charged particle rapidity density of dn@xmath28/dy  @xmath29  940 . \n [ fig : event_display ] shows the reconstructed clusters after clean - up of such a central collision . \n the clean - up is optimized for electron identification and hadron rejection . \n it requires : a ) a pad amplitude @xmath30  p.e . ; \n b ) a cluster amplitude@xmath31  20  p.e . \n ; c ) a cluster size with n@xmath32  2 . out of the huge number of hadrons ( @xmath10400 ) going through the hbd only two are reconstructed demostrating excellent hadron rejection . \n electrons reconstructed in the central arms and matched to a cluster in the hbd are rejected as a ) likely conversions if the cluster amplitude is larger than 60 p.e . ; \n b ) likely @xmath11 dalitz decays if there is another electron cluster in the hbd within a distance of 200  mrad . for the mass region around the @xmath4 meson , \n this results in a reduction of the combinatorial background from these two sources by a factor larger than 100 , compared to the present performance without the hbd . at this level of rejection \n the quality of the low - mass pair measurement is not anymore limited by this background but rather by the combinatorial background from the semi - leptonic decays of charmed mesons .", "StartTimeOffset": 1872925632475, "RequestID": "d2182c50b14f41d0963d268b4393f325", "TotalTokens": 2471}

many of these stars are also rich in li and @xmath5 process elements . \n hbb converts c into n and will prevent the atmosphere from becoming c rich @xcite . \n the copious amounts of n produced in this case will be primary owing to the primary c being dredged from the he - shell . \n intermediate - mass evolution is sensitive to the initial composition and the mass - loss law used in the calculation @xcite , where the minimum stellar mass for hbb is pushed to lower mass in lower metallicity models . \n there is evidence from agb stellar spectra @xcite , and from pre - solar grains @xcite that `` extra - mixing '' processes are also operating in low - mass ( @xmath6 ) agb stars , along with the tdu . \n the physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the extra mixing are not known , although various processes have been proposed including rotation and thermohaline mixing . \n the presence of a binary companion could have dramatic consequences for the evolution and nucleosynthesis , however i leave discussions to izzard , taam and podsiadlowski ( these proceedings ) . \n owing to fact that calculating a tp - agb model is a computationally intensive task , synthetic agb models , which use fitting formulae to model the evolution quickly , have proved to be a successful approach for population syntheses studies that require @xmath7 stars . \n historically this approach was validated by the fact that the stellar luminosity on the agb is nearly a linear function of the core mass @xcite , although this relation breaks down for stars undergoing hbb @xcite . \n synthetic agb models have successfully been used to model agb populations @xcite , and compute stellar yields @xcite . \n many of the parameterizations used in synthetic evolution studies are derived from detailed stellar models , such as the growth of the h - exhausted core with time , and as such are only accurate over the range in mass and metallicity of the stellar models they are based upon . \n an example is provided by @xcite who compute agb yields for initial masses between 0.9 and 8@xmath1 whereas the interpulse - period - core mass relation @xcite they use was only derived for stars with initial masses between 1 and 3@xmath1 . \n what affect this has on the yields is unclear since this relation will affect the number of tps during the tp - agb phase and hence the level of chemical enrichment . \n recent improvements in computer power mean that grids of detailed agb models can now be produced in a reasonable time @xcite ;

{"ContextTokens": 1907, "GeneratedTokens": 193, "SynthesizedBody": "in standard models of active galactic nuclei , seyfert 2 galaxies are interpreted as systems viewed at sufficiently high inclination angles that the central continuum source is obscured by the surrounding dusty torus ( e.  g. , krolik 1999 ) . however \n , residual soft x - ray emission is observed from many of these systems . \n this must originate in the unobscured nuclear vicinity , or perhaps in other regions of the galaxy . \n while one expects some soft x - ray emission to be produced by reprocessing of the strong continuum flux in the circumnuclear environment , collisionally - heated gas associated with starburst regions might also provide an important contribution ( e.  g. , wilson et  al . \n 1992 ) . \n high resolution x - ray spectroscopy provides the least ambiguous means of distinguishing between these two interpretations . \n discrete spectral features formed in collisional plasmas are qualitatively different from those formed in photoionized gas ( liedahl 1999 ) . in collisional plasmas , \n emission lines are primarily produced by electron impact excitation from the ground state , which favors strong resonance transitions . \n fe l - shell transitions are especially prominent . in photoionized plasmas , \n the electron temperature and density are too low for excitation by electron impact , and the lines are produced mostly via radiative cascades following recombination , which favors the lowest - lying multiplet levels , thereby producing forbidden transitions . \n also , fe l lines are much weaker than hydrogenic and heliumlike k - shell transitions of lower z elements . \n another characteristic difference involves the radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) . in collisional plasmas , these are broad weak features , barely discernible above the bremsstrahlung continuum . in photoionized plasmas , \n the rrc are much narrower and far more prominent ( liedahl and paerels 1996 ) . \n the grating experiments on chandra and xmm - newton have provided the first x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 s with sufficient resolution and sensitivity to investigate these issues in detail . here \n we present chandra hetg spectra of markarian 3 and xmm - newton rgs spectra of ngc 1068 . \n the data are consistent with all emission arising in photoionized gas . \n we can use these spectra to derive sensitive constraints on the structure of the circumsource environment . \n the chandra hetg spectrum of markarian 3 is shown in figure 1 ( sako et  al . \n a variety of narrow features are readily discernible and are explicitly labeled in the figure . \n these include ly series transitions of hydrogenic o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe , heliumlike complexes of o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and fe , near - neutral fluorescence k@xmath0 lines of mg , si , s , and fe , and a few weak fe l lines for a range of charge states ( fe xvii through xxiv ) . \n the he@xmath0 complexes are especially interesting . for o vii , \n the forbidden line is clearly the strongest , and the relative line ratios agree with the values expected for pure recombination ( porquet & dubau 2000 ) . for both ne ix and si xiii , \n the resonance lines are roughly comparable to the forbidden lines , but the ratios are still not as high as expected for electron impact excitation . \n this suggests possible contributions from both recombination and collisional excitation emission from the same plasma or spatially - distinct plasmas . \n the presence of the fe l features might also bolster that interpretation .    however , we are firmly convinced that this is _ not _ what is happening in this spectrum . \n both the heliumlike resonance lines and the fe l lines are not produced collisionally , but instead are photoexcited by the central continuum radiation . \n two major clues lead us to this interpretation : ( 1 ) the fe l lines are too weak relative to the heliumlike resonance lines to be consistent with electron impact excitation , unless we significantly reduce the iron abundance in the putative collisional component . \n ( 2 ) the specific fe l lines observe are all 3d2p and 3p2s . \n these have high oscillator strengths , and are the most prominent features expected for photoexcitation . \n there are no accompanying 3s 2p transitions , which have much lower oscillator strengths . in collisional plasmas , \n the two sets of transitions have near comparable line intensities .    at low to intermediate line \n optical depths , photoexcitation and recombination provide comparable contributions to the x - ray line spectrum of photoionized gas . \n this interpretation suffices for markarian 3 . \n we see no conclusive evidence for a contribution from collisional gas . \n the xmm - newton rgs spectrum of ngc 1068 is shown in figure 2 ( kinkhabwala et  al . \n we see a very line - rich spectrum dominated by hydrogenic and heliumlike lines ( c through si ) , accompanied by weak fe l - shell transitions . \n in addition , we see very prominent rrc . \n all rrc for the hydrogenic and heliumlike charge states of c , n , o , and ne are detected . \n the narrow rrc provide unambiguous evidence that most of the x - ray emission we are observing is produced in photoionized gas . \n this conclusion is supported by the he@xmath0 complexes , in which the forbidden line is brighter than the resonance . \n the ratios of the forbidden line intensities to the rrc intensities agree with expectations for recombination cascades . \n nevertheless , as for markarian 3 , recombination alone does not provide a good quantitative fit to the entire ngc 1068 spectrum . \n the heliumlike resonance lines are still too bright relative to the forbidden lines , and the fe l lines are brighter than would be expected for purely recombining gas . here \n again , we can explain all of these features by allowing for additional contributions from photoexcitation . \n conclusive evidence for this comes from the hydrogenic line series : the higher series lines are observed to be significantly brighter relative to ly@xmath0 than is expected for either recombining gas or collisionally - excited gas . \n this is a natural consequence of photoexcitation at intermediate optical depths due to saturation of the highest oscillator strength lines . \n we have developed a fully self - consistent model for the ngc 1068 spectrum in terms of a photoionized medium which correctly accounts for both the photoexcitation and radiative recombination contributions ( kinkhabwala et  al . \n 2001a , behar et  al . \n individual column densities and velocity distributions for each ion are left as free parameters . \n the model provides an amazingly good fit to these high statistics data . \n fits to the earlier chandra hetg spectra of markarian 3 , ngc 4151 ( ogle et  al . \n 2000 ) , and the circinus galaxy ( sambruna et  al . 2000 ) as well as to a recent observation of ngc 4507 yield similar results ( kinkhabwala et  al . \n 2001b ) . in particular , we find that the ogle et  al . \n ( 2000 ) conclusion that the ngc 4151 spectrum indicates the presence of hot collisional gas is incorrect . \n all of the features in the spectra of all seyfert 2 galaxies so far observed with chandra and xmm are consistent with fluorescence of cold gas and photoexcitation and recombination cascades in photoionized gas . \n the high resolution x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies display a wealth of emission features produced by fluorescence , photoexcitation , and recombination cascades in radiatively - driven gas . \n there is no evidence for measureable contributions from hot collisionally - ionized gas in any of the sources which have been studied to date . \n further observations of this kind should be very helpful in elucidating the nature of the circumsource medium in active galactic nuclei .", "StartTimeOffset": 1925790838358, "RequestID": "c6a53b1fc4624d72bc681ad3b3f26089", "TotalTokens": 2100}
{"ContextTokens": 3045, "GeneratedTokens": 96, "SynthesizedBody": "modern cosmology is nowadays settled on observations concerning mainly the distribution of matter and the dynamics of the expansion of the universe . on the one hand , there are now various cosmological observations supporting a matter distribution that is homogeneous on large scales of order @xmath0 h@xmath1mpc . \n nevertheless , at late times , the matter distribution is highly structured on smaller scales , with the presence of clusters of galaxies , filaments and voids . moreover \n , the statistical isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation supports the idea that the universe is highly isotropic on average , on large scales . facing these observational issues \n , one assumes in the standard cosmological framework that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on all scales , resulting in a spacetime described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , the inhomogeneities being perturbations around this homogeneous and isotropic background . \n then , all the observables of the universe on large scales can be deduced from a single degree of freedom : the scale factor of the metric , and the dynamics of the inhomogeneities is well described as long as the density contrast in the matter fields remains small .    on the other hand \n , many recent observations strongly favor a universe whose expansion has been accelerating in the recent past and may be accelerating today . in the frw context \n this necessarily requires the introduction of exotic sources as for example a cosmological constant or quintessence fields , or a modification of gravity , generally implying the so - called coincidence problem : why is the expansion accelerating approximatelly at the same time when the universe becomes structured , that is when the density contrast in the matter field is no longer small on a wide range of scales \n ?    regionally averaged relativistic cosmologies may be able to answer this question by linking the dynamics of the universe on large scales to its structuration on smaller scales ; see interesting discussions of that topic in rsnen ( 2006 ) . \n it consists in defining cosmologies that are homogeneous on large scales without supposing any local symmetry , thanks to a spatial averaging procedure . \n it results in equations for a volume scale factor that not only include an averaged matter source term , but also additional terms that can be interpreted as the effects of the coarse - grained inhomogeneities on the large scales dynamics . \n these additional terms are commonly named backreaction .    in this paper , after introducing the formalism of regionally averaged cosmologies in the first part , we shall propose a correspondence between regionally averaged cosmologies and friedmannian scalar field cosmologies in the second part , the scalar field being interpreted in this context as a mean field description of the inhomogeneous universe , that can play the role of a quintessence field . \n then , in the third part , as an example of the correspondence , we explicitly reconstruct the mean field theory for the particular class of scaling solutions of the regionally averaged cosmologies , and discuss its properties . \n this correspondence has been proposed and discussed in buchert et al . \n in this paper , since we are interested in the late time behavior of the cosmological model , we restrict the analysis to a universe filled with an irrotational fluid of dust matter with density @xmath2 . \n the more general case of an irrotational perfect fluid can be found in buchert ( 2001 ) . \n following buchert ( 2000 ) we foliate the spacetime by flow - orthogonal hypersurfaces with the 3-metric @xmath3 . \n the line element then reads @xmath4 . \n the large scale homogeneous model is built by averaging the scalar part of the general relativistic equations on a spatial domain @xmath5 with a spatial averager applied to any scalar function @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the volume of the domain @xmath5 and @xmath9 . \n then , one can define a volume scale factor @xmath10 , and applying the averager [ averager ] to the hamiltonian constraint and raychaudhuri s equation when @xmath11 has been set to @xmath12 leads to : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the averaged spatial 3-ricci scalar , and @xmath15 is known as the kinematical backreaction term . \n this backreaction is given in terms of the well - known adm variables that are the local expansion rate @xmath16 and the rate of shear @xmath17 by : @xmath18 . \n one can notice that this additionnal term is the spatial variance over the domain @xmath5 of these quantities . \n in other words , the more the matter distribution is structured , with collapsed regions and voids , the more this term may contribute to the dynamics , except of course if the two parts , i.e. expansion and shear fluctuations compensate each other . \n the third equation of the system [ averagedsystem ] is simply an integrability condition that expresses the compatibility of the first two equations . \n the system [ averagedsystem ] characterizes the properties of the universe on large scales . \n it preserves the main feature of the standard frw universe , that is the fact that the properties of the universe on large scales can be deduced from a single scale factor , but this scale factor now obeys dynamical equations that differ from the frw equations for a dust field because of the additional source terms @xmath19 and @xmath14 . \n these terms arise because the averaging and the time derivatives do nt commute . \n of course the curvature is also present in frw equations , but it reduces to a constant curvature term , whereas in averaged cosmologies , it is coupled to the backreaction term through the last equation of [ averagedsystem ] . \n we will see below that this coupling is essential to explain the cosmic acceleration in averaged cosmologies . in analogy with frw cosmology , \n we introduce @xmath20 , and we can define a set of cosmological parameters : @xmath21 as well as an effective deceleration parameter : @xmath22 .    to emphasize the difference between the mean curvature @xmath14 and the friedmannian constant curvature @xmath23 , one should note that they differ by a term representing the effect of the whole history of the universe since the beginning of the dust dominated phase : @xmath24 . \n so , when the backreaction term does nt vanish identically , the mean curvature does nt behave like a constant curvature term . \n finally , it is important to note that the system [ averagedsystem ] is not closed : it has four unknown quantities , but only three independent equations . in order to close it , it is then necessary to introduce another relation that can be either a mathematical ansatz or a physical statement . \n in order to constrain and understand the dynamics of averaged cosmologies , it could be interesting to benefit from the well - known properties of the friedmannian cosmologies , so we will develop in this section a correspondence between the backreaction effect , and the simplest mean field model , that is a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field @xmath25 with a self - interaction potential @xmath26 . \n let s parameterize @xmath19 and @xmath14 as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 for a standard scalar field and @xmath29 for a phantom scalar field . \n then , the system [ averagedsystem ] becomes : @xmath30 except for the dependence on the domain @xmath5 , these are exactly the equations for a homogeneous cosmology in presence of a dust field and a minimally coupled scalar field . because this scalar field appears as a mean field description of the morphology of the structures in the universe , we call it the morphon field. \n the correspondence established in the previous section can be used in two different ways . the first one , and probably the more useful would be to consider particular models of scalar field cosmologies and to deduce the characteristics of the corresponding backreaction and mean curvature ; this will be the subject of a forthcoming work . in this short contribution , as an illustration of the correspondence , we will conversely focus on constructing the mean field model from a particular class of backreaction . \n we consider the large class of scaling solutions : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the initial values of @xmath19 and @xmath14 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real numbers . inserting this ansatz in the third equation of [ averagedsystem ] , one obtains two different kinds of solutions . for @xmath36 , \n the only solution is : @xmath37 that is a near - friedmannian solution because it reduces to a constant curvature for @xmath38 . \n it corresponds to the case where the backreaction and the mean curvature evolve independently . on the contrary , the solutions for @xmath39 : @xmath40 entail a strong coupling between the backreaction and the mean curvature \n this case is an extreme one , but the coupling must be considered a generic property . \n the parameter @xmath41 that is constant for the scaling solutions is the conversion rate of the mean curvature into backreaction ; it plays a very important role in the mechanism responsible for the cosmic acceleration : it only occurs if @xmath420,-1[$ ] , that is if the mean curvature converts sufficiently into backreaction that then decays slowly enough or even grows ( @xmath43 ) . in the following \n we will focus on this class of strongly coupled solutions [ neqp ] . \n one can then reconstruct the potential for the scalar field associated with the scaling solutions [ neqp ] . \n a straightforward calculation provides : @xmath44    the potential [ pot ] is known in the literature about scalar field type dark energy ( sahni et al . \n 2000 , sahni & starobinskii 2003 , urena - lopez & matos 2000 ) . \n it corresponds to dark energy with a constant equation of state , here given in terms of the parameters of the averaged cosmology by @xmath45 . \n this result is consistent only under some restrictions on the parameters : we must have @xmath46 and @xmath28 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 with @xmath29 in @xmath42 -

[ intense ] show that the intensity changed due to a factor.the same , we can get @xmath17 where @xmath18is the flux striking the disc in kerr metric , while@xmath19is the fomat in newtonian space - time . in the newtonian space-time.in the model of point like , static source up the black hole \n , the flux striking the disk should be @xmath20 in kerr black hole , we know that @xmath21 we set r , a , in unit of m , then@xmath19can have the detailed formula @xmath22 for a non - rotating black hole , we can get @xmath23 when we set r , h in unit of schwichild radii @xmath24,the formula change to @xmath25 from eq . \n [ qin ] we can see that the flux striking the accretion disc has a close relation with both the photo index @xmath0 , the accretion rate @xmath26,and the sources location.observations shows that the source x - ray continuum always have a photo index @xmath27 . \n when we compute the @xmath18 in this model , we find that in a extremely rotating kerr metric the flux concentrated on only a very small region near the center , while other place left nearly no illumination at all.it is apparently a gr effect.when it comes to the schwchild metric , the power law approximation is also not good to describe the emissivity , but it is rather flatter to the case in kerr metric.we can conclude that the need of steep power law model may due to a rapidly rotating black hole . \n our work is invoked by recent report of steep emissity in inner part of accretion disk(fabian 2002).in the observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15,fabian use a broken emissivity law to model the data , and with good result.however,they assume that the steep emissivity is a result from two reflector in the disk . in our work \n we can see that , the steep emissivity may come from the effect of light bending near the center black hole.and the concentrating of flux , will give inner side a rather high ionization parameter,@xmath28 , which may result a line component at @xmath29kev.there are also other sources , such as iras 13224 - 3809(boller 2003),which should induce a steeper emissivity law.the steep emissivity law may be a evidence of a centering rapidly rotating black hole .    in present x - ray study , \n there are lots of uncertainty in modelling the iron lines in agn , the s / n is a big problem to determine the real shape of the line.former observation confirms that there exist many agn which contain board and skew iron line , indicating that the line is produced very near the black hole.however,recent xmm observation show that there does not ubiquitous exist board iron line , instead , a narrow cole at 6.4 kev is present.this has not been included in this paper .    our work show that in the gr effect , the emissity can not be simply regarded as a power law as a function of r , instead , it should be described by various factors such as a , the source s position the photo index.when computed in the gr we find in the kerr metric the large concentration of the flux in the accretion disc , rather left other part of the disk `` empty'',also , the large concentration in flux will undoubtedly invoke the model of ionized disk describe by ross 1999.and our work is only a simplified model to test the gr effects , further work such as the disk motion and density under high illumination which may affect the emissity should be invoked . \n ballantyne d.r . \n , fabian a.c . , 2001 , mnras , 328 , l11 ballantyne d.r . , \n ross r.r , 2002 , mnras , in press ( astro -

binary evolution . \n the question is : is there evidence for the existence of o / ne wds ? \n a very useful overview about this topic has been given by weidemann ( 2003 ) at the last wd workshop at naples . \n we refer to his paper for a detailed discussion and references concerning stellar evolution scenarios , which we only briefly summarize here . \n o / ne wds should have masses of 11.3m@xmath0 . \n below a core mass of 1m@xmath0 c burning can not ignite . \n if the core mass exceeds 1.3m@xmath0 , an electron capture collapse will occur and probably result in a neutron star . \n there is a debate as to what initial -

rich intershell matter on the surface ( e.g.  werner 2001 ) . \n h1504 + 65 is an extreme , and unique , pg1159 star because it is also he - deficient . \n the first quantitative analysis revealed that the photosphere is mainly composed of c and o , by equal parts ( werner 1991 ) , and it has been discussed that h1504 + 65 is either a naked c / o core or that we see the c / o envelope of a o / ne wd . the latter possibility is supported by the fact that h1504 + 65 is the most massive known pg1159 star , although the spectroscopic mass determination suggests a mass slightly below 1m@xmath0 . from the discovery of ne lines in optical and euv spectra ( werner & wolff 1999 ) we found ne=25% . \n this result is inconclusive concerning the nature of the star as a possible o / ne wd . \n soft x - ray and fuv spectra of h1504 + 65 were taken by chandra / letg and fuse , respectively , and the following atmospheric and stellar parameters were derived ( werner et al . \n 2004 ) : @xmath3}\\ ] ] @xmath4 @xmath5 estimated errors for abundances are : @xmath620% for mass fraction of c and o , and a factor of 3 for ne and mg . \n one significant result is the detection of mg in high amounts , which seems to confirm the o / ne wd nature of h1504 + 65 . \n however , a detailed discussion reveals that the abundance determinations of ne and mg still can not decide if h1504 + 65 exposes a c / o core or a c / o envelope . the final answer to this problem \n was hoped to be accomplished by uv spectroscopy with hst . planned observations during cycle  13 aimed at the detection of \n na which , if strongly overabundant , is a clear indicator for c burning . \n unfortunately , the stis spectrograph aboard hst died before the observations were carried out . \n it appears that this question will remain unanswered for many years to come . \n this is disappointing , because h1504 + 65 is the only object for which we can hope to proof that single o / ne wds do really exist . \n considering our mass determination , even if we stretch the result to the limit of our error bar , the mass of h1504 + 65 is slightly below 1m@xmath0 . \n however , we point out that the evolutionary tracks which we used to derive the mass , are those of post - agb remnants that have lastly burned helium but  h1504 + 65 has no helium \n . there are no appropriate evolutionary tracks available . \n the main problem is that we have no idea what is the evolutionary history of this unique star : what event caused the helium - deficiency ? \n we finally note that there is no indication that h1504 + 65 is in a binary system . \n it could be that agb - like mass loss of single stars during carbon burning is not sufficient to stop the growth of the o / ne core before the onset of electron - capture collapse . \n hence , close binary systems in which mass is transferred from the c - burning star onto a companion might be the only places where o / ne wds are created . \n first evidence for the existence of such systems came from neon overabundances detected by line emission in ( low resolution ) asca spectra of the lmxb 4u1626 - 67 ( angelini et al . \n evidence for neon - rich absorbing circumstellar material was found in chandra letg spectra of 4u0614 + 091 and three other lmxbs ( juett et al . \n the detection of double - lined emissions in the chandra hetg spectrum of 4u1626 - 67 ( schulz et al . \n 2001 ) suggests neon and oxygen overabundances in the accretion disk of this system .    in total \n there is now a group of five lmxbs , for which it is believed that they are ultracompact systems ( orbital periods below 1 hour , i.e.  separation of the order 1 light - s ) in which a neutron star or a black hole accretes matter from a low - mass ( @xmath7m@xmath0 ) degenerate star , the strongly ablated core of a wd . \n mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation . \n the luminosity of these systems is dominated by the accretion disk . in the soft x - ray and uv spectral regions \n we see the hot ( several 100000k ) innermost parts of the disk , which can be x - ray heated by the neutron star . \n the optical light is dominated by cooler ( about 10000k ) , outer parts of the disk . \n so we have the unique possibility to study the former wd interior composition by the determination of element abundances in the accretion disk .    for this purpose \n we have obtained optical medium - resolution spectra of two of these systems ( 4u1626 - 67 and 4u0614 + 091 ) . \n we have used the fors1 spectrograph attached to ut1 of eso s very large telescope to record long - slit spectra . \n we used two grisms ( 600b and 600r ) and obtained spectra in the regions 34505900  and 52507450  with a resolution of about 5 . \n the b magnitude of both targets is near 18.7 ; exposure times for both binaries were 87 and 58 minutes for the red and the blue spectra , respectively . \n the observations were performed in service mode during nov . \n 2003 and mar .  2004 . \n the spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures . \n they are presented in fig.1 , and show emission lines from cii / iii and oii / iii . \n they lack hydrogen and helium lines , apparently confirming the h- and he - deficiency of the donor stars . in the case of 4u0614 + 091 \n we confirm the line identifications of nelemans et al . \n ( 2004 ) , who have obtained vlt / fors2 spectra with slightly higher resolution . \n in addition to these data , we also make use of archival hst / uv data of 4u1626 - 67 , kindly provided in reduced form by homer et al . \n the hst spectrum is shown in fig.2 . \n it shows emission lines from civ , ov , and siiv . \n it does not show heii  1640 .    we have begun the construction of accretion disk models to calculate synthetic spectra and report here on the current state of our work . \n we use our accretion disk code acdc , which is described in detail by nagel et al . \n in essence , it assumes a radial @xmath8-disk structure ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . \n then the disk is divided into concentric annuli . for each annulus \n we solve the radiation transfer equation ( assuming plane - parallel geometry ) together with the nlte rate equations , plus energy- and hydrostatic equations , in order to calculate a detailed vertical structure . \n the integrated disk spectrum is then obtained by co - adding the spectra from the individual annuli . in comparison with the observed uv / optical spectra we present here first model spectra for particular , representative disk regions . \n 4u1626 - 67 has an orbital period of 42  min ( see e.g.  chakrabarty 1998 , and references therein ) . the accretor is a 7.7s x - ray pulsar with a magnetic field strength of @xmath9 g . the donor s mass is smaller than 0.1m@xmath0 . \n the system separation is 300000 km . \n the inner disk edge is at the co - rotation radius , at r=6500 km from the pulsar , and the outer edge at the tidal truncation radius , near r=200000 km . \n the mass transfer rate is roughly @xmath10m@xmath0/yr and the x - ray luminosity is about @xmath11erg / s . \n fig.2 shows the uv spectrum of two disk models extending from r=650015000 km , seen under an inclination angle of 17@xmath12 . \n they are irradiated by the neutron star , assuming the x - ray luminosity mentioned above and a blackbody energy distribution ( t@xmath13k ) . \n the two models differ by their chemical composition . \n one model is he - poor ( dominated by c , o , ne , mg ) , the other is he - rich with abundances typical for he - rich disks in am  cvn systems . \n this comparison shows that neither model exhibits a clearly detectable heii  1640  line . \n hence the lack of this line in the hst spectrum is no proof of he - deficiency . \n the situation is perhaps more favorable in the optical region . in fig.1 \n we have plotted two model spectra from c / o dominated disk regions at r=70000 km , one without h and the other with trace h ( @xmath14 by number ) . \n a strong h@xmath15 emission is seen in the second case , which is not present in the observed spectra . \n although we have not yet performed this test with helium , we hope that we can derive a tight upper limit for the he abundance from the lack of hei lines . \n the parameters of the system 4u0614 + 091 are poorly known . \n no orbital period was measured . from x - ray bursts \n it is assumed that the accretor is a neutron star . from the similarity of the x - ray spectral characteristics with 4u1626 - 67 , juett et al . \n ( 2001 ) suggest that this system is also ultracompact . \n the optical spectrum displays a number of c and o lines , as already identified by nelemans et al . \n the lack of hei and hi lines supports the suggestion of juett et al . \n the two c / o dominated models shown in fig.1 were computed for this system . \n irradiation by the central object is not taken into account . \n they do show emission features , which qualitatively match some observed features . \n it appears that the disk in this region is optically thin . \n angelini , l. , white , n. e. , nagase , f. , et al . \n 1995 , apj , 449 , l41 chakrabarty , d. 1998 , apj , 492 , 342 homer , l. , anderson , s. f. , & wachter , s. 2002 , aj , 142 , 3348 juett , a. m. , psaltis , d. , & chakrabarty , d. 2001 , apj , 560 , l59 nagel , t. , dreizler , s. , rauch , t. , & werner , k. 2004 , a&a , in press nelemans , g. , jonker , p. g. , marsh , t. r. , & van der klis , m. 2004 , mnras , 348 , l7 schulz , n. s. , chakrabarty , d. , marshall , h. l. , et al . \n 2001 , apj , 563 , 941 shakura , n. i. , & sunyaev , r. a. 1973 , a&a , 24 , 337 weidemann , v. 2003 , in white dwarfs , eds . \n d.de  martino , r.silvotti , j .- \n e.solheim , r.kalytis , nato science series ii , 105 , 3 werner , k. 1991 , a&a , 251 , 147 werner , k. 2001 , in low mass wolf -

{"ContextTokens": 4034, "GeneratedTokens": 172, "SynthesizedBody": "a meteoroid enters the earth s atmosphere at hypersonic speed and it collides with air molecules . the high kinetic energy involved in the process \n determine the transformation of a solid body into a plasma , which can scatter radio waves and can emit light ( meteor ) .    during sixties and seventies several works \n investigated the formation and evolution of the meteor , with particular attention to diffusion , in order to study mesospheric winds . \n a complete review of standard meteor science can be found in ceplecha et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n however , there are still some aspects not well understood about the physical properties of a meteor , specifically whether it is an ionized gas or a plasma . during past years \n , these two appellatives were often used as synonymous in meteor physics , even though they indicate two different states of the matter . in some studies , such as those about diffusion , \n specific plasma properties are taken into account ( e.g. ambipolar diffusion ) ; however in other studies , such as about radiowave scattering , the meteor is simply considered a long narrow column of ionized gas . \n this can appear as a futile debate , but it hides important concepts . \n specifically , a plasma has collective properties ( e.g. langmuir frequency ) that an ionized gas has not . \n a first attempt to study the meteor as a plasma was carried out by herlofson ( @xcite ) . \n he investigated the proper oscillations in the meteor and their interaction with radio waves . \n but , at our knowledge , none continued his studies . only in 1999 the question of collective oscillations in meteoric plasma \n was reprised ( foschini @xcite ) . \n perhaps , this gap may be explained by taking into account that , according to purposes of meteor astronomy , it was sufficient to use the approximation of the long narrow cylinder . \n however , the meteoric plasma is something more complex than a reflecting rod and it is necessary to study it . \n there are several types of oscillations and instabilities , which can interact with radio waves . \n the scattering is not the only process : for example , fluctuations from equilibrium may lead to transformation of waves ( longitudinal to transverse and vice versa ) . \n the question is : are such processes present in a meteoric plasma ? \n we think that the study of plasma collective oscillations may give new useful tools to understand the physics of meteors \n . some basic concepts about meteoric plasma were settled in a previous paper ( foschini 1999 ) , thereafter called paper i. according to the theory exposed there , radio echoes can be divided into two classes and two subclasses \n . then we have underdense and overdense echoes , according to whether the langmuir frequency is higher or lower than the radio wave frequency . \n overdense echoes totally reflect electromagnetic waves , but the presence of binary collisions among ions and electrons weaken the collective oscillations of the plasma , allowing the propagation of the waves , even though with strong attenuation . \n therefore , we can divide the overdense echoes into two subclasses : type i , when there is total reflection ; type ii , when binary collisions allow the propagation . \n the division between overdense type i and ii depends on the electron \n ion collision frequency , which in turn depends on electron density and ion cross section . in paper \n i , for the sake of simplicity , we considered potassium ion , that is the chemical element with lower ionization energy . \n in addition , recent studies show that potassium seems to be much more important in the evolution of meteor than previously thought ( von zahn et al . \n @xcite ) . with this assuption \n , the division between overdense echoes occurs at about @xmath0  m@xmath1 . \n it is worth noting that this border can be moved by considering other elements . \n but the calculation of particle distribution and evolution in a meteoric plasma will be object of other papers . \n the overdense type i echoes derives from total reflection of radio waves ( see fig . \n [ fig1 ] for an example ) . \n this allows to calculate the height of the meteor in an easy way , as shown in the paper i. here we want to present a statistical sample of several meteor showers , for which we have calculated the height . \n data will be discussed and compared with available data in literature . \n we shortly recall how to calculate the meteor height , as described in paper i. first , we have to take into account that the plasma has not a definite boundary and then , the incident electromagnetic wave penetrates a little into it before reaching the density necessary to allow total reflection . \n we can consider this something similar to skin effect in metals . \n we can consider a simple geometry , as shown in fig .  6 of paper i , and then use the definition of the attenuation @xmath2 in decibel units :    @xmath3      \\label{e : decib}\\ ] ]    where subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for incident and reflected wave . \n > from the solution of maxwell s equations we obtain that , for overdense meteors type i , the electric field is :    @xmath6    where the wave vector in eq . \n ( [ e : solu ] ) has the form :    @xmath7    we refer to paper i for explanation of symbols , even though they are commonly used in literature about electromagnetic fields . \n we substitute eqs . \n ( [ e : solu ] ) and ( [ e : wv ] ) in eq . \n ( [ e : decib ] ) and , taking into account that the amplitude of a totally reflected wave is equal to the amplitude of the incident wave , we can obtain an attenuation value of about @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the path of the wave into the plasma :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the incidence angle and @xmath12 is the penetration depth . \n then , eq .  ( [ e : decib ] ) becomes :    @xmath13      \\label{e : decib1}\\ ] ]    in the case of overdense type i ( total reflection ) the attenuation is simply a function of the angle of incidence . \n ( [ e : decib1 ] ) refers to an idealized case . \n when we deal with real meteors and radio waves , we have to take into account of several factors , i.e. antenna gains , losses in radio receiver and trasmitter , atmospheric absorption , and the distance of reflecting point from trasmitter and receiver . strictly speaking , eq . \n ( [ e : decib1 ] ) can be considered as the `` meteor cross section '' in the radar equation . \n we can consider common factors in radar theory , as described in kingsley & quegan ( @xcite ) . by means of \n commonly used values for forward scatter radar , we obtain that the attenuation recorded with our receiver is :    @xmath14      \\label{e : meyere}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the received signal amplitude [ v ] . > from the amplitude of the reflected wave , we can calculate the incidence angle with the eq . \n ( [ e : decib1 ] ) . \n therefore , we can calculate the meteor height by considering the geometry of fig . \n we can see that :    @xmath16    taking into account that the earth s mean radius @xmath17 is much larger than @xmath18 , we can calculate @xmath19 :    @xmath20    by substituting eq . \n ( [ e : hei2 ] ) in eq . \n ( [ e : hei1 ] ) , we obtain the height of the reflection for an overdense meteor type i :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 . \n the angle @xmath23 is the half angular distance between receiver and transmitter . \n the distance @xmath24 plays an important role in the derivation of the above formula . indeed , from a geometric point of view , the specular reflection in a forward scatter system occurs when the meteor trail lies along a tangent to an ellipsoidal surface , with the transmitter and the receiver stations in foci ( forsyth & vogan @xcite ) . \n this condition is fulfilled by different values of distances of the reflecting point from the source and from the receiver . \n if we do not know the path source  meteor  receiver , this introduces an uncertainty of about 40  km in the height of the reflecting point ( for our system ) . \n one way to overcome this problem is to set up a third station , but if it is not possible , as in our case , we can reduce uncertainties by making heuristic considerations . \n indeed , as explained by forsyth & vogan ( @xcite ) , the forward scatter system is most sensitive to meteor trails which are nearly horizontal and directed along the transmission line . \n a meteor perpendicular to the source  receiver line gives an echo that is about five times lower than the case of parallel direction ( forsyth & vogan @xcite ) . \n therefore , the choice of the reflecting point located closely to the middle of the transmission path appears to be reasonable and , as we shall see , is justified by facts . \n the general principle of meteor observation by forward scattering of radio waves is the following : a vhf radio receiver ( 30100  mhz ) is located at a large distance ( about 6002000  km ) from a transmitter at the same frequency . \n direct radio communication is not possible , owing to the earth s curvature , but the meteor allows the commuication over the horizon , by reflecting the transmitted signal .    in this study , observations were carried out mainly by m.  de meyere . \n his radio receiver is located in deurle , belgium ( longitude @xmath25  e , latitude @xmath26  n ) , while the trasmitter is located in sofia ( bulgary ) . \n it transmits radio signals at 66.50  mhz all over the day with 10  kw power . in this case , values of @xmath18 and @xmath23 are , respectively , @xmath27  km and @xmath28 . \n the receiving station consists of a crossed yagi antenna ( 4 elements ) , that is linked to a computer with a digital acquisition interface ( 150 samples per second , 8 bit resolution ) . \n data are recorded and stored into a file .    .observed meteor showers . \n in the last column , the percentage indicates the number of overdense meteors type i compared with the total number of recorded meteors . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     observations of several meteor shower were carried out during several years ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , with a total number of meteors recorded equal to 13401 . \n the overdense i meteors are 131 ( about 1% of the total ) and the height distribution for analysed showers are shown in figs . \n [ fig3][fig6 ] ( each bin is 1  km wide ) . \n values in table  [ tab1 ] refer to all echoes recorded during shower days . in order to evaluate also the sporadic background \n , we have analysed some days in february , without any shower . \n we have found a mean value for sporadic overdense type i meteors of about 0.2 meteor per hour , so that the contribution of background can be considered negligible . \n measured heights are in the range between 70 and 110  km , in good agreement with typical meteor heights ( 60110 km ) , even though the large part of meteors are in the range 95110 km . \n the peaks of distributions are not centered , but are located toward right . \n however , this seems to be an effect dues to a low number of data . \n indeed , the best fit for the observations , calculated with the @xmath29 test , is a gaussian distribution ( therefore @xmath30 is calculated with standard methods for this type of distribution ) . in table \n [ tab2 ] values of mean speed ( allen @xcite ) and height of overdense i meteor are shown . \n data obtained here show that the mean height is independent from the entry speed of the meteoroids ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . on the other hand \n , it is known that the height depends on entry speed of meteoroids : for example , greenhow & lovell ( @xcite ) wrote that the highest speed sporadic meteors , moving at 6070  km / s , ionize at a mean height of 100  km , whereas those with minimum speed ( 11.2  km / s ) reach a mean height of 85  km . \n the theory of radio meteor height was elaborated by kaiser ( @xcite , b ) and recently belkovich et al . \n ( @xcite ) proposed some changes , in order to take into account the fragmentation . \n kaiser found that the width of the height distribution depends on the atmospheric scale height and the mass distribution of incoming meteoroids . \n the mean height depends strongly on meteor speed , through two coefficients named @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and depends also on the probability of ionization . \n kaiser s theory refers to the point of maximum ionization , but it is known that in experimental radio observations the height of reflecting point does not necessarily lie in the point of maximum ionization ( greenhow & lovell @xcite ) .    if we observe a meteor shower with a given mean speed and mass distribution , the height distribution is related to the length of ionization curve . \n the point of maximum ionization corresponds to the most probable height . \n it is worth noting that kaiser s theory refers to underdense meteors . only mckinley ( @xcite ) referred to overdense meteors and found no clear dependence on speed . \n moreover , he found a two peaks distribution : the main peak is located at about 95  km , and the second one at 106  km . \n we can try to explain the differences between our results and data available in literature . \n the first reason is that we try to analyse overdense meteors , while the large part of published data refer to underdense meteors . \n it is very interesting to note that for bright meteors , which are surely overdense , the radio height of maximum echo duration is well above the mean height of maximum light , obtained from photographic data ( millman & mckinley @xcite ) . on the other hand , \n the situation is reversed for faint meteors . \n the reason for this difference is that overdense type i meteors reflect totally the incoming electromagnetic wave . \n total reflection is allowed only when plasma frequency is higher than the radio frequency and the collision frequency in the plasma is negligible ( see paper i ) . \n these conditions are achieved indipendently from speed of incoming of meteoroid , but it depends on the mass and chemical composition of the body . \n once an overdense type i meteor is created , the signal amplitude of the reflected wave remains constant until the collision frequency in the plasma or recombination and attachment processes subtract energy to the plasma frequency . \n we can say that collective properties of the plasma , which generate the long plateau of overdense type i meteor , `` hide '' in some way some properties of the incoming meteoroid . \n concerning the two peaks found by mckinley ( @xcite ) , we note that our distributions show only the secondary peak . \n this can be explained by taking into account that while mckinley made no distinction between overdense meteors , we have considered only overdense type i meteors . \n we have carried out an analysis of several overdense radio echoes , recorded during last years by a radio observer located in belgium . \n we have analysed a particular class of overdense meteors ( type i ) and measured height distributions are in good agreement with previous results obtained by mckinley ( @xcite ) , even though only for the secondary peak . \n we suppose that the first peak in mckinley s work should be due to overdense type ii meteors , while the secondary peak , recorded also by our system , appeared to be due to overdense type i meteors . \n we think that collective properties of the meteoric plasma ( langmuir oscillations ) hide some characteristics of the originary cosmic body , specifically there is no clear dependence on speed . \n further study , mainly theoretical and able to take into account collective properties of plasma , are required to assess the particle dynamics in the meteor . \n it should be noted that our studies were carried out with an amateur forward scatter system and we have no full control on it . \n moreover , heuristic considerations were introduced in order to minimize uncertainties , but results showed that they were justified by facts . \n the agreement with previous works , with other techniques , supports our conclusions . \n the future availability of a full forward scatter system would be of great help in more detailed studies . \n lf wishes to thank p.  farinella for useful discussions . authors are also grateful to the referee , p.  pecina , for useful

vii.1 and jendl-4.0 were processed in a similar way and criticality calculations performed . \n the results obtained are compared with mean of the @xmath0 distribution of the random nuclear data files . \n the fast tmc methology presented in  @xcite is used in this work . \n however , instead of using it to obtain short computation times it is used to obtain a very accurate and precise estimate of the uncertainty in reactor parameters due to nuclear data ( @xmath2 ) . in tmc , ( @xmath2 ) \n is obtained by running n different nd files . \n the result is a spread in the data ( @xmath3 ) that is both due to statistics ( @xmath4 ) and due to nuclear data ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath5 since both the parameter , e.g , @xmath0 , and its statistical uncertainty , @xmath6 , is determined by most transport codes , we obtain a distribution of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 when we run with our n random files . \n the spread in the distribution of @xmath0 is then @xmath3 and the @xmath7 is equal to @xmath4 . \n [ yi ] holds assuming that there is no correlation between statistics and nuclear data ; the correlation between @xmath0 and the corresponding statistical error was investigated and no correlation was observed . \n the methodology produces an accurate estimate of @xmath2 if @xmath7 is accurately determined by the transport code . to test this we executed the serpent input file 740 times with constant nuclear data , but with different random seeds . \n if @xmath3 = @xmath7 then the transport code determines @xmath6 correctly ; in our case with serpent and electra and this was found to be true . \n criticality benchmarks are used mostly for validation of calculational techniques in reactor calculations and for establishing minimum subcritical margins for operations with fissile material  @xcite . in the nuclear data evaluation process , benchmarking evaluated data against differential and integral data is very important . \n this is mostly done by selecting large sets of criticality , dosimetry , fusion , activation benchmarks among others . \n the selection varies from one application group to another as a results of different expertise , purpose of the evaluation and accessibility to benchmarks  @xcite . to solve this problem , we proposed the tmc methodology for the selection of benchmarks . \n first , random files obtained from the tendl project are processed into usable format for reactor codes . \n criticality simulations are performed for 1 ) the @xmath8 benchmark under consideration and for 2 ) the specific reactor system using same processed random files . \n a correlation test is then performed by plotting the @xmath0 obtained for the reactor system against that of the benchmark . \n if a strong correlation exists between the two systems , this can be interpreted as a good representation of your system . \n this methodology has been tested only on the pu-239 jezebel benchmark and we plan to investigate this in more detail taking into consideration fusion and shielding benchmarks . \n the proposed method also opens up possibilities for assigning weights to each benchmark based on the goodness of fit or the correlation coefficient . in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , a correlation between the @xmath0 computed for electra and that of the pu-239 jezebel benchmark is presented .     determined for electra and the pu-239 jezebel benchmark for pu-239 random files . ]      an accept / reject criterion is investigated to study how limiting @xmath1 values for accepting random files could reduce nuclear data uncertainties in safety parameters . \n simulations were performed for pu-239 random files  @xcite and with pu-239 jezebel criticality benchmark and with the electra serpent monte carlo code input file . \n limiting chi squares were set and corresponding nuclear data uncertainty calculated.in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , we present a plot of limiting chi square verses pu-239 random files index . \n a distribution in @xmath0 was obtained for 740 pu-239 random endf files and the mean compared with results from other nuclear data libraries . the jeff-3.1 ( the reference library ) \n temperature dependent cross - section libraries were maintained for all other isotopes except for pu-239 files which was changed with files from tendl , jendl-3.1.2 , jendl-4.0 and end / b - vii.1 . \n it was observed that the mean value of of the random files @xmath9 compared favorably with the other nuclear data libraries : endf / b - vii.1 was @xmath10 , jeff-3.1.1 was @xmath11 , jendl-4.0 was @xmath12 . \n this can be attributed to the contribution of the well known fission cross section of pu-239 which has a relatively high impact on the effective multiplication factor . \n the uncertainty due to nuclear data was determined and found to be @xmath13 pcm . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , we present a plot of limiting @xmath1 values against the random file index . \n nuclear data uncertainties were determined for each limit and the results is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig3 ] .        the correlation between @xmath0 computed for electra and for the pu-239 jezebel benchmark \n is shown in fig . \n it can be seen from the plot that there exists a strong correlation between the two systems implying that , the pu-239 jezebel benchmark is a good representation of electra . \n the pearson correlation coefficient which is a measure of the strength of the relationship between the two systems was computed and found to be r=0.84 , further underscoring the strong correlation observed . for the computation of @xmath1 for a large set of benchmarks \n , we propose that a weighted factor ( @xmath14 ) , which should be equal to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ( @xmath15 ) be set for the @xmath8 benchmark . \n we plan to test this methodology on a large set of benchmarks and for different nuclides . \n the approach has however been applied am-241 in burnup evaluation of electra  @xcite . \n it was observed that , a 25% reduction in nuclear data uncertainty was achieved after a setting a more rigid acceptance criteria . in fig . \n [ fig3 ] , we present the nuclear data uncertainty against limiting @xmath1 . it can be observed from the figure that by setting a minimum limiting @xmath1 of 5.31e-06 , we were able to reduce the uncertainty in nuclear data from 748 to 443 pcm . \n this therefore implies that , by implementing an accept / reject criterion in the total monte carlo method for accepting random files , nuclear data uncertainty can be reduced significantly . \n a study has been carried out by using benchmarks within the total monte carlo methodology on nuclear data uncertainty propagation for the european lead cooled training reactor ( electra ) . \n it was observed that , nuclear data uncertainties could be reduced considerably in criticality calculations after introducing an accept / reject criterion based on integral benchmarks into the tmc calculation chain . \n a method for the selection of benchmarks with tmc was also proposed which opens up possibilities for assigning weights to benchmarks . \n 9 iaea , final report of a coordinated research project ripl-2 , august 2006 . \n a. koning and d. rochman , nuclear data sheets * 113 * , 2841 ( 2012 ) . \n d. rochman , a. koning nuclear science and engineering , * 168 * , 1 ( 2011 ) . \n j. wallenius , e. suvdantsetseg and a. fokau , nuclear technology * 177 * , 303 -

{"ContextTokens": 2609, "GeneratedTokens": 300, "SynthesizedBody": "chemical evolution of the universe has been one of the major issues in the modern astronomy . \n heavy elements , or metals , have been generated and accumulated in the universe since its birth mainly through supernovae . an important clue to understand the chemical evolution of the universe \n will no doubt be brought about by systematic study of a well - defined sample of supernova remnants . in x - ray observations , we are able to extract information of plasma temperature , metal abundance , explosion energy , ionization age , and so on from optically thin thermal plasma emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) \n . these pieces of information will lead to understand galactic chemical evolution and star formation history . \n a systematic study of snrs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) suits well for this purpose , because of its well - known distance ( 50kpc ; @xcite ) and small interstellar absorption to lmc . \n the fact that lmc is face - on to us is another advantage . because of these characteristics \n , systematic x - ray studies of the thermal snrs in lmc have been carried out with some major x - ray observatories ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n these observations are , however , limited in terms of energy resolution in the low energy band below @xmath01  kev , which is important to study the nature of the snr plasma in detail , because the temperature of the plasma in most snrs is less than @xmath02  kev . \n in particular , hydrogenic and he - like oxygen lines that appear in 0.50.7  kev dominate a spectrum of the plasma with a temperature of @xmath61  kev , and hence , high resolution spectroscopy in this energy band is of great importance in evaluating the parameters of the low temperature plasma , such as the temperature , the density , the ionization parameter and the abundances of the metal . \n we therefore have decided to perform a systematic study of the snrs in lmc with the suzaku xis ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which has the best energy resolution in the oxygen 0.50.7  kev energy band among the ccds currently in orbit . in this paper \n , we study the snr n23 , as a beginning of our systematic study project .    n23 is identified as a snr with radio observations at 5 and 14.7  ghz for the first time ( @xcite ) . \n its x - ray emission extends @xmath7 in the sky ( @xmath8pc at a distance of 50  kpc ) , showing a semi - circular morphology with only the south - eastern hemisphere being bright @xcite . \n based on the observation , @xcite classified n23 as a young snr with an age of @xmath9 from the spectrum of the entire remnant . \n @xcite carried out spatially resolved spectroscopy of n23 with , and estimated the age of north - western rim to be @xmath04600  yr . \n these observations result in consistent estimation of the temperature and the ionization parameter ( @xmath10 ) in the bright south - eastern shell , which is @xmath00.50.7  kev and @xmath11@xmath12 , respectively . \n they are , however , not be able to resolve hydrogenic and he - like lines from oxygen clearly because of limited energy resolution below @xmath01  kev . \n in addition , @xcite have revealed that there is a point source around the center of n23 . from its 0.510  kev flux ( @xmath13 ) and \n power - law spectrum with a photon index of 2.2 , the source is probably a rotation - powered pulsar and/or a pulsar wind nebula . \n if so , the progenitor of n23 is a core - collapsed massive star ( @xcite ) . \n this paper is organized as follows . after describing how the observation and data reduction are carried out in   [ sec : obs ] , we report the results of spectral analysis of n23 in   [ sec : spec_ana ] . \n owing to high spectral resolution of the xis in the oxygen band , we have clearly resolved hydrogenic and he - like k@xmath14 emission lines from oxygen for the first time , which leads to identification of a new low temperature component . \n based on these results , we discuss the plasma parameters and evolutionary phase of n23 in   [ sec : dis ] . finally , the summary is given in \n [ sec : sum ] . \n n23 was observed with @xcite on 2005 august 1617 . \n the observation log is summarized in table  [ tab : suzakuobslog ] .    .observation log . [ cols= \" < \n , < , < \" , ]     using eq . \n ( [ eq : sedovage ] ) with @xmath15  pc , @xmath16 estimated from the low and high temperature components becomes @xmath08000 and @xmath05000  yr , respectively , which are consistent with the lower limit of @xmath17 . \n this is a direct consequence of eq . \n ( [ eq : sedovage ] ) , implying @xmath16 being proportional to @xmath18 . \n the high temperature component is younger than the low temperature component . in the sedov scheme , this can be interpreted as the high temperature component being heated recently . on the other hands , @xmath19 of the low and high temperature components are 9300@xmath20 and 12000@xmath20 , respectively , using eq . \n ( [ eq : coolage ] ) with @xmath21 given in table  [ tab : n23phi ] (  [ sec : n23_phys ] ) . since @xmath22 for both components , n23 is likely to be at a late stage of the sedov phase , and if so , its age is @xmath08000  yrs old from the newly discovered low temperature component . \n note , however , that this discussion depends on the estimation of the volume filling factor @xmath23 . \n accounting for the highly anisotropic image ( fig . \n [ fig : n23image ] ) , we have normalized @xmath23 by 0.1 . \n however , if the shock wave of n23 propagates in a higher density ism , like the edge of the open cluster hs  114 @xcite , the total volume should be smaller for the given emission measure , resulting in a smaller @xmath23 . \n if , for instance , @xmath24 , @xmath25 of the low and high temperature components are @xmath05000 and @xmath07000  yr , respectively . since @xmath26 , the low temperature component should be regarded as in the radiative phase . \n in addition , we would also like to remark that , in   [ sec : n23_phys ] , we have calculated the plasma volume , assuming that the shell thickness is 1/12 of the shell radius , which is expected for a spherical strong shock . \n this holds only if n23 is still in the sedov ( adiabatic ) phase . \n if n23 has been in the radiative phase , then the shell thickness should be smaller due to radiative cooling , and hence , the plasma density would be larger than the current estimation . as a result , the cooling time scale estimated from eq . \n ( [ eq : coolage ] ) should be smaller , and @xmath27 . \n consequently , we can not deny possibility that n23 has been in the radiative phase .    in summary \n , the age of n23 is estimated to be @xmath08000 yr from the newly discovered low temperature component as long as it still stays in sedov phase . \n this condition is , however , uncertain , because the discussion depends on the volume filling factor of the plasma . \n if , for instance , the shock propagate in the higher density ism , n23 may have already entered into the radiative cooling phase . in this case , the remnant age estimated from the cooling timescale is smaller . \n finally , we can make an independent age estimation from the central source detected by @xcite . \n its luminosity is @xmath28  erg in the 0.510.0  kev @xcite . \n if the central source is a pulsar ( although the pulsation has not been detected ) , the characteristic age is @xmath29@xmath30  years , which is consistent with our age estimation update . \n the main component of x - ray emission originates from the swept - up ism in n23 . \n hence the elemental abundances of n23 reflect those of its environment . \n figure  [ fig : ab ] shows the abundances obtained from the spectral analysis ( table  [ tab : n23bestfitpar ] ) . \n ( 80mm,80 mm ) ./figure \n / figure4.eps    the abundances of n , o , ne and fe agree roughly with the lmc average @xcite . \n the si and mg abundances are smaller than those obtained ( @xcite ) , although their errors are relatively large . \n the mg and si abundances obtained by suzaku are consistent with those from asca ( @xcite ) , respectively , which seem slightly less than the lmc average . \n we observed n23 in the large magellanic cloud with suzaku , and discovered the new soft emission component with a temperature of @xmath31  kev , in addition to the @xmath320.7  kev component so far known . \n this alters the estimate of the ionization parameter ( @xmath33 ) significantly from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . with the aid of imaging capability , we are able to calculate the density of the plasma , and have confirmed that the supernova explosion of n23 occurred in a high density region with an ism density of @xmath048  @xmath3 . \n the relatively high ambient density may be related to the open cluster hs 114 @xcite near the remnant @xcite . \n the parameters of the plasma from our analysis indicate that n23 is either at a late stage of the sedov phase or in the radiative cooling phase . assuming it is still in the sedov phase , we have estimated the age of the remnant to be @xmath08000  yr from the newly discovered soft component , which is twice as old as the estimation by @xcite . \n given the uncertainty of the volume filling factor , however , we can not deny the possibility that n23 has already entered into the radiative phase . \n the abundances of n23 is roughly consistent with the lmc average ( @xcite ) . \n the si and mg abundances obtained by spectral fitting are smaller than those obtained by @xcite , although their errors on si and mg abundances are relatively large . \n the mg and si abundances obtained by are consistent with those from ( @xcite ) . \n we thank dr . \n y. maeda for his useful discussion and comments . \n we would like to express our gratitude to all members of the suzaku team for their contributions to the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in -

{"ContextTokens": 3781, "GeneratedTokens": 144, "SynthesizedBody": "magnetic fields play a double role in the cosmos : first , planetary , stellar , and galactic fields are produced by the homogeneous dynamo effect in moving electrically conducting fluids . \n second , magnetic fields can accelerate tremendously the formation of stars and black holes by enabling outward directed transport of angular momentum in accretion disks by virtue of the so - called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . \n this instability was discovered as early as 1959 , when velikhov showed that a taylor - couette flow in its hydrodynamically stable regime ( i.e. with outward increasing angular momentum ) can be destabilized by an applied axial magnetic field @xcite . \n it was only in 1991 , however , that the importance of mri for accretion disks in the vicinity of young stars and black holes was realized in a seminal paper by balbus and hawley @xcite . \n the last decades have seen tremendous theoretical and computational progress in understanding the dynamo effect and the mri . \n the hydromagnetic dynamo effect has even been verified experimentally in large - scale liquid sodium facilities in riga , karlsruhe , and cadarache , and is presently studied in laboratories around the world @xcite . \n in contrast , attempts to study the mri in the laboratory have been less successful so far . \n recently , an mri - like instability has been observed on the background of a turbulent spherical couette flow @xcite , but the genuine idea that mri would destabilize a hydrodynamically stable flow was not realized in this experiment . \n one of the basic problems for the experimental investigation of the  standard mri \n , with only an axial magnetic field being externally applied , is the need for flows with large magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath0 . \n the crucial point is that the azimuthal field , which is essential for the mri mechanism to work , must be produced from the applied axial field by induction effects proportional to @xmath0 . \n the natural question , why not substitute the induction process by externally applying the azimuthal field as well , was addressed by hollerbach and rdiger @xcite . exemplified in a taylor - couette configuration \n , it was shown that the scaling properties for this  helical mri  , as we call it now , are completely different from those of the  standard mri  . while the latter is governed by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 and the lundquist number @xmath1 , \n the former depends only on the hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath2 and on the hartmann number @xmath3 . for liquid metals , with their small magnetic prandtl number @xmath4 \n , this makes a dramatic difference for the feasibility of mri experiments , since @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n =    we have to point out , though , that there is no real breach between  standard mri \" and  helical mri \" . \n this can be clearly seen in fig . 1 of @xcite , where the critical @xmath0 is plotted against the rotation ratio @xmath7 of outer to inner cylinder of a taylor - couette set - up . the extremely steep increase of this curve at the rayleigh line , which occurs for a purely axial magnetic field , is just smeared out when an azimuthal field is added . \n in this paper , we summarize the main results of a first experimental verification of this idea obtained in the framework of the promise experiment ( potsdam rossendorf magnetic instability experiment ) which were already published in @xcite , and we report some new results of an improved version of this experiment . \n the basic part of promise is a cylindrical containment vessel v made of copper ( see fig . \n the inner wall of the vessel v is 10 mm thick , and extends in radius from 22 to 32 mm ; the outer wall is 15 mm thick , extending from 80 to 95 mm . \n this vessel is filled with the eutectic alloy ga@xmath8in@xmath9sn@xmath10 which is liquid at room temperatures . \n the vessel v , which is completely made of copper in the first version of the experiment ( henceforth called promise 1 ) , is fixed , via an aluminum spacer d , on a precision turntable t ; the outer copper cylinder of the vessel represents the outer cylinder of the taylor - couette cell . the inner copper cylinder \n i of the taylor - couette flow is fixed to an upper turntable , and is immersed into the liquid metal from above . \n it has a thickness of 4 mm , extending in radius from 36 to 40 mm , thus leaving a gap of 4 mm between this immersed cylinder i and the inner wall of the containment vessel v. the actual taylor - couette cell extends in radial direction over a cylindrical gap of width @xmath11 mm , and in axial direction over the liquid metal height @xmath12 mm , resulting in an aspect ratio of 10 . \n = hz ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 a ( i.e. ha=7.9 ) . \n ( b ) promise 1 with @xmath17 a ( i.e. @xmath18 ) . \n ( c ) promise 2 with @xmath19 a ( i.e. @xmath20).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]    in the promise 1 configuration , the upper endplate is a non - rotating plexiglass lid p fixed to the frame f. the bottom , however , is simply part of the copper vessel v , and rotates with the outer cylinder . with respect to both their rotation rates and electrical conductivities , \n there is thus a clear asymmetry in the end caps . \n figure 2a shows the changes made for promise 2 to improve this situation : first , both end caps are made of insulating material in order to avoid short - circuiting of currents along the copper end cap at the bottom ( those currents had been shown to be dangerous by possibly changing the rotation profile via azimuthal forces @xcite ) . \n second , both the upper and the lower end caps are split into two rings , the inner rotating with the inner cylinder and the outer rotating with the outer cylinder . in @xcite \n it had been shown that this splitting yields a minimization of the ekman pumping if the position of the splitting is at 0.4 of the gap width @xmath21 . \n third , the co - rotation of the two rings with one of the cylinders made it necessary to change the signal path of the ultrasonic transducers . \n these two transducers provide full profiles of the axial velocity along the beam - lines parallel to the axis of rotation . \n while in promise 1 they are inserted in the upper plexiglass end cap that is fixed to the laboratory frame , in promise 2 they must be connected via a sliding contact to the signal processing computer ( dop 2000 ) . \n the configuration of magnetic fields is the same for promise 1 and promise 2 . \n an axial magnetic field in the order of 10 mt is produced by a double - layer coil with 76 windings ( c in fig . \n the omission of windings at two symmetric positions close to mid - height , as seen in fig . \n 1a , was motivated by a coil optimization to maximize the homogeneity of the axial field throughout the fluid volume . \n the coil is fed by currents up to 200 a , beyond which a significant heating of the coil sets in . the azimuthal field , also in the order of 10 mt , is generated by a current through a water - cooled copper rod r of radius 15 mm . the special power supply ( ps in fig . \n 1c ) for this axial current is capable of delivering up to 8000 a. \n we have carried out a large number of experimental runs in order to cover a wide range of parameter dependencies . typically , the duration of an experimental run was 1900 sec , after a waiting time of one hour and more . \n many details for the promise 1 set -

dependent ) time average in order to filter out the two ekman vortices which appear already without any magnetic field . \n these ekman vortices , which in the promise 1 version are characterized by inward radial flows close to the upper and lower end - plates and a jet - like radial outflow in the centre of the cylinder @xcite , are significantly suppressed in the promise 2 version due to the use of split end caps . in promise 1 , \n the wave dies away at the position of the radial jet ( which is not always at mid - height ) . \n in contrast to this , in promise 2 the wave propagates throughout the total height of the cell . \n this much improved behaviour of the mri in promise 2 can be visualized nicely when crossing the rayleigh line . \n it is known @xcite that the travelling wave appears already with a stationary outer cylinder , i.e. at @xmath36 , although with a very low frequency . with increasing @xmath37 , the wave frequency increases and typically reaches a value of @xmath38 at the rayleigh value @xmath39 . \n figure 3 shows now in detail what happens with the travelling mri wave when @xmath37 crosses the rayleigh line . \n the parameters for this run were @xmath22 hz ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , @xmath23 a ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , @xmath24 a. it is clearly visible that the mri wave is still present at @xmath42 , becomes significantly weaker at @xmath43 , and has completely died at @xmath44 . \n this transition is further analyzed in fig . \n 4 which shows the rms of the axial velocity perturbation in dependence on @xmath37 , now both for @xmath24 a and @xmath19 a ( which corresponds to @xmath25 and 4.5 , respectively ) .    the measured values ( full lines ) \n are compared with the numerical results of a 2d solver ( dashed lines ) , but also with the results of a 1d solver for the onset of the absolute and the convective instability @xcite ( courtesy of jnis priede ) . \n it is most remarkable that the 1d results for the onset of the absolute instability correspond nearly perfectly with the results of the 2d solver , while the thresholds for the convective instability are situated at much higher values of @xmath37 . \n compared to the 2d numerical curves , the experimental curves are shifted only slightly towards higher @xmath37 . as expected , we see also that for increasing @xmath45 the threshold of the instability shifts to higher values of @xmath37 . \n we have obtained experimental evidence for the existence of the mri in current - free helical magnetic fields . \n the symmetrization of the axial boundary conditions and the use of split end caps in promise 2 has led to a strong reduction of the ekman pumping and hence to an avoidance of artefacts in the radial jet flow region . \n the mri wave extends clearly beyond the rayleigh line , and its behaviour is in good correspondence with both 2d simulations and 1d simulations for the absolute instability , but in stark contrast with 1d simulations for the convective instability . \n this indicates that the observed mri wave is indeed a global instability and not only a noise triggered convective instability as claimed recently @xcite . \n further dependencies of the mri on parameters like @xmath2 , @xmath45 , and @xmath3 , as well as their comparison with numerical predictions will be published elsewhere . \n .  9 ( 1959 ) , pp .  995998 . . \n , vol .  376 ( 1991 ) , \n 214222 . . \n , vol .  74 ( 2002 ) , \n .  973990 . . \n , 88 ( 2008 ) , 930954 . . \n , vol .  93 ( 2004 ) , art . \n , vol .  95 ( 2005 ) , art . \n 97 ( 2006 ) , art . \n 184502 . . . , vol \n .  649 ( 2006 ) , pp . \n l145-l147 . . . \n , vol .  9 ( 2007 ) , art . no . 295 . . \n , vol .  329 ( 2008 ) , \n pp .  652 -

like energies ( @xmath2 erg ) . \n it is thus probable that a major subclass of grbs is a consequence of the collapse of a massive star .    in this study \n , we perform 2.5-dimensional general relativistic mhd simulations of the gravitational collapse of a rotating star with magnetic field as a model for a collapsar . \n the collapsar is in some sense an anisotropic supernova , and it is considered that relativistic jets from collapsars are launched by mhd processes in accreting matter and/or by neutrino annihilation @xcite . \n in order to study the formation of relativistic jets from a collapsar we use a 2.5-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) code @xcite .we assume that the gravitational potential is constant in time . \n we neglect nuclear burnings and neutrinos in this simulation . \n we consider the following situation as the initial condition for the simulations : a few @xmath3 black hole is produced at the center of the stellar remnant with a weak shock standing at a radius of a few hundred km and the post - shock gas falling onto the central black hole . \n we consider a non - rotating black hole as the central black hole . \n we employ 1-dimensional supernova simulation data of bruenn ( 1992 ) @xcite to obtain the initial density , pressure and radial velocity distribution . \n we add the effect of stellar rotation and intrinsic magnetic field . \n the initial rotational velocity distribution is assumed to be a function of the distance from the rotation axis only . \n the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and parallel to the rotational axis . \n see mizuno et al . \n ( 2003 ) @xcite for details . \n the stellar matter falls onto the central black hole at first . \n this collapse is anisotropic due to the effects of rotation and magnetic field . \n the accreting matter falls more slowly on the equatorial plane than on the rotational axis . \n the matter piles up on the equatorial plane , and a disk - like structure is formed near the central black hole . since the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma , it is dragged by the accreting matter and amplified . \n the amplified magnetic field expands outwards as alfvn waves and launches an outgoing shock wave . \n the jet - like outflow is generated behind the shock wave . \n the shock wave has the high magnetic pressure gradient force and high centrifugal force . \n these forces push back the accreting matter and construct the jet - like outflow . \n the jet - like outflow formed in the simulation is thus magnetically driven . \n the jet has a mildly relativistic velocity , @xmath4 c ( the poloidal velocity is @xmath5 c ) . \n it exceeds the escape velocity . \n thus , the jet is likely to get out of the stellar remnant . \n the magnetic field plays an important role in the collimation . \n not only the pinching force of the toroidal magnetic field but also the geometry of the poloidal magnetic field ( i.e. poloidal magnetic pressure ) plays a crucial role .      as the initial magnetic field strength increases , the jet velocity increases and the magnetic twist decreases . \n however , for stronger magnetic field the jet velocity decreases with increasing initial magnetic field strength and the magnetic twist still continues decreasing . as the initial rotational velocity becomes faster , the jet velocity becomes faster and the magnetic twist becomes stronger up to a certain value . \n for faster initial rotational velocity , the vertical component of the jet velocity and the magnetic twist are almost constant .    in order to produce a strong jet \n , the magnetic field has to be twisted significantly so that it can store enough magnetic energy . \n if the initial magnetic field is strong , the magnetic field can not be twisted significantly because alfvn waves propagate as soon as the magnetic field is twisted a little bit . as a result , the jet velocity does not rise up and the magnetic twist remains weak . \n therefore , weaker initial magnetic fields are favorable for a stronger jet \n . the dependence on the initial rotational velocity can be understood by a same reason as the dependence on the initial magnetic field strength . \n if the initial rotation is sufficiently fast , the magnetic field is twisted significantly and stores enough energy to produce a fast jet . however , the stored magnetic energy has a limit . \n it is determined by the competition between the propagation time of alfvn waves and the rotation time of the disk ( or the twisting time ) . \n we have studied the generation of a jet from gravitational collapse of a rotating star with magnetic field by using the 2.5d general relativistic mhd simulation code . \n the maximum velocity of the jet is mildly relativistic ( @xmath0 0.3c ) . \n this result is consistent with newtonian case @xcite . \n the jet is too slow for the jet of grbs . \n we have to consider other acceleration mechanism . \n the break out of the jet through the stellar surface is the most applicable acceleration mechanism . \n when the jet goes through the stellar surface , the strong density gradient may accelerate the jet . \n in fact , some authors @xcite have showed numerically that a significant acceleration of the jet occur and the terminal lorentz factor becomes as high as @xmath6 . \n we think it is important to simulate the propagation of the jet outside the stellar surface by a grmhd code properly evaluating the importance of magnetic fields for the dynamics and further propagation of the jet . \n this work was partially supported by a grant -

process nucleosynthesis@xcite ) . \n the @xmath69 likelihood region of lsnd , combined with the @xmath69 confidence limits from e776 and the bugey reactor experiment@xcite allow @xmath70 and @xmath71 , giving @xmath72 and @xmath73 . \n the upper end of the range of @xmath8 is reasonably close to our expectation of @xmath74 . \n if is found to be in the lower end of this range , then the mixing of the charged leptons must be supressed from its expected hierarchical value for almost any conceivable neutrino mass scenario .    for the atmospheric deficit , \n the relevant probability is @xmath75 this has the same effect as a two flavor @xmath76 oscillation with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . \n maximal mixing is allowed by the combined frejus , nusex , imb , kamioka sub -

type quark would have to have a similar mass to the other three particles , in conflict with the existing hierarchy . \n the probabilities for @xmath92 appearance experiments are @xmath93 each expression contains terms where @xmath94 will be large for any conceivable experiment . \n for those terms , @xmath95 will average to @xmath96 over the finite @xmath54 and @xmath56 resolution of an experiment . \n thus we may estimate the probabilities as @xmath97 and @xmath98 . \n currently the best limits for large @xmath65 are @xmath99 and @xmath100 from the e531 experiment at fermilab@xcite . \n @xmath101 gets its scale from @xmath102 . thus , while the parametrization ( [ wolf ] ) is viable , maximal hierarchical mixing with @xmath103 is ruled out for any scenario with @xmath104 . \n maximal hierarchical mixing is not constrained in the @xmath25-@xmath105 channel . \n upcoming experiments may be able to distinguish this scenario from the other possibilities in the next few years . \n the prediction that the atmospheric deficit is caused by @xmath106 oscillations with maximal mixing is unique to this scenario . \n the mixing angle could be pinned down with further atmospheric neutrino data . \n chooz@xcite and san onofre@xcite can eliminate the possibility that the atmospheric deficit is @xmath107-@xmath25 by directly measuring @xmath2 disappearance probabilities . and \n icarus@xcite and minos@xcite might be sufficient to rule out @xmath107-@xmath105 . \n this would leave @xmath107-@xmath108 as the only alternative . \n an mev @xmath92 is then almost inevitable to save bbn since there would be at least four active neutrino flavors at the time of nucleosynthesis . \n observations of the solar neutrino spectrum can firmly establish the mass splitting and mixing angle for the neutrinos responsible , and karmen@xcite can confirm the lsnd result , which would eliminate @xmath107-@xmath25 as a possibility for the solar deficit since the mass splitting would be too large . \n an observation of @xmath107-@xmath105 oscillations at chorus@xcite , nomad@xcite , or cosmos@xcite would then firmly establish @xmath107-@xmath108 for the solar channel . while chorus and nomad themselves have a chance of observing @xmath107-@xmath105 \n , cosmos is very likely to observe this channel , but very unlikely to see @xmath25-@xmath105 . \n it is clear that the next few years will be very exciting for neutrino physics . \n we have shown how neutrino masses appropriate for the various oscillation data can be fit into a hierarchical mass scenario analogous to the hierarchies in the quark and charged lepton sectors . \n small mass splittings and small mixing angles result from the interplay of dirac and majorana mass terms . \n the scenario satisfies all experimental and astrophysical constraints . \n it is unique among proposed solutions in that the atmospheric oscillations are @xmath107-@xmath108 with maximal mixing , a prediction which could be tested experimentally in upcoming experiments . \n t.  yanagida , in _ proceedings of the workshop on unified theory and baryon number of the universe _ , edited by o.  sawada and a.  sugamoto ( kek , tsukuba , japan , 1979 ) ; m.  gell -

{"ContextTokens": 3088, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "small - scale ocean motions have an important effect on oceanic flows several orders of magnitude larger than them . \n the best - known bulk effect of small - scale processes is a substantial contribution to the transport of heat , salt , momentum , and passive tracers in all parts in the world s oceans . \n this effect is usually included in ocean circulation models by modifying the transport and mixing properties of the fluid from their molecular values to larger ones , giving rise to eddy - diffusion approaches of increasing sophistication and predictive power @xcite . \n the transport processes parametrized by these effective changes of the diffusive fluid properties have been shown to control important aspects of the earth s climate @xcite .    beyond eddy diffusion approaches , physical effects of small - scale activity are still poorly understood . \n for this reason , the nature and variability of small - scale oceanic motions have been exhaustively examined in different oceanographic contexts @xcite . \n given the nature of small - scale activity  disordered , fluctuating and turbulent  a contribution to diffusion and dispersion effects is obvious on physical grounds . but a more coherent influence of processes occurring at small - scales on large scales motions is unexpected unless some oceanographic factor is able to get a significant mean component out of the fluctuating behavior . \n bottom topography is one of such factors breaking the symmetry of the fluctuation statistics , and thus provides a dynamical link for energy transfer from the small to the large scale . \n evidence has been accumulated in the last decade showing that mean flows following the topographic contours are often found in the vicinity of topographic features of different scales @xcite . \n these topographically generated currents have been shown to influence both local and global aspects of the earth s climate @xcite . \n for example , large - scale motions related to topographic anomalies have been found in the north and south atlantic playing a major role in determining regional circulation and climatic characteristics @xcite . \n coriolis force , topography and fluctuations have been pointed out as the main ingredients to generate these along - isobaths coherent motions @xcite . \n briefly , coriolis force links topography to the dynamics of ocean vorticity . \n thus changes in ocean depth provide a symmetry breaking factor distinguishing according to their vorticity content otherwise isotropic mesoscale fluctuations . \n the result is that the mean effect of small - scale fluctuations does not average to zero yielding the existence of mean flows . \n finally , the topographic structure determines the circulation patterns of the originated currents .    on the basis of present knowledge , \n anticyclonic ( cyclonic ) tendencies are expected over bumps ( depressions ) for generated mean flows over topography . \n however , [ 1998 ] pointed out that these circulations tendencies could be strongly dependent on the properties of the small - scale variability . \n they theoretically addressed the possibility that the above mentioned circulation pattern could be even reversed ( cyclonic ( anticyclonic ) circulations over bumps ( depressions ) ) by the action of the small scales . \n the same effect is predicted when considering bottom friction instead of viscosity as the damping mechanism @xcite . \n the present letter attempts to elucidate , by means of computer simulations , if the direction of these mean flows is sensitive to the statistical characteristics of the small - scale , as it was argued on theoretical grounds . \n to explore in detail the possible relations between large and small scales in the presence of topography an ideal ocean represented by a single layer of fluid subjected to quasigeostrophic dynamics will be considered . \n baroclinic effects which in real oceans give rise to meso - small scale activity are modeled here by an explicit stochastic forcing with prescribed statistical properties @xcite . \n this term might also be considered as representing any high frequency wind forcing components and other processes below the resolution considered in the numerical model . \n this random forcing , in combination with viscous dissipation , will bring the ocean model to a statistically steady state . while highly idealized , the simplifying modeling assumptions above arise from our interest in isolating just the essential processes by which small -

vorticity fluctuations more dominant at the large scales , whereas negative @xmath11 represents fluctuations dominant at the smaller scales . \n the distribution of fluctuation variance among the scales can thus be controlled by varying @xmath11 . \n the spectrum of the energy input corresponding to the above stochastic vorticity forcing is also white in time , with a wavenumber dependence given by the relation @xmath12 . \n we have started first considering a situation where the small - scale variability is described by @xmath13 . \n this power - law has been observed for vorticity forcing induced by winds in the pacific ocean @xcite . \n the model has been integrated until a stationary state is achieved . \n figure 1b shows the mean currents obtained from this specific simulation . in the mean state \n the currents do not average to zero , despite the isotropy of the fluctuations and dissipation . \n instead the final mean state is characterized by the existence of large - scale mean currents strongly correlated with bottom topography . the spatial correlation coefficient between the streamfunction and the bottom topography is for this case @xmath14 . \n this positive spatial correlation implies the existence of mean anticyclonic ( cyclonic ) circulations over bumps ( depressions ) . as a next step , \n we have modeled the action of small - scales as a noisy process with a correlation described by the power - law @xmath15 . \n this spectrum describes a situation where the small - scale variability is more energetic than the one induced by the previous @xmath16 power - law . \n the response of the system is drastically changed by this small - scale activity . as shown in figure 1c \n the mean state of the ocean displays a pattern of circulation practically uncorrelated with bottom topography . \n specifically , the spatial correlation coefficient is @xmath17 . \n increasing again the exponent of the power law to @xmath18 , we obtain the generation of mean currents anticorrelated with bottom topography , as it can be observed from figure 1d . \n the spatial correlation coefficient is @xmath19 in this case of high small - scale activity , indicating the existence of mean cyclonic ( anticyclonic ) motions over bumps ( depressions ) . \n note that figures 1c and d display topography - generated currents much weaker than those obtained for the @xmath16 power - law case , figure 1b . \n this feature comes from the scale - selective character of the viscosity , more efficient at small scales where the forcing energy is most localized in the @xmath15 and @xmath20 cases . besides this effect \n , it should also be mentioned that forcing with a @xmath16 spectral power - law directly provides more energy input to the large - scale components than the @xmath15 and @xmath20 forcings . \n additional numerical simulations , for different initial conditions and noise and topography realizations , consistently confirm the results of the simulations presented in fig .  1 , that is the sensibility of the large - scale circulations not only to the particular structure of the underlying topography but also to the characteristics of the small - scale variability of the environment . \n in particular , as the small - scale content in the vorticity forcing is augmented with respect to the large - scale one , mean currents are always seen to reverse direction . \n on the basis of the property of potential - vorticity conservation , anticyclonic ( cyclonic ) motions are traditionally expected over topographic bumps ( depressions ) @xcite . \n if potential vorticity is not preserved because of the presence of some kind of forcing mechanism , then different circulation patterns can be generated . \n small - scale activity constitutes a systematic and persistent forcing of the circulation in the whole ocean . due to the relatively small and fast space and time scales that characterize this variability , \n the physical characteristics of this forcing are usually described in terms of their statistical properties @xcite . in other words , \n small - scale activity can be considered as a fluctuating background in which the large - scale motions are embedded . \n the relevance of the role played by this fluctuating environment in modifying the transport and viscous properties of the large scales is widely recognized . beyond these diffusive and viscous effect of the small - scale activity , \n the numerical results presented in this letter show that in the presence of bottom topography , statistical details of the variability of the small - scales can induce different large - scale oceanic circulations . \n the strength of this effect will be affected by the spectral characteristics of the topographic and forcing fields as well as by the real baroclinic nature of the ocean . \n preliminary computer simulations indicate that the strength of the mean currents increases when the topography contains more proportion of large - scale features . \n this effect and the dependence of the current direction on the forcing spectral exponent , presented in fig . \n 1 , nicely validates the theoretical results in @xcite . \n extension of the theoretical methods to the baroclinic case is in progress . \n however , a complete analysis of the influence of different forcings and topography shapes can only be addressed numerically . \n the shape of the topography was already shown to play a fundamental role in the energy transfer between different scales in baroclinic quasigeostrophic turbulence @xcite . \n finally , the results shown in this letter stress the need for a better observational characterization of the space and time variability of oceans at small - scales in order to achieve a complete understanding of the large - scale ocean circulation . \n numerical simulations of eq . \n ( [ eq ] ) have been conducted in a parameter regime of geophysical interest . \n a value of @xmath21 was chosen as appropriate for the coriolis effect at mean latitudes on earth and @xmath22 for the viscosity , a value usual for the eddy viscosity in ocean models . \n we use the numerical scheme developed in [ 1992 ] on a grid of @xmath23 points . \n the distance between grid points corresponds to 20 km , so that the total system size is @xmath24 km . \n the algorithm , based on arakawa finite differences and the leap - frog algorithm , keeps the value of energy and enstrophy constant when it is run in the inviscid and unforced case . \n the consistent way of introducing the stochastic term into the leap - frog scheme can be found in [ 1997 ] . \n the amplitude of the forcing has been chosen in order to obtain final velocities of several centimeters per second . \n the topographic field is randomly generated from a isotropic spectrum containing , with equal amplitude and random phases , all the fourier modes corresponding to scales between 80 km and 300 km . \n the model was run for @xmath25 time steps ( corresponding to 206 years ) after a statistically stationary state was reached . \n the streamfunction is then averaged during this last interval of time .    financial support from cicyt ( amb95 -

{"ContextTokens": 2254, "GeneratedTokens": 259, "SynthesizedBody": "there are several advantages in studying a heavy - light system on a lattice . \n our meson is much more simple than in true qcd : one of the quarks is static with the light quark `` orbiting '' it . \n this makes it very beneficial for modelling . on the lattice \n an abundance of data can be produced , and we know which state we are measuring  the physical states can be a mixture of two or more configurations , but on the lattice this complication is avoided . however , our results on the heavy - light system can still be compared to the @xmath6 meson experimental results . \n we have measured both angular and radial excitations of heavy - light mesons , and not just their energies but also some radial distributions . since the heavy quark spin decouples from the game we may label the states as @xmath7 , where l is the angular momentum and @xmath8 is the spin of the light quark . \n the measurements were done on a @xmath9 lattice with dynamical clover fermions . \n we have two degenerate quark flavours with a mass that is close to the strange quark mass . \n the lattice configurations were generated by the ukqcd collaboration . \n some details about the different lattices used in this study can be found in table  [ latttable ] . \n two different levels of fuzzing ( 2 and 8 iterations of conventional fuzzing ) were used in the spatial directions to permit the extraction of the excited states . \n .lattice parameters . \n these are ukqcd collaboration s lattices with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the 2-point correlation function ( see figure  [ fig : corr ] a ) is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the heavy ( infinite mass)-quark propagator and @xmath14 the light anti - quark propagator . @xmath15 is a linear combination of products of gauge links at time @xmath16 along paths @xmath17 and @xmath18 defines the spin structure of the operator . \n the @xmath19 means the average over the whole lattice . \n the energies ( @xmath20 ) and amplitudes ( @xmath21 ) are extracted by fitting the @xmath22 with a sum of exponentials , @xmath23 fuzzing indices have been omitted for clarity . \n we introduced two types of smearing in the time direction to allow the stationary quark to move a little , but not too far , from its fixed location . \n first we tried ape type smearing , where the original links in the time direction are replaced by a sum over the six staples that extend in the spatial directions ( in fig . \n [ fig : smear ] on the left ) . \n this smearing is called here `` sum6 '' for short . to smear the static quark even more we then tried hypercubic blocking , again only for the links in the time direction ( in fig . \n [ fig : smear ] on the right ) . \n now the staples ( the red ones in fig . \n [ fig : smear ] ) are not constructed of the original , single links , but from staples ( the blue ones in fig . \n [ fig : smear ] ) . \n this allows the heavy quark to move within a `` hypercube '' ( the edges of the `` cube '' are 2@xmath0 in spatial directions but only one lattice spacing in the time direction ) . \n this smearing is called here `` hyp '' for short . \n smearing the heavy quark was expected to improve the measurements , particularly radial distributions - which it did , to some extent . \n the energy spectrum obtained is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : espectr ] . using different smearing for \n the heavy quark does not seem to change the energies too much - except for the p@xmath24 state . \n it is not understood yet why this state should be more sensitive to changes in the heavy quark than the other states we have considered . \n the energy of the d@xmath25 state was expected to be near the spin average of the d@xmath26 and d@xmath24 energies , but it turned out to be a poor estimate of this average . \n thus it is not clear whether or not the f@xmath25 energy is near the spin average of the two f - wave states , as was hoped . \n our earlier results can be foun in ref . \n @xcite . \n one interesting point to note here is that the spin - orbit splitting of the p - wave states is small , almost zero . \n we extracted the energy difference of the p@xmath24 and p@xmath26 states in two different ways :    1 .   indirectly by simply calculating the difference using the energies given by the fits in equation  [ c2fit ] , when the p@xmath24 and p@xmath26 data are fitted separately . \n 2 .   directly by combining the p@xmath24 and p@xmath26 data ( taking the ratio ) and fitting everything in one go with @xmath27+b\\exp[-m_ct],\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are fit parameters . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energies of the p@xmath26 and p@xmath24 ground states , respectively . \n the energy difference , rather than the energies themselves , were varied in the fit . \n the second exponential contains the corrections from the excited states . \n d - wave spin - orbit splitting was also extracted in a similar manner . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : sos ] . \n for evaluating the radial distributions of the light quark a 3-point correlation function shown in fig . \n [ fig : corr ] b is needed . \n it is defined as @xmath33 this is rather similar to the 2-point correlation function in eq . \n [ 2point ] . \n we have now two light quark propagators , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and a probe @xmath36 at distance @xmath37 from the static quark ( @xmath38 for the vector ( charge ) and @xmath39 for the scalar ( matter ) distribution ) .    knowing the energies @xmath20 and the amplitudes @xmath21 from the earlier @xmath22 fit , the radial distributions , @xmath40 s , are then extracted by fitting the @xmath41 with @xmath42 the results are plotted in figures  [ s11][dmdistr ] . \n the error bars in these figures show statistical errors only . \n see @xcite for earlier s - wave distribution calculations . \n the `` sum6 '' distributions have been published in @xcite , but the `` hyp '' results are still preliminary . \n we are currently trying to improve the analysis of the d - wave radial distribution data . \n when measuring a radial distribution it is easy to also measure the sumrule by simply summing over the whole lattice . \n our results for the charge sumrule are shown in figure  [ dmdistr ] . \n we included the vertex correction @xmath43 , so that with our normalisation the result should be one . \n this comes out very nicely for the s - wave , but for the other states we get the sumrule to be somewhat smaller . \n a simple model based on the dirac equation is used to try to describe the lattice data . \n since the mass of the heavy quark is infinite we have essentially a one - body problem . \n the potential in the dirac equation has a linearly rising scalar part , @xmath44 , as well as a vector part @xmath45 . \n the one gluon exchange potential , @xmath46 , is modified to @xmath47 where @xmath48  mev and the dynamical gluon mass @xmath49  mev ( see  @xcite for details ) . \n the potential also has a scalar term @xmath50 , which is needed to increase the energy of higher angular momentum states . \n however , this is only a small contribution ( about 30  mev for the f - wave ) . \n the solid lines in the radial distribution plots are predictions from the dirac model fit with @xmath51  gev , @xmath52 , @xmath53  gev / fm , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . \n these are treated as free parameters with the values obtained by fitting the ground state energies of p- , d- and f - wave states and the energy of the first radially excited s - wave state ( 2s ) . \n note that the excited state energies in fig . \n [ fig : espectr ] were not fitted . \n this fit was done using the energies obtained with ape smearing ( `` sum6 '' ) , and the latest `` hyp '' data was not used . \n * there is an abundance of lattice data , energies and radial distributions , available . * \n the spin - orbit splitting is small and supports the symmetry @xmath56 as proposed in  @xcite . * the energies and radial distributions of s- , \n p- and d - wave states can be qualitatively understood by using a one -

{"ContextTokens": 2851, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of the effects of noise is a well established subject in several different disciplines ranging from physics , to chemistry and to biology @xcite . \n the essential role of the noise in theoretical ecology however has been recently recognized . \n some key questions in population ecology are related to the understanding of the role that noise , climatic forcing and nonlinear interactions between individuals of the same or different species play on the dynamics of the ecosystems @xcite . \n more recently noise induced effects on population dynamics have been investigated @xcite . in this paper \n we study the dynamics of two and three interacting species in the presence of multiplicative noise and a periodic driving force . \n specifically we consider : ( a ) two competing species and ( b ) three interacting species . \n the multiplicative noise models the interaction between the species and the environment , and the driving force mimics the climatic temperature oscillations . in case ( a ) \n the interaction parameter between the species is a stochastic process which obeys an ito stochastic differential equation . \n the noise induces spatio - temporal patterns , quasi - deterministic oscillations , stochastic resonance ( sr ) phenomenon @xcite and noise delayed extinction , which is akin of the noise enhanced stability @xcite . in case ( b ) \n we find noise induced spatial patterns whose time evolution is strongly dependent on the initial conditions . \n specifically we consider two different initial conditions : ( i ) an uniform initial distribution which gives rise to anticorrelated spatio - temporal patterns between the two preys , and ( ii ) a peaked initial distribution which gives rise periodically to a strong correlation between the patterns of the three species . \n time evolution of two competing species is obtained within the formalism of the lotka - volterra equations  @xcite using the ito scheme    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is gaussian white noise with zero mean and @xmath2@xmath3 = @xmath4 . \n the multiplicative noise models the interaction between the environment and the species . \n the interaction parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are characterized by a critical value corresponding to @xmath7 . \n we choose @xmath8 . for @xmath9 a coexistence regime of the two species \n is established , while for @xmath10 an exclusion regime takes place , i.e. in a finite time one of the two species extinguishes . \n the two regimes correspond to stable states of the deterministic lotka - volterra model . \n it is then interesting to investigate the time evolution of the ecosystem for @xmath11 varying around the critical value @xmath12 in the presence of fluctuations , due to the significant interaction with the environment . \n the interaction parameter @xmath11 therefore can be described by a stochastic process which obeys the following differential equation    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is a bistable potential ( see fig.1 )    @xmath15    @xmath16 is a gaussian white noise with the usual statistical properties : @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n we perform simulations of eqs . \n ( 1 ) and ( [ lotvol ] ) by using a bistable potential @xmath14 centered at @xmath19 , i.e. in the coexistence region . \n we consider as initial value of the interaction parameter @xmath20 , which corresponds to the left minimum of the potential well ( see fig.1 ) . \n we fix the intensity of the multiplicative noise at a constant value @xmath21 , and we vary the intensity of the additive noise . for low noise intensity \n the two species coexist all the time , while by increasing noise one species dominates the other one for a random time and quasi - deterministic oscillations take place . by increasing even more the noise intensity the coherent response to environment variations \n is lost ( see figs.2(a),(b ) and ( c ) ) . \n these time variations of competing populations are due to noise induced phenomena , namely quasi - deterministic oscillations and stochastic resonance . in fig.2(d ) we report the snr of the squared difference of population densities @xmath22 . at a finite noise intensity @xmath23 \n the snr exhibits a maximum , which characterizes the sr phenomenon . \n now we consider the effect of the additive noise @xmath24 in eq.([beta_eq ] ) on the extinction time of the species and we neglect the multiplicative noise and the periodical forcing . because of the initial condition , the ecosystem is in the coexistence region , then the deterministic extinction time of both species is infinity . by introducing noise , exclusion takes place and a finite mean extinction time ( met ) appears . by increasing the noise intensity \n we obtain a noise delayed extinction : both species survive because of the noise \n . then the average extinction time grows reaching a saturation value , which corresponds to the absence of the barrier of the potential @xmath14 . \n the met as a function of the noise intensity @xmath24 takes a minimum at a finite noise intensity @xmath25 . \n we perform 1000 realizations of eqs . \n ( [ lotvol ] ) and the results are shown in fig.3 . \n in this section we study the effects of the noise on the spatial distribution of interacting species . \n in particular we analyze the spatial distribution of two different ecosystems : ( a ) two competing species , ( b ) three interacting species , one predator and two preys . to study the spatial effects we consider a discrete time evolution model , which is the discrete version of eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) with diffusive terms , namely a coupled map lattice  @xcite . \n the time evolution of the spatial distribution for the two species is given by the following equations    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the densities of the species in the site _ \n ( i , j ) _ at the time step _ \n n _ , @xmath29 is the interaction parameter at the same time , _ d _ is the diffusion constant and @xmath30 indicates the sum over the four nearest neighbors . \n the @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance unit . \n the interaction parameter @xmath33 is a stochastic process obtained by solving iteratively eq.([beta_eq ] ) . \n the bistable potential is centered at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which corresponds to the minimum of the left well . \n the results of our simulations are shown in fig . \n +    we observe periodical formation of correlated patterns . \n after 600 time steps the spatial distributions of the two species appear almost independent . after 3000 time steps the anticorrelation between the two species densities increases \n . a further evolution of the system produces again spatial distributions which are independent after 4800 time steps and anticorrelated after 5400 time steps . \n the two competing species tend to occupy different spatial places periodically without overlap . \n finally we analyzed an ecosystem composed by three species : two preys and one predator . \n we use the same coupled map lattice model of the previous section    @xmath36 + \\sqrt{\\sigma_z}z_{i , j}^n z_{i , j}^n + d\\sum_\\delta ( z_{\\delta}^n - z_{i , j}^n),\\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath37 are respectively the densities of preys _ x _ , _ y _ and of the predator _ z _ in the site _ ( i , j ) _ at the time step _ \n _ , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the interaction parameters between preys and predator and d is the diffusion coefficient . \n the interaction parameter @xmath11 between the two preys is a periodical function whose value , after _ \n n _ time steps , is given by    @xmath40    with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . \n we consider two different initial conditions : ( i ) a homogeneous initial distribution and ( ii ) a peaked initial distribution . in the first case we find exactly anticorrelated spatial patterns of the two preys , while the spatial patterns of the predator show correlations with both the spatial distributions of the preys ( see fig . \n the preys tend to occupy different positions as in the case of two competing species . in the second case we use delta - like initial distributions for the two preys and a homogeneous distribution for the predator . \n after @xmath44 steps we find strongly correlated spatial patterns of the preys which almost overlap each other . \n the maximum of spatial distribution of the predator is just at the boundary of the spatial concentrations of the preys , so that the predator surrounds the preys ( see fig.6 ) . \n the preys now tend to overlap spatially as it occurs in real ecosystems when preys tend to defend themselves against the predator attacks . \n we analyzed the role of the noise on the spatio - temporal behaviors of two ecosystems composed by two and three interacting species . \n we use lotka - volterra generalized equations with multiplicative noise , climatic periodic forcing and random interaction parameter . \n the main conclusions of this work are : ( i ) in the case of two interacting species the appearance of noise induced phenomena such as quasi - deterministic oscillations , stochastic resonance , noise delayed extinction and spatial patterns ; ( ii ) in the case of three interacting species the formation of dynamical spatial patterns exhibiting correlations which are strongly dependent on the initial conditions . \n our population dynamical model could be useful to explain spatio - temporal experimental data of interacting species strongly interacting with the noisy environment @xcite \n . a more detailed study of the dynamics of spatial patterns through stochastic partial differential equations will be the subject of future investigations . \n this work has been supported by intas grant 01 -

{"ContextTokens": 2202, "GeneratedTokens": 188, "SynthesizedBody": "studying the early universe requires describing the evolution of interacting fields in a dense , high - energy environment . \n the study of reheating after inflation and the subsequent thermalization of the fields produced in this process typically involves non - perturbative interactions of fields with exponentially large occupations numbers in states far from thermal equilibrium . \n various approximation methods have been applied to these calculations , including linearized analysis and the hartree approximation . \n these methods fail , however , as soon as the field fluctuations become large enough that they can no longer be considered small perturbations . \n in such a situation linear analysis no longer makes sense and the hartree approximation neglects important rescattering terms . in many models of inflation preheating can amplify fluctuations to these large scales within a few oscillations of the inflaton field . \n moreover , such large amplification appears to be a generic feature , arising via parametric resonance in single - field inflationary models and tachyonic instabilities in hybrid models . \n the only way to fully treat the nonlinear dynamics of these systems is through lattice simulations . \n these simulations directly solve the classical equations of motion for the fields . \n although this approach involves the approximation of neglecting quantum effects , these effects are exponentially small once preheating begins . \n so in any inflationary model in which preheating can occur lattice simulations provide the most accurate means of studying post - inflationary dynamics . \n in 2000 g.f.and igor tkachev released latticeeasy @xcite , a c++ program for simulating scalar field evolution in an expanding universe . in the ensuing years latticeeasy \n has been used by us and other groups to study such topics as preheating , baryogenesis , gravity wave production , and more . \n these simulations have been extremely useful , but they have for the most part been confined to relatively simple toy models , primarily due to computational limitations . \n to study cosmology in more complex models such as the mssm or gut theories will require the use of large , parallel clusters . \n clustereasy is a version of latticeeasy that can be run in parallel on multiple processors . \n section [ overview ] of this paper gives a brief overview of what latticeeasy does and how to use it , and notes the modifications that must be made in the latticeeasy files to run them in clustereasy . \n section [ implementation ] describes the algorithms used to parallelize the simulations . for more detailed documentation \n the reader is referred to the latticeeasy website ` http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/physics/fstaff/gfelder/latticeeasy/ ` \n latticeeasy consists of several c++ files , but only two are designed to be modified by most users . \n each particular scalar field potential that the program solves is encoded in a _ model file _ called model.h , in which the user enters equations for the potential and its various derivatives . \n the parameters that control individual runs are stored in a file called parameters.h . \n these parameters include physical quantities such as masses and couplings , numerical quantities such as the number of gridpoints and the size of the time step , and parameters to control what types of output are generated by the simulation . \n to use clustereasy the user must replace all of the non - user - modifiable files from latticeeasy with the new , clustereasy versions . the parameter files from latticeeasy can be used with no changes , however , and the model files only need the addition of two lines , described in the online documentation . \n the formats of the outputs created by clustereasy are the same as those from the serial version . \n one of the output options is to create a grid image that can be used to resume a run and continue it to later times . \n grid images created by latticeeasy can be read in by clustereasy and vice - versa . the only way to distinguish clustereasy output from latticeeasy output is the file info , which contains basic information about the run such as the potential used and the physical and numerical parameters . in clustereasy this file has an additional line specifying the number of processors used for the run .    to run clustereasy \n you need a cluster with mpi . \n mpi is a standard set of libraries used for parallel programming in c , c++ , and fortran , and should be installed on any standard cluster . \n you also need the freely available fourier transform library fftw . \n ( see the online documentation for possible compatibility issues with the way fftw is installed on different systems and how to resolve them . )    the makefile that comes with clustereasy assumes that the command for compiling a c++ mpi program is mpicc . \n if this command is different on your system you will need to modify the makefile accordingly \n . otherwise you should be able to compile the code simply by typing `` make . '' \n you should consult your system documentation for the correct syntax for running a parallel program , but on most clusters it is ` mpirun -np < number of processors > latticeeasy ` note that the number of processors is determined at execution - time , not at compile - time . \n latticeeasy uses a staggered leapfrog algorithm with a fixed time step . \n this means that at each step the field values @xmath0 and their derivatives @xmath1 are stored at two different times @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . \n the derivatives are used to advance the field values by a full step @xmath4 and then the field values are used to calculate the second derivatives @xmath5 , which are in turn used to advance the field derivatives by @xmath4 . \n this evolution is done in place , meaning the newly calculated field values and/or derivatives overwrite the old ones .    to implement this scheme on multiple processors clustereasy uses `` slab decomposition , '' meaning the grid \n is divided along a single dimension ( the first spatial dimension ) . \n for example , in a 2d run with @xmath6 on two processors , each processor would cast a @xmath7 grid for each field . at each processor \n the variable _ \n n _ stores the local size of the grid in the first dimension , so in this example each processor would store @xmath8 , @xmath6 . note that _ n _ is not always the same for all processors , but it generally will be if the number of processors is a factor of _ n_.    in practice , the grids are actually slightly larger than @xmath9 because calculating spatial derivatives at a gridpoint requires knowing the neighboring values , so each processor actually has two additional columns for storing the values needed for these gradients . \n continuing the example from the previous paragraph , each processor would store a @xmath10 grid for each field . within this grid the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 \n would be used for storing `` buffer '' values , and the actual evolution would be calculated in the range @xmath13 , @xmath14 . \n this scheme is shown in figure  [ clusterimage ] . at each time \n step each processor advances the field values in the shaded region , using the buffers to calculate spatial derivatives . \n then the processors exchange edge data . at the bottom of the figure i ve labeled the @xmath15 value of each column in the overall grid . during the exchange processor 0 \n would send the new values at @xmath16 and @xmath17 to processor 1 , which would send the values at @xmath18 and @xmath19 to processor 0 . \n the actual arrays allocated by the program are even larger than this , however , because of the extra storage required by the fourier transform routines . in two and three dimensions clustereasy uses fftw . \n when you fourier transform the fields the nyquist modes are stored in extra positions in the last dimension , so the last dimension is @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 . \n the total size per field of the array at each processor is thus typically @xmath22 in 1d , @xmath23 in 2d and @xmath24 in 3d . in 2d \n fftw sometimes requires extra storage for intermediate calculations as well , in which case the array may be somewhat larger than this , but usually not much . \n this does not occur in 3d . \n we have found that the speed of the simulation scales roughly as the number of processors , provided that number is significantly smaller than @xmath21 , the number of gridpoints along each edge of the lattice . \n a good rule of thumb is that you probably wo nt get much benefit from using more processors than @xmath25 . \n also , you will get slightly better performance per processor if the number of processors is a factor of @xmath21 so that the processors can divide the lattice up evenly . \n clustereasy offers the opportunity to do simulations of much larger , more complex , and more realistic early universe theories than was possible with serial simulations . \n we offer it in the hope that it will be useful to the research community . \n the usual thanks offered in a paper are inadequate for the impressive contributions made by students and other collaborators on this project . \n significant work on the project was done in particular by sirein awadalla , douglas swanson , and hal finkel . \n others who contributed include jing li , dessislava michaylova , and olga navros . \n i would also like to thank richard easther for valuable discussions and the canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics for hosting me during part of this work . \n finally , i would like to thank igor tkachev , my collaborator on latticeeasy , without whom none of this would have been possible . \n g.f . was supported by nsf grant phy-0456631 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2210239146517, "RequestID": "26a71eb8b7714933a5de683f5b0a81d9", "TotalTokens": 2390}

phonon scattering is also quantitatively understood @xcite . however , comparing theoretical with stm - derived experimental damping rates of electronic excitations with energies above the fermi level @xmath2 show that the experimental decay rates increase more rapidly with increasing energy @xmath1 . recently a similar discrepancy between image state lifetimes measured by means of the stm and two - photon - photoemission spectroscopy was lifted @xcite . \n it was shown that the applied electric field during the stm - measurement causes an increase in both the efficiency of the image state decay channels as well as their number . in the light of this work , becker _ \n et al . _ theoretically investigated the impact of the stm - induced electric field on the inelastic _ e - e _ damping rate of the electron- and hole - like excitations in the shockley surface state band at ag(111 ) @xcite . \n their results indicate that under typical tunnelling conditions the stm does not significantly alter the surface state wave function and so previous stm - derived shockley state lifetimes need not be corrected . \n nevertheless , while experimental and calculated lifetimes agree quite well over a range of energies , a quantitative difference remains for unoccupied states of energies @xmath3  mev . \n the origin of this different energy dependence , which is still an open question , is addressed in this report . \n the calculations presented here are based upon the approach developed by chulkov _ et al . _ \n @xcite , and used widely in calculations of surface state dynamics @xcite . within this approach the damping rate or inverse lifetime of an excitation in the state @xmath4 with energy @xmath1 \n is obtained from the expectation value of the imaginary part of the electron self -

electron eigenfunctions with energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 a positive infinitesimal . \n the screened coulomb interaction is evaluated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath17 is the density - density response function of the non - interacting electron system . an explicit expression for @xmath18 \n can be found in ref . \n @xcite . \n the single particle states have been obtained by solving the schrdinger equation using a one - dimensional pseudopotential varying in the direction perpendicular to the surface @xcite . \n the pseudopotential does not describe the @xmath19-electrons of the substrate , which are anyways too low in energy to play a significant role as final states for the decay , but their contribution to the screening is included via a polarisable background @xcite . \n ( color online ) ag(111 ) surface band structure . \n shaded area and solid line are the projected bulk and surface state dispersion from _ ab -

phonon contribution to the linewidth is taken to be constant @xmath22  mev for energies in excess of @xmath23  mev above the fermi level @xcite . \n previous calculations of the decay rate of the ag(111 ) shockley state have assumed parabolic dispersion with effective masses of @xmath20 and @xmath24 for the intrinsic surface state and the lower band edge respectively @xcite . \n however , over the extended energy range of interest here , this approximation needs to be improved as evident from fig . \n [ fig : disp ] . figure [ fig : disp ] shows the parabolic dispersions ( dashed lines ) for the surface state band and the band edge with effective masses as mentioned above . \n the grey shaded area and the solid line are the projected bulk and surface state dispersion , respectively , that are found from _ ab - initio _ calculations . \n the parabolic dispersion underestimates the gap between surface state band and band edge . \n we have therefore used the _ ab - initio _ \n dispersions for our lifetime calculations . \n as previously noted @xcite there are important changes in the shape of the surface state wave function with @xmath25 , the surface wave vector , and we take these into account by recalculating the wave function for different @xmath25 with the pseudopotential parameters changed to take into account the appropriate _ ab - initio _ band edges and surface state energy . \n we focus on the energy range between @xmath26 and @xmath27  ev above the fermi level where the surface state is energetically separated from the bulk states and thus is well defined . \n this energy range is of interest as according to ref . \n @xcite there is a cross - over in the primary decay channel from intraband to interband dominated decay . \n our calculated results for the total damping rate @xmath28 are shown in fig . \n [ fig : damp ] as a solid line .    for energies below @xmath29 \n ev we find that our results for the inelastic _ e - e _ damping rate of excitations in the shockley state band agree well with the inverse lifetime estimation from echenique _ \n ( dashed line ) @xcite using similar methods but with an effective mass approximation . \n this agreement is due to the fact that the effective mass approximation gives a very good description of the projected _ ab - inito _ surface band structure for energies with @xmath30  ev as evident from fig . \n [ fig : disp ] .    for larger energies \n we find that the _ e - e _ damping rate as a function of energy increases more rapidly with the _ ab - initio _ dispersion than calculated with parabolic dispersions . \n this result can be understood as follows : for energies @xmath31  ev the parabolic dispersions underestimate the energy gap between surface state band and the bulk band edge . \n consequently , the _ ab - initio _ dispersions reveal a reduced penetration of the surface state wave function into the interior of the crystal and an increased probability amplitude in the proximity of the metal surface . \n this modification leads to two competing effects . \n since screening is reduced at the surface @xcite intraband decay becomes more efficient . \n on the other hand , interband decay becomes less probable owing to the reduced overlap with bulk states . \n it turns out that the increase of intraband decay outweighs the decrease in interband transitions . the net result is a more steep increase of @xmath0 than obtained from parabolic dispersions . \n we thus find the intraband contribution to dominate up to @xmath32  ev where the interband and intraband contributions become similar in magnitude . \n comparing to published experimental data ( symbols in fig . \n [ fig : damp ] ) the agreement is improved .    in summary , we have presented a theoretical many -

{"ContextTokens": 3529, "GeneratedTokens": 107, "SynthesizedBody": "although a homogeneous neutron matter is one of the simplest nuclear systems , its importance can not be overemphasized since it constitutes the main component of neutron stars . \n the density of the neutron matter forming neutron stars ranges from subnuclear densities ( in the inner crust ) up to extremely high values of @xmath4 ( expected in the center of the star ) , where @xmath5 is the saturation density@xcite .    in the regime of sufficiently low densities \n one can perform very precise calculations since the neutron - neutron interaction is completely dominated by the scattering in @xmath6 channel , which is determined by two parameters only : the scattering length @xmath7 and the effective range @xmath8 . \n indeed , at the densities @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the influence of other channels as well as of three - body forces is marginal and can be neglected@xcite . \n the values of the scattering length and the effective range are well known from the low energy scattering experiments and read : @xmath11 , @xmath12@xcite . at the densities where @xmath13 the dilute neutron matter is an example of a strongly correlated system . moreover , \n the influence of the effective range can not be ignored except for very low densities where @xmath14@xcite . \n it implies that only non - perturbative approaches are able to gain a reliable insight into physics of this system . the large class of such methods , which are known under the general name of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , has been applied for the dilute neutron matter@xcite . in spite of a considerable theoretical effort some of its static properties \n are still vaguely known . \n the open questions mostly concern the superfluid state , which is generated at sufficiently low temperatures . \n for example the predicted value of the zero temperature energy gap differs significantly for various approaches , revealing a strong dependence on the details of the applied method ( see@xcite and references therein ) . \n the same concerns the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal phase transition , where the well known bcs formula @xmath15 is believed to be valid .    here \n we present the selected results concerning the superfluid state , obtained within the afqmc approach at non - zero temperatures@xcite for the dilute neutron matter of density @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . \n this study can be regarded as a continuation of the investigations presented in the papers @xcite , where the details of the afqmc algorithm and the procedure of adjusting the interaction , have been discussed . in the present study we focused on two basic quantities which characterize a superfluid state : the critical temperature and the pairing gap . \n in the case of superfluidity the convenient order parameter is specified by the long - distance behavior of the two - body density matrix @xmath18 where the field operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 obey the fermionic anticommutation relations . \n such a long - distance behavior is directly related to the condensate fraction @xmath21 , which measure the fraction of cooper pairs forming a condensate@xcite . \n this quantity can be efficiently computed within afqmc , provided the information concerning the one - body density matrix @xmath22 is also included . \n the condensate fraction is given by:@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the number of particles and the correlation functions @xmath25 are defined as : @xmath26     as a function of temperature ( in units of fermi energy @xmath27 ) for three lattice sizes @xmath28 . \n the inset presents the rescaled condensate fraction obtained for lattices @xmath29 ( squares ) and @xmath30 ( circles ) . \n the intersection of the fitted lines determines the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal phase transition , @xmath31 . ] \n the figure [ fig : nm_alpha ] presents the condensate fraction versus the temperature for three different lattice sizes @xmath28 . \n it is clearly visible that the results for @xmath32 significantly deviate from those obtained for larger lattices . \n it is due to the fact that for small lattices the limiting value of @xmath33 is rather poorly determined . indeed , \n the infinity  in this case is equal to the half of the box size and is only a few times larger than the interaction range . \n consequently , it will generate a large systematic error when the lattice is too small . \n the presented results indicate that this is exactly the case for @xmath32 and therefore these data were not included in the process of determination of the critical temperature .    in the thermodynamic limit \n the condensate fraction has to vanish at the critical temperature @xmath2 . \n however , in the case of calculations in the box the finite size effects come into play and smooth out all singularities typical for the phase transition . \n still , one can estimate the critical temperature using the method based on the finite size scaling . \n similar technique has been used to determine the critical temperature for cold atomic gases ( see@xcite for details ) . \n the volume - dependent estimation of the critical temperature @xmath34 is obtained by finding the intersection of the rescaled condensate fraction @xmath35 for two different lattice sizes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the universal critical exponent and @xmath38 is the volume of the box . as @xmath39 \n the thermodynamic limit is recovered and the series @xmath34 converges to the critical temperature . to extract @xmath2 \n we have used two largest of the available lattices , namely @xmath40 . \n the filling factor in both cases reads : @xmath41 . according to our experience , \n the above methodology is sufficient to estimate the critical temperature with an uncertainty smaller than @xmath42 ( in fact this procedure applied to the unitary gas provides the value of @xmath2 with the relative error smaller than @xmath43 ) . \n finally , the estimated value of the critical temperature reads @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , where @xmath27 is the fermi energy ( see the inset of fig . [ \n fig : nm_alpha ] ) . \n in order to determine the gap in the single particle spectrum , we have computed the spectral weight function @xmath46 . this quantity has been extracted from the imaginary time propagator @xmath47 through the analytic continuation@xcite . \n the procedure is equivalent to solving the integral equation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the inverse of the temperature and @xmath50 is determined from the monte carlo calculations for the discrete set of values @xmath51 . \n numerically , however , the above integral equation represents an ill - posed problem i.e. there is an infinite class of solutions for @xmath46 which satisfy eq . \n ( [ eqn : ap ] ) within uncertainties generated by monte carlo method . \n therefore we have used two methods which were in particular designed to deal with such tasks : the truncated svd method and the maximum entropy method@xcite . \n for the dilute neutron matter at selected temperatures : a )  @xmath52 , b )  @xmath53 , c )  @xmath54 , d )  @xmath55 . \n the nonzero energy gap is present up to the critical temperature @xmath31 . ] \n the spectral functions for selected temperatures ( below and above @xmath2 ) are presented in fig . \n [ fig : nm_spectral ] . \n our results admit the gapped solutions up to the critical temperature and above @xmath2 the gap vanishes . \n one has to remember , however , that there is a finite resolution of both methods concerning the value of the gap . \n namely , the gap can not be resolved if its value decreases below @xmath56 . \n the value of the energy gap @xmath57 extracted from the spectral function at the temperature @xmath58 is expected to provide a good approximation of its value at zero temperature . \n it reads : @xmath59 .    . \n ]    in fig . \n [ fig : gap_comparison ] our results are compared to those obtained by other authors within _ \n ab  initio _ \n calculations for zero temperature . \n we have found our results in agreement with the recent green function monte carlo calculations of gezerlis and carlson@xcite . \n the calculations including other scattering channels together with the three body forces were performed by gandolfi _ \n et al.,_@xcite and predict larger paring gap . however , it is difficult to establish the source of this discrepancy since their method ( auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ) has been constrained in order to avoid the fermionic sign problem and therefore can be regarded as a variational approach \n .    an interesting result can be noticed by considering the ratio of the energy gap at zero temperature to the critical temperature . \n namely , the ratio @xmath60 exceeds almost twice the well - known bcs value @xmath61 . \n a similar situation has been encountered for the unitary gas , where the existence of the exotic `` pseudogap '' phase above @xmath2 was recently reported@xcite . \n it indicates that the dilute neutron matter at this density is not a bcs - type superfluid . \n we have performed the fully non - perturbative calculations for the dilute neutron matter of density @xmath62 at finite temperatures . \n we focused on the basic quantities which characterize the superfluid state and extracted the value of the critical temperature and the pairing gap . \n our results are free from uncontrolled approximations and are essentially exact with only uncertainties related to statistical errors and finite size effects . \n the large value of @xmath60 suggests that the dilute neutron gas can not be described by the bcs theory and thus is not a bcs superfluid at low temperatures . \n support from the polish ministry of science under contracts no . \n n n202 328234 , n n202 128439 and by the unedf scidac collaboration under doe grant de - fc02 - 07er41457 is gratefully acknowledged . \n calculations reported here have been performed at the interdisciplinary centre for mathematical and computational modelling ( icm ) at warsaw university . \n muller , s.e . \n koonin , r.  seki and u.  vankolck , _ phys . \n rev . _  * c61 * , 044320 ( 2000 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 2033, "GeneratedTokens": 575, "SynthesizedBody": "the planck telescope is designed as an off - axis tilted system offering the advantage of an unblocked aperture . \n the baseline configuration has been selected among thirty different optical designs . \n the current configuration has been obtained by optimizing the telescope performance for a set of equally distributed in frequency ( from 30 to 857 ghz ) and space ( within the focal plane box ) representative feed horns . \n both mirrors have an ellipsoidal shape ( aplanatic configuration ) . \n the conical constants , the focal lenght , the tilting , and the decenter of the mirrors have been combined to reduce the main beam aberrations , the curvature of the focal surface , and the spillover as well . \n the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) is one of the two instruments onboard the planck satellite @xcite that shares the focal region of the telescope . \n it is an array of 54 hemt - based pseudo - correlation receivers coupled to the telescope by 27 dual profiled corrugated feed horns . \n the baseline layout of the lfi focal plane unit ( fpu ) foresees the 27 feed horns located around the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) : 16 feed horns at 100 ghz , 6 at 70 ghz , 3 at 44 ghz and 2 at 30 ghz . \n the lfi team has carried out an exhaustive study of the lfi optical interface devoted to optimize the angular resolution ( 12 arcmin at 100 ghz as a requirement , 10 arcmin at 100 ghz as a goal ) and at the same time to minimize all the systematics coming from the side lobes of the radiation pattern . \n different techniques can be applied to predict the radiation pattern : geometrical optics ( go ) , geometrical theory of diffraction ( gtd ) , physical optics ( po ) and physical theory of diffraction ( ptd ) . \n the simulations have been performed considering each feed ( gaussian , x axis polarized @xcite ) as a source and computing the pattern scattered by both reflectors on the far field . \n the go / gtd methods have been used to model the sub reflector , while the main reflector has been modelized using the po .      the angular resolution ( expressed here in term of full width half maximum , fwhm ) of the beam on the sky depends on the illumination of the primary mirror . \n the illumination can be represented by the edge taper , defined as the ratio of the power per unit area incident on the centre of the mirror to that incident on the edge . \n decreasing the edge taper has a positive impact on the angular resolution but lower is the edge taper and higher is the side lobes level since they are largely due by diffraction and scattering from the reflector edges . \n the trade - off between the angular resolution ( which impacts the ability to reconstruct the anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation at high multipoles @xcite ) and the edge taper ( which impacts the systematics of the detected signal from receivers @xcite ) has been carried out for some lfi feed horns @xcite . \n the dependence of the angular resolution improvement on the edge taper degradation is almost linear until a certain edge taper is reached , when increasing the illumination on the primary mirror does nt involve a further angular resolution betterment . \n the latter because a strong illumination of the mirrors increases the aberrations on the main beam . obviously , the amount of the improvement depends on the feed horn location , since the primary mirror is illuminated in a different way . \n the amplitude field incident on the main reflector has been computed for each lfi feed horn . \n the model of the feed we used is a x axis polarized gaussian horn with an edge taper of 30 db at 22@xmath0 of angle @xcite . \n the x axis ( y axis ) of the contour plot lies on the symmetry ( asymmetry ) plane of the telescope . \n the + z direction corresponds to the main beam peak direction and the ( x , y , z ) is a standard cartesian frame . as a conseguence , \n the top edge of the main reflector is at x @xmath1 750 mm and y@xmath1 0 mm on the contour plot coordinate system . \n we used the geometrical optics ( go ) and the geometrical theory of diffraction ( gtd ) on the sub reflector to calculate the total amplitude of the field incident on the surface of the primary mirror , in the reference system of the main beam . \n the contour plots show that , as expected , the illumination of the primary mirror is roughly elliptical . as a consequence \n the field amplitude on the primary mirror rim is not constant ( see figure [ fig : inc ] , left panel ) . \n the amplitudes of the field on the main reflector contour have been used to set the requirements on the edge taper values for all the lfi feed horn illuminations . \n the field amplitude on the mirror contour is a function of the @xmath2 angle ( @xmath3 ) , defined in the reference system of the main beam ( @xmath4 in the direction of the top edge of the main reflector and has a counterclockwise direction ) . \n the edge taper of each feed , at a reference angle ( 22@xmath0 or 24@xmath0 ) , has been chosen comparing the field amplitute , @xmath5 , with that corresponding to a _ \n worst reference _ case , @xmath6 , for which a full straylight analysis has been performed , showing acceptable contamination levels from the galactic emission @xcite . \n the edge taper correction of each feed horn , in order to assure a straylight rejection analogous to the reference case , was calculated by computing the lowest difference between the edge taper curve of each feed and the reference edge taper curve ( @xmath7 ) . \n we decrease by this difference the horn s edge taper at the reference angle and the results are reported in table [ tab : beams ] . in this way , for each lfi feed horn , no single point on the main reflector rim has an edge taper value lower than that of the reference case @xcite . \n polarization properties of the beams are mainly determined by the feed position and orientation in the focal plane unit . \n the lfi polarization properties have been optimized rotating each feed horn about its axis , in order to obtain the right orientation of the polarization direction of each beam . \n the polarized radiation in the far field is fully described by giving the projection of the electric field vector in two mutually orthogonal directions . \n far field amplitude radiation patterns reported here are given in the co and cross polar basis according to the ludwig s 3rd definition . \n the reference system in which each beam is computed has been rotated about their z axis in order to find out the main polarization direction on the sky . \n when this condition is reached , a well defined minimum appears in the crosspolar component , in corrispondence to the maximum of the copolar component ( see figure [ fig : inc ] ) .    6 , tech . rep . \n sci -

{"ContextTokens": 3139, "GeneratedTokens": 112, "SynthesizedBody": "lattice qcd has always been plagued by the fact that towards realistic quark masses the simulation costs increase drastically due to the large correlation lengths of the light states and the large lattice volumes that one employs in order to avoid finite - size ( fs ) effects . \n this difficulty has , in fact , prevented us until this day from carrying out simulations with truly physical parameters . \n instead one resorts to computations with several un - physically large quark masses in fs - effect - free volumes , followed by an extrapolation to the physical quark mass . \n however , the chiral extrapolation introduces uncertainties that can be reduced only by increasing the overlap of lattice simulations with chpt . \n it is thus inevitable to look out for feasible ways to obtain lattice results at light quark masses . \n current approaches like overlap , domain - wall or improved staggered fermions are still very costly , especially if one goes beyond the quenched approximation . \n faced with limited computer resources we therefore investigate the feasibility of an approach that restricts itself to the use of standard wilson fermions . \n the aim of the _ gral _ project is to carry out a systematic study of fs effects in the light hadron spectrum in the parameter regime accessible to us . with simulations on series of small to medium - sized lattice volumes ( at fixed coupling and quark mass , respectively ) we also want to address the issue of whether one can use formulae obtained from this investigation to extrapolate hadronic observables to the infinite volume . \n in 1983 m.  lscher published a universal field theoretic formula for the shift in the mass of a stable particle enclosed in a finite box  @xcite . \n the formula states for asymptotically large volumes that the fs mass - shift vanishes exponentially with increasing box size at a rate that depends on the particle considered and on the spectrum of light particles in the theory . \n if , in qcd , we consider a stable hadron in a box of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions and sufficiently large ( euclidian ) time - extent @xmath1 , its mass @xmath2 becomes a universal function of @xmath3 ( where , at fixed @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) in the finite - volume continuum limit . since fs effects probe the system at large distances and are thus insensitive to the form and magnitude of the uv cutoff , this function is expected to hold also for finite lattice spacings . with the ( constant ) lo chiral expression for the @xmath6-@xmath6 forward scattering amplitude the relative mass - shift for the pion \n is given by @xmath7    if we assume , for simplicity , the pion - nucleon forward scattering amplitude to be constant , too , then the formula for the nucleon involves a term that is  up to low -

{"ContextTokens": 2681, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has been the first practical realization of communication based on the laws of the quantum mechanics . as bennett and \n brassard showed with their pioneer protocol bb84 \n @xcite , nonorthogonal quantum states , together with an unjammable classical channel , can be used to prevent an eavesdropper ( eve ) from gaining information on the key without being revealed . \n there are already different working realizations of bb84  @xcite . \n some of them  @xcite exploit entanglement in polarization to encode a random string of bits in two unbiased polarization bases of a single photon , thus following the original proposal . however , polarization is not the most suitable degree of freedom for fiber communication because birefringence usually fluctuates randomly in a fiber , making the encoded information impossible to decode . \n the most appealing setup for real telecom communications is based on the phase degree of freedom .    as an example we consider the setup shown in the upper part of fig.[bb84 ] , that has been used for a qkd up to 30 km  @xcite . in this arrangement a relative phase @xmath0 between two time - bins of a photon state is realized by the sender ( alice ) with an unbalanced interferometer and a phase modulator . \n the receiver ( bob ) measures incoming bins by means of a second interferometer , matched to the sender s one , set to @xmath1 . with a probability of 50% the phase difference between alice and \n bob s interferometers will be @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and their measures will be correlated ; in the other half of cases measures will be discarded by the two users . \n schematics of two interferometers for bb84 . \n the upper one , in blue , has been used for qkd up to 30 km ; the lower one , in red , is the plug - and - play setup used for qkd up to 67 km . ] \n another realization of phase encoded qkd , namely the  plug - and - play \" setup  @xcite , is reported in the lower part of fig.[bb84 ] , and it has been used for qkd up to a distance of 67 km  @xcite . using an intense pulse , \n bob populates two time - bins with relative phase @xmath4 , and sends them to alice . \n alice applies a relative phase @xmath0 , reflects the pulses on a faraday mirror , let them pass through an attenuator , and sends them back to bob . \n the two pulses retrace in their backward path all the fluctuations they suffered in the forward path , thus arriving at bob s interferometer ready for being interferometrically revealed . as in the previous scheme bob sets at random @xmath1 , and \n measures the outcomes , completing the _ \n qkd run pertaining to bb84 . \n this mechanism of automatic compensation of noise earned this setup the name of  plug - and - play \" . \n recently bostrm and felbinger  @xcite presented a variant for qkd , and named it  ping - pong \" cryptography ( pp ) for its peculiarity of a forward and backward use of the quantum channel . \n this peculiarity seems to suit perfectly with the forward and backward dynamics typical of plug - and - play setups , as the one described above , and this motivated the present work . \n the main advantage of pp is the deterministic nature of its _ encoding - decoding _ procedure ; its main flow is that it has been proved to be not completely secure  @xcite . \n a number of variants , still based on the polarization degree of freedom of a photon , have been proposed to solve this problem , some making use of entanglement  @xcite , and others making no use of it  @xcite . \n we envisage here a protocol with phase - encoded information to have a secure , completely deterministic , quantum communication . \n a few variants and applications of the protocol are also discussed . \n the receiving user , bob , prepares a photon in a superposition of two time - bins with a relative phase @xmath5 randomly chosen between the values @xmath6 . \n he sends the photon to alice , the transmitting user , who chooses one of two possible tasks , _ control mode _ ( cm ) or _ message mode _ ( mm ) , with probability @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ; the former realizes a control on the security of the channel , the latter the deterministic communication between the users . \n alice encodes a bit of information with an unitary operation on the two time - bins : she can either apply the identity operation , choosing @xmath9 and encoding a ` 0 ' , or introduce a ` phase - flip ' , by applying a phase @xmath10 between the time - bins and encoding a ` 1 ' . \n the photon is sent back to bob who measures it with his apparatus set with the same phase @xmath5 he prepared initially . \n in this way bob s measurement is _ deterministic _ , because the initial phase of the state ( that he does know ) is changed by an amount of 0 or @xmath3 ; he can thus guess alice s operation without any needs of a classical channel . \n alice detects the photon with her interferometer randomly set to @xmath9 or @xmath11 . \n after that alice prepares a _ new photon state _ with a phase @xmath12 , and sends it back to bob who , analogously to what he did in mm , measures it with the same phase @xmath5 he prepared initially . \n we notice that if phase difference between bob s interferometer and alice s one is @xmath2 or @xmath3 then the two users share correlated information , while in the other two cases they do not . \n it is straightforward to realize that alice procedure in preparing the new photon let the two users interferometers to be necessarily correlated either in the forward path or in the backward one . \n this entails that the cm of our protocol results as deterministic as the mm is , thus achieving that doubling of the whole rate transmission we mentioned before . \n none of the qubits , neither destined to mm nor to cm , is discarded . \n given un unjammable public channel two users can exchange information in a secure manner by means of the above protocol . \n eve can try to gain information by inquiring the phase of the photon both on the forward and in the backward path ; alternatively , she can prevent bob from gaining information ( dos attack  @xcite ) by randomly measuring the state of the traveling photon ; finally , on a lossy channel , she can conceal her presence behind losses  @xcite . \n nevertheless no attack can remain undetected by the control procedure since it is akin to a bb84 check test , performed either on the forward path or on the backward one . \n this guarantees the protocol is unconditionally secure , as bb84 is , even if the security threshold may be different . \n our protocol gives a probability of 25% to detect dos attack as well as a general attack providing eve with full information . \n the practical implementation requires to gather the two interferometers of fig.[bb84 ] . \n the resulting scheme is shown in fig.[pppp84 ] : the upper interferometer is devoted to cm , the lower to mm , and they are connected by a 1x2 fiber - coupler . \n the signal prepared by bob goes at random into cm or into mm with probability @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . \n later on , when the photon is on the backward path , this device redirects it to bob .     final setup for deterministic plug - and - play cryptography . \n it merges the two interferometers of fig.1 , reported in blue ( cm ) and red ( mm ) . the black represents the common elements between the two , while the green indicates new components . \n an automatic switch between mm and cm is performed by a 1x2 coupler . ] \n the mm - interferometer resembles the one used for testing bb84 up to 67 km  @xcite . \n it is a typical plug - and - play scheme , with the unique difference that the attenuator is inserted just after the laser - diode ( ld ) , at bob s side . \n a laser pulse with a mean photon number much lower than unity goes through bob s interferometer and comes out into two time - bins with a relative phase @xmath5 and opposite polarizations . in the plug - and - play setup \n an intense pulse is sent to alice to provide a trigger signal for alice s electronics . in our case , as the pulse is already attenuated at bob s side , a further synchronization system , such as usually used in other practical qkd setup  @xcite , is necessary . \n after reflection on the faraday mirror , the photon travels back to bob , retracing exactly those paths that let him compensate any undesired phase : this makes unnecessary the stabilization of the polarization . eventually , raileigh backscattering is not a problem in this case because of the low value of the average photon number from the beginning of the protocol . \n the cm - interferometer resembles the one used for bb84 qkd up to a distance of 30 km  @xcite . as a time - polarization division technique \n is implemented , this task is sensible to random phase changes , and needs adjustments during the protocol runs . \n a value of @xmath13   rad / min for slow thermal drift in the interferometer was estimated , thus requiring a compensation step every @xmath14  @xcite . \n also in this case alice must synchronize her electronics with detectors , phase - modulator , and laser - diode using a suitable synchronization system . \n we proposed a setup that fully exploits the potentialities of the two - way unbalanced interferometers of certain implementations of bb84 to merge the features of plug - and - play setup for bb84 and ping - pong cryptography . \n the scheme is completely deterministic , both in the encoding - decoding procedure and in the control one , thus achieving a doubling in the rate of information transmission . \n it seems to be quite practical to implement since it is based on existing working implementations .    besides , due to its deterministic nature , several other advantages are available . \n bases revelation on the public channel is avoided , and this feature , together with a slightly different alice s preparation procedure during the cm , leads to a qkd more secure than that achieved by means of bb84  @xcite . \n furthermore a ` quantum direct communication ' ( qdc ) between users is also possible  @xcite . \n finally , we notice that once qdc is available also the novel protocol called ` quantum dialogue '  @xcite can be achieved : if alice delivered a message to bob by means of a secure qdc , then bob can use the message just received as the key of encryption of his answer , and simply communicate it to alice on the public channel .                    g. l. long and x. s. liu , phys . \n a * 65 * , 032302 ( 2002 ) ;

fock self - consistent field studies of many electron systems , see for example raimes @xcite . as an application of the results of this paper we use them for crude estimates of the energy of electrons moving in a cubic background of smeared out positive charge . \n in particular we compare the energies of delocalized electron states with those of localized states . when the density is small the localized states are found to have lower energy . \n this is the phenomenon of wigner crystallization @xcite . \n consider two electrons of charge @xmath15 in a cubic box with edges of length @xmath16 . \n assume that both electrons have constant charge density , @xmath17 in this box . \n the coulomb , electrostatic , interaction energy of these charge distributions is then : @xmath18 here @xmath19 denote the cubic boxes over which the integration variables , @xmath2 , take their values . \n we now introduce units so that @xmath20 . \n the integral can then be expressed in the form , @xmath21 which shows explicitly that this is a six - dimensional integral . \n nowadays we are spoilt by systems for doing mathematics by computer . \n it is therefore tempting to try these systems whenever some cumbersome integral arises , and frequently they do deliver sensible answers . for the integral ( [ eq.for.c.six.dim.explicit ] ) , however , those that i have tried fail . \n brute force ca nt handle the coulomb singularity . \n let us see what happens if we start by dividing each cube into @xmath0 sub - cubes : @xmath22 where the indices , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , run from 1 to @xmath25 . \n our integral can then be written as the sum , @xmath26 over @xmath27 terms , integrals over pairs of sub - cubes , @xmath28 for sufficiently large @xmath25 most integrals are over pairs of spatially separated sub - cubes and can be easily approximated . \n this leads to a brute force approach . \n fairly large contributions should , however , come from pairs of cubes that coincide or touch since they are strongly affected by the singularity . \n such an approach is clearly clumsy . \n the awkward singularity occurs only in the interior of those @xmath0 terms of this sum for which the integration sub - cubes are equal . \n if we thus write , @xmath29 where the terms with all three indices the same ( @xmath30 ) are excluded in the double sum , we see that the interior singularities occur in the first sum over coinciding sub - cubes . but these integrals are all identical and equal to , @xmath31 from formula ( [ eq.two.sums ] ) one thus gets , @xmath32 apart from being over a smaller cube , the integral @xmath33 is essentially like the original integral . in fact one easily finds the scaling property , @xmath34 using this equation ( [ eq.simp.sums ] ) becomes , @xmath35 solving for @xmath4 we thus finally have , @xmath36 here the original integral with its singularity has been written as a sum of @xmath37 integrals without ( interior ) singularities . \n the non -

electron pair repulsion terms . \n simplifying this gives the total energy @xmath58 the energy of this closed shell delocalized state should now be compared to the energy of the ferromagnetic localized state with the electrons in one corner each . \n we find , @xmath59 for the kinetic energy since all 8 electrons now sit in cubes ( octants ) of side @xmath60 . \n they are however alone in their corners ( octants ) so the pauli principle is automatically obeyed . \n the electrostatic energy becomes @xmath61 simplification of this using eq . \n ( [ eq.exact.expression ] ) gives the total energy @xmath62 if we introduce atomic units ( @xmath63 ) so that length is measured in units of the bohr radius we can plot the two energy curves , @xmath64 and get the results of fig . \n [ fig8 ] . \n finally we give the corresponding results for 16 electrons sharing orbitals pairwise . in the electrostatic energy one \n can then essentially change the particle charge @xmath15 to @xmath65 and add the contributions from the repulsion within the pairs . \n this gives the two curves , @xmath66 for the delocalized and localized energies respectively . \n these curves are plotted in fig . \n [ fig16 ] . \n one notes that the localized states always have lower electrostatic energy simply because in these states the electrons are better at avoiding each other . for small @xmath16-values \n the delocalized states always have lower energy because of the uncertainty principle . \n the curves in these plots resemble those of wigner @xcite who predicted that localization gives lower energy in metals at low densities \n . this phenomenon is called wigner crystallization . \n i am not aware of any comparable study of the electrostatic interaction energies of homogeneous cubic charge distributions . \n the algebraic and combinatoric tricks used to eliminate the coulomb singularities in the integrals seem partly new , as well as the result of eq . \n ( [ eq.result.for.the.four ] ) . \n it is possible that these ideas can be generalized to more general integration problems involving the coulomb singularity . \n it is a further bonus that these insights into the electrostatics of cubes and their sub -

{"ContextTokens": 2542, "GeneratedTokens": 161, "SynthesizedBody": "graphene is the two dimensional form of carbon with novel structural , optical and electrical properties that make it a promising material for device applications@xcite . \n graphene can be accessed as a single sheet of carbon atoms , monolayer graphene(mlg ) or as two stacked sheets of carbon atoms , bilayer graphene(blg ) . \n both types of graphene are gapless semiconductors . \n mlg has a linear band structure and the charge carriers can have very high mobility exceeding 200,00 @xmath0/vs@xcite . \n this high mobility which greatly exceeds the values found in si opens the way to new type of electronic devices from mlg . \n however , these high values of mobility are only found in suspended samples implying that supported samples have sources of scattering which limits their mobility . \n blg , on the other hand , has a parabolic band structure and a quadratic energy dispersion . \n because of the reduced symmetry of the blg , applying an electric field perpendicular to the plane of blg opens a band gap . \n this band gap tunability makes blg a very promising material for digital electronics applications@xcite . \n the isolation of mlg and blg from graphite , the three dimensional form of carbon , gave rise to the field of graphene experiments and theory . \n the exfoliated sheets are then studied by depositing them on a silicon dioxide substrate . \n graphene can also be prepared by epitaxy on silicon carbide substrates@xcite , irridium@xcite and ruthenium@xcite as well as chemical vapor deposition growth on copper@xcite and nickel@xcite . \n every technique has its own advantages and disadvantages . \n epitaxial graphene needs to be delocalized enough from the substrate to be useful for nanoelectronic devices . \n however , these growth techniques tend to provide much larger samples than the exfoliation technique , up to wafer size in the case of silicon carbide which is useful for commercial applications . \n current growth techniques produce large samples which are not uniform in thickness and show reduced quality compared to exfoliated samples . \n exfoliated graphene has been shown to have intrinsic ripples and not be atomically flat @xcite . \n these ripples can influence the electronic properties by changing the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude . \n this variation in the hopping amplitude leads to a shift in the electrochemical potential and hence the dirac point @xcite . \n exfoliating graphene on silicon dioxide substrates leads to random charged impurities on the sheet due to impurities trapped between the oxide layer and graphene sheet . \n these impurities also influence the electrical properties of graphene and may be the source of the reduced mobility in supported samples . to examine the effect of ripples and charged impurities on exfoliated mlg and blg \n we have performed measurements using a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) . \n mechanical exfoliation of graphene , a seemingly simple but intricate technique @xcite was used to prepare our samples . \n graphene flakes were then transferred to the sio@xmath1 substrate . \n ti / au electrodes were deposited on the graphene using a shadow mask technique described elsewhere @xcite . \n the use of a shadow mask for the electrodes eliminates the need to use pmma as a resist which is a possible source of charged impurities . eliminating the pmma \n has also been seen to increase the cleanliness of the graphene devices . \n this is evidenced by atomic resolution topography of freshly prepared samples without the need for high temperature cleaning . \n the cleanliness is also seen in an improved mobility in samples fabricated with the shadow mask technique . \n the samples were transferred to the ultrahigh vacuum ( p @xmath2 mbar ) stm and cooled to 4.6 k. electrochemically etched tungsten tips were used for imaging and spectroscopy . \n these tips were checked on a au surface to ensure a constant density of states prior to measurements on graphene . \n figure 1(a ) shows the setup for scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on graphene flakes . \n the voltage is applied to the tip attached to the piezo tube and the sample is grounded . \n stm images show the hexagonal lattice characteristic of mlg @xcite and the triangular lattice for blg @xcite as shown in fig . \n 1(c ) and 1(b ) respectively . \n blg shows a triangular lattice because the two layers of carbon atoms reduce the symmetry of the graphene and therefore only one of the two sublattices is visible . \n we have recorded the local density of states for both mlg and blg with di / dv point spectroscopy measurements . here \n the tip is fixed at a definite position on the sample , the feedback loop is deactivated and the sample voltage is ramped within an energy window \n . an ac modulation voltage of 5 mv rms , 570 hz is applied to the tip and the resulting di / dv spectrum is recorded using lockin detection . \n 1(d ) shows one such di / dv spectrum for blg while the results for mlg are in fig . \n the minimum of each spectrum corresponds to the local dirac point . in the blg , \n this minimum clearly occurs away from the fermi energy which is at 0.0 v. this is evidence that the local electrochemical potential has shifted but the origin of this shift is not clear without further analysis as discussed below . \n previous stm studies have shown that in case of mlg impurities @xcite and phonons @xcite influence the charge - carrier scattering mechanisms in graphene . \n there has also been the observation of electron and hole puddles due to localized charged regions of the mlg.@xcite . however , the connection between the localized charge puddles and the topography of the graphene has not been firmly established . \n here we have measured the spatial variation of the dirac point in order to correlate it with the local topography . \n figure 2(a ) shows the topography recorded for a 100 nm @xmath3 100 nm area of mlg . for this area , \n spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a 1 nm @xmath3 1 nm grid with an energy resolution of 5 mev . \n these measurements were used to create a local density of states ( ldos ) map . from this map , we have calculated the shift of the dirac point at each point based on the minimum in the density of states . \n the energy shift of the dirac point as a function of position is plotted in fig . \n the bright regions correspond to a positive shift and the dark regions represent a negative shift . \n the average shift is 88 mv and the standard deviation of the shift is 84 mv . \n the average shift indicates that the dirac point is shifted away from the fermi energy while the variation indicates the strength of the puddles . \n the spatial extent of the puddles is approximately 8 - 15 nm in size . \n these sizes match well with the roughness of the sio@xmath1 substrate @xcite . \n theory calculations have predicted that the ripples in graphene generate an electrochemical potential which varies as the square of the local curvature of the graphene flake @xcite . to investigate the influence of ripples in our measurements \n , we used the topography image ( fig . \n 2(a ) ) to calculate the curvature of the graphene and thereby get a map of the electrochemical potential generated by the ripples \n . then we carried out a cross correlation of this electrochemical potential with the map of the dirac point shift ( fig . \n the cross correlation image is shown in fig . \n if the shift in our measurements were to be a consequence of the ripples , it would be manifested as a peak in the center of the cross correlation image . \n however there is no peak or any structure in the cross correlation image ( fig . \n 2(c ) ) . in all locations \n the degree of correlation , r@xmath4 is less than 0.5@xmath5 . \n this indicates that there is no correlation between the topography and the dirac point shift in the case of mlg . \n we have repeated the analysis for blg . \n figure 3(a ) shows the topography for a 60 nm @xmath3 60 nm area of blg . \n spectroscopy measurements were taken on a 0.6 nm @xmath3 0.6 nm grid with a 5 mev energy resolution . \n figure 3(b ) shows the plot of the shift of the dirac point . here \n the average shift is -44 mv and the standard deviation of the shift is 27 mv . \n the size scale of the puddles is once again approximately 8 - 15 nm . \n similar to mlg , we have calculated the curvature and electrochemical potential variation from the topography image . \n this image is then cross correlated with the dirac point shift image to produce fig . \n once again the two images show no correlation as the correlation coefficient for the unshifted images is approximately the same as for any shift of the two images . \n we have mapped the dirac point by spatially resolved spectroscopy for monolayer and bilayer graphene using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy . using cross correlation \n we have shown that there is no correlation between the topography and spectroscopy images for monolayer and bilayer graphene . \n therefore , we can rule out curvature as the mechanism for creating the shift in the electrochemical potential . \n hence , we attribute the shift of the dirac point to random charged impurities . \n a recent technique of making graphene on mica substrates instead of silicon dioxide seems promising in terms of reducing the ripples @xcite . \n spectroscopy measurements need to be carried out with exfoliated graphene on mica substrates to check the effect of impurities . \n further studies can also be done on suspended graphene devices where the amount of ripples increases but the oxide substrate is no longer present . \n more efforts are necessary in this direction to develop an ideal substrate for using graphene in nanoelectronic devices . \n ad and bjl acknowledge the support of the u. s. army research laboratory and the u. s. army research office under contract / grant number w911nf-09 - 1 - 0333 and national science

lac objects . gamma rays from mkn501 around 100mev to 10gev was not observed by the cgro egret detector(@xcite ) , however , emission in the tev energy region were discovered by the whipple telescope ( @xcite ) and confirmed by the hegra telescopes ( @xcite ) . \n detailed study of gamma rays from agn will give us information about the environment surrounding the huge black hole located at the center of the agn , and the high energy phenomena and particle acceleration in the jet . \n the time scale of the intensity variations of the tev gamma rays may explain the particle acceleration site is close to the black holes . \n tev gamma rays from such extragalactic object interacts with the infrared background photons , and a cutoff of the energy spectrum is expected around 7 - 15tev(@xcite ) . \n there is an ambiguity in the prediction of the cutoff energy due to the uncertainty of the number density of infrared photons . in the discovery stage , \n the intensity in the tev energy range was very small , corresponding to 8% of the crab nebula flux , however , from mar 1997 it increased dramatically and variated from 0.3 to 4 crab flux . \n it is found that the variation of the intensities are larger in the tev range than x - ray and other ranges(@xcite ) . \n these flares are observed by whipple , hegra , cat , tactic and the telescope array prototype ( tap ) ( @xcite ) . \n the flares were continuously observed until the end of july 1997 . \n here we will report the details of the mkn501 observations by tap . \n the telescope array prototype detector @xcite , a seven telescope array is under construction at utah , dugway . \n its geographical position is @xmath0 n , @xmath1 w at an altitude of 1600 m above sea level . \n the prototype detector works in dual modes : the cherenkov and the air fluorescence mode . \n construction started in the summer of 1996 , and currently three telescopes with the respective separation of 120 m are in operation . \n the seven telescopes will be arranged in a hexagonal grid with a separation of 70 m to maximize the detection efficiency of tev gamma rays . \n each telescope is the alt - azimuth mount with a 6m@xmath2 main dish . \n the main dish consists of 19 hexagonal shape segmented mirrors coated with anodized aluminum . \n the reflectivity of mirrors are about 90% at wave length of 400 nm . at the focal plane , \n a high resolution imaging camera of 256ch photomultipliers is installed to measure detailed images of cherenkov light from gamma rays and cosmic rays . \n the cherenkov light images are used to distinguish the gamma rays from the huge number of background cosmic rays . \n the typical cosmic - ray rate is about 1000/min and the gamma - ray rate from the crab nebula is about 0.5/min ( @xcite ) with three telescopes . \n therefore rejection of cosmic ray background events using the shape parameter of the cherenkov light is essential to obtain a reasonable s / n ratio in this experiment , and we use the techniques originally developed by the whipple group ( @xcite ) . \n the absolute pointing accuracy of the telescopes is typically 1 arcmin which is frequently calibrated by imaging bright stars . \n the signals from the 256ch camera are amplified just behind the camera in order to minimize electric noise and to obtain better timing resolution , and are then fed to adc and tdc modules mounted at the telescope base to measure the amplitude and the timing after passing through 10 m of twisted pair cables . the triggering requirement to record \n the event is four folds out of 256 tubes . \n the threshold of the discriminators are set at 5 photoelectron level . \n the single counting rates in each tube are set to 3 - 5khz in each channel . \n the threshold energy for detectable gamma rays is 600 gev for vertical showers . \n the mkn501 was observed with the raster scan tracking mode . in this mode \n , the telescope tracking center scans the sqaure region of @xmath3 in right ascension and declination coordinate centered on the target . \n there are several advantages in this method compared with the conventional on - source / off - source tracking mode . \n the on - source and off - source sky region can be observed simultaneously . \n the systematics of the imaging devices can be reduced significantly . by observing the bright star images , \n the calibration of the telescope absolute direction can be done with the accuracy of @xmath4 . \n our telescopes will be described in more detail elsewhere . \n this observation of mkn501 was carried out from the end of march to the end of july , 1997 . \n we observed a total number of 47 nights for a total observation time of 105.4 hrs . \n we have observed 3,400,000 events in the f.o.v . of @xmath5 around mkn501 , which are mainly cosmic - ray protons and helium nuclei . in the analysis \n , we have limited the zenith angle to the range of @xmath6 to @xmath7 in order to reduce the systematic errors in the energy and the aperture estimates . \n this leaves 2,160,000 events and 64.0 hrs of live time , with an average event rate of 9.4hz with three telescopes . among these events \n , we selected gamma ray candidates using the shape parameters of cherenkov images and their directionality . \n we can determine the arrival direction of gamma rays and the cosmic rays with an accuracy of @xmath8 ( the elliptical errors ) in each event . \n therefore , 97% of the background events around the target , say within @xmath9 , can be rejected . \n the cosmic rays show larger images than gamma rays , and they are rejected with 95% efficiency through the image selection . \n therefore , typically 99.95 % of the background events around the target are rejected with the image and the arrival direction using the present analysis method . \n 35 % of the gamma rays remain through this process . therefore , even if the original @xmath10 is bad as @xmath11 , we can obtain @xmath10 of order @xmath12 . \n at first , the clean cherenkov images are obtained by removing the background photons with the timing information . \n the signal timings of each photomultipliers are recorded with an accuracy of 1nsec . \n the cherenkov light signals from gamma rays and cosmic rays are concentrated within a 10 nsec interval , however noise including the photons from star light and the air glow are randomly distributed in time . therefore we require a timing alignment with a software gate set at 40 nsec . \n then we require the clustering of hit tubes , geometry . \n after these selections , the chance coincidence events due to the random coincidence are completely rejected and the pure cherenkov events induced by gamma rays and cosmic rays remain . \n then , the image parameters are calculated : signal size size , the centroide position of images ( x , y ) , width , length and conc . \n the events with images located near the camera boundary are cut by requiring the condition @xmath13 , because the images near the camera boundary are distorted due to the boundary . \n the gamma rays show the compact images compared with the hadronic showers , so we then selected the events which has a smaller width and length region similar to what is predicted by a monte carlo simulation . \n we select events with the following conditions , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to 30% and 50% of the points obtained by integrating the width distribution from off - source events ( hadron events ) . \n the typical values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and they naturally contain the zenith angle dependencies and the weather conditions , and we could obtain the constant fraction of data as gamma ray candidates . \n the size of 400 corresponds to the the average value of size . \n the second terms ( 0.020 and 0.023 ) represent the size dependence of the images as predicted by the monte carlo simulation . \n the parameter @xmath20 corresponds to the light concentration , as gamma ray showers have a higher light concentration than hadronic showers . \n after these selections , 8 - 10% of events remain . finally , we select for gamma ray showers using the directional information obtained by the asymmetry of shower images . \n we select for events which develop from neighbouring of the target source to outer direction . \n finally , 97% of the hadronic showers are rejected and 30 - 40% of gamma rays are selected . after these cuts we obtained the excess of @xmath21 from the direction of mkn501 . \n the monthly excesses in the alpha distribution are shown in figure 1 . \n the absolute gain calibration is carried out by the measurement of a single photoelectron . \n we found that a single photoelectron corresponds to 4 adc counts . \n the relative gain of each channel of 256ch is adjusted to within 5% accuracy using the led pulsar . \n we confirmed that the @xmath22 distribution observed is consistent with the simulated showers assuming the cosmic ray energy spectra in each composition . \n the uncertainty of the absolute gain or the @xmath22 and the energy relation is estimated as to be 20% . with a monte carlo simulation \n , we can determine the effective area for gamma rays and hadrons , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . \n we also obtain experimentally the number of the excess events @xmath25 , and number of background events @xmath26 . in order to minimize the systematic errors \n , we took the ratio @xmath27 . \n the denominator @xmath28 has a weak dependence on size with our imaging selection of approximately @xmath29 . \n the energy and the @xmath22 relations for gamma rays and hadrons are determined by our monte carlo simulation to be @xmath30 tev and @xmath31 tev , respectively . \n then we can obtain the gamma ray energy spectrum from @xmath32 . \n the derived energy spectrum is shown in the figure 2 . \n . the differential energy spectrum can be well fit with the power law spectrum of index -2.5 up to 5 tev . \n the spectrum becomes steeper above 5tev which may suggest a cutoff of the energy spectrum . \n however , it is possible that statistical fluctuations may make this effect . \n we need more statistics to obtain conclusive results . \n the saturation of the photomultipliers , the amplifiers , and the adc is considered to occur at higher energy , above 30 tev . \n we could minimize this saturation effect by the above ratio method . \n the observation of the mkn501 was carried out for 47 nights from the end of march to the end of july . \n the gamma ray event rate is plotted as a function of mjd in figure 3 . for reference , \n the gamma ray rate from the crab nebula measured by our detectors is shown by a horizontal line . \n the event rate was highly variable day by day , and the maximum event rate was about 4 crab and the minimum rate was @xmath34 crab . \n the time scale of the intensity change was about a few days . \n we searched for a short time variation of the intensity but we could not find clear evidence of any short time variation in our data set . \n we can see high states and low states clearly in our data set . \n this feature ( the time scale and the intensity change ) in april and in july appear to be similar , showing `` u '' shapes , and the interval of the two high states are 14 days and 12 days . \n may and june data each show only one high state `` @xmath35 '' shapes . in order to examine the periodicity in the data set , the data shifted by 25.5 days are superposed in the bottom pannel of figure 3 . \n we can see good coincidence of the high states . \n this test suggests a @xmath36 day periodicity . \n the periodicity of the gamma ray intensities was examined by the rayleigh test . \n we calculated the powers ( amplitude when fitting sinusoidal function ) in each test period from 5 days to 45 days . in order to evaluate the significance in each test period , \n we have generated @xmath37 data set artificially by shuffling the relation of ( @xmath38 , mjd ) , where @xmath38 is 47 flux points in figure 3 . \n ( these data set also has the same gaps in the observation time . ) \n they are analyzed in the same way as the real data set . by comparing the amplitude of the real data set with the amplitude distribution of the generated @xmath37 data sets , we can estimate the probability of the appearance of observed amplitude in each test period . with this method \n we could remove the spurious effect ( the gaps in the observations making the false periodicities ) , and succeed to obtain the chance probability . \n figure 4 shows the obtained chance probability as a function of the test period . \n we can see prominent peak at 12.7 days with the chance probability of less than @xmath39 . \n this period corresponds to a half of the period obtained in the simple test mentioned above . \n we obtained the differential energy spectrum of the gamma rays from mkn501 . \n it shows a possible cutoff feature above 5 - 7 tev . \n this cutoff is predicted to be caused by the interaction with the infrared photons or the the limit of the electron acceleration in the jet . \n the cutoff energy of the gamma rays due to the infrared photon interaction from the distance of the mkn501 , z=0.034 is estimated 7 tev to 15 tev by @xcite .    in the time variation of the gamma ray intensities \n , we found a periodicity , which may be a quasi periodic oscillation . the observed periodicity corresponds to 12.7 days or 25.5 days . \n the relationship of this periodicity with high energy phenomena around the massive black holes could be influenced by factors including the precession of the jet , and the rotation of the black hole(s ) . \n r. protheroe ( @xcite ) suggested the interaction of the shock wave and the helical structure of the jet may cause this observed type of periodicity . \n authors would like to thanks to j.como , a.larsen , r.smith , f.misak , l.sutton , d.gardener , s.davis , c.davis , j.parry and b.larsen for their contribution to our experiment in usa . \n this project is supported by the grant aid ( # 07247102 ) and aid ( # 08041096 ) by monbushou ( the ministry of education and science ) and also partly supported by the science research promotion fund of japan private school promotion foundation .", "StartTimeOffset": 2310395810696, "RequestID": "cdcd9e0dbfa24675b0ae05e299b9c381", "TotalTokens": 3908}

terminal agn shocks ) . \n the non  thermal radiation is emitted in strongly collisionless shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n despite their importance and universality collisionless shocks are poorly understood . \n the non  thermal radiation is believed to be emitted in the shock by relativistic particles accelerated by strong electromagnetic fields . \n naturally this fact poses the questions which mechanism is responsible for the electromagnetic field and how are the particles accelerated to the ultra \n relativistic energies implied by observations . in @xcite @xcite suggested that the weibel or two stream instability was responsible for creating a strong magnetic field in the shock interface . \n it was recently confirmed numerically in computer experiments using particle  in  cell ( pic ) codes . \n [ @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ] . \n @xcite @xcite ] showed that the magnetic field reaches an energy content of a few per cent of the equipartition value . \n fermi acceleration has , so far , been used to explain the existence of a power law distributed non  thermal electron population . \n it has been shown to occur in test particle monte carlo simulation under assumptions of the structure of the magnetic field ; but as pointed out by @xcite ( 2004 ) , to further the progress , self consistent models taking into account the back reaction and the detailed microphysics has to be made . \n recently , @xcite ( 2004 ) showed that particle distribution functions ( pdfs ) inferred from grb observations are in conflict with those predicted by fermi theory and diffusive shock acceleration . in this proceeding we report on 3d pic models , also presented in @xcite , of counter streaming plasma shells as a description of the shock interface in grb afterglows . \n to perform the numerical experiments we use a relativistic 3d pic code as described in @xcite ( 2004 ) that works from first principles by solving the full maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field and move the particles according to the lorentz force . \n we set up two counter streaming ion election populations in the rest frame of the densest population . \n the density jump is 3 . \n the inflow lorentz boost of the less dense population is @xmath0 ( run i ) and @xmath1 ( run ii ) in the two experiments , that we report on here . the boundaries are periodic in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 direction , transverse to the flow , and open in the @xmath4 direction parallel with the flow . \n the box sizes are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . \n the electron skin depth is @xmath7 and @xmath8 grid zones respectively , and we use a mass ratio of @xmath9 to resolve both the ion and the electron dynamics . \n we use 16 particles per cell and our boxes contained almost @xmath10 particles . \n the plasmas are initially unmagnetised and cold ( @xmath11 ) . \n in the computer experiments we see how the inter penetrating jets undergo the two  stream instability . \n first , the electrons , being the lighter particles , collect into caustic surfaces and then current channels ; in accordance with the linear theory @xcite . then they reach a non  linear saturation point and the channels simply merge forming thicker and thicker channels . when the magnetic field becomes strong enough the heavier ions are deflected into the magnetic voids between the channels and start undergo the two  stream instability too . \n since the ion instability is catalysed by the electron instability the initial growth rate depends on the electron instability growth rate . when the caustic surfaces of the ions collapse into current channels the electrons , being the lighter particles , are heated and scattered by the magnetic field of the ion channels . \n attracted by the electric potential of the ion channels the electrons start to debye shield channels . \n the debye shielding quenches the electron channels , while at the same time it supports the ion channels . \n the large random velocities of the electrons allow the ion channels to keep sustaining strong magnetic fields . \n this is qualitatively different from the case of a pair plasma , where no shielding mechanism operates . \n the evolution is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . to the left \n we see the initial electron dominated phase , while to the right  further downstream in the shock  the ions dominate the dynamics forming dense ion channels ; the more diffuse electrons shielding the channels , and the resulting transverse magnetic field indicated with arrows . \n the efficiency of conversion of the injected kinetic to magnetic energy , @xmath12 , is around one per cent . \n the full extent of the plasma dynamics operating in collisionless shocks is still not known , but in @xcite ( 2004 ) it was estimated that for a mass ratio @xmath13 of 16 and inflow lorentz boost @xmath1 ( run ii ) the ion channels would survive over 1500 ion skin depths . \n we speculate that with a more realistic mass ratios the debye shielding would be more effective and therefore the ion channels would survive over even larger scales .    , \n at distances less than a debye length from the ion channels electrons are subject to a transverse acceleration towards the ions since the electric field is not fully neutralised . \n there also exists a strong magnetic field and in total this translates into a two component transverse oscillation and acceleration along the flow direction . \n it was shown by @xcite ( 2004 ) that the ion channels are distributed according to a power law and later @xcite ( 2005 ) , showed that this is a consequence of the self similarity in the process of merging ion channels . the acceleration a debye shielding electron receives depends on the size of the ion channel . as a direct consequence of the power law distributed ion channels \n the electron pdf obtain a non  thermal energy tail as shown in fig . \n this is a local acceleration mechanism , that only depends on the local electromagnetic field . because the electrons are decelerated when moving away from the channel ; the principal energy losses are radiative ( e.g.  bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and jitter radiation ) . \n it also implies that no high energy electrons are available for recursive acceleration processes through this mechanism . \n we have confirmed this by an exhaustive search through a representative dataset of @xmath14 particles . by tracking back and forth in time \n we found only @xmath15 possible candidate particles , that had managed to escape retaining their energy . \n it happened at places where the ion channel made sudden bends and mergers and the electromagnetic fields were not well approximated as static fields . \n none of them showed any sign of recursive acceleration . \n downstream of the shock in run ii . \n the dot  dashed line is a power law fit to the non thermal high energy tail . \n the dashed curve is a lorentz boosted thermal electron population . \n [ fig3],width=264 ] \n in this contribution we have presented the results of self consistent pic computer experiments of collisionless shocks . \n we have shown how the two  stream instability naturally generates a highly intermittent dominantly transverse magnetic field containing a few per cent of the equipartition energy . \n the extent of the two stream instability in the case of an ion  electron plasma is unknown ; it clearly depends on the inflow lorentz boost , the density jump and the mass ratio . for @xmath1 a density jump of 3 and an electron  ion mass ratio 16 @xcite ( 2004 ) estimated the instability to be sustained up to 1500 ion skin depths . for realistic mass ratios this could be closer to @xmath16 ion depths . in the neighbourhood of the ion structures electrons \n are continuously accelerated and decelerated . \n the mechanism is local and the power law distributed pdf is created is situ . \n hence the observed radiation may be tied directly to the local conditions of the plasma . in this experiment with @xmath1 \n we found a power law index of @xmath17 . \n the mechanism does not rule out fermi acceleration . \n the lack of evidence in our numerical experiment for any recursive acceleration processes can be due to the limited extent of the simulated region . \n it may , though , overcome some of the difficulties pointed out by @xcite ( 2004 ) . \n @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 should not be understood as free parameters . to unravel the dependence on the outflow velocity and density jump a parameter study or better theoretical understanding of the non \n linear evolution is needed . \n it is also clear that the non  thermal electron acceleration , the ion current channels and the magnetic field generation are beyond an mhd description and techniques respecting the full phase  space description of the plasma is needed to further the understanding of collisionless shocks .", "StartTimeOffset": 2329168432233, "RequestID": "666978e277744423b314a3253fdb496b", "TotalTokens": 2375}

{"ContextTokens": 3821, "GeneratedTokens": 273, "SynthesizedBody": "a common challenge for quantum field theorists consists in finding accurate methods in regimes where existing expansions break down . in the rg language , this amounts to find acceptable interpolations for the rg flows in intermediate regions between fixed points . in the case of scalar field theory , the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential suppression of the large field configurations operating at strong coupling . \n this problem can be cured by introducing a large field cutoff @xmath2 which eliminates dyson s instability . \n one is then considering a slightly different problem , however a judicious choice of @xmath2 can be used to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy with the original problem ( i. e. , the problem with no field cutoff ) . \n this optimization procedure can be approximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and naturally bridges the gap between the weak and strong coupling expansions . \n the workshop on qcd in extreme environments was held right after the lattice 2004 conference . \n the talk of k. wilson about the early days of lattice gauge theory was a very inspirational moment of lattice 2004 . \n he stressed the importance of , in his own words , `` butchering field theory '' in the development of the rg ideas and recommended that we keep doing it . in the following \n , we will be butchering field theory in the space of field configurations . \n we are interested in the effects of a large field cutoff on observables ( we expect the effect to be small if the field cutoff is large enough and the observable is not a product of too many fields ) and on the coeffients of the perturbative series for the observables ( we expect the effect to be drastic for the large order behavior ) . for scalar fields , \n there are many ways to accomplish this task . \n the configurations can be ranked according to the largest absolute value of the field or according to the average over the sites of even powers of the field . \n the larger the power is , the more emphasis is put on the configurations with the largest field values . as one may suspect , there exists correlations among the results obtained with different cutoff procedures . for gauge theory , we can define the concept of small or large field configurations in the landau gauge and in a gauge invariant way . \n this was one of the questions that we discussed at lattice 2004 and an account can be found in ref . \n @xcite . instead of duplicating \n , we will rather give an elementary discussion of our motivations and existing results in the scalar case and explain how we expect to extend them in the gauge case . \n recent progress are briefly discussed at the end . \n the best way to understand why the perturbative series of @xmath4 problems in various dimensions generically have a zero radius radius of convergence is to consider the integral @xmath5 the peak of the integrand of the r.h.s . \n moves too fast when the order increases . \n more precisely , @xmath6 is maximum at @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . \n the truncation of @xmath9 at order @xmath10 is accurate provided that @xmath11 . a good accuracy in the region where the integrand is maximum requires @xmath12 , which implies @xmath13 . \n note also that the exponential function converges uniformly over a finite interval but _ not _ over @xmath14 and consequently one can not interchange the sum and the integral . \n on the other hand , if we introduce a field cutoff , the peak moves outside of the integration range and we get a converging expansion @xmath15 in general we expect that for a finite lattice , the partition function @xmath16 calculated with a field cutoff is convergent and @xmath17 has a finite radius of convergence . \n the problem with the field cut differs from the original problem but the difference can be made exponentially small . \n the method works well in nontrivial examples . \n this has been checked @xcite for the hierarchical model and in the continuum for quantum mechanical problems ( the anharmonic oscillator and the double - well potential ) . \n in this section , we describe graphical representations of the accuracy reached at different orders in perturbation theory . \n we typically want to know the number of ( correct ) significant digits that can be obtained at a given order for a given coupling . \n three situations are represented in fig . \n [ fig : sd ] . for @xmath18 \n , the accuracy always increases when we increase the order . in the case of @xmath19 , \n this is the case only if @xmath20 and the lines have a focus point at @xmath21 . on the other hand , for the integral discussed in the previous section , \n the lines move left as they rotate and one sees an envolope that delimitates a `` forbidden region '' for the accuracy of perturbation theory . at fixed and not too large coupling , the accuracy first increases and then decreases with the order . \n the `` rule of thumb '' consists in stopping when the accuracy is optimal , in other words , when we reached the envelope discussed above . \n note also that the lines flatten near 14 on the left of the graph . \n this simply reflects that we have only 14 digits of accuracy in our numerical calculation of the integral . \n ( upper left ) and @xmath22 ( upper right ) , and orders 1 , 2 , ... , 20 for the integral discussed in section 2 ( lower ) . as the order increases , the lines `` rotate '' clockwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]    ( upper left ) and @xmath22 ( upper right ) , and orders 1 , 2 , ... , 20 for the integral discussed in section 2 ( lower ) . as the order increases , the lines `` rotate '' clockwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]    ( upper left ) and @xmath22 ( upper right ) , and orders 1 , 2 , ... , 20 for the integral discussed in section 2 ( lower ) . as the order increases , the lines `` rotate '' clockwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    when a field cut is introduced , the series apparently become convergent and we can make a significant , but localized in coupling , incursion in the forbidden region of perturbation theory . \n this is illustrated for three different field cuts in fig . \n [ fig : cutanh ] in the case of the ground state of the anharmonic oscillator .    in an ideal world \n , we would pick a field cut large enough to reduce the errors ( due to the field cut ) to an acceptable level . \n we would then calculate enough terms in order to reach an accuracy consistent with this level . in practice , \n we are usually limited to calculations up to a certain order . \n the field cut can then be chosen in order to minimize the error at that order . from fig . \n [ fig : cutanh ] , one can see that it is possible to pick a cut that makes the accuracy optimal in the neighborhood of some given value of the coupling @xmath23 . when the numerical answer is known , it is easy to adjust the field cut in order to optimize the accuracy . \n when the answer is not known , one can use an approximation . in ref . \n @xcite , we showed that for the integral eq . \n ( 1 ) , the strong coupling expansion can be used to determine approximately the optimal field cut . this way strong and weak coupling expansions can be combined coherently .    up to now \n , we have defined the field cut locally in configuration space ( at each lattice site ) . \n it is however possible to proceed differently and to use the average of even powers of the fields to sort the configurations . \n there exist correlations among these indicators @xcite . \n we now report our attempts to extend the modification of perturbation theory discussed above in the scalar case to lgt . \n perturbation theory for lgt has been developed almost 20 years ago @xcite . \n exact calculations up to 3 loops @xcite and numerical calculations for 8 @xcite and 10 loops @xcite are available . \n it proceeds in 3 steps .    1 .   with the convention @xmath24 , we set @xmath25 at every link . \n we extend the range of integration of @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( anything else would be unpratical ! ) 3 . \n we then expand in powers of @xmath28    in step 2 , we added the integration `` tails '' . \n this presumably makes the series nonconvergent ( asymptotic )

multiple coverage of the manifold as shown in fig . \n [ fig : haar2 ] . \n the logarithm of the haar measure is also used in the context of gluon equations of state @xcite .    . \n the ground state of the double - well potential @xmath42 can be expanded in powers of @xmath43 . except for the zeroth order contribution , \n all the coeffients of the series are negative and their magnitude grow

\n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : dwcut ] where the modified series allows us to go above the instanton envelope . \n we expect to be able to achieve similar results for @xmath0 . \n in particular , we expect to be able to use the strong coupling expansion to obtain an optimal choice of field cut , since the validity of this expansion seems to extend close to the scaling window . \n [ fig : strong ] indicates that the radius of convergence of the strong coupling expansion is between 4 and 6 for @xmath49 . \n this series was calculated using the expansion of the free energy of ref . \n at the time of the workshop , we presented results related to the questions discussed below . \n since our understanding has evolved in the meantime , we will give a brief summary and refer to recent preprints for more details . \n we have attempted to follow the same procedure as for the scalar models , for gauge models using the landau gauge where @xmath51 should play a role analogous to @xmath52 in scalar models . \n we found correlations between the lattice average of this quantity and the average action . \n however , we found no correlations between the average and the maximum value . \n these results are explained in more detail in the proceedings of lattice 2004 @xcite . \n the lack of correlation is due to the imperfect way the landau gauge condidtion is implemented numerically . \n this is being remedied @xcite . \n we considered wilson s @xmath46 lattice gauge theory ( without fermions ) at negative values of @xmath53 and for @xmath54=2 or 3 . \n we showed that in the limit @xmath55 , the path integral is dominated by configurations where links variables are set to a nontrivial element of the center on selected non intersecting lines . for @xmath56 , \n these configurations can be characterized by a unique gauge invariant set of variables , while for @xmath57 a multiplicity growing with the volume as the number of configurations of an ising model is observed . in general , there is a discontinuity in the average plaquette when @xmath43 changes its sign which prevents us from having a convergent series in @xmath43 for this quantity . for @xmath56 , \n a change of variables relates the gauge invariant observables at positive and negative values of @xmath49 . for @xmath57 \n , we derived an identity relating the observables at @xmath49 with those at @xmath49 rotated by @xmath58 in the complex plane and showed numerical evidence for a ising like first order phase transition near @xmath59 . \n so far we see no obvious connections to the known singularities @xcite . \n these results are discussed in more detail in a recent preprint @xcite . for another approach of problems at negative coupling \n @xcite . \n we revisited the question of the convergence of lattice perturbation theory for a pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions . using the most recent calculation of the weak coupling expansion of the plaquette average \n , we showed that the extrapolated ratio and the extrapolated slope suggest a nonanalytical power behavior at @xmath60 with an exponent @xmath61 in agreement with an existing analysis @xcite . \n we found indications for a possible singularity in the third derivative of the free energy on @xmath62 and @xmath63 lattices . \n as the lattice size increases , the statistical errors become large and a significantly larger number of independent configurations is needed in order to draw definite conclusions . \n this will be discussed in a forthcoming preprint @xcite . \n [ [ a - proposal - for - a -

known book@xcite on the connection between particle phenomenology and theoretical cosmology discusses possible candidates \n axions , wimps , machos  for the constituents of the dark matter . in the present article \n i shall provide a complete solution to the dark matter problem which is in the macho category and surprisingly simple : the dark mattter is all black holes ! \n let me first consider low mass dark matter candidates suggested by particle phenomenology . \n there are two especially popular candidates . \n the lighter is the invisible axion predicted by @xcite . \n its mass denotes any integer between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \n ] must be in an allowed window @xmath4 . \n although there are compelling arguments@xcite that the invisible axion requires stronger fine tuning than the strong cp problem it purports to solve , it has staying power and remains the subject of experimental searches . \n the other very popular low - mass dark matter candidate , at a proposed mass typcally a trillion times that of the invisible axion , is the wimp ( weakly - interacting massive particle ) exemplified by the neutralino of supersymmetry . \n the fact that wimps can naturally annihilate to an acceptable present abundance of dark matter is sometimes cited as support for wimps as dark matter . \n but if my proposal for identification of the constituents of dark matter as black holes with masses above @xmath5 is correct , particle - phenomenology - inspired dark matter candidates are , unfortunately for their creators , irrelevant . \n higher mass dark matter constituents are generically called machos ( massive astrophysical compact halo objects ) . \n my proposed constituents fall into this class with masses in the range @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the solar mass ; equivalently @xmath8 or @xmath9 gev . \n even the most die - hard opponent to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) could not take seriously that the lhc could create a black hole with fifty orders of magnitude times the available lhc energy of @xmath10 so the present article thus might convince that the lhc is safe . \n the machos are truly compact , all being smaller in physical size than the earth . \n it is the small size and large mass which have enabled these dark matter constituents to escape detection for 75 years . \n we discuss two methods for their detection , their formation then what , for me , is the best motivation - the entropy of the universe .    . \n note that for the range of masses between @xmath11 and @xmath12 all halo mass can be imbhs . \n taken from @xcite.,height=491 ] \n in the late twentieth century heroic searches were made for microlensing events and many spectacular examples @xcite of machos were identified with masses up to @xmath11 . \n the length of time of a microlensing event depends on the velocity and mass of the lensing macho . \n since the velocities do nor vary widely it is the macho mass which is most crucial in determining longevity . \n the longevity is directly proportional to the square root of the lens mass . \n machos were discovered with microlensing longevities up to about 400 days . \n insufficient machos to account for more than a few percent of the dark matter were discovered . to detect machos up to mass @xmath12 , the current upper limit for halo black holes , necessitates study of microlensing events with duration up to 4.5 years . \n nature has provided delicate astrophysical clocks whose accuracy is sensitive to the possible proximity of machos . \n these clocks are binaries with separations up to 1 pc and therefore can be bigger than the solar system in which the distance from the sun to the outermost planet is only @xmath13 pc .    because these wide binaries are so weakly bound they are the most sensitive to disruption by nearby machos . \n after formation they retain their original orbital parameters as a reliable clock except when affected by gravitational encounters with machos . \n the detailed study of wide binaries is a young and promising technique for macho detection . in the first pioneering presentation@xcite the range of masses allowed for machos which provide all dark matter was @xmath14 . \n it seemed unlikely , though logically possible , that all dark matter machos could have masses within such a narrow range . \n a revisit and reanalysis@xcite of wide binaries has , however , recently discovered that one of the key examples used in @xcite was spurious . \n this leads to quite different and much more promising restrictions on machos , with the allowed mass range extending up to @xmath12 . \n the new constraint is displayed in fig . 1 . and \n it is now far more likely that all dark matter is in the form of black hole machos . \n because intergalactic dust shows evidence of metallicity which involves nuclei heavier than lithium , the heaviest element formed during big - bang nucleosynthsis , it has been hypothesized @xcite that there must have existed pop iii stars in an era before galaxy formation . \n these subsequently exploded producing the dust nuclei heavier than lithium , and leaving massive black holes which are macho candidates . \n numerical simulations of dark matter halos@xcite have given insight into the likely general features of the halo profile . \n the spatial resolution of such simulations is , however , far too coarse to study the formation of machos smaller than the earth whose radius is @xmath15 . \n nevertheless , dark matter is known to clump at large scales and may well do so at such far smaller scales . \n i have assumed that dark energy possesses no entropy . \n let me argue that this is a very weak assumption . \n recently the planck satellite was launched and is on its way to lagrangian point 2 where it will attempt to measure with unprecedented accuracy the dark energy equation of state @xmath16 where @xmath17 are respectively pressure , density . \n the key quantity is @xmath18 . if @xmath19 vanishes identically the assumption of zero entropy for dark energy is justified because it is fully described by one parameter , the cosmological constant . \n if non - zero @xmath19 were observationally established , it would imply a dynamical dark energy with concomitant entropy . \n however , without black holes , the dark energy dimensionless entropy would be much less than one googol and so the identification of the dark matter as black holes and the rest of the present discussion would be unchanged . \n the identification of the dark matter constituent has been an intellectual pursuit for over 75 years . \n particle theorists have naturally suggested light mass solutions which include the invisible axion and wimps . according to theoretical cosmology , however , the most likely solution is that all dark matter is black holes . \n according to the recently updated analysis of wide binaries the permitted mass range is between 30 and 500 solar masses . \n taking a universe comprised of @xmath20 halos each of mass @xmath21 , and using a central macho mass @xmath22 , there are @xmath23 machos per halo and @xmath24 in the universe . \n the dimensionless entropy per macho , using the pbh formula @xcite is @xmath25 and the total is 1000 googols . for galactic - core supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , there are @xmath20 of them so that for a central mass @xmath26 and individual entropy @xmath27 their total entropy is also 1000 googols .    because @xmath28 , the total mass of machos is much larger than that of smbhs . for the central values \n it is @xmath29 times larger . \n the total macho mass is @xmath30 so i hereby predict several thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion kilograms of black holes !", "StartTimeOffset": 2388433761104, "RequestID": "c65375a93636466caf6015ab3e6d9a9b", "TotalTokens": 2020}

{"ContextTokens": 2662, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "the distinction between the energy involved in creating a new surface , as compared to stretching an already existing one , has been reemphasized many times over the years @xcite . while the former can fairly be taken as a constant per unit area , the latter may have complicated dependence on surface strain . here \n we try to find the effect of the latter ( ` surface elasticity ' ) on crack field solutions when this dependence is quadratic akin to its bulk counterpart . \n physically , this effect will be important when the solid dimensions are of the order of @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are surface and bulk elasticity moduli respectively . for real materials \n this ratio is of the order of nanometers . \n since the dimensions of cracks in many materials such as glass range from few angstroms to micrometers , and crack elastic field solutions depend largely on surface tractions , it seems worthwhile to analyze the effect of surface elasticity on crack field solutions . at the outset \n , the use of continuum elasticity at such dimensions may be questioned . \n some years ago shenoy et al compared the continuum elasticity results with atomistic simulations @xcite and were able to show that bending and torsional behavior of a solid at such dimensions can be accounted for by taking surface elasticity into account . here in similar spirit \n we try to formulate the problem of a mode-3 crack for a material having elastic surfaces . \n in this section we solve for the elastic field of a mode-3 crack for a solid having an elastic surface . \n we follow a perturbative approach with the field in the absence of surface elasticity as the unperturbed solution . \n the domain @xmath5 consists of @xmath6 ( see fig 1 ) . \n let the loading at the external boundary @xmath7 be of the form @xmath8 . \n the specimen ]    in the absence of surface tension and surface elasticity effects , the only non - zero displacement @xmath9 in the z - direction satisfies    @xmath10    supplementing the above equations with the condition of finite displacement at @xmath11 , the anti - symmetric solution ( i.e. the one which contributes to crack - opening ) to above set of eqns . can be easily found as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 . \n a general formulation of elastic surfaces was given by gurtin and murdoch @xcite . \n following @xcite , in the presence of surface elasticity / tension effects , the equation of equilibrium in the bulk remain unchanged ( i.e. same as eq . \n ( [ eq : bulk ] ) ) while the boundary conditions at a free surface are changed from @xmath14 to :    @xmath15    here @xmath16 denote surface stress tensor while @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are surface elastic moduli . \n if the normal to the surface lies along direction 2 , then latin subscripts @xmath20 range over 1,2,3 while greek subscripts \n @xmath21 range over only the directions lying along the surface viz . 1 and 3 . the derivatives such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 employed in the above eqns . \n are surface derivatives i.e. projection of usual derivatives along the surface . \n note that @xmath24 is linear in surface strain @xmath25 where @xmath26 . \n we switch to cartesian coordinates for a while for sake of mathematical convenience . along the crack \n faces ( @xmath27 ) , the negative @xmath28 axis coincides with @xmath29 for @xmath30 . \n substituting @xmath31 in above equations    @xmath32    taking surface divergence of @xmath24 one obtains @xmath33 where @xmath34 . \n the first term arises because the constant part of surface stress in eq . \n ( [ eq : surfstress ] ) drops abruptly to zero at the crack tip . its effect on stress fields \n was solved for many years ago by thomson et al @xcite who showed that such terms lead to @xmath35 singularity in stresses at the crack - tip . \n as we are concerned with the effect of surface elasticity and not surface tension in this work and since the overall field can be found as superposition of the fields due to both terms individually , we drop the first term in above eqn . keeping this in mind , the above eqn . in @xmath36 \n coordinates may be written as @xmath37    eqn . \n ( [ eq : bulk ] ) in conjunction with  ( [ eq : bc1wel ] ) and  ( [ eq : bc2wel ] ) completes the specification of boundary value problem for our problem . \n we were unable to find a straightforward method to solve this set of equations \n . we will solve for @xmath38 as a series expansion in terms of the parameter @xmath39 . \n we make the assumption @xmath40 . \n next write @xmath41 as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is given by  ( [ eq : w_on1 ] ) . throughout our analysis \n we assume that @xmath40 . \n since @xmath44 s are independent , each must satisfy the equation @xmath45 in the bulk and the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc1wel ] ) ,  ( [ eq : bc2wel ] ) individually . \n thus one gets the following set of equations    @xmath46    for all @xmath47 , and @xmath48    where upper sign stands for @xmath49 and lower for @xmath50 . substituting for @xmath43 from  ( [ eq : w_on1 ] ) in  ( [ eq : g_1n ] ) and solving for @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an arbitrary coefficient . \n since the loading due to surface elasticity is symmetric ( note the sign change in boundary condition at @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , all the terms containing @xmath3 should be symmetric in @xmath56 . \n therefore @xmath57 . \n thus the terms containing @xmath3 do not contribute to the crack opening displacement but the stress field is necessarily altered due to surface elasticity . substituting the expression for @xmath51 in  ( [ eq : g_2n ] ) @xmath58 again by the same argument @xmath59 \n is seen to be identically equal to zero . \n it immediately follows that @xmath60 . \n thus the perturbative solution is @xmath61 \n from equations  ( [ eq : w_tot1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : pert1 ] ) one observes that the displacement diverges if we include the term @xmath62 . as and \n ruina @xcite have shown through their analysis that one needs to be careful while discarding non-@xmath0 singular(and non - singular ) terms for crack problems . \n in fact , such terms are always present if one take a more realistic situation where there is a nonlinear zone @xmath63 surrounding the crack as shown in figure 2 . here \n we do an analysis similar to @xcite to determine the condition for small - scale yielding in the presence of surface effects .     the specimen ] \n assume that the nonelastic zone is centered at the origin @xmath64 and has dimensions smaller than the crack length @xmath65 . \n we now consider a completely elastic problem in the domain @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the outermost radius of @xmath63 . \n the traction at the inner radius @xmath68 is taken as @xmath69 together with the loading @xmath70 at @xmath71 . the antisymmetric solution to the elastic problem in the absence of surface effects \n can now be found as @xmath72 where @xmath13 and @xmath73 . \n following the notation of @xcite , the above field can be expressed as a sum of two terms : @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 stands for _ _ a__ntisymmetric , _ _ i__nner traction free and @xmath77 for _ _ a__ntisymmetric , _ _ \n o__uter traction free . for sake of completeness \n we write the expressions for these fields :    @xmath78    with @xmath73 , and @xmath79 with @xmath80 , and@xmath81 with @xmath82 , in the presence of surface effects the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc1woel ] ) ,  ( [ eq : bc2woel ] ) remain unchanged except that now our domain is @xmath83 . \n following exactly the same strategy as before , we obtain the following perturbative solution :    @xmath84    from this , the stress fields are readily obtained ,    @xmath85    and    @xmath86    from above equation the condition for @xmath0 ( @xmath87 term ) field dominance can be determined . \n comparing the total stress field due to @xmath0 field to that of next singular @xmath88 term one obtains the following expression for the region in which @xmath0 field dominates :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 it immediately follows from above eqn . that when @xmath91 , the k - dominance region diminishes in its radius by @xmath92 while for the case when @xmath93 the @xmath88 term always dominates the @xmath0 term as it does in the absence of surface elasticity . \n to put our analysis in perspective , many articles pertaining to effect of surface stress on crack field solutions have appeared in the past @xcite . \n the main difference with our work is that we have considered surface stress @xmath94 as having linear ( and thus surface energy quadratic ) dependence on surface strain @xmath95 instead of being independent of it . as mentioned earlier that a constant surface stress leads to @xmath96 singularity for a mode-3 crack @xcite . \n we have shown that the linear term causes a @xmath97 singularity at the crack - tip for @xmath98 . \n physically speaking , non-@xmath0 singular terms due to surface elasticity should be dominant only in the region of extent @xmath99 . \n indeed we see from eq . \n ( [ eq : region ] ) that surface elasticity decreases the extent of @xmath0-dominant region by @xmath100 .    though we are not aware of any direct experimental evidence which favors a quadratic dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath95 over a linear one , miller et al @xcite showed that a quadratic dependence was consistent with atomistic simulations for simple problems of elongation , bending and torsion . \n note that the variable @xmath94 , which is responsible for size - dependent elastic properties in @xcite , has same significance as @xmath3 in this article under gurtin - murdoch s formalism @xcite . \n finally , the green s function obtained by thomson et al @xcite for symmetric dipole acting along a mode-3 crack s surface may also be used for obtaining the results in this article but since in our problem the loading itself is dependent on the displacement field , we found it more expedient to directly solve the equations of elasticity instead of a solving a singular integro - differential equation .", "StartTimeOffset": 2431975601473, "RequestID": "161cab32e0e7457bb96b81b5dd081fa0", "TotalTokens": 2789}

shifted optical jet component was discovered by @xcite . \n the optical visibility of @xmath4  oph  102 suggests that the source corresponds to a class ii object @xcite in the star formation phase , a class with an accreting circumstellar disk and the protostar at this stage is the so - called classical t tauri star . \n we have observed iso - oph  102 with the receiver band at 230  ghz of the sma @xcite . \n both 2 ghz - wide sidebands which are separated by 10 ghz were used . \n the sma correlator was configured with high spectral resolution bands of 512 channels per chunk of 104  mhz for @xmath5co , @xmath6co , and c@xmath7o @xmath8 lines , giving a channel spacing of 0.27  km  s@xmath9 \n . a lower resolution of 3.25  mhz per channel was set up for the remainder of each sideband . \n the quasars 1625@xmath10254 and 3c  279 have been observed for gain and passband calibration , respectively . \n mars were used for flux calibration . \n the data were calibrated using the mir software package and further analysis was carried out with the miriad package adapted for the sma . \n the compact configuration was used , resulting a synthesized beam of 3@xmath11.60  @xmath12  2@xmath11.43 with a position angle of 8.5@xmath13 . \n the rms ( root mean square ) sensitivity was about 3  mjy for the continuum , using both sidebands and @xmath140.2  jy  beam@xmath9 per channel for the line data . the primary fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) beam is about 55@xmath11  at the observed frequencies . \n the integrated flux density from the dust continuum emission was 7@xmath153  mjy measured at the brown dwarf position . \n an overlay of a near - infrared image and the integrated intensity in the carbon monoxide ( co @xmath16 ) line emission is shown in figure 1 . \n two spatially resolved blue- and red - shifted co components are symmetrically displaced on opposite sides of the brown dwarf position , with the size of each lobe of about 8@xmath11 corresponding to 1000  au in length . \n this is similar to the typical pattern of bipolar molecular outflows as seen in young stars @xcite . \n the two outflow components with a wide range of velocity ( figure 2 ) suggests a bow shock structure , an effect of the interaction between the jet propagation and the ambient material , which appears very similar to the bow shock phenomena as seen in young stars @xcite . \n such a co outflow morphology suggests that the jet - driven bow shock model ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be at work in @xmath4  oph  102 . \n following the standard manner @xcite , we calculate the outflow properties . \n we use a value of 35  k @xcite for the excitation temperature , and we derive a lower limit to the outflow mass of @xmath17 . if we correct for optical depth with a typical value of 5 @xcite , we obtain an upper limit to the outflow mass of @xmath0 . this value is smaller than the ones observed in young stars @xcite by three orders of magnitude . \n to estimate the outflow inclination , we combine our sma data with archival infrared data of the spitzer space telescope . for the infrared photometry \n , we use the archival basic calibrated data ( pids : 58 , 177 ) that were reduced with iraf to measure flux densities . \n disk modeling is performed as the previous works ( see @xcite and references therein ) . \n the circumstellar geometry consists of a rotationally flattened infalling envelope , bipolar cavities , and a flared accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium . \n the disk density is proportional to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radial coordinate in the disk midplane , and @xmath20 is the radial density exponent . \n the disk scale height increases with radius , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the scale height at @xmath23 ( the brown dwarf radius ) and @xmath24 is the flaring power . \n stellar parameters are obtained from @xcite , and an accretion rate of @xmath25  yr@xmath9 is used . \n the nextgen @xcite atmosphere file for an effective temperature @xmath26 of 2700  k , and log _ g _ = 3.5 , where @xmath27 is the surface gravity , is used to fit the atmosphere spectrum of the central sub - stellar source . \n the disk shows some flaring longward of @xmath1410 @xmath28 m , and the best model - fit was obtained using a disk mass of @xmath2 , an inclination angle between 63@xmath13 and 66@xmath13 , an outer disk radius of 80 au , and an inner disk radius equal to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the dust sublimation radius : 1  @xmath29@xmath30 . \n there is thus no inner hole in the disk as it would have to be larger than @xmath29 . \n the outer disk radius and the disk mass are well - constrained by the millimeter observations . a more face - on inclination \n can be ruled out as it results in larger - than - observed mid- and far - infrared fluxes . \n figure 3 presents the best fit from the disk modeling obtained using a disk mass of @xmath2 , an inclination angle between 63@xmath13 and 66@xmath13 , an outer disk radius of 80 au , resulting in a projected disk radius of 32 - 36 au . \n this immediately explains the non - detection of the red - shifted optical jet component , estimated to be about 15  au in length as reported in the previous observation @xcite . \n since the projected disk radius is larger than the jet length , the disk therefore hides the red - shifted jet component from our view . \n we use the observed maximum flow velocity of 2.2 km  s@xmath9 and apply a correction for the outflow inclination to compute upper limit values for the kinematic and dynamic parameters . \n we find that the momentum is @xmath31@xmath32  km  s@xmath9 , the energy is @xmath33@xmath32  km@xmath34  s@xmath35 , the force is @xmath36@xmath32  km  s@xmath9  yr@xmath9 , and the mechanical luminosity is @xmath37  l@xmath38 , where l@xmath38 is the solar luminosity . a correction for the optical depth factor of 5 and a missing flux factor of 3 for \n sma @xcite will increase these upper limit values by a factor of 15 . using the lower value of the outflow mass and a correction factor of 10 applied for the outflow duration time @xcite \n , we derive the outflow mass - loss rate of @xmath39@xmath32  yr@xmath9 , which is smaller than a typical value for t tauri stars @xcite by two orders of magnitude . \n one should note that these values are roughly estimated , depending on the correction factor values used in the calculation . \n one should also note that the outflow mass and the mass loss rate values from iso - oph 102 appear similar to that from l1014-irs @xcite , suggesting that they share the same origin . \n however as clearly stated in @xcite l1014-irs could be an embedded protostar or a proto - brown dwarf , corresponding to the earliest stages of star or brown dwarf formation processes , respectively . \n more observations are needed to confirm the l1014-irs nature and study the connection between iso -

loss rate , respectively . \n we demonstrate for the first time that brown dwarfs , even young planetary mass objects @xcite can launch a bipolar molecular outflow , and hence we confirm that they are likely to have a common origin with the low - mass stars . \n this suggests that the terminal stellar / brown dwarf mass is not due to different formation mechanisms , but more likely due to the initial mass of the cloud core . \n we also show that there is evidence for dust crystallization in the disk around the brown dwarf . in brown dwarfs \n the molecular outflows may be longer lived than in low - mass stars and they coexist with grain growth and crystallization . \n outflows from brown dwarfs may play a crucial role in sweeping out gas from the disk and favouring the formation of rocky planets . \n np -

{"ContextTokens": 3989, "GeneratedTokens": 219, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery made by of a handful of x - ray emitting kiloparsec - scale jets opens a new window on the study of the physics of relativistic jets . \n the x - ray emission offers the possibility to observe directly the sites of particle acceleration , and allows us to calculate important physical quantities such as the transported power . for this purpose \n it is of primary importance to establish the mechanism responsible for the observed x - ray emission . \n recently chartas et al . \n ( 2000 ) and schwartz et al . \n ( 2000 ) reported the discovery of the x - ray emission from the jet of a distant powerful quasar pks  0637752 ( @xmath4 ) . from the shape of the spectral energy distribution \n , one can exclude that the origin of the x - rays is synchrotron emission from the same electron population responsible for the radio continuum . \n this is because the observed optical flux is well below ( about a factor of 10 ) the line connecting smoothly the radio and x - ray emission . \n schwartz et al . \n ( 2000 ) , in discussing several possibilities for producing the observed x - rays from knot wk7.8 ( notation from schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) , exclude bremsstrahlung emission and inverse - compton scattering of photons originating in the quasar . \n the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scenario implies a magnetic field well below the equipartition value , so schwartz et al . \n conclude that a viable explanation is de - beamed ssc emission \n . however , this solution also presents problems which we address here .    in this letter \n we discuss the possibility that x - rays are produced through inverse compton scattering of photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . \n the observed superluminal motion in the jet on parsec scales , together with the close alignment between parsec and kiloparsec scale jets ( e.g. , tingay et al . 1998 , schwartz et al . 2000 ) suggests that the kiloparsec scale emission could be beamed , with a doppler factor as high as 10 - 15 . \n this effect was possibly not taken into account in the cmb model discussed by chartas et al . \n ( 2000 ; see their fig \n if the x - ray jet of pks  0637752 is indeed sufficiently doppler beamed , inverse compton scattering of cmb photons can easily explain the observed x - ray emission . in   2 we discuss in detail the implications of an ec / cmb vs an ssc model and in \n 3 we summarize our conclusions . \n througout the letter we assume @xmath5 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath6 . \n given the observed spectral energy distribution of knot wk7.8 in pks  0637752 , the most plausible mechanism responsible for the x - ray emission is inverse compton scattering , although other mechanisms , such as synchrotron emission from a second electron population can not be ruled out . \n possible sources of soft photons include the synchrotron photons themselves ( ssc ) or a radiation field external to the jet ( external compton , or ec ) . given the large distance of the jet from the nucleus , we can exclude that an important contribution comes from the stellar and nuclear radiation of the quasar ( schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) .    among other possible external sources of soft photons , \n the cmb is particularly important . \n its energy density , at the redshift of the source , is a factor @xmath7 times the local value . \n more importantly , in the frame of the relativistic electrons in the jet , it is enhanced by a factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma ( e.g. , ghisellini et al . \n 1998 ) .    for any ssc or ec model , \n it is possible to constrain the allowed values of magnetic field and doppler beaming factor using standard formulae ( e.g. , tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 ) . \n we assume that the radiating region is approximately spherical , with radius @xmath10  cm ( corresponding to @xmath110.3  arcsec ; schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) , filled with tangled magnetic field with intensity @xmath12 , and characterized by doppler factor @xmath13)^{-1}$ ] . \n the particle distribution is a power law with index @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the observed radio spectral slope ( schwartz et al . \n 2000 ; @xmath17 ) , and with low and high energy cut - off @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . \n note that the x - ray spectrum also has this spectral index , @xmath20 ( chartas et al . 2000 ) , as expected in either ec or ssc models .    using standard expressions for synchrotron and inverse compton emissivities , corrected for doppler beaming , and using the observed radio , optical , and x - ray fluxes as constraints , for both models \n the allowed values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 describe a line . \n these are shown in figure  1 for the ssc and ec / cmb models . \n also shown in figure  1 are lines corresponding to equipartition between magnetic field and radiating particles for two values of the assumed @xmath18 ( the line is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath22 ) . \n the ssc line depends primarily on the ratio of observed x - ray to radio luminosity . \n the condition for the ec / cmb model has a different slope due to the role of additional beaming of the cmb radiation in the rest frame of the emitting plasma  i.e. , the electrons `` see '' a beamed cmb flux from the forward direction ( e.g. , dermer 1995 , ghisellini et al . 1998 ) . for the ssc emission , \n a greater degree of beaming implies a lower synchrotron energy density in the jet frame , which in turn implies lower values of the magnetic field for a given compton / synchrotron luminosity ratio ( solid line in fig .  1 ) . \n in the ec / cmb model ( dashed line in fig .  1 ) , in contrast , the amplification of the external radiation increases with @xmath21 , implying a larger energy density of soft photons in the jet frame , and thus a higher magnetic field for a given @xmath23 .    from figure  1 \n it is clear that the ssc model implies a very large deviation from equipartition unless the source is significantly de - beamed , with @xmath24 ( schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) , while the ec / cmb model is compatible with equipartition for a moderate value of the doppler factor , @xmath25 . \n this is consistent with measurements of superluminal motion in the pks  0637752 jet on vlbi scales ( lovell 2000 ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( implying @xmath28 ) . \n we computed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) for both the synchrotron plus ec / cmb and the synchrotron plus ssc models for a homogeneous sphere filled with relativistic electrons ( as described by tavecchio et al . \n the cmb spectrum is modeled as a blackbody and the compton scattering calculation takes into account the full klein - nishina cross - section . in figure  2 \n we compare our best results with the observed radio , optical and x - ray fluxes from knot wk7.8 ( from chartas et al . \n 2000 ) . \n the ec / cmb spectrum is obtained using equipartition values for the parameters , @xmath29  g and @xmath30 ( see fig .  1 ) . for the small angles implied by vlbi observations , @xmath31 \n , we can also assume @xmath32 . \n the electron distribution is described by a power law with low- and high - energy cutoffs , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and normalization @xmath35  @xmath36 . \n the value of @xmath18 was chosen so that the low energy spectral break of the ec / cmb component lies in the range @xmath37 . \n we could fit the spectrum with values in the range @xmath38 ; for lower @xmath18 the ec emission would over - predict the observed optical flux , while for higher values the x - ray spectrum would have a very steep slope . \n the value of @xmath19 is fixed by the optical point and by the values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 . for the above parameters the ssc contribution is several orders of magnitude below the ec / cmb emission and \n is not visible in the figure . \n the predicted x - ray spectral slope matches well the observed slope ( @xmath39 ; chartas et al . \n 2000 ) . \n we calculated the ssc spectrum for the marginally unbeamed case , @xmath40 and @xmath41  g ( see fig .  1 ) , as a sort of `` best case '' scenario . for larger \n beaming ( @xmath42 ) , the magnetic field is even farther from equipartition ( @xmath43  g ) , while for lower doppler factor ( a very de - beamed jet ) , the jet may approach equipartition but the total implied energy grows very large ( see further discussion below ) . \n the low- and high - energy cut - offs of the electron distribution are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , and the normalization is @xmath46  @xmath36 . \n the high value of @xmath18 is imposed by the necessity of truncating the ssc spectrum below the soft x - ray band in order not to overproduce the optical flux . \n if , as in fig 2 , the low - energy tail of the ssc spectrum gives a significant contribution to the optical flux a strong uv emission from the jet would be expected . \n note also that the predicted x - ray spectrum is somewhat harder than actually observed . \n given @xmath12 and @xmath21 , together with the observed synchrotron flux , we can calculate the total kinetic power transported by the jet : @xmath47 ( e.g. , celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ) , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the energy densities of protons , electrons , and magnetic field , respectively . \n the constraints are quite interesting in the case of the ec / cmb model , because most of the jet energy is in the less relativistic electrons ( given their steep energy distribution ) , and it is those electrons that produce most of the x - ray emission . for minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath33 as derived above , and assuming equal numbers of electrons and ( cold ) protons , we find @xmath51  erg  s@xmath2 , consistent with the jet power estimated for the most powerful blazars ( e.g. , celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ; tavecchio et al 2000 ) . \n this is also consistent with the kinetic luminosity required to power the lobes of giant radio galaxies ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) . \n in contrast , the ssc model requires an unreasonably high value of the jet power . for @xmath40 , even if @xmath52 ( which would imply @xmath53 ) and for the lowest possible electron cutoff energy , @xmath54 from the spectral constraints discussed above , we find @xmath55  erg  s@xmath2 irrespective of the proton contribution since the average energy of the electrons is larger than the proton mass . for the de - beamed case \n the situation becomes far worse . also , the de - beamed model implies that the jet , the projection of which is very well aligned from vlbi to kiloparsec scales , must actually bend away from us through a 90-degree angle .    in the ec / cmb model the radiative power of the knot \n is dominated by the @xmath56-ray peak . \n its beaming - corrected value ( sikora et al . \n 1997 ) is @xmath57  erg  s@xmath2 . \n the position of the @xmath56-ray peak , @xmath58 , is very well constrained because the cmb peak frequency ( @xmath59 ) is known and the values of the doppler factor ( @xmath21 ) and the maximum lorentz factor ( @xmath19 ) are well constrained by the assumption of equipartition . \n the corresponding @xmath56-ray power for the minimally beamed ssc model ( @xmath40 ) is @xmath60  ergs  s@xmath2 , and this value increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath21 .    even for the ec / cmb model , \n the kinetic power of the jet is very high compared to the observed luminosity , implying very low radiative efficiency . \n ( the efficiency is higher for the ssc model and it increases as @xmath61 decreases . ) \n the electrons emitting via synchrotron in the optical band and via ec / cmb in the @xmath56-rays have relatively short lifetimes , @xmath62  s ( compton cooling dominates synchrotron cooling ) and can travel for at most @xmath63  kpc . \n this is consistent with ( @xmath64 times ) the size of the knot , which can therefore arise from a single acceleration site . \n given the close alignment of the jet with the line of sight , its minimum de - projected length is @xmath65  mpc , and _ in situ _ reacceleration beyond knot wk7.8 is required in either case . \n we conclude , from spectral , equipartition and jet power arguments , that inverse compton scattering of cmb photons is the most likely emission mechanism for the observed x - rays from pks  0637752 . \n we have shown that the x - ray emission from knot wk7.8 in the pks  0637752 jet likely originates from upscattering of cmb photons provided the jet is still relativistic on kiloparsec scales . \n the physical parameters in the emitting region are consistent with equipartition for moderate values of the doppler beaming factor , @xmath25 , which also agrees with observed superluminal motion in this jet ( albeit on much smaller scales ) . \n given a high degree of relativistic beaming , the size of the knot is also consistent with the diffusion length for the radiating electrons . \n modeling the radio - to - x - ray continuum constrains the value of the minimum lorentz factor of the emitting electrons to be @xmath3 . \n this is the first such constraint from spectral modeling . generally , the synchrotron emission from these electrons is self absorbed ( here , @xmath66  hz ) . \n minimum values for electron energy have been inferred from general arguments ( e.g. , reynolds et al . \n 1996 ) or the lack of faraday depolarization ( e.g. , wardle et al . 1998 ) , but a direct probe of @xmath18 is possible only when the observed spectrum describes a sharp break in the compton - scattered radiation . \n the estimated kinetic power of the jet , @xmath67  ergs  s@xmath2 , is then consistent with that of other powerful blazar jets . \n the ssc model requires far less reasonable assumptions , notably that the parsec - scale jet is nearly aligned with the line of sight but the kiloparsec - scale jet is roughly in the plane of the sky , and implies a jet kinetic power at least one order of magnitude larger . \n observations of the jet in the uv could help discriminating between the two possibilities .    with the favored ec / cmb model ( and also in the ssc case ) \n , the x - ray jet has remarkably low radiative efficiency , suggesting pks  0637752 should have powerful extended radio lobes or be in an early phase of evolution . \n ft is grateful to stsci for hospitality during the preparation of this work . \n this work was supported in part by nasa grant nag5 - 9327 . \n ft and lm acknowledge partial support from grants cee erbfmrx - ct98 - 0195 and murst - cofin-98 - 02 - 15 - 41 . \n rms acknowledges support from nasa contract nas38252 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2455230236257, "RequestID": "804465bf4a3049de969202a0bbb8ca76", "TotalTokens": 4208}

qubit logic gates and one - qubit local operations universal . \n the standard paradigm of quantum computation is the dynamical one where the local interactions between the qubits are controlled in such a way so that one can enact a sequence of quantum gates . on the other hand \n , it has been recognized that the quantum gate operations can also be implemented through the geometric effects on the wave function of the systems , this is the so -

called standard cooling scenario that turns out to be possible not only in neutron star matter but in strange quark matter too , altering some of the conclusions made in the earlier investigations significantly . \n we use the mit bag model including @xmath1-corrections ( cf . \n @xcite ) to model the properties of absolutely stable strange matter . \n its equation of state and quark - lepton composition , which is governed by the conditions of chemical equilibrium and electric charge neutrality , is derived for that range of model parameters , that is , bag constant @xmath2 , the strange quark mass @xmath3 , and strong coupling constant @xmath4 , for which strange matter is absolutely stable ( energy per baryon @xmath5 less than the one in iron , @xmath6  mev ) . in the limiting case of vanishing quark mass , \n the electrons are not necesaary to maintain charge neutrality . in the realistic case of finite strange quark masse @xmath7 , the electrons can nevertheless vanish above some density which depends on @xmath8 . \n it was pointed out by duncan et al . \n ( 1983 ) ( see also @xcite ) that the neutrino emissivity of strange matter depends strongly on its electron fraction , @xmath9 . \n for that reason we introduce two different , complementary parameter sets denoted sm-1 and sm-2 ( see tab . \n [ tab : parameter ] ) , which correspond to strange matter that contains a relatively high electron fraction ( sm-1 ) , and @xmath10 ( sm-2 ) for the density range being of interest here . \n the quark _ direct _ urca processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 as well as their inverse ones are only possible if the fermi momenta of quarks and electrons ( @xmath13 , @xmath14u , d , s;e@xmath15 ) fulfill the so - called triangle inequality ( e.g. , @xmath16 for process ( [ eq : dtou ] ) ) . \n this relation is the analogue to the triangle inequality established for nucleons and electrons in the nuclear matter case ( direct urca process , @xcite ) . \n if the electron fermi momentum is too small ( i.e. , @xmath9 is too little ) , then the triangle inequality for the above processes ( [ eq : dtou ] ) and ( [ eq : stou ] ) can not be fulfilled , and a bystander quark is needed to ensure energy and momentum conservation in the scattering process . \n the latter process is known as the quark _ modified _ urca process , whose emissivity is considerably smaller than the emissivity of the direct urca process . \n if the electron fraction vanishes entirely , as is the case for sm-2 , both the quark direct and the quark modified urca processes become unimportant . \n the neutrino emission is then dominated by bremsstrahlung processes only , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 denote any pair of quark flavors . for the emissivities associated with the quark direct urca , quark modified urca , and quark bremsstrahlung processes \n , we refer to refs . \n price ( 1980 ) , iwamoto ( 1982 ) and duncan et al . \n ( 1983 ) . \n it has been suggested ( see @xcite ) that the quarks eventually may form cooper pairs . \n this would suppress , as in the nuclear matter case , the neutrino emissivities by an exponential factor of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gap energy , @xmath22 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath23 the temperature . \n unfortunately , there exists up to now neither a precise experimentally nor theoretically determined value of the gap energy . \n so to provide a feeling for the influence of a possibly superfluid behavior of the quarks in strange matter too , we choose @xmath24  mev as estimated in the work of bailin & love ( 1979 ) . \n ( such a @xmath21 value is not too different from the nuclear - matter case , where the proton @xmath25 gap , for instance , amounts @xmath26  mev ( cf . \n @xcite ) , depending on the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the microscopic model . ) \n the outcome of our superfluid strange matter calculations will be labeled sm-1@xmath27 and sm-2@xmath27 . \n among the x - ray observations of the 14 sources which were identified as pulsars , the rosat and asca observations of psrs 0833 - 45 ( vela ) , 0656 + 14 , \n 0630 + 18 ( geminga ) and 1055 - 52 ( see tab . [ tab : observations ] ) achieved a sufficiently high photon flux such that the effective surface temperatures of these pulsars could be extracted by two- or three - component spectral fits ( cf . \n the obtained effective surface temperatures , shown in figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] , depend crucially on whether a hydrogen atmosphere is used or not . \n since the photon flux measured solely in the x - ray energy band does not allow one to determine what kind of atmosphere one should use , we consider both the blackbody model and the hydrogen - atmosphere model , drawn in in figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] as solid and dashed error bars , respectively . \n the kind of atmosphere possessed by a specific pulsar could be determined by considering multiwavelength observations ( see @xcite ) . \n all error bars represent the @xmath28 error range due to the small photon fluxes . \n the pulsars ages are determined by their spin - down times assuming a canonical value of 3 for the braking index . in reality \n the braking index may be quite different from 3 . \n its variation between 2 and 4 , for instance , would change the age of geminga as indicated by the horizontal error bar shown at the bottom of figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] . \n the thermal evolution of strange stars and neutron stars was simulated using the evolutionary numerical code described in schaab et al . \n ( 1996b ) ( see also @xcite ) . \n the neutron star models are based on a broad collection of eoss which comprises relativistic , fieldtheoretical equations of state as well as non - relativistic , schroedinger - based ones ( see @xcite for details ) . as a specific feature of the relativistic models , they account for all baryon states that become populated in dense neutron star matter up to the highest densities reached in the cores of the heaviest neutron stars constructed from this collection of equations of state . \n neutron stars are known to loose energy either via standard cooling or enhanced cooling . both may be delayed by superfluidity . \n consequently all four options have been taken into account here . \n these are labeled in figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] as ns-1 ( enhanced cooling ) and ns-2 ( standard cooling ) for normal neutron star matter , and ns-1@xmath27 and ns-2@xmath27 ( delayed cooling ) for superfluid neutron star matter . \n the parameters of ns-1@xmath27 and ns-2@xmath27 are listed in tab .  4 of ref . \n schaab et al . \n ( 1996b ) . in analogy to this , \n the corresponding strange - star cooling curves are sm-1 ( enhanced cooling ) and sm-2 ( standard cooling ) for normal strange quark matter , and sm-1@xmath27 and sm-2@xmath27 ( delayed cooling ) for superfluid quark matter . \n all calculations are performed for a star mass of @xmath29 , about which the observed pulsar masses tend to scatter . \n the band - like structure of the cooling curves is supposed to reflect the uncertainties inherent in the equation of state of neutron - star and strange - star matter . \n these have their origin , in the case of neutron stars ( bands filled with dots ) , in the different many - body techniques used to solve the nuclear many - body problem , and the star s baryon - lepton composition . in the latter case , \n strange - star matter , the solid bands refer to different bag values , @xmath2 , which vary from 137 to 148 mev for sm-1 , and from 133 to 146 mev for sm-2 . \n all values correspond to absolutely stable strange matter . \n one might suspect that the large gap between the cooling tracks of the sm-1 and sm-2 models in fig . \n [ fig : nsf ] can be bridged steadily by varying the strong coupling constant @xmath8 in the range 0.10.15 . \n however it turns out that the gap can be filled only for @xmath8-values within an extremely small range . \n this is caused by the sensitive functional relationship between @xmath8 and the neutrino luminosity @xmath30 , which is rather steep around that @xmath8-value for which the electrons vanish from the quark core of the star . \n all other values of @xmath8 give cooling tracks which are close to the upper or lower bands , respectively . \n this behavior might be compared with the case of neutron stars , where the neutrino luminosity depends sensitively on the star s mass . \n one sees from figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] that , except for the first @xmath0 years of the lifetime of a newly born pulsar , both neutron stars and strange stars may show more or less the _ same _ cooling behavior , provided both types of stars are made up of either normal matter or superfluid matter . \n ( we will come back to this issue below . ) this is made possible by the fact that both standard cooling ( ns-2 ) as well as enhanced cooling ( ns-1 ) in neutron stars has its counterpart in strange stars too ( sm-2 and sm-1 , respectively ) . \n the point of time at which the surface temperature drop of a strange star occurs depends on the thickness of the nuclear crust that may envelope the strange matter core ( cf . \n @xcite ) . in the present calculation , \n strange stars possess the densest possible nuclear crust , which is about 0.2 km thick . \n thinner crusts would lead to temperature drops at even earlier times , and thus an earlier onset of the photon cooling era . \n figures [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] indicate that the cooling data of observed pulsars do not allow to decide about the true nature of the underlying collapsed star , that is , as to whether it is a strange star or a conventional neutron star . \n this could abruptly change with the observation of a very young pulsar shortly after its formation in a supernova explosion . in this case \n a prompt drop of the pulsar s temperature , say within the first 30 years after its formation , could offer a good signature of a strange star ( see @xcite ) . \n this feature , provided it withstands a rigorous future analysis of the microscopic properties of quark matter , could become particularly interesting if continued observation of sn 1987a would reveal the temperature of the possibly existing pulsar at its center .    finally , we add some comments about the possibility that only the neutron star is made up of superfluid matter but not the strange star . in this case one \n has to compare the models sm-1 and sm-2 ( see fig . \n [ fig : nsf ] ) with models ns-1@xmath31 and ns-2@xmath31 ( see fig . [ \n fig : sf ] ) yielding to an overall different cooling history of neutron stars and enhanced - cooling strange stars ( sm-1 ) . therefore , the standard argument pointed out quite frequently in the literature that strange stars cool much more rapidly than neutron stars applies only to this special case . \n .bag constant , @xmath2 , strange quark mass , @xmath3 , and the qcd coupling constant , @xmath4 , for the two sets of parameters denoted sm-1 and sm-2 . \n the energy per baryon , @xmath5 , for two and three flavor quark matter is given too .

? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n star formation in such an environment is thought to be assisted by some external trigger , and the filamentary clouds themselves have probably been created by large - scale motions of the interstellar gas . \n the most plausible scenario , suggested by the arc - like structure is , that energetic stellar winds and/or supernova explosions of high - mass stars at lower galactic latitudes lifted the gas above the galactic plane and compressed it to form stars . in this case \n the apparent filament is a projection of a shell , and its line - of - sight extent may be comparable to its length . \n the distribution of ysos relative to the clouds does not support this scenario . \n the young stars of l1333 are located at the high - latitude side of the cloud , with the oldest member , oksh@xmath126 , lying farthest from the cloud . the lack of h@xmath12 emission stars , as well as yso - like _ iras _ and 2mass point sources on the low - latitude side of the filament suggests star formation propagating toward lower latitudes , and a source of trigger at higher galactic latitudes . \n a possible candidate trigger source is the collision of high velocity gas with the giant radio continuum emitting region _ \n loop  iii _ \n , described by @xcite . \n our target objects are located near the far side of loop  iii @xcite . \n @xcite has shown that loop  iii collided with high velocity gas originating from a galactic supershell some @xmath29 ago . \n the collision has been well modelled for latitudes @xmath30 . at lower latitudes , \n however , the behaviour of the supershell and its collision with the local interstellar matter has not yet been studied . in order to reveal the geometry of the possible collision in the latitude range @xmath31@xmath32 \n , the velocity distributions of both molecular and atomic gas have to be studied in detail . \n closer to the galactic plane the high velocity gas of the supershell might have decelerated before reaching our galactic neighbourhood .    in this scenario \n the high - density regions , created by the colliding surfaces , have small line - of - sight extent . \n the ages obtained for _ iras _  02086 + 7600 , oksh@xmath125 , and oksh@xmath1216 , taking into account their accuracies , support this scenario . \n oksh@xmath126 was , however , born apparently before the collision . \n the weak - line t  tauri stars to the west of the cloud complex make the pattern of star formation of this region even more complicated . \n they indicate a prolonged star formation in the region . \n the age distribution of the wttss suggests star formation propagating from lower to higher galactic longitudes . \n more accurate age determinations and more detailed mapping of molecular velocity distribution are needed to clarify the picture . \n we identified five low - mass ysos in the small filamentary molecular complex associated with the dark cloud lynds  1333 . \n their masses are in the interval 0.150.8m@xmath33 , and they are 15 million years old . \n we confirmed that _ iras \n _  02086 + 7600 is a class  i yso associated with the l1333 complex , and found its age to be comparable to those of the cttss born in the same cloud . \n the relative distribution of ysos and clouds suggests that the star formation might have been triggered by the collision of high velocity gas with loop  iii . \n this work is partly based on observations with nordic optical telescope operated on the island of la palma jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden , in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias . \n the data presented here have been taken using alfosc , which is owned by the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( iaa ) and operated at the nordic optical telescope under agreement between iaa and the nbifafg of the astronomical observatory of copenhagen . \n our results are partly based on observations obtained at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) at calar alto , operated jointly by the max - planck institut fr astronomie and the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( csic ) . \n we are indebted to francesco palla for sending his data set on pre - main sequence evolution , and to lszl szabados for careful reading of the manuscript . financial support from the hungarian otka grants \n t034584 , t037508 , ts049872 , t042509 , and t049082 is acknowledged . \n sn acknowledges support from the chilean _ centro de astrofsica _ fondap no . \n 15010003 and serbian ministry of science and environmental protection grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 2498916341774, "RequestID": "db40089d1bba4c38bc99bc135056a230", "TotalTokens": 4190}

selective diagrams beyond the gw set were also included . \n the results for fe and ni were quite reasonable , although no improvement was obtained compared to lda . \n while the choice of gw diagrams is unjustified for the homogeneous electron gas at typical metallic densities and likewise for semiconductors ( the diagrams that are left out do not contain any small parameter ) , it was noted that the situation may be better in transition metals , because high orbital degeneracy provides an additional enhancement to the diagrams with the largest number of closed electron loops favoring the gw set.@xcite in addition , for transition metals the `` local '' ( one - site ) approximation for the self - energy is quite reasonable due to the short screening length and greatly facilitates self - consistent calculations . \n another realization@xcite using gw set with the full @xmath3-dependence of the self - energy was applied to elemental semiconductors . \n it was found that self - consistency and accurate treatment of core electrons improve the agreement with experiment for the band gaps in si and ge . \n while the adequacy of gwa for the studies of metals and semiconductors has not been firmly established from the point of view of the many - body theory , this method may be regarded as one of the possible steps toward a consistent green s function - based scheme . \n therefore , it is important to establish the accuracy of this approximation for different materials , and in particular for transition metals where , as noted above , there are reasons for it to work better than in the homogeneous electron gas . to this end , in this paper we calculate the conduction - band spectra for all elemental @xmath0 and @xmath1 metals using the self - consistent gw approach of ref .   and compare them with the observed ones and with those given by the lda . \n the technique used in this paper was introduced in ref .  . \n here we describe some points in more detail . \n the self - energy @xmath4 is obtained from the luttinger - ward generating functional @xmath5 defined by the set of skeleton graphs . \n @xcite the hartree diagram gives the local contribution @xmath6 , and the exchange diagram contributes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coulomb potential . \n the total contribution of the remaining gw sequence ( the `` correlation term '' ) is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the effective ( screened coulomb ) interaction defined by the integral dyson equation @xmath11 and the polarization operator @xmath12contour of integration in eqs . \n ( [ sigmac]),([pi ] ) is directed along the imaginary axis and embraces the cut on the real axis from the fermi energy @xmath13 to the external energy . \n the gw approximation may be modified by the inclusion of vertex corrections in the polarization operator ( [ pi ] ) which may improve the results in some cases . \n the calculations are drastically simplified by the use of the one - site approximation  @xcite ( osa ) , in which the self - energy is calculated only on one lattice site neglecting all non - diagonal maxrix elements connecting different lattice sites . \n thus , in osa the self - energy depends on energy and on the coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 belonging to the same unit cell . in order to implement osa \n we first need to choose an appropriate on - site basis . \n inspired by the good description of the band structure of densely packed solids achieved in the atomic sphere approximation within the linear muffin - tin orbital method ( lmto - asa ) , we used a very similar , minimalistic approach . for the basis set \n we also use just one function per each angular momentum @xmath16 and its projection @xmath17 ( below we denote @xmath18 ) , along with its energy derivative . the radial basis functions @xmath19 satisfy the `` schrdinger - type '' equation @xmath20 \\phi_l(r)=0   \\label{schroed}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the radial part of the laplasian , and @xmath22 is an integral radial operator whose kernel is obtained from @xmath23 by projecting onto the @xmath16 subspace : @xmath24 where we denoted @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the spherical harmonics , and integration is over the directions of @xmath14,@xmath27 . the operator @xmath22 may be represented as the sum of a local part @xmath28 similar to an external potential and a nonlocal part @xmath29 which ( after acting on @xmath30 ) gives a linear combination of @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    similarly to the lmto - asa method , the solutions of eq . \n ( [ schroed ] ) are only found at one energy @xmath33 for each @xmath16 which is fixed at the center of gravity of the corresponding band . \n we may safely discard the imaginary part of the self - energy operator because it is small in the vicinity of @xmath13 where @xmath33 is usually chosen . \n thus , our radial basis functions are real . \n the non - local equation ( [ schroed ] ) is solved by iterations . \n if @xmath34 is the solution after @xmath35 iterations , then the solution on iteration @xmath36 is obtained using auxiliary functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 f_l(r)&= & \\widehat\\sigma_l^{(n)}(\\epsilon_l)\\phi_l^n , \\\\ \n \\left[\\epsilon_l+\\frac{\\delta_l}{2}-v_{\\mathrm{h}}\\right ] g_l(r)&=&0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to @xmath40 , where the coefficient @xmath41 is found by normalizing @xmath42 . \n just as in the lmto method , in addition to @xmath30 we compute its energy derivative @xmath43 : @xmath20 \\dot\\phi_l=-\\phi_l+\\frac{\\partial\\widehat\\sigma_l(% \\epsilon_l)}{\\partial\\epsilon_l}\\phi_l   \\label{schroed1}\\ ] ]    to stabilize the solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ schroed ] ) , we added the exchange with the nearest - neighbor cells to @xmath44 . \n the corresponding matrix element was subtracted from green s function ( gf ) below .    with the on - site self - energy @xmath45 defined for @xmath46 within the single unit cell \n we can calculate its matrix elements between the muffin - tin `` eigenfunctions '' @xmath47 , which in turn are the linear combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath48 . due to the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath47 the self - energy also acquires @xmath3-dependence , just as the local potential in lda . \n finally , on - site green s function is found by integration using the tetrahedron method : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are right and left eigenvectors , and @xmath52 the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian operator @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the hartree hamiltonian . \n ( [ gf ] ) imposes the locality condition and is equivalent to the self - consistency condition of the dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite \n using the technique described above ( below referred to as `` gw '' ) we calculated the spectral densities @xmath55 for elemental @xmath0 and @xmath1 metals , where lda has long been the only appropriate approximation . \n we used the fcc structure for hcp elements ( sc , ti , y , zr , tc , ru , co ) and the bcc structure for mn . \n all atomic volumes were taken from experiment . \n cr was treated within the single bcc cell , and hence was non - magnetic . \n the iterations were started from the lda potential , and at each iteration the non - local self - energy was mixed to this potential with a gradually increasing weight , so that in the end only @xmath44 was left . in the final state the magnitude of @xmath44 differs by about 40% from its initial value based on the lda wave functions . \n the iterational procedure is rather stable in all metals except ni where the magnetic moment is very sensitive to the details of the calculation . \n the results are shown in figs . \n 1,2 along with the lda densities of states ( dos ) and the experimental xps and bis spectra taken from refs .  . \n strictly speaking , comparison with experiment requires the calculation of the corresponding matrix elements , but we believe that in the present context some qualitative conclusions can be drawn based on the spectral densities .    the main differences between the lda dos and gw spectral density may be summarized as follows . \n the conduction band widens as all dos features are pushed away from @xmath13 ; this outward shift is roughly proportional to the distance from @xmath13 . \n moreover , all dos features are increasingly smeared out due to the decreasing quasiparticle lifetime as the distance from @xmath13 increases . \n substantial spectral weight is transferred from the quasiparticle states to the incoherent `` tail '' extending far below @xmath56 . \n the lda dos for @xmath2-metals is typically too small to account for experimentally measured electronic specific heat @xmath57 . as seen from figs .  1,2 \n , the gw spectral density at @xmath13 is generally smaller compared to lda . \n although to obtain @xmath58 we have to remove the renormalization factor @xmath59 from @xmath60 , the gw method does not improve the overall agreement with @xmath58 measurements . \n the differences between the gw and lda spectra are most notable for early transition metals ( treated here in the fcc structure ) where the strongest unoccupied peaks given by lda are almost completely smeared out in gw . \n notably , the worst agreement with experiment for the lda spectra is observed for the same elements . \n in particular , the position of the fermi level obtained in lda for hcp sc and y appears to be off by nearly 1  ev.xps    the agreement between lda and gw improves as we progress to later transition metals and as the fcc structure is replaced by the bcc one . \n already in v and nb the gw and lda curves are quite similar except for the shift of the unoccupied @xmath2-peak by 1.52  ev to higher energies .    as in lda , the @xmath0 metals from mn to ni were magnetic in our calculation . for simplicity \n , we used the bcc structure for mn , and also the fcc structure for co ( this structure is often realized in thin films ) . as it is seen from fig .  1 , \n the general features of the gw spectral density described above are observed in these metals as well . in general , the gw description also gives a reasonable exchange splitting and magnetic moment . \n we obtained the moments of 0.9  @xmath61 for mn compared to 1.03  @xmath61 in lda , 2.3  @xmath61 for fe compared to 2.25  @xmath61 in lda , and 1.85  @xmath61 for fcc co compared to 1.62  @xmath61 in lda . from these results \n it is clear that there is no systematic trend for gw to give larger or smaller magnetic moments compared to lda . \n the magnetic moment in ni is rather sensitive to various details of the calculation , and proper convergence turned out to be problematic . \n we believe that the approach based on matsubara green s functions is necessary to stabilize this problem . apart from the exchange \n splitting , the shape of the spectrum is quite stable . \n we also note that the magnetic moment is expected to be sensitive to the choice of the skeleton graph set .    as an example of the general trend of band dilatation off the fermi level , \n the distance from @xmath13 to the upper edge of the fully occupied @xmath2-band in cu and ag is notably larger in gw compared to lda , which results in a better agreement with experimental xps spectra . on the other hand \n , we also observe a rather strong upward shift of the unoccupied peak in v , nb , fe and mo in obvious disagreement with the bis spectra . \n this shift is more pronounced compared to the downward shift of the occupied states at a similar distance from @xmath13 . \n the results presented above demonstrate that self - consistent gf approach with one - site approximation can be used for ground state studies . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems we have shown that the gw spectral density is generally similar to the lda density of states , while the gf approach includes typical fermi - liquid effects such as finite quasiparticle lifetime and self - consistent renormalization . \n the preliminary comparison with experiment is rather satisfactory and clearly indicates the problems that need improvement beyond our simple gw - osa technique are similar to those in lda  the exchange splitting in ferromagnets , value of @xmath62 , and the unoccupied peak position which is too high for some metals . \n in general , the presented technique based on the luttinger - ward functional is a practical alternative to other methods based on the density functional theory and can serve as a reliable starting point for more sophisticated methods .. \n this work was carried out at the ames laboratory , which is operated for the u.s . \n department of energy by iowa state university under contract no . \n w-7405 -

[ [ the - importance - of - circumstellar - disks ] ] the importance of circumstellar disks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    circumstellar disks are an important part of the star formation process and are ubiquitous around young stars . even though they seem to be relatively short lived , they impact strongly on stellar evolution . \n the interaction between the disk and the stellar magnetic field plays a central role in angular momentum regulation and it is thereby likely to influence the spread of rotation rates in young stars . \n young stars may also accrete a significant fraction of their final mass from their disks , so disk evolution could impact strongly on theoretical pms models and attempts to determine stellar masses and ages . \n + two very important questions are disk dissipation timescales and its possible mass dependence . \n disk dissipation timescales might be the strongest factor in determining the timescales for planet formation or whether planets form at all in a particular stellar system \n . this could be even more crucial in ob associations where there are exterior sources of photo - evaporating radiation . \n mass dependence of disk dissipation could be important in the context of brown dwarf formation . \n it has been proposed that brown dwarfs form by ejection from their parent systems ; numerical simulations ( bate et al . \n 2003 ) propose that the dynamical interactions that eject brown dwarfs also truncate their disks , making them relatively small and of low mass . \n a testable prediction of such models is that brown dwarf disks dissipate faster . \n [ [ the - sigmaorionis - cluster ] ] the @xmath0orionis cluster + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath0orionis is a trapezium - like system with an o9.5v primary . \n the population of low - mass stars spatially clustered around this system was discovered as bright sources in rosat x - ray images , and follow - up optical spectroscopy confirmed most sources as pms stars ( walter et al . \n this association is young , nearby and affected by low reddening , making it an ideal target to analyse the pms population , even down to brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects . \n the main goal of the work we summarise here is to probe the properties of the pms population in the @xmath0ori cluster , establishing a representative sample of cluster members and analysing the frequency and properties of circumstellar disks . \n [ [ photometric - surveys ] ] photometric surveys + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    firstly , it is necessary to identify the low - mass pms content near @xmath0ori . \n fig.1 ( left ) shows an @xmath1 colour - magnitude diagram , obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , where the pms stars can be seen separated from the bulk of the contamination . \n it was based on this diagram that targets were identified for follow - up spectroscopy . \n the figure also shows ( right ) the @xmath5 colour - magnitude diagram for cluster members  j - magnitude comes from the 2mass database . \n it shows most of the ( over 100 ) cluster members identified so far , either by us ( see below ) or from the literature ( e.g.  bjar et al . 2001 ; zapatero osorio et al . 2002 ) . \n overplotted are the model tracks and isochrones from baraffe et al . \n we estimate that the median age of the cluster is approximately 4myr ( oliveira et al . \n 2002 ) and the sample covers the mass range 0.02@xmath61m@xmath3 . \n it is worth pointing out that a large number of brown dwarfs have been identified ( 30@xmath640 depending on the adopted age ) . \n several isolated planetary mass objects ( @xmath7m@xmath3 ) have been discovered in the cluster ( e.g. zapatero osorio et al . \n 2000 ) . \n [ [ membership - analysis ] ] membership analysis + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the main drives of our spectroscopic observations was to investigate how efficient photometric surveys are in identifying pms stars and thus cluster members . \n this is actually quite important for the disk frequency analysis as contamination leads to lower disk frequencies . \n + we have performed spectroscopic observations of approximately 70 photometric cluster candidates with wyffos at the william hershel telescope ( wht ) . \n we use 3 means of diagnostic for cluster membership : radial velocity measurements ( compared with the cluster mean of @xmath832kms@xmath9 ) , the equivalent width of the lii 6708  feature ( a fragile element that remains unburned for stars younger than 10myr ) , and the equivalent width of the nai 8190  doublet ( a gravity indicator that is very weak in the spectra of giant stars , is strong for field dwarfs and weak for pms stars ) . using these indicators together we are able to firmly identify cluster members and binary candidates . \n we found that 90% of the objects in the photometric sample are indeed cluster members . \n this implies that photometric surveys are quite efficient in identifying cluster members . \n this analysis is described in kenyon et al . \n ( 2003 in preparation ) . \n we have an on - going program to survey the circumstellar disk population in the @xmath0 ori cluster . \n the traditional first step is to look for k - band excesses in our sample of cluster members . using @xmath10 photometry from 2mass , \n it has been established ( oliveira et al . \n 2002 ; barrado y navascus 2003 ) that at most 10% of the cluster members exhibit a k - band excess that could indicate the presence of a circumstellar disk . \n however , a k - band excess is an unreliable disk indicator . \n it depends strongly on the inner disk temperature ; in particular for the lower mass stars , there is evidence that their disks are not hot enough to produce significant k - band excess ( natta & testi 2001 ; comern et al . \n 2000 ) .      at longer wavelengths , \n infrared excesses grow rapidly thus l - band observations are the most reliable and efficient way to detect circumstellar disks , down to the substellar regime . \n we have a program to observe all known @xmath0ori cluster members in the l - band ( and also in the k - band to avoid uncertainties related with variability , carpenter et al . \n 2002 ) ; we have obtained data in january 2003 with the newly installed uist at the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . \n due to adverse weather conditions we could only perform about 30% of the program , observing the targets in the mass range 0.2@xmath61.0m@xmath3 . \n we have since then been allocated more observing time at ukirt to complete this program . \n + fig.2 shows colour - colour diagrams for the sample observed at ukirt . on the top left \n is the 2mass @xmath10 diagram ; only one object has a significant k - band excess , indicative of a circumstellar disk . \n the situation changes dramatically in the @xmath11 diagram ( top right ) where many stars seem to exhibit @xmath12 excess , evidence of circumstellar disks . \n a very revealing diagram is @xmath13 ( bottom ) . both photometric variability in i- and j - band and reddening would move an object s position almost horizontally in this diagram , while a disk excess moves an object vertically . \n this means that the diagnostic value of this diagram for the detection of disks is for all effects insensitive to variability and reddening . \n at least 30% of the objects seem to have an excess that indicates the presence of a circumstellar disk , but this value might be as high as 50% . only the computation of the intrinsic colour for each object will reveal the true percentage of objects with an excess ( oliveira et al . \n 2003 in preparation ) . \n l - band observations are adequate for disk surveys , but in order to characterise circumstellar disk properties , observations at even longer wavelengths are necessary . based on estimates from the original iras data for the possible mid - ir emission of pms stars around @xmath0ori \n , we have targetted 12 such objects with timmi2 at the eso 3.6 m telescope to obtain n - band photometry , as well as q - band photometry and n - band spectroscopy for the brightest amongst them . \n + fig.3 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these sources \n . indicated in the upper right corner of each graph is the spectral index @xmath4  that is a measure of the mid - ir excess . \n the three objects on the top row , @xmath0ori itself , @xmath0ori e and a rosat source are the more massive , early spectral type objects . \n their seds are consistent with the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody ( @xmath14 ) , so there is no excess emission . \n the other objects all show an excess at these wavelengths , evidence of circumstellar disks . \n for instance , tx ori has @xmath15 consistent with a classii classification ( classical t tauri star , ctts ) ; the spectrum in the n - band reveals a feature consistent with silicate dust emission at 10@xmath16 m . \n based on the value of @xmath4 , most objects can be classified as classii objects . \n two objects exhibit seds that suggest more complex circumstellar structures : v510ori ( associated with a jet ) has @xmath4 consistent with a flat - spectrum source and iras05358 - 0238 has @xmath4 consistent with a classi source ( an intermediate state between an embedded class0 source and a ctts ) . \n this analysis is described in full in oliveira & van loon ( 2003 in preparation ) . \n we have combined photometric and spectroscopic surveys and identified a very significant number of cluster members , that together with other surveys constitutes a unique sample of pms objects , covering the mass range 0.02@xmath61.0m@xmath3 . \n + we have begun a program to search for cluster members with circumstellar disks in the l - band . \n preliminary results on a representative sample ( 0.2@xmath61.0m@xmath3 ) indicate that at least 30% of @xmath0ori cluster members have circumstellar disks . \n when compared with two other clusters of similar ages ( ngc2264 at @xmath83.2myr and ngc2362 at @xmath85myr ) , a disk frequency of 30% for the @xmath0ori cluster would fit nicely between these two clusters ( disk frequencies respectively 52% and 12% ) , broadly agreeing with the 6myr timescale for all stars to lose their disk as proposed by haisch et al . \n as our l - band survey does not yet reach low enough masses , we are not able to address the issue of mass dependence of disk frequency . \n we intend to continue our program to search for and characterise circumstellar disks around fainter members of the @xmath0ori cluster .    99 baraffe i. , chabrier g. , allard f. , hauschildt p. , 1998 \n , a&a 337 , 403 barrado y navascus d. , bjar v.j.s . , mundt r. et al . , 2003 , \n a&a in press bate m.r . , \n bonnell i.a . , bromm v. , 2003 , mnras 339 , 577 bjar v.j.s . \n , martn e.l . , zapatero osorio m.r . \n et al . , 2001 , \n apj 556 , 830 brown a.g.a . , 2001 , \n rmxac , 1 , 89 carpenter j.m . , \n hillenbrand l.a . \n , skrutskie m.f . \n et al . , 2002 , aj 124 , 1001 comern f. , neuhuser r. , kaas a. , 2000 , a&a 359 , 269 haisch k.e . , lada e.a . , lada c.j . , 2001 , \n apj 553 , 153 natta a. , testi l. , 2001 , a&a 376 , 22 oliveira j.m . \n , jeffries r.d . , kenyon m.j . \n et al . , 2002 , \n a&a 382 , 22 walter f.m . , \n wolk s.j . , freyberg m. , schmitt j.h.m.m.,1997 , mmsai 68 , 1081 walter f.m . , alcala j.m . , neuhauser r. et al . , 2001 , in protostars and planets iv , university of arizona press , eds . mannings v. , boss a.p . , russell s.s . \n , 273 zapatero osorio m.r . \n , bjar v.j.s . \n , martn e.l . \n et al . , 2000 , sci 290 , 103 zapatero osorio m.r . , bjar v.j.s . , pavlenko y. et al . , 2002 , a&a 384 , 937", "StartTimeOffset": 2539450338673, "RequestID": "7149c90a7b4c4e4e8592225aee73b672", "TotalTokens": 3975}

the - fly observations we have obtained a set of 12  400 spectra for each transition with typical integration time of 48 s. basic technical description of the data \n is given in table  1 . \n it should be noted that the sensitivity of the survey in both lines is rather poor . \n furthermore , because of changing atmospheric conditions the data quality is not homogeneous . \n hence , special data reduction procedures were needed to visualize the data ( e.g. clipping method ) .    from an analysis of the spectra averaged over all the positions and from the channel maps we have found that the molecular emission in the mapped region comes mainly from matter at radial velocities of @xmath7=1832 km  s@xmath4 and @xmath8=4457  km  s@xmath4 . adopting a galactic rotation curve from @xcite \n the two velocity ranges correspond to kinematical distances of @xmath9=2.33.0 kpc and @xmath10=6.26.5 kpc , respectively . \n these values are in good agreement with distances to two spiral arms in the direction of v838  mon , i.e. perseus arm ( 3 kpc ) and norma  cygnus arm ( 6.25 kpc ) . \n we have estimated physical parameters for the clouds emitting in co. adopting @xmath9 as distances to these structures we have got values of the physical parameters typical for molecular clouds .    in fig . \n 2 we present the map of intensity integrated over two velocity ranges ( spectra used to obtain map were earlier clipped at @xmath11 level ) for the co  ( 21 ) transition . the co  ( 32 ) map looks similar so we do not present it here . \n no significant emission can be seen around v838 mon up to a radius of about 40. in particular there is no shell - like structure around the star , contrary to the claim of @xcite . \n all the significant emission west from the star position comes from ordinary giant molecular clouds in the galactic disk . \n lccc co line & @xmath0 = 1@xmath10 & @xmath0 = 2@xmath11 & @xmath0 = 3@xmath12 + beam & 55  & 130 `` & 82 '' + @xmath12 [ k ] &  231 @xmath13 286 &  153 @xmath13 230 &  230 @xmath13 377 + vel . range [ km s@xmath4 ] & 139 @xmath13 189&106 @xmath13 216&121 @xmath13 231 + @xmath15 [ km \n s@xmath4]&0.37&0.21&0.29 + @xmath16 [ k ] & 0.09&0.42&0.93 +     = 2@xmath11 integrated over two velocity ranges : 1832 km s@xmath4 ( contours ) and 4457 km s@xmath4 ( grey scale ) . \n contours are plotted from 2.7 to 64.1 k  km  s@xmath4 by 6.8 k  km  s@xmath4 ( 4 to 94% by 10% of the maximum ) . \n the v838  mon position is marked a star -

type stars ( bond et al . \n 2006 , this issue ) . \n principle technical details of our observations in co ( 10 ) are presented in table  1 . \n average 3@xmath19 level for these observations is of @xmath20.3  k , which gives a better sensitivity than that of the galactic survey by @xcite in the same transition . \n significant co  ( 10 ) emission is seen only for points west of the star position , in the area where we have also found emission in co ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) ( see  3.1 ) . the emission is always related to molecular clouds ( what has already been noted by * ? ? ? \n * ) . among the points in the ring - like structure claimed in @xcite we have found a clear emission only at an offset @xmath20=12 , @xmath21=1 ( see upper and right axes in fig .  1 , \n the offset is given in respect to the star position ) . \n the emission is weak , @xmath220.6  k , and narrow , @xmath23=1.9  km  s@xmath4 . \n it is at a radial velocity of @xmath8=49.2  km  s@xmath4 , only @xmath25  km  s@xmath4 different from the velocity of v838  mon ( 54.3  km  s@xmath4 ) . \n our observations in co  ( 10 ) show that the shell - like structure suggested by @xcite does not exist . \n detection of the emission at 12 from the star ( 20  pc at 6  kpc ) suggests that there can be a weak extended molecular emission near v838  mon , below the sensitivity of our observations . \n observations with a better sensitivity are needed to verify if this molecular matter can be related to the echoing matter . \n v838 mon itself was observed in the three lowest rotational transitions of co with longer integration times . \n observational details are summarized in table  2 .    in the co ( 10 ) \n transition the v838  mon position was observed only once . \n we did not find any emission stronger than @xmath24  k ( @xmath11 ) . \n we also observed 8 positions around the star , i.e. points with offsets of @xmath25 , with shorter integration times . \n in all these positions we did not detect any emission higher than @xmath26  k ( @xmath11 ) . \n the area covered by these 9 points corresponds to that of the light echo in the fall of 2005 . \n thus the echoing matter is not seen at the sensitivity of our observations .    in co ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) we have spectra obtained in april and december 2005 . in the spring spectra \n we have found emission only in the co  ( 21 ) transition at a radial velocity of @xmath27  km  s@xmath4 , almost the same as the velocity of the sio maser emission @xcite . in the spectra obtained in december with much longer integration times we have found two components in both transitions . apart from the already known component at @xmath28  km  s@xmath4 , an emission is also seen at a radial velocity of @xmath29  km  s@xmath4 . \n the line intensities , widths and peak velocities are presented in table  3 . \n all the lines are very narrow . \n the component at @xmath30  km  s@xmath4 is stronger in the co ( 21 ) transition , while that at @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 is stronger in co ( 32 ) . \n when one compares the line intensities in april and december it looks like the strength of the component at @xmath32  km  s@xmath4 decreased . however , the observed change is close to the measurment uncertainty so this finding is not conclusive . \n the beam widths of our observations in co ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) are rather large ( 130  and 82  , respectively ) . \n therefore we can not say whether the emission detected at the v838 mon position comes from the closest stellar vicinity or from regions which are located at a few tens of arcmin from the star . \n it should be noted that a search for molecular emission ( including co and sio maser ) in 2003 gave negative result @xcite . the detected emission in the co lines may indicate that a molecular activity has started close to v838  mon , but its origin is unclear \n . further observations with a better angular resolution would be of particular interest in this point . \n ccccccc date&line&@xmath12&@xmath33&@xmath15&velocity range&@xmath19 + & & [ k]&[khz]&[km  s@xmath4]&[km  s@xmath4]&[k ] + 04 apr.&21&168&165.4&0.21&106.4 @xmath13 171.4&0.043 + & 32&273&339.1&0.29&121.4 @xmath13 186.4&0.083 + & & & & & & + 02 nov.&10&245&142.1&0.37&139.5 @xmath13 188.7&0.072 + & & & & & & + 26 dec.&21&310&165.4&0.21&206.8 @xmath13 233.5&0.014 + & 32&418&339.3&0.29&289.5 @xmath13 250.4&0.022 +    ccrccc date&line&&&fwhm&int . \n intensity + & & [ km  s@xmath4 ] & & [ km  s@xmath4]&[k km  s@xmath4 ] + 04 apr.&21 & 53.3 & 0.553&1.174&0.691 + 26 dec.&21 & 11.1&0.099&1.075&0.114 + & & 53.3 & 0.323&1.179&0.406 + & 32 & 11.0&0.188&1.148&0.230 + & & 53.2&0.156&1.500&0.190 +      the kosma 3 m telescope is operated by the klner observatorium fr submillimeter astronomie of the i.  physikalisches institut , universitt zu kln in collaboration with the radioastronomisches institut , universitt bonn . \n claussen , m. , healy , k. r. , starrfield , s. , & bond , h. e. 2005 in aas meeting 207 , 182.12 brand , j. & blitz , l. 1993 , a&a , 275 , 67 dame , t. m. , hartmann , d. , & thaddeus p. 2001 \n , apj , 547 , 792 deguchi , s. , matsunaga , n. , & fukushi , h. 2005 , pasj , 57 , 933 van loon , j. th . , \n evans , a. , rushton , m. t. , & smalley , b. 2004 , a&a , 427 , 193 rushton , m. t. , coulson , i. m. , evans , a. , nyman , l .-  . , \n smalley , b. , geballe , t. r. , van loon , j. th . , \n eyres , s. p. s. , & tyne , v. h. 2003 , a&a , 412 , 767 tylenda , r. , soker , n. , & szczerba , r. 2005 , a&a , 441 , 1099", "StartTimeOffset": 2544896577398, "RequestID": "81faed0d41ac4f528de84083b2872531", "TotalTokens": 4056}

{"ContextTokens": 3947, "GeneratedTokens": 168, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of the dynamics of stars and gas in galaxies have provided important evidence for the existence of dark matter halos around galaxies . \n these studies have also shown that tight relations exist between the baryonic and dark matter components . \n the latter findings provide important constraints for models of galaxy formation , as their origin needs to be explained .    however , dynamical methods require visible tracers , which typically can be observed only in the central regions of galaxies , where baryons are dynamically important . in this regime , the accuracy of simulations is limited and the physics complicated . \n hence the interpretation of observations is complicated and one needs to proceed cautiously . \n in addition assumptions about the orbit structure need to be made . instead \n , it would be more convenient to have observational constraints on quantities that are robust ( both observationally and theoretically ) and easily extracted from numerical simulations . \n an obvious quantity of interest is the virial mass of the galaxy . \n fortunately , in recent years it has become possible to probe the outer regions of galaxy dark matter halos , either through the dynamics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. , prada et al . 2003 ) or weak gravitational lensing . in these proceedings \n we focus on the latter approach , which uses the fact that the tidal gravitational field of the dark matter halo introduces small coherent distortions in the images of distant background galaxies . \n this signal can nowadays be easily detected in data from large imaging surveys . \n it is important to note , however , that weak lensing can not be used to study individual galaxies , but ensemble averaged properties instead .    since the first detection of this so - called galaxy - galaxy lensing signal by brainerd et al . \n ( 1996 ) , the significance of the measurements has improved dramatically , thanks to new wide field ccd cameras on a number of mostly 4 m class telescopes . \n this has allowed various groups to image large areas of the sky , yielding the large numbers of lenses and sources needed to measure the lensing signal . \n results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provided a major improvement ( e.g. , fisher et al . \n 2000 ; mckay et al . 2001 ) over early studies . \n apart from the increased surveyed area , an important advantage of the more recent sdss studies ( mckay et al . \n 2001 ; guzik & seljak 2002 ) is the availability of ( photometric ) redshift information for the lenses and sources . \n this has enabled studies of the dark matter properties as a function of baryonic content .    here , \n we highlight recent progress by presenting results from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; gladders & yee 2005 ) . recently hsieh et al . \n ( 2005 ) derived photometric redshifts for a subset of the rcs and we use these results to study the virial mass as a function of luminosity . \n we also present measurements of the extent of dark matter halos and discuss measurements of their shapes . \n we conclude by discussing what to expect in the near future , when much larger surveys start producing results . \n -band luminosity bins . to account for the fact that the lenses have a range in redshifts , \n the signal is scaled such that it corresponds to that of a lens at the average lens redshift ( @xmath0 ) and a source redshift of infinity the mean restframe @xmath1-band luminosity for each bin is also shown in the figure in units of @xmath2l@xmath3 . \n the strength of the lensing signal clearly increases with increasing luminosity of the lens . \n the dotted line indicates the best fit nfw model to the data . \n [ gtprof],width=453 ] \n one of the major advantages of weak gravitational lensing over most dynamical methods is that the lensing signal can be measured out to large projected distances from the lens . \n however , at large radii , the contribution from a particular galaxy may be small compared to its surroundings : a simple interpretation of the measurements can only be made for ` isolated ' galaxies . \n what one actually observes , is the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function . \n this can be compared directly to models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , tasitsiomi et al . 2004 ) . \n alternatively , one can attempt to select only isolated galaxies or one can deconvolve the cross - correlation function , while making some simplifying assumptions . in this section \n we discuss results for ` isolated ' galaxies , whereas in the next section , which deals with the extent of dark matter halos , we use the deconvolution method .    a detailed discussion of the results presented in this section can be found in hoekstra et al . \n the measurements presented here are based on a subset of the rcs for which photometric redshifts were determined using @xmath4 photometry ( hsieh et al . 2005 ) . \n we selected galaxies with redshifts @xmath5 and @xmath6 , resulting in a sample of @xmath7 lenses . \n however , to simplify the interpretation of the results , we proceed by selecting ` isolated ' lenses . to do so \n , we only consider lenses that are at least 30 arcseconds away from a brighter galaxy ( see hoekstra et al . , 2005 for details ) . \n note , that bright galaxies are not necessarily isolated . for such galaxies , however , we expect the lensing signal to be dominated by the galaxy itself , and not its fainter companions . \n we split the sample into 7 luminosity bins and measure the mean tangential distortion out to 2 arcminutes from the lens . \n the resulting tangential shear profiles are shown in figure  [ gtprof ] for the bins of increasing rest - frame @xmath1 luminosity . \n the results for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band are very similar . \n we estimate the virial mass for each bin by fitting a a nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) profile to the signal . \n the resulting virial mass as a function of rest - frame luminosity is presented in figure  [ ml_all ] . \n these findings suggest a power - law relation between the mass and the luminosity , although this assumption might not hold at the low luminosity end . \n we fit a power - law model to the measurements and find that the slope is @xmath10 for all three filters . \n this results is in good agreement with results from the sdss ( guzik & seljak , 2002 ) and predictions from models of galaxy formation ( yang et al . \n as stressed by guzik & seljak ( 2002 ) , the observed slope implies that rotation curves must decline substantially from the optical to the virial radius .    ._lower \n panels : _ observed rest - frame virial mass - to - light ratios . \n the results suggest a rise in the mass - to - light ratio with increasing luminosity , albeit with low significance . \n [ ml_all],width=453 ]    for a galaxy with a luminosity of @xmath11 we obtain a virial mass of @xmath12 . \n we note that if the mass - luminosity relation has an intrinsic scatter , our mass estimates are biased low ( tasitsiomi et al . \n the amplitude of this bias depends on the assumed intrinsic scatter . \n the results presented in tasitsiomi et al . \n ( 2004 ) , however , do indicate that the slope of the mass - luminosity relation is not affected . \n the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function is the convolution of the galaxy distribution and the underlying galaxy dark matter profiles . \n provided we have a model for the latter , we can ` predict ' the expected lensing signal . \n such an approach naturally accounts for the presence of neighbouring galaxies . \n it essentially allows us to deconvolve the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function , under the assumption that all clustered matter is associated with the lenses . \n if the matter in galaxy groups ( or clusters ) is associated with the halos of the group members ( i.e. , the halos are indistinguishable from the halos of isolated galaxies ) our results should give a fair estimate of the extent of galaxy halos . \n however , if a significant fraction of the dark matter is distributed in common halos , a simple interpretation of the results becomes more difficult .     and \n scale radius @xmath13 for a fiducial galaxy with @xmath14 , with an nfw profile . \n the corresponding values for @xmath15 are indicated on the right axis . \n the contours indicate the 68.3% , 95.4% , and the 99.7% confidence on two parameters jointly . \n the cross indicates the best fit value . \n the dotted line indicates the predictions from the numerical simulations , which are in excellent agreement with our results . \n [ size_nfw],width=396 ]    we use such a maximum likelihood approach to place constraints on the properties of dark matter halos . \n a detailed discussion of the results can be found in hoekstra et al . \n the analysis presented here uses only @xmath16 imaging data from the rcs , and therefore lacks redshift information for the individual lenses . \n nevertheless , these measurements allow us to place tight constraints on the extent and masses of dark matter halos . \n in our maximum likelihood analysis we consider @xmath13 and @xmath17 ( or equivalently the mass @xmath15 ) as free parameters . \n figure  [ size_nfw ] shows the joint constraints on @xmath17 and scale radius @xmath13 for a fiducial galaxy with @xmath18 , when we use an nfw profile for the galaxy dark matter profile . \n numerical simulations of cdm , however , show that the parameters in the nfw model are correlated , albeit with some scatter . \n hence , the simulations make a definite prediction for the value of @xmath17 as a function of @xmath13 . \n the dotted line in figure  [ size_nfw ] indicates this prediction . \n if the simulations provide a good description of dark matter halos , the dotted line should intersect our confidence region , which it does . \n this result provides important support for the cdm paradigm , as it predicts the correct `` size '' of dark matter halos . \n it is important to note that this analysis is a direct test of cdm ( albeit not conclusive ) , because the weak lensing results are inferred from the gravitational potential at large distances from the galaxy center , where dark matter dominates . \n most other attempts to test cdm are confined to the inner regions , where baryons are , or might be , important . \n another prediction from cdm simulations is that halos are not spherical but triaxial instead . \n we note , however , it is not completely clear how the interplay with baryons might change this . \n for instance , kazantzidis et al . ( \n 2004 ) find that similations with gas cooling are significantly rounder than halos formed in adiabatic simulations , an effect that is found to persist almost out to the virial radius . \n hence , a measurement of the average shape of dark matter halos is important , because both observational and theoretical constraints are limited . \n weak gravitational lensing is potentially one of the most powerfuls way to derive constraints on the shapes of dark matter halos . \n the amount of data required for such a measurement , however , is very large : the galaxy lensing signal itself is tiny , and now one needs to measure an even smaller azimuthal variation \n . we also have to make assumptions about the alignment between the galaxy and the surrounding halo . \n an imperfect alignment between light and halo will reduce the amplitude of the azimuthal variation detectable in the weak lensing analysis . \n hence , weak lensing formally provides a lower limit to the average halo ellipticity . \n hoekstra et al . \n ( 2004 ) attempted such a measurement , again using a maximum likelihood model . \n they adopted a simple approach , and assumed that the ( projected ) ellipticity of the dark matter halo is proportional to the shape of the galaxy : @xmath19 . \n this yielded a a best fit value of @xmath20 ( 68% confidence ) , suggesting that , on average , the dark matter distribution is rounder than the light distribution . \n note , however , that even with a data set such as the rcs , the detection is marginal . a similar , quick analysis of imaging data from the cfhtls and virmos - descart surveys give lower values for @xmath21 , suggesting that the rcs result is on the high side . \n recently , an independent weak lensing measurement of halo shapes was reported by mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) , based on sdss observations . for the full sample of lenses \n they do not detect an azimuthal variation of the signal , which is somewhat at odds with the hoekstra et al . \n ( 2004 ) findings . however , as mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) argue , the comparison is difficult at best , because of different sensitivity to lens populations , etc . and differences in the analyses . however , the approach used by mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) has the nice feature that it is more ` direct ' , compared to the maximum likelihood approach . \n the latter ` always gives an answer ' , but in our case it is difficult to determine what scales or galaxies contribute most to the signal . interestingly , \n mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) also split the sample into blue ( spiral ) and red ( elliptical ) galaxies . \n the results suggest a positive alignment between the dark matter halo and the brightest sample of ellipticals , whereas the spiral galaxies might be aligned perpendicular to the disks . \n although the signal in both cases is consistent with 0 , it nevertheless provides an interesting that deserves further study . \n the results presented in the previous two section provide a crude picture of what weak lensing studies of galaxy halos can accomplish with current data sets . for galaxy - galaxy lensing studies \n both the rcs and sdss data sets provide the most accurate results , with sdss having the advantage of a larger number of galaxies with ( photometric ) redshift information . \n even though these are early results ( the galaxy - galaxy lensing was first detected less than a decade ago ) , already we can place interesting constraints on the properties of dark matter halos and the stellar contents of galaxies . \n much larger surveys have started . \n for instance , the second generation rcs aims to image almost 850 deg@xmath22 in @xmath23 . \n these data provide more than an order of magnitude improvement over the results discussed in these proceedings . \n the kilo degree survey ( kids ) will start observations soon using the vlt survey telescope . \n this survey will image @xmath24 deg@xmath22 ( to a depth similar to that of rcs2 ) in five filters , thus adding photometric redshift information for most of the lenses . \n the canada - france - hawaii - telescope legacy survey will also provide important measurement of the lensing signal induced by galaxies . \n it is much deeper than rcs2 or kids , but will survey a smaller area of @xmath25 deg@xmath22 , with cosmic shear measurements as the primary science driver . \n nevertheless its signal - to - noise ratio of the measurements will be comparable to the rcs2 , but it will have the advantage of accurate photometric redshift information from the 5 color photometry . thanks to its added depth , it is also well suited to study the evolution of galaxy properties . \n dedicated survey telescopes such as panstarrs or the lsst will image large portions of the sky , thus increasing survey area by another order of magnitude to a significant fraction of the sky . \n one of the most interesting results from these projects will be a definite measurement of the average shape of dark matter halos . \n we can expect much progress on this front in the next few years . although there is much reason for optimism \n , we also need to be somewhat cautious : the accuracy of the measurements is increasing rapidly , but it is not clear to what extent the interpretation of the results can keep up . \n the early results , presented here , have statistical errors that are larger than the typical model uncertainty . \n however , as measurement errors become are significantly smaller , it becomes much more difficult to interpret the measurements : some more subtle effects arising from neigbouring galaxies or satellite galaxies can no longer be ignored . \n instead , it will become necessary to compare the lensing measurements ( i.e. , the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function as a function of galaxy properties ) to results of simulations directly . \n these future studies will provide unique constraints on models of galaxy formation as they provide measures of the role dark matter plays in galaxy formation . \n much of the work presented here would not have been possible without the efforts of the members of the rcs team . \n in particular i acknowledge the work of paul hsieh and hun lin on the photometric redshifts and howard yee and mike gladders on their work on rcs in general .", "StartTimeOffset": 2597842545071, "RequestID": "5c1e3ab8744449ddb4b33c93de2fd901", "TotalTokens": 4115}
{"ContextTokens": 4046, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "in a highly conductive and strongly turbulent plasma like the solar photosphere random small - scale deviations of the flow field from mirror symmetry are expected to incessantly generate small magnetic flux loops of random orientation . \n this is a miniature analogue of the large - scale dynamo process occurring in a globally non - mirror - symmetric flow , for which reason it is known as small - scale dynamo action ( # leorat+:smalldyn.closure##2##3#leorat+:smalldyn.closure@xcite # leorat+:smalldyn.closure##2##3##3@xcite

loops , \n no net large - scale field will arise , but a non - zero mean magnetic energy density @xmath0 and mean unsigned flux density @xmath1 results . \n most of this turbulent flux resides in magnetic structures with scales much smaller than the characteristic scale of the turbulent velocity field ( which is the granular scale of @xmath2 km in the solar case ) . \n traditional zeeman magnetography is `` blind '' to these fields as the net circular polarization of the mixed polarity small - scale field cancels out in a resolution element . \n it has long been recognized that the hanle effect ( magnetic depolarization of linearly polarized radiation ) may offer a way to detect the turbulent fields ( # stenflo : hanlelimit##2##3#stenflo : hanlelimit@xcite # stenflo : hanlelimit##2##3##3@xcite ) . the observational study of turbulent fields has however been hampered by the shortage of observational data , by the lack of a reliable radiative transfer theory for polarized radiation in magnetic fields and by the fact that beside turbulent fields , the hanle effect is also due to resolved magnetic elements ( network , ephemeral active regions ) and to the overlying canopy fields ( especially for lines formed higher in the atmosphere ) . \n nevertheless , in recent years important advances have been made in all these areas ( # faurob##2##3#faurob@xcite # faurob##2##3##3@xcite , # faurob+me##2##3#faurob+me@xcite # faurob+me##2##3##3@xcite , # bianda+:ca##2##3#bianda+:ca@xcite # bianda+:ca##2##3##3@xcite , # bianda+:sr##2##3#bianda+:sr@xcite #

: nature@xcite # landi : nature##2##3##3@xcite ) .    on of the most intriguing recent discoveries is the finding of # stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3#stenflo+:hanle.fluct@xcite ( # stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3##3@xcite ) that the degree of linear polarization @xmath3 shows large amplitude random variations over the solar disk . \n while , as mentioned above , canopy fields , network elements and ephemeral active regions may also contribute to the observed hanle depolarization , it is still likely that at least part of this observed spatial variation is due to the presence of similar fluctuations in the flux density @xmath1 of the turbulent photospheric magnetic field . \n the presence of fluctuations should not come as a surprise from a theoretical point of view . \n after all , in the turbulent solar photosphere any physical quantity should show fluctuations , and even variations of an amplitude comparable to the mean value are commonplace . what is more surprising is the _ spatial scale of the fluctuations . \n while the observations have a resolution of about @xmath4 along the slit , the dominant variations seem to occur on the much larger scale of @xmath5 km . \n variations on the granular scale are of much smaller amplitude . \n ( see e.g.  fig .  3 in # stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3#stenflo+:hanle.fluct@xcite # stenflo+:hanle.fluct##2##3##3@xcite . ) \n the real theoretical challenge is therefore to understand how the dominant scale of fluctations of turbulent flux density can be so much larger than the turbulence scale ? _ \n one popular explanation for the existence of large - scale photospheric structures ( such as supergranulation ) is that they are the `` imprints '' of processes going on deeper down in the convective zone where the characteristic scales ( determined by the pressure scale height @xmath6 ) are larger . \n alternatively , it is of course also possible that the large scales are due to some local photospheric process like an inverse cascade . in order to resolve this problem \n , we need a model for the generation and transport of turbulent magnetic flux that takes into account both the generation and saturation processes constituting the small - scale dynamo and the turbulent transport of @xmath1 throughout the underlying convective zone . in the following such a model \n will be presented . \n the evolution equation for the unsigned flux density @xmath1 of the turbulent field should read something like @xmath7 as the transport of the highly intermittent magnetic field in a turbulent plasma is due to advection of flux tubes irrespective of their polarity , the transport terms are expected to be identical to those for the signed field @xmath8 . for simplicity , here we consider an isotropic turbulent diffusion with diffusivity @xmath9 ( first term on the r.h.s . ) , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 being the correlation length and r.m.s . \n amplitude of the turbulent velocity field . \n the linear generation term corresponding to a small scale dynamo would lead to an exponential growth of a homogeneous @xmath1 field to infinity , were it not for a higher order term leading to the saturation of @xmath1 at a finite value @xmath12 , induced by the curvature force ( last term on r.h.s . ) . \n numerical simulations and closure calculations ( # kida+##2##3#kida+@xcite # kida+##2##3##3@xcite , # nordlund+:undershoot##2##3#nordlund+:undershoot@xcite # nordlund+:undershoot##2##3##3@xcite , # durney+:basal##2##3#durney+:basal@xcite # durney+:basal##2##3##3@xcite , # deyoung##2##3#deyoung@xcite # deyoung##2##3##3@xcite ) show that @xmath12 is about an order of magnitude lower than the equipartition flux density : @xmath13 . \n as the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are functionals of the turbulent velocity field they are expected to show considerable fluctuations around their mean values . \n hence , the flux density @xmath1 determined by the equilibrium of generation and nonlinear saturation processes will also fluctuate around its mean value @xmath16 . \n it is plausible to assume @xmath17 furthermore , introducing the notation @xmath18 , it greatly simplifies the treatment if one assumes @xmath19 . \n ( in section 3 we will consider the problem to what extent this simplification affects the results . ) \n this allows us to linearize equation ( 1 ) . in the case \n when @xmath20 varies much faster with depth than @xmath12 we obtain @xmath21 now the second term on the r.h.s . \n describes the net mean restoring effect of generation and saturation terms , tending to reduce the fluctuation @xmath20 , while the last term is the _ fluctuation generation term or _ forcing term arising owing to the turbulent fluctuations in the coefficients . _ _ \n we further introduce the ( physically plausible ) assumption that the fourier spectrum of this forcing term is dominated by those isotropic modes whose vertical phase is such that at the depth where the pressure scale height equals the inverse of their horizontal wavenumber @xmath22 they are maximal : @xmath23}\\ ] ] ( note that throughout this paper we take the logarithmic pressure @xmath24 as independent variable in the vertical direction , the depth @xmath25 being just a shorthand notation for a function @xmath26 , determined by a convection zone model . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the horizontal coordinates . ) for the solution of equation ( 3 ) we take a similar _ ansatz _ : @xmath29}\\ ] ]    let us consider one mode only . \n ( note that in this case @xmath30 can always be considered real as by virtue of our assumption about the vertical phase of modes @xmath31 may be written as @xmath32 $ ] , and the initial phase in @xmath33 can be chosen freely by a displacement of the time axis . ) we substitute ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) into ( 3 ) , simplify , and take the real part . to simplify the notation , from this point \n onwards we omit the hats . with this \n we arrive at @xmath34 this equation determines the fourier amplitude @xmath35 of each mode of horizontal wavenumber @xmath22 in the spectrum of turbulent magnetic field fluctuations . \n vertical diffusion is now separated in the first term ; horizontal diffusion and the restoring force constitute the second and third terms on the l.h.s .    the r.h.s . \n is the fourier amplitude of the forcing . \n @xmath36 is the fluctuation amplitude produced in time @xmath37 by the forcing if other terms were not present . \n as the forcing is due to the action of the fluctuating flow field on the existing magnetic field , it is plausible to assume @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the corresponding fourier amplitude in the spectrum of @xmath1 , and @xmath40 is the eddy turnover time . \n this spectrum may be determined from closure calculations , numerical simulations and observations . \n its simplest representation is by two power laws joining in a peak at @xmath41 . \n thus , we represent the r.h.s . by @xmath42 where @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 otherwise . \n ( note that in fact a spectrum with two breaks might be more realistic as the spectrum of @xmath37 is peaked at a lower wavenumber of @xmath46 ; our purpose here , however , is just to present a simple example calculation . ) \n on the basis of the observed properties of photospheric magnetic fields and motion , @xmath47 seems to be a realistic choice . \n the value of @xmath45 will be found to be irrelevant to the solution below . \n for the solution of equation ( 6 ) the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath37 are interpolated from a convective zone model . \n @xmath49 is evaluated by fitting a solution of equation ( 1 ) , with the diffusive term and the perturbations of the coefficients neglected , to profiles of @xmath50 resulting from the closure model of # deyoung##2##3#deyoung@xcite ( # deyoung##2##3##3@xcite ) ; this yields @xmath51 . \n the boundary conditions may be chosen as closed ( @xmath52 ) or open ( @xmath53 ) ; experimenting has shown that this does no exert a very strong influence on the resulting mode profiles . for the numerical solution of equation ( 6 ) \n we take @xmath24 as independent variable and use a relaxational method . \n the vertical profiles of some fourier modes in the spectrum of fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic field are shown in figure 1 . as expected , the modes with larger horizontal scales have their maxima in deeper layers \n .    computing a large number of modes and plotting their amplitudes near the surface against @xmath22 yields the fourier spectrum of the fluctuations in the turbulent magnetic field ( fig .  2 ) . \n experimenting with the parameters in equation ( 6 ) we find that the choice of @xmath45 is irrelevant for the spectrum , @xmath54 determines its amplitude , while @xmath55 and @xmath49 determine the shape of the spectrum . \n a striking feature of the spectra in figure 2 is that their maxima fall to significantly lower wavenumbers than @xmath56 , i.e.  the characteristic scale of the fluctuations in turbulent magnetic flux density is much larger than the typical scale of turbulent motions . \n the physical background of this phenomenon is that the high wavenumber components are more efficiently suppressed by diffusion ( @xmath57 term in eq . \n the wavenumber of the maximum increases with @xmath49 ( dashed vs.  dash - dotted curves ) , as a stronger nonlinear saturation reduces the role of the diffusive terms in the equation . on the other hand , \n the spectral amplitude at even lower wavenumbers depends strongly on the spectral index @xmath55 of the forcing ( dashed vs.  solid curves ) clearly , the shallower the forcing spectrum , the more energy is input at the larger scales . \n the results presented in the previous section were computed under the assumption that the fluctuations of @xmath1 have a small relative amplitude . \n this assumption is rather dubious in the light of the large fourier amplitudes found in the model ( fig .  1 ) . \n in order to have an idea about the extent to which nonlinear effects may modify the linear results , in this section we present an alternative model that calculates the fluctuating field without the assumption of linearity , at the cost of a strong simplification of the geometry : only @xmath58 modes are considered . \n this obviously implies that spatial spectra or correlation lengths can not be studied ; instead , we will compare the _ temporal autocorrelation of the fluctuations in the linear and nonlinear cases . _    for @xmath58 modes \n @xmath59 so we write equation ( 1 ) in the form @xmath60+b_f/\\tau\\ ] ] where the last term corresponds to fluctuation forcing by to the turbulent fluctuations of the velocity field . \n we model this term as a gaussian stationary random process with correlation time @xmath61 , vertical correlation `` length '' 1 ( in @xmath24 units ) , and a mean displacement of @xmath62 over @xmath37 \n .    equation ( 8) is then integrated numerically starting from an arbitrary perturbed initial state . \n an example solution is presented in figure 3 . \n figure 4 shows the autocorrelation of the fluctuating flux density as a function of the time shift for different cases . \n it is apparent ( dotted vs.  dashed curves ) that the correlation time is primarily determined by the value of the @xmath49 nonlinearity parameter , lower @xmath49 values corresponding to longer correlation times . this result is a close analogue to the findings of section 2 with respect to the spatial correlations . on the other hand \n , switching off the diffusive term in equation ( 8) ( dash - dotted vs.  dashed curves ) has no significant effect , showing that diffusive quenching of small spatial scales is _ not the mechanism responsable for the extended correlations here . replacing equation ( 8) with its linear equivalent ( solid vs.  dashed curves ) does not lead to great modifications in the results . \n this may reassure us to some extent of the reliability of the findings of section 2 above . _ \n the results of section 2 now enable us to answer the question posed at the end of the introduction . \n turbulent transport processes indeed result in a dominant scale for the fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic flux density that is an order of magnitude larger than the turbulence scale . \n the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is that small - scale fluctuations are more efficiently damped by diffusion , shifting the spectral peak to lower wavenumbers . \n the low value of the @xmath49 nonlinearity parameter suggested by closure calculations and simulations also favors larger dominant scales .    on the other hand , \n the possibility that deeper structures are `` imprinted '' on the photospheric pattern can apparently be discarded . \n switching off the first term ( vertical diffusion ) in equation ( 6 ) does not lead to any reduction of the dominant scales ( dotted vs.  dashed curves in fig . \n 2 ; dash - dotted vs.  dashed in fig . \n all this shows that the observations of strongly varying hanle depolarization over the solar disk may be understood from a theoretical point of view even if all the depolarization is attributed to turbulent fields . \n further advances on both the observational and theoretical side may make more detailed comparisons between the models and the observations possible , thereby offering the prospect of a direct observational diagnostics of the properties of the turbulent dynamo .", "StartTimeOffset": 2612070226224, "RequestID": "f53e0cf422c7406f8154ff522ddfed08", "TotalTokens": 4230}

momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra of dileptons in urhics at \n the cern sps and bnl rhic will be reviewed . \n the emission rate of dileptons with an invariant mass @xmath2 and three - momentum , @xmath3 , from a medium at temperature @xmath4 is given by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the fine - structure constant , @xmath7 the lepton - phase space factor , @xmath8 the retarded in - medium em current correlator , and @xmath9 the bose - einstein distribution . \n in the vacuum the hadronic em correlator can be inferred from @xmath10 . at low @xmath0 \n it is well - described by the vector dominance model ( vdm ) , including the light vector mesons , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and at higher @xmath14 by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) continuum . \n the theoretical investigation of the dilepton signal in urhics thus must aim at a concise model for the spectral properties of the light vector mesons , most importantly the @xmath11 meson in the iso - vector - vector channel , which give the most important contribution to the em current correlator , and of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec . \n [ sec_medium ] theoretical models for the em current correlator in partonic as well as hot and/or dense hadronic matter are summarized , followed by a comparison to recent dilepton data from the sps in sec . \n [ sec_dileps - hics ] and conclusions and outlook in sec . \n [ sec_concl ] . \n approximate chiral symmetry ( cs ) in the light - quark sector of qcd is one of the most important ingredients for the building of effective hadronic models . in the vacuum and at low temperatures and/or densities \n cs is broken dynamically through the formation of a quark condensate , @xmath15 , leading to the mass splitting of the mass spectra of chiral hadron multiplets . \n one of the most evident manifestations of cs breaking is seen in the measurement of the isovector - vector and -axialvector current correlators through @xmath16-decay data ( @xmath17 : number of pions )  @xcite . \n finite - temperature lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) calculations  @xcite find a melting of the quark condensate with increasing temperature and the restoration of cs above a critical temperature , @xmath18-@xmath19 . \n another finding is that the cs restoration ( csr ) and deconfinement transition temperatures , coincide  @xcite . from these findings \n one expects significant changes of the hadron spectra in a hot and dense medium close to csr .    in the literature , \n two scenarios concerning the manifestation of csr in the hadron spectrum have emerged : in one scenario it has been suggested that due to the melting of the quark condensate hadron masses should drop to @xmath20 at the critical point  @xcite . \n the other mechanism is found in phenomenological hadronic many - body models , where hadron spectral functions show a significant broadening with small mass shifts  @xcite . \n it turns out , however , that both scenarios , i.e. , either dropping masses or the broadening of in - medium hadron widths ( `` melting resonances '' ) are compatible with qcd - sum rule calculations  @xcite . \n thus the dilepton signal in urhics gives an important experimental insight into the nature of the csr through the vector part of the em current correlator . \n since on the other hand a direct measurement of the axialvector correlation function in heavy - ion collisions is difficult , a direct assessment of csr in hic s seems not to be possible . \n thus , a promising theoretical evidence for csr may be achievable by the application of finite - temperature weinberg - sum rules  @xcite which relate moments of the difference of vector and axial - vector spectral functions to order parameters of cs like quark and four - quark condensates , which are in principle accessible in lqcd simulations .    a model - independent approach to the em current correlator is the use of the chiral - reduction formalism based on a low - density ( virial ) expansion  @xcite to evaluate medium modifications with empirical vacuum - vector and axialvector - correlation functions as input . in this approach a mechanism for csr is the mixing of the vector and axialvector correlators through pions in the medium , similar to the `` chiral mixing '' found on the basis of current algebra and pcac  @xcite . \n however , the applicability of such methods is limited to the low - density / temperature region of the medium . \n thus the building of effective hadronic models and the application of quantum - field theory methods becomes necessary to assess the dilepton signal in urhics realistically . \n the most important guideline for building effective hadronic models is cs , e.g. , using ( generalized ) hidden local symmetry  @xcite to describe vector ( and axial - vector ) mesons as gauge bosons . \n recently , it has been shown that within these models cs can be realized in the vector manifestation ( vm ) , leading to a field - theoretical model for the dropping - mass scenario of csr  @xcite . \n however , the same model also admits the usual wigner - weyl realization , where one finds degeneracy of the @xmath11 and @xmath21 spectral functions with little mass shifts  @xcite . in general , this finding suggests that a decision in which way cs is realized in nature and how it is restored can not be achieved from the fundamental principle of cs alone . \n another approach is the use of phenomenological lagrangians which describe the vacuum properties of the vector mesons and evaluate medium modifications of their spectral functions within finite - temperature / density quantum field theory . to account for the strong couplings , \n hadronic many - body theory ( hmbt ) implements non - perturbative techniques like the dressing of , e.g. , the pion propagator in the @xmath11-meson s pion cloud , as well as a resummation of direct interactions of the @xmath11 with mesons and baryons of the medium ( for a review see  @xcite ) . \n one finds small mass shifts of the vector mesons due to many repulsive and attractive interactions with cancellations in the real part of the vector - meson self - energy , but a substantial broadening of their spectral functions . \n an interesting result of the model in ref . \n @xcite is the apparent degeneracy of the pertinent hadronic dilepton - emission rates and that of hard - thermal - loop improved pqcd rates  @xcite at temperatures close to the critical region , @xmath22-@xmath23 , in a kind of `` quark - hadron duality '' , implying csr through `` resonance melting '' . \n this finding is consistent with the smoothness of the isovector quark - number susceptibility in lqcd simulations  @xcite . \n another possibility to assess in - medium properties of vector mesons is to employ empirical scattering amplitudes and dispersion - integral techniques within the @xmath24 approximation for the in - medium selfenergies  @xcite . \n to confront the in - medium em spectral functions from the above models to dilepton @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra in urhics a description of the entire evolution of the produced medium in its hadronic and partonic stages is necessary . \n the success of ( ideal ) hydrodynamics in the evaluation of the bulk of this matter implies local thermal equilibrium , i.e. , the medium can be modeled by an energy - density and collective - flow field . in  @xcite \n a thermal fireball parameterization has been used . after a formation time the hot and dense matter is described as an ideal gas of quarks and gluons , evolving through a mixed phase to a hadron - resonance gas at a transition temperature of @xmath22-@xmath19 . as thermal - model evaluations of particle abundances in urhics indicate , the chemical freeze - out temperature is about @xmath25-@xmath26  @xcite , below which the particle ratios are fixed through the introduction of chemical potentials . the thermal freeze - out temperature , around which also elastic rescatterings cease , occurs at temperatures of @xmath27-@xmath28 . \n the evolution of the medium is parameterized as a cylindrical homogeneous fireball which is longitudinally and radially expanding . \n the temperature is given via the assumption of isentropic expansion and the equation of state of an ideal gas of massless gluons and @xmath29 effective quark flavors with the total entropy fixed by the number of charged particles . \n after a mixed phase , which is described by a standard volume partition , the hadronic phase is modeled as a hadron - resonance gas .    early on , measurements of dilepton @xmath0 spectra in urhics at the sps have shown an indication of medium modifications via an increased yield in the low - mass region ( lmr ) , @xmath30 , compared to expectations from @xmath31 collisions  @xcite . however \n , only the recent precision achieved in the dimuon measurement of the na60 collaboration in @xmath32 in - in collisions  @xcite has made it possible to subtract the `` hadron - decay cocktail '' contribution to obtain the excess spectrum and thus to significantly discriminate between models of the dropping - mass or the resonance - melting scenarios for csr . \n the data clearly favor small mass shifts and a substantial broadening of the vector - meson spectral functions . \n spectrum in @xmath33 in - in collisions  @xcite compared to model calculations in  @xcite . \n right panel : @xmath1 spectra  @xcite in various @xmath0 bins compared to the model in  @xcite ( using eos -

pion induced processes and non - thermal sources ( drell - yan annihilation , decays of primordial @xmath11 mesons not equilibrated with the medium and @xmath11 decays after thermal freeze - out ) , ( ii ) ref . \n @xcite , implementing spectral functions from the @xmath24 approach in  @xcite , and ( iii ) ref . \n @xcite , where the chiral - reduction formalism has been applied . for the medium evolution in ( i ) and ( ii ) fireball models are used , while in ( iii ) a hydrodynamical calculation is employed . \n the predicted broadening of the em correlator , particularly in model ( i ) at low masses , is dominated by baryonic excitations of the vector mesons in the medium .    in the same figure , @xmath36 spectra ( @xmath37 ) in different mass bins \n have been compared to the model in  @xcite . \n the latter also contains studies of the sensitivity to uncertainties in ( a ) @xmath38 as determined in present lqcd simulations , and ( b ) @xmath39 as extracted from thermal models for hadron production . \n three equations of state with @xmath40 ( eos - a ) , @xmath41 ( eos - b ) , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( eos - c ) have been used . in eos - c a chemically equilibrated hadronic phase in the temperature region @xmath44 has been assumed . the comparison to the @xmath0 and \n @xmath36 spectra is qualitatively comparable to that of eos - a ( up to small variations of the total dilepton yields which could be readjusted by small changes of the fireball lifetime ) \n . an interesting consequence of this insensitivity to @xmath38 and @xmath39 is that the dimuon spectrum in the intermediate - mass region ( imr ) @xmath45 can be equally well described with models where the dilepton yield is either dominated by radiation from a partonic ( eos - b ) or a hadronic ( eos - c ) source . since the emission in this @xmath0 region is dominated from fireball stages with temperatures around the critical region , @xmath46-@xmath47 , this insensitivity is due to the above described `` parton - hadron duality '' of the dilepton rates within this model . \n thus , a definite conclusion whether the dileptons in the imr are dominated by radiation from a partonic or hadronic medium can only be drawn if a more precise value of @xmath38 is known .    as shown in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig.2 ] the comparison of the effective slopes of the @xmath36 spectra with the corresponding analysis of the na60 data indicates that a larger radial flow of the medium is favored by the data . \n spectra for different equations of state and radial acceleration of the fireball  @xcite , compared to na60 data  @xcite . \n right panel : comparison of the same model  @xcite to recent ceres / na45 dielectron spectra  @xcite in central @xmath48 pb -

pion threshold . \n the comparison of effective hadronic models for in - medium properties of the em current - correlation function with high precision dilepton data in urhics is a promising method to gain insights in the nature of csr . \n models based on hadronic many - body theory , predicting a strong broadening of the vector - meson spectral functions with little mass shifts , are favored by recent measurements compared to those implementing the dropping - mass conjecture . however , a more complete analysis of the generalized hidden - local symmetry model with the vector manifestation of cs , leading to dropping vector and axialvector masses , including baryonic interactions is not available yet . \n the large enhancement of the dilepton yield in the lmr , recently observed by phenix in @xmath49 au -

{"ContextTokens": 3993, "GeneratedTokens": 182, "SynthesizedBody": "ultracold particles in an optical resonator interact non - locally via collective scattering of photons in and out of the cavity modes . under suitable conditions \n this induces collective instabilities@xcite or even crystallisation of the particles  @xcite . \n one of the earliest examples of such an instability , developed in close analogy to free electron lasers  @xcite , was studied in the so called collective atomic recoil lasing ( carl )  @xcite . \n this type of instability can be realised in a single side pumped ring cavity and it reveals a transient bunching concurrent with coherent collective backscattering of pump light for an ensemble of fast particles counterpropagating the pump field of the cavity . in an alternative geometry , \n considering cold particles with transverse pump in a standing wave cavity , a phase transition from homogeneous to crystalline order was predicted  @xcite and experimentally verified  @xcite . \n later this was identified and as well confirmed as a quantum phase transition also occurring at zero temperature  @xcite .    in this paper \n we show that in a generalized geometry using two counter propagating pump fields of orthogonal polarization ( carlo ) , a very similar type of phase transition appears , where the system breaks its translational symmetry and transforms into periodic order . \n the geometry is related to the configuration studied in  @xcite , where no cavity was present . \n it is important to note that the pump fields injected from two sides into the ring cavity do not interfere and hence do not form a prescribed optical lattice , as they have orthogonal polarization . \n a lattice only appears through interference of pump and backscattered light . \n the two fields of orthogonal polarization interact only indirectly by scattering from the same atomic density distribution  @xcite . \n this work is organized as follows : after a short presentation of the model , we study general properties of the system and exhibit its relation to known models . in particular using a vlasov - type approach we study the stability boundary of the homogeneous distribution . to understand the system s behaviour in more detail \n , we perform specific numerical simulations in part two . \n we reveal that selfordered solutions with a constant centre of mass velocity can be realised . \n in addition we show that the system allows for slowing down a fast atomic or molecular beam . in the last part \n we derive expressions which enable to state whether the system settles in a selfordered phase or a carl instability depending on the pump parameters . \n let us consider a large ensemble of @xmath0 polarizable particles within a ring cavity supporting pairs of orthogonally polarized counterpropagating modes . for simplicity , we assume them to be linearly polarizable with a real scalar polarizability . as optically pumped atoms often have tensor polarizabilities , where the two orthogonal polarizations couple to different atomic transitions , the equations below have to be adapted for this case . \n however , for sufficiently large detuning from the optical resonances , we can largely neglect mode mixing due to spontaneous raman transitions to other zeeman levels and thus we simply end up with an effective polarizability for each field mode . \n note that in this case we do not include optical pumping and polarization gradient cooling as in optical molasses . \n when enhanced by cavity feedback this would tend to localize the particles in space as investigated in some earlier work  @xcite . while this is certainly a very interesting generalization and extension of our model , such ordering is a single - particle effect an thus fundamentally different from the collective selfordering dynamics into a lattice structure as studied below .    in a semiclassical point particle description the time evolution of the mode \n amplitudes @xmath1 of the intra cavity field @xmath2 is governed by the equations  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cavity linewidth and @xmath5 denotes the detuning between the pump field ( @xmath6 ) and the cavity modes ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 determines the interaction strength . \n physically , @xmath8 represents the optical potential depth per photon in the cavity as well as the cavity mode frequency shift per particle . in general \n , @xmath8 can be complex but we will restrict our treatment to real @xmath8 , meaning that we only consider dispersive atom - light interactions . \n we approximate the mode functions @xmath9 in the interaction zone as plane waves , so that their polarization is constant . in the following we will only consider four different modes , hence we will change notation from @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and the polarization vectors fulfil the orthogonality relation @xmath13 . \n two counterpropagating , orthogonally polarized modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pumped with amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while the other two modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are only populated by scattered photons . \n this configuration represents only a slight change as compared to standard ring cavity cooling scheme  @xcite , but constitutes a very different situation physically . \n as the two counterpropagating pump fields do not interfere , no prescribed optical lattice is formed and the system is inherently translation invariant . note that imperfect mirrors in principle could lead to scattering between the two polarizations . \n fortunately in a three mirror ring cavity the two orthogonal polarization modes are sufficiently frequency shifted due to the polarization dependent mirror reflection , so that no resonant scattering between the modes will occur . \n the force on a particle within the cavity field is given by the gradient of the optical dipole potential @xmath20 associated with the local field intensity , hence @xmath21 with particle mass @xmath22 . \n we restrict our treatment to the one dimensional motion along the cavity axis , so that @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath24 . under these assumptions eqs .   and   lead to :    @xmath25    [ eqn : modes ]    where @xmath26 defines the orderparameter and @xmath27 is the effective cavity detuning . \n these eqs . \n describe two independent carl geometries with different propagation directions  ( cf . \n [ fig : scheme ] ) which interact via the atomic density inhomogeneities . \n the light induced optical potential explicitly reads : @xmath28    for very large particle numbers the numerical simulation of equations of motion can be achieved only at large computational cost . however , in the limit @xmath29 the dynamics of the gas can , for sufficiently short times be reliably approximated by a vlasov equation ( in 1d )  @xcite @xmath30 for the corresponding one - body phase space distribution function @xmath31 \n . such a treatment misses , however , correlations in the density and field fluctuations which lead to cooling and heating on longer time scales  @xcite . assuming periodic boundary conditions allows to restrict our treatment to the truncated phase space with @xmath32 . \n let us now investigate the coupled dynamics of the field modes and the gas described by eqs .    . \n for a spatially homogeneous particle distribution the system is fully translation invariant and thus @xmath33 . \n for this reason the state defined by , @xmath34 as well as    @xmath35    [ eqn : stationary ]    constitutes a stationary solution of the system  - , regardless of the velocity distribution @xmath36 . \n notice , in the following we only consider thermal ( i.e.  maxwell - boltzmann ) velocity distributions @xmath37 here we introduced the thermal velocity @xmath38 which is connected to the temperature via @xmath39 .    in this stationary state only forward scattering occurs without photon redistribution between the modes and thus there are no forces on the particles . \n only deviations from perfect spatial homogeneity can lead to backscattering and the build - up of an optical lattice . to find out under \n which conditions such deviations are amplified and a subsequent phase transition to an ordered phase can occur , we perform a linear stability analysis following landau  @xcite . as a result \n we find that the steady state   is unstable if and only if the dispersion relation @xmath40 has at least one zero with a positive real part , where @xmath41i(s ) . \n \\label{eqn : dispersion}\\ ] ] in   we defined the total pump parameter @xmath42 and the pump asymmetry @xmath43 according to @xmath44 furthermore , @xmath45 with the recoil velocity  @xmath46 . \n one finds that for every given pump asymmetry there exists a critical total pump parameter @xmath47 such that the homogeneous state is unstable for @xmath48 and stable otherwise .    for equal pump intensities , i.e.  @xmath49 , we recognize that   is almost exactly the same dispersion relation as one obtains for a transversally pumped ring - cavity . \n the only difference is that the wavenumber is multiplied by a factor 2 and the transversal pump - intensity is replaced by the sum of the two pump intensities @xmath42  @xcite . \n obviously there exists a close analogy between the present setup with equal pump strengths and a transversally pumped ring - cavity . as in the latter case there \n appear stable selforganized solutions beyond an instability threshold  @xcite , which is given by @xmath50 the other extreme case , @xmath51 , corresponds to a pure carl instability  @xcite in which case no selforganization can take place . \n the dependence of the critical pump parameter on the pump asymmetry can not be found in closed form . \n nonetheless , solving @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 yields the stability boundary using @xmath55 as parameter ,  cf . \n [ fig : phasediagr ] . \n the central question in the following is whether and under which conditions there occurs selforganization for nonzero pump asymmetries . \n to gain deeper insight into the systems behaviour we have numerically solved the maxwell - vlasov equations  - for an initial condition close to homogeneous in space and a negative effective detuning @xmath56 . \n these simulations confirm our predictions for the @xmath49 case . \n furthermore they reveal that for sufficiently small @xmath43 and above threshold the system does evolve into a selfordered state , albeit one in which the gas possesses a non vanishing centre of mass velocity @xmath57 constant in time . in the process of forming such a travelling wave \n the continuous translation symmetry is broken . as a matter of fact , the gas moves in the direction of the stronger pump beam . \n a )   b )   c )    however , we find that , for a given @xmath42 , as soon as @xmath43 exceeds a certain value , there still occurs a carl instability resulting in a runaway centre of mass velocity . for an illustration of these processes ,  cf . \n [ fig : phsptevo1]-  [ fig : vcm ] . \n a )   b )   c )    while we have started from a particle ensemble at rest up to now and found a moving gas in a steady state , one can turn the idea around and use this setup to efficiently slowing down a cold atomic or molecular beam by collective scattering , improving a similar approach which has already been presented in  @xcite ( see the red curve in  [ fig : vcm ] ) .    . \n sufficiently small @xmath58 ( dashed blue ) leads to a selforganized solution with a constant centre of mass velocity whereas for large @xmath59 ( dash dotted black ) the carl phase is realised which results in an indefinitely increasing centre of mass velocity . \n the solid red curve shows the evolution of the mean velocity for a initial distribution with initially @xmath60 and @xmath49.,width=80 ] \n as we have seen above , in the case of instability and depending on the pump asymmetry , the gas either enters the carl regime , in which the centre of mass is accelerated indefinitely , or it settles in a selfordered , travelling - wave state with a constant phase velocity ( i.e.  centre of mass velocity ) . \n let us therefore investigate this latter type of solution more closely . from equation one deduces that any nonlinear wave with phase velocity @xmath61 must be of the bgk ( bernstein - greene - kruskal ) form  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an arbitrary function . \n furthermore , @xmath64 may depend on @xmath65 only through @xmath66 , which implies that @xmath67 as well as @xmath68 all be independent of time . to actually find the phase velocity from the equations of motion we require @xmath63 , which is obtained as the solution of an initial value problem and thus in general out of reach . \n nevertheless it is possible to deduce a relationship between the phase velocity , the order parameter and the relative pump asymmetry in the form ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 fulfilled by any nonlinear wave solution . from \n we find that for @xmath71 the wave travels in the direction of the stronger pump beam , as long as @xmath72 . \n as soon as the inequality is violated , waves with sufficiently large order parameters propagate in the opposite direction . as such waves \n have never been observed numerically we have reason to expect them to be dynamically unstable . \n hence we stipulate that the order parameter satisfies the bound @xmath73 .    . \n the dark grey region , bounded by  , marks the parameter regime where a warm gas transitions to a bgk state  . \n the dashed black line corresponds to the bound  .,width=245 ]    furthermore , eqn .   allows to conclude that \n if @xmath74 there exists _ no _ bgk - wave solution at all . \n this implies that if the homogeneous solution is unstable and the asymmetry exceeds the bound  , the gas will _ necessarily _ enter the carl regime . \n eqn .   can also be viewed as determining the necessary relative pump asymmetry @xmath75 , which is needed to generate a wave with a prescribed phase velocity @xmath57 and order @xmath76 . \n notice , however , that the necessary total pump strength @xmath42 can not be inferred . \n in particular , in order to stop a beam ( i.e.  to achieve @xmath77 ) the pump asymmetry has to be equal to zero . \n the foregoing statements exhaust the characterization of the bgk solutions in absence of knowing @xmath63 . without going into details we state that for gas with temperature @xmath78 \n , one finds that a bgk - wave will develop as soon as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 . \n \\label{eqn : bgkbound}\\ ] ] the results of the stability analysis and the discussion above are summarized in  [ fig : phasediagr ] . \n we demonstrated that utilizing orthogonally polarized counter propagating modes the physics of light induced selfordering is observable , similarly to the case of a transversely pumped ring resonator . in the case of no pump asymmetry the two setups are fully equivalent  @xcite . \n however , the system considered in this work is more versatile , because , in principle , by the choice of the pump asymmetry , ordered particle distributions with any prescribed centre of mass velocity can be generated . \n therefore the control of the pump intensity allows for controlling the motion of gas particles inside the ring cavity . as a consequence , \n a particle beam can be effectively slowed down and trapped . \n note that a different loss rate for the two polarization modes , as it often appears in practice , can be easily compensated by a correspondingly enlarged pump . \n analogous physics should be present at zero temperature allowing to control and study degenerate quantum gases . \n interesting effects can also be expected in the case of particles in optical lattices . \n here collective scattering from orthogonally polarized modes can be used to gain insight into the particle quantum statistics at minimal perturbation or to induce tailored long - range interactions . \n 22ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 2676200300133, "RequestID": "11666419fd004ed099e9a2e7317c4e5a", "TotalTokens": 4175}

leptonic decay rates of the charmed hadrons employ heavy quark effective theory and the factorization approximation  @xcite . \n nonetheless , the three  body cabibbo  suppressed decays of charmed baryons are prohibitively difficult to calculate . \n measurements of relative branching fraction between simple charmed baryon states , both cabibbo  favored and cabibbo  suppressed , give additional insight into the structure of the decay amplitude and the validity of the factorization approximation . until now the only cabibbo  suppressed charmed baryon decay reported with significant statistics is @xmath9 and its resonant state , @xmath10  @xcite . \n in this paper , we report the first observation of the cabibbo  suppressed @xmath11 and determine the branching fraction of this decay relative to the cabibbo  favored @xmath12 mode . \n selex is a high energy hadroproduction experiment at fermilab using a multi  stage spectrometer designed for high acceptance for forward interactions ( @xmath13 ) . \n the experiment aimed especially to understand charm production in the forward hemisphere and to study charmed baryon decays . using both a negative hyperon beam ( 50% @xmath0 , 50% @xmath1 ) and a proton beam ( 92% p , 8% @xmath14 ) , selex took 15.2 billion interaction events during the 19961997 fix target run , tagging 600 gev @xmath0 , @xmath1 and 540 gev @xmath15 beams with a beam trd . \n the data were accumulated using a segmented charm target ( 5 foils : 2 cu , 3 c , each separated by 1.5 cm ) whose total thickness was 5% of interaction length for protons . \n the spectrometer had silicon strip detectors to measure beam and outgoing tracks and provided precision primary and secondary vertex reconstruction . \n transverse position resolution was 4 @xmath16 for the 600 gev beam and the average longitudinal vertex position resolution was 270 @xmath16 for primary and 560 @xmath16 for secondaries , respectively . \n track momenta were measured after magnetic deflection by a system of proportional wire chambers ( pwc ) , drift chambers and silicon strip detectors . \n track momentum resolution for a typical 100 gev track was @xmath17% . \n the absolute momentum scale was calibrated to the @xmath18 mass . for @xmath19 \n decays the average mass resolution was 9 mev for @xmath20 momenta from 100 - 450 gev . \n charged particle identification was done with the ring image @xmath21erenkov radiation ( rich ) detector  @xcite which distinguished @xmath22 from @xmath23 up to 165 gev . \n the proton identification efficiency was greater than 95% above proton threshold ( @xmath24 gev ) and the pion mis  identification probability was about 4% . \n interactions were selected by a scintillator trigger and an online software filter . \n the charm trigger required at least 4 charged tracks and 2 hits in a scintillator hodoscope after the second analyzing magnet . \n we triggered on about 1/3 of all inelastic interactions . \n based on downstream tracking with particle identification information , the online filter selected events that had evidence for a secondary vertex among tracks completely reconstructed using the forward pwc spectrometer and the vertex silicon . \n this filter reduced the data size by a factor of nearly 8 at a cost of about a factor of 2 in charm written to tape as normalized from a study of unfiltered @xmath18 and @xmath25 decays . \n most of the charm loss came from selection cuts that were independent of charm species or kinematic variables and which improved the signal / noise in the final sample . \n the charm events were selected by the following requirements ; ( 1 ) fits for both primary and secondary vertex have @xmath26 5 , ( 2 ) \n longitudinal separation l between primary and secondary vertices is greater than 8 times the combined longitudinal error @xmath27 , and ( 3 ) the reconstructed momentum vector from the secondary vertex points back to the primary vertex with good quality @xmath28 , and ( 4 ) @xmath29 for k identification and @xmath30 for @xmath15 identification , where @xmath31 is the likelihood function based on rich information . \n additional cuts will be explicitly described if applied . \n the production properties of charm quarks require measurements of charm hadrons . \n pqcd calculations can be probed experimentally using measurements of single - charm - particle inclusive distributions as a function of @xmath3 and asymmetries , either integrated or as a function of @xmath3 . \n previous charm hadroproduction experiments showed evidence of a large enhancement in the forward production of charmed particles that contain a quark or an antiquark in common with the beam ( _ leading particles _ ) over those that do not ( _ non - leading particles _ ) , in the meson sector . \n recently , this study has been extended to the production of baryons by a @xmath0 beam  @xcite . \n according to our simulations and our measurements of @xmath18 decays , the selex spectrometer acceptance is charge independent and we have a smooth , generally constant acceptance as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath32 . \n we show in fig . \n [ integrated_a ] the integrated charm production asymmetry for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and proton beams in the kinematic region @xmath32 . \n the raw asymmetry for charm baryons is much stronger than for charm mesons in this forward @xmath3 region for all 3 beam types . \n the effect is even more pronounced when the charm baryons are produced by a baryon beam . \n one typical explanation of this observed asymmetry is that longitudinal momentum is added to the produced charm quark if it recombines with a valence quark from the incoming particle , forming the leading particle shown in fig . \n [ stfigure ] . \n this is incorporated , for example , in the pythia simulation program  @xcite , where the effect is overestimated for typical model parameters  @xcite . with this scenario in mind , \n we expect to find a harder @xmath3 spectrum for leading particles than non - leading particles \n .    4.2 truein    -.2 cm    4.2 truein    -.2 \n cm    the @xmath3 dependence of the corrected number of events from each beam is shown in figure  [ xf ] . \n the curves are fits of the standard parametrization @xmath35 to the data . \n the @xmath3 distributions for @xmath2 show an @xmath3 dependence for all three beam types that is harder than that reported for d mesons from a @xmath36 beam . \n the @xmath2 is a leading particle for each of the three beam particles reported here , and the values of @xmath37 are all consistent . further insight into \n the mechanism will come from comparisons of charm meson production characteristics from these three beam hadrons . that work is in process . \n 4.2 truein    -.2 cm \n the study of cabibbo  suppressed charm decays can provide useful insights into the weak interaction mechanism for non - leptonic decays  @xcite . \n the observed final state may arise either from direct quark mixing at the decay stage or , in some cases , from quark rearrangement in final - state scattering . by comparing the strengths of cabibbo  suppressed decays to their cabibbo  favored analogs , one can , in a systematic way , assess the contributions of the various mechanisms . \n [ decayfigure ] shows a simple spectator diagram with external @xmath39emission for @xmath38 decaying into a cabibbo  allowed and a cabibbo  suppressed mode . \n the other cabibbo  allowed @xmath40 mode interchanges @xmath41 and @xmath42 quark lines and produces a @xmath43 pair from the vacuum instead of a @xmath44 pair . \n 4.2 truein    -.2 cm    since the decay process is similar in the two modes except flavor changing through the cabibbo  kobayashi \n maskawa matrix element ( @xmath45 , we expect @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the cabibbo angle and @xmath48 is a coefficient of order one containing information about differences in the two decay mechanisms over the allowed phase space . to the extent that the relative branching ratio is different from this , we may argue for enhancement or suppression of one of the two modes . \n 4.2 truein    -.2 cm    fig . \n [ cspkifigure ] shows the first observation of the cabibbo \n suppressed @xmath49 decay mode . \n the inset of the figure shows the invariant mass distribution from reconstructed @xmath50 candidates with @xmath51 gev and the sum of transverse momentum square ( @xmath52 ) of decaying particles greater than 0.3 ( gev@xmath53 . \n the large peak is the charm baryon decay , @xmath54 and the bump in the right corner shows the cabibbo  suppressed @xmath55 decay . \n the analysis cuts off because of a maximum mass cut in the analysis of this mode during this first pass through the data . \n we observed @xmath56 events for @xmath55 with the @xmath57 mass at ( @xmath58 ) mev . \n the statistical significance for the signal , @xmath59 , is @xmath60 in which @xmath61 is the number of signal events and @xmath62 is the number of background events under the signal region .    in this first reconstruction pass , hyperons ( @xmath63 ) \n were identified only inclusively in the limited decay interval ( @xmath64 . the hyperon candidate track was identified with a track having @xmath65 gev for which no reconstructed track segments were observed in the 14 chambers along the trajectory after the second analyzing magnet . \n this category of tracks ( kinks by disappearance ) had a unique @xmath66 identification for positive kinks but had an ambiguity for negative kinks between @xmath67 and @xmath68 . \n reflections in 3-body modes are therefore expected and are taken into account , based on data in the true mode . \n [ brfigure ] shows two cabibbo \n favored @xmath57 modes decaying to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . \n for these modes , we require additional kinematical cuts : ( a ) the transverse component of the reconstructed parent particle momentum with respect to the line of flight less than 0.3 gev , and ( b ) the momentum of the @xmath14 is greater than 10 gev . \n the shaded area in @xmath69 and @xmath71 is the estimated reflection from @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . \n the shape is determined by a monte carlo simulation and the area is normalized to the observed number of signal events in the @xmath2 data .    to estimate the total acceptance for decay modes of interest \n , we embedded monte carlo charm decays events in data events . \n we generated charm events with an average transverse momentum @xmath74 gev and longitudinal momentum spectrum as observed for the @xmath57 data . \n detector hits , including resolution and multiple coulomb scattering smearing effects , produced by these embedded tracks were ord into the hit banks of the underlying data event . \n the new ensemble of hits was passed through the selex off -

[ fig:2 ] ) .    the price - chart view of the game . \n the price changes proportionally to the global action @xmath9 of agents ( eq .  [ eq:2 ] ) ; the player must predict whether the market will rise or fall . \n note that the last action is highlighted for the player . ]    clearly , the binary viewpoint is more suited to games where the player s gain is also binary , i.e.  where @xmath15 , and the price - chart view is more suited to games with a linear payoff , @xmath16 . \n this is the practise we have followed in our ready - made games . \n however , the option to create a custom game allows the user to ignore our advice if s / he feels like it ! \n the reader may have noticed that , rather than being asked to make a choice ( ` buy ' or ` sell ' , @xmath1 or @xmath2 ,  ) , the human player is asked to ` _ _ predict which way you think the market is going to go _ _ ' . \n that is , the user is asked to _ predict the majority action _ , and their own action ( the opposite ) is inferred from this  we ask the human player for a prediction @xmath17 and an amount bet on this prediction , @xmath18 ( their _ weight _ or _ market impact _ ) , and their action is then taken to be @xmath19 . \n we apologise if this is perhaps a little confusing for those familiar with the mg ! our concern , as we noted in the introduction , was to make the game simpler for those who have never encountered the mg before . ` what way do you think the market will go ? ' seemed to us a simpler question than , say , ` would you like to buy or sell ( do the opposite of what you think everyone else will do ) ? ' in addition , those unused to the mg might reasonably ask , like andersen and sornette in a recent paper  @xcite , questions such as , ` why does buying hurt me if the market keeps rising ? ' we would rather avoid such problems !    in summary : although it is a little hidden from view , the player still has to try and perform the minority action . \n ;-)      the game interface consists of a series of php files that interact with an underlying c program ; the latter calculates the actions of all the computer - controlled agents , and calculates all the relevant and interesting quantities ( such as predictability ) . \n we hope that the reader will forgive us if we are coy about revealing any more ( in particular , about revealing source code ) ; we are willing to reveal the workings - behind - the - scenes but there are a few rabbits - up - our - sleeve that we would like to keep from players for now , so as to make the game more interesting ! \n the interactive minority game offers a number of possibilities for the human player to pick from . as well as a variety of ` standard ' , ready - made games \n , there is the option to create a custom game by choosing from various parameters . for those well - versed in mg lore \n , this could no doubt do with some extra explanation . \n parameters particular to the human player are denoted by a subscript asterisk ( @xmath20 ) .      to begin with , \n let us summarise the basic parameters of the mg : we have a homogeneous population of @xmath0 agents with memory @xmath3 , each with @xmath21 strategies . \n this gives us @xmath22 as the size of the space of histories given to agents , and we can then define the control parameter @xmath23 . it is this parameter @xmath24 which determines the type of market : a low value creates an extremely inefficient market , easily predictable by the smart human , while a high value of @xmath24 creates a market whose behaviour is close to randomness . \n the most efficient market ( and therefore most difficult to play ) , i.e.  the market with the minimal value of standard deviation @xmath25 , lies somewhere in the middle at the critical point @xmath26  @xcite . for the purposes of our games ( custom or standard ) , \n we have chosen to make @xmath3 and @xmath24 variables , with other parameters being calculated from these two . \n as we have already noted , the human player enjoys the benefit of a larger memory , @xmath27 , than the computer - controlled agents ; we have chosen to set @xmath28 for the binary view and @xmath29 for the price - chart view . \n we have also added a parameter particular to the img for the human player : the player s _ weight _ or _ \n market impact_. recall from \n [ sec : predict ] that at each time @xmath5 the player is asked for a prediction @xmath30 on the direction the market will take , and the amount they bet on this , @xmath31 . \n their action is then taken to be , @xmath32    put simply , this amounts to the human player taking an action @xmath33 rather than @xmath34 ; i.e. , the player chooses to have a market impact equivalent to that of @xmath35 normal agents . \n the player s gain per turn is then also proportional to @xmath35 . \n depending on the market phase , this can be an advantage or a disadvantage : it brings the potential of a greater reward if the player can correctly predict the market , but with the potential of a far greater loss if s / he can not . \n we have also used the concept of _ minimum weight _ , @xmath36 , where we require that @xmath37 . \n we can force the human player to act on a larger scale than the typical agent \n equivalent , perhaps , to the actions of a large investment bank rather than an individual trader . \n the other new parameter introduced , for custom games , is the length of the _ introductory period _ , @xmath38 . \n this is the length of time that the computer - controlled agents play by themselves before the human player joins the game . \n a long value allows the agents to adapt to the statistically stationary state of the game , while if @xmath38 is low , the players start off `` stupid '' , not knowing which of their strategies is better . in the more difficult games ( efficient markets ) , a such a low value is essential as a high value of @xmath38 makes it completely impossible for a human to compete ! \n the img allows the player both to pick from a variety of ` standard ' , ready - made games and to create their own custom game . \n the total choices available to the player are as follows : their _ minimum weight _ \n , @xmath36 ; the _ market phase _ , determined by @xmath24 ; the _ agent memory _ , @xmath3 ; the display mode ( see  [ sec:2 - 1 ] ) ; the payoff ( binary or linear ) ; and , in the custom game , the length of the introductory period , @xmath38 . \n the * custom game * allows the choice of a full range of parameters , including some that are not used in our standard games . \n minimum weight can be small ( @xmath39 ) , medium ( @xmath40 ) or large ( @xmath41 ) absolute values ; the market phase varies from extremely crowded ( @xmath42 ) to crowded ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , the critical point ( @xmath45 ) and anticrowded ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) . \n @xmath3 can be 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 or 8 ; the introductory period can be the full period ( @xmath48 ) , or it can be short ( 200 ) or very short ( 5 ) . \n the * standard games * were set up to create a variety of different market experiences for the human player . \n _ beginners _ is exactly that : a nice and easy game , with @xmath49 , @xmath42 and @xmath39 . \n this is designed simply as a friendly introduction to the img and should not be taken too seriously !

{"ContextTokens": 3502, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "the electron crystal has created considerable interest since its possible existence was first pointed out by wigner  @xcite . \n the three - dimensional wigner crystal and its two - dimensional counterpart have been extensively studied , and there exist beautiful experimental realizations of the latter using electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium  @xcite . \n more recently , wigner crystallization in one dimension has received renewed interest  @xcite ; for recent reviews see refs .   and . \n the realization of a one - dimensional system requires the dominance of the confining potential over internal energies , in particular , the inter - particle interactions . upon increasing density ( and , thus , \n the interaction energy ) , or weakening the confining potential , the crystal deviates from its strictly one - dimensional structure . \n it has been shown that at a critical density , a transition to a zigzag crystal takes place  @xcite . though not for electrons , this zigzag transition has indeed been observed using @xmath0mg@xmath1 ions in a quadrupole storage ring  @xcite .    here \n we investigate the structural properties of the classical quasi - one - dimensional wigner crystal beyond the zigzag regime . while previous investigations  @xcite concentrated on regular structures , we are interested in the formation of defects . from symmetry considerations \n the assumption of regular crystals is plausible at low densities when the number of rows is small , however , its validity is not at all obvious once the lateral extent of the crystal increases at higher densities . \n in fact , one expects a nonuniform charge density in the direction transverse to the wire axis . \n in particular , considering the electrostatics problem of charges confined by a parabolic potential , @xmath2 , the density profile should obey @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the width of the system  @xcite . \n therefore , the assumption of perfect rows with equal linear densities should eventually break down . \n the formation of defects is of particular interest because they will have a direct impact on the transport properties of the system : while regular rows are locked , defects are expected to be mobile . \n we consider classical particles in two dimensions interacting via long - range coulomb interaction . \n the system is assumed to be infinite in the @xmath5-direction and confined in the transverse @xmath6-direction by a parabolic confining potential @xmath7 . \n the energy of the system then reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dielectric constant of the material and @xmath10 is the frequency of harmonic oscillations in the confining potential .    at low densities , \n the system is one - dimensional , and the particles minimize their mutual coulomb repulsion by occupying equidistant positions along the wire , forming a structure with short - range crystalline order  the so - called one - dimensional wigner crystal  @xcite . upon increasing the density , the inter - electron distance diminishes , and the resulting stronger electron repulsion eventually overcomes the confining potential @xmath7 , transforming the classical one - dimensional wigner crystal into a staggered ( zigzag ) chain . from the comparison of the coulomb interaction energy @xmath11 with the confining potential an important characteristic length scale emerges . \n indeed , the transition from the one - dimensional wigner crystal to the zigzag chain is expected to take place when distances between electrons are of the order of the scale @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . within our model , _ \n i.e. _ , for a parabolic confining potential and coulomb interactions , the characteristic length scale @xmath12 is given as @xmath14 it is convenient for the following discussion to measure lengths in units of @xmath12 . to that purpose \n we introduce a dimensionless density @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the linear density of the system . \n rescaling lengths , the energy can be written as @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 . \n as a first step , we minimize the energy assuming regular rows , aiming to find approximate values for the density range in which a configuration with a given number of rows is stable . assuming staggering in the @xmath5-direction between neighboring rows and inversion symmetry of the @xmath6-positions of the rows with respect to the wire axis , the number of minimization parameters is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for even ( odd ) number of rows @xmath21 , and the minimization is straightforward . within these constraints , \n the minimization of the energy with respect to the electron configuration reveals  @xcite that a one - dimensional crystal is stable for densities @xmath22 , whereas a zigzag chain forms at intermediate densities @xmath23 . \n more rows appear as the density further increases . \n the number of rows as a function of @xmath24 is shown in table [ table_1 ] . \n .[table_1]number of rows in the crystal as a function of the dimensionless density @xmath24 , assuming regular structures . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n eventually , one expects that more complicated structures will appear . \n the simple configuration we studied is in competition with structures where defects appear away from the edges , such as structures of the type @xmath25 $ ] , for example . \n detailed calculations within these simplified models reveal that such structures are indeed competitors for the ground state , but up to 13 rows such a minimum is not realized . \n to approach the transition between regular and defected rows , we use a different trick . an unbiased search for the global minimum \n is numerically costly because a simple minimization may get stuck in a metastable minimum . \n however , if the initial guess of the electron configuration is sufficiently close to the global minimum , a simple minimization will converge . \n having identified the structure of defects in region i , one may feed such structures into a simple minimization at lower densities . \n the results of such a procedure have been included in figs . \n [ fig - nu_def ] and [ fig - y ] . \n there , structures with defect densities down to @xmath26 were obtained with the full minimization , whereas structures close to the phase boundary with lower defect structures were obtained with the method described here . \n the results suggest that the defect density indeed vanishes at the transition which points to a second order phase transition . \n we study quasi - one - dimensional systems of classical particles interacting via long - range coulomb interactions and confined by a parabolic potential in the transverse direction . \n the ground state configurations are multi - row wigner crystals where the number of rows is controlled by the density ( or the strength of the confining potential ) . \n we find that defects that accommodate the density variation in the transverse direction appear once the number of rows exceeds four .    defected structures have less particles in the outer than in the inner rows . \n the full numerical minimization for five rows reveals that two distinct types of defected phases exist . upon increasing density , \n the regular structure at low - densities is replaced by a structure with symmetric defects , _ \n i.e. _ , where the center of the defect on the two outer rows is located at the same @xmath5-position . as the number of particles that can be simulated sets a lower limit on the defect density that can obtained , the full minimization allows one only to provide an upper limit for the density at the transition from regular to defected structures . \n we extend our calculations to lower densities by using structures with the type of defect described above as the input for a simple minimization . \n the results indicate that the defect density vanishes at @xmath27 and that the transition is of second order . to obtain symmetric defects , \n the longitudinal distortion of the inner rows , namely an increased density at the center of the defect , is crucial . any analytical description of the transition would have to take into account this distortion .    upon further increasing density \n , the defect density rapidly increases . at a critical density , @xmath28 , structures with a different type of defect corresponding to a sinusoidal distortion of the rows with a phase shift of half a period between the two outer rows \n become become the ground state . \n this second regime is characterized by a defect density that barely varies with density and extends up to the transition to six rows . \n the transition between the two defected phases with different symmetries is first order . \n simplified models neglecting the corrugation of the rows only capture this second defected phase . \n thus , these models do not allow one to further investigate the nature of the phase transition from regular to defected structures . \n however , as this second phase occupies most of the density interval , they may be used to study the stability of regular structures upon increasing the number of rows . \n we find that beyond nine rows , no stable regular structures exist . \n taking into account that the simplified model overestimates the energy of defected structures , we expect that stable regular structures may disappear even earlier . \n we would like to acknowledge stimulating discussions with k.  a. matveev , yu . \n v.  nazarov , and a.  melikyan . \n part of the calculations were performed at the ohio supercomputer center thanks to a grant of computing time . \n this work was supported by the u.s . \n department of energy , office of science , under contract no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 2414, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum zeno effect , proposed by misra and sudarshan @xcite in 1977 , is believed to exist uniquely in the quantum world due to informatical description of quantum states and the projective measurement in quantum mechanics ( for a review , see ref . \n while its classical correspondences , such as the fletcher s paradox , becomes an antinomy in newtonian mechanics . \n the basic reason , from our judgement , is the absence of the projective measurement in classical physics . \n however , though newtonian mechanics excludes the projective measurement , the later does exist in the classical world . in a recent work on this issue sjgumario , one of us ( gu ) touched the possibility of the classical zeno and anti - zeno effects . \n gu used a scenario of super mario s prison break to show that a classical state \" might not decay if it is observed continuously . \n nevertheless , the scenario involves too much subjective freedoms coming from super mario s intelligent feedback , such that it is , though reasonable in everyday life , far beyond the objective laws of the classical world . \n this consideration leads to the main motivation of the present work to seek a possibility of the classical zeno effect without involving any subjective judgement . \n we consider here such a scenario of transferring a classical state , for instance a digitized image , through a classical channel with a noise surrounding ( see fig . \n [ sketch.eps ] ) . \n the state , if there is no assisted equipment , decays inevitably with the distance due to the surroundings interferences , and finally loses all information . in order to suppress the decay rate or \n even ensure zero decay , we need to check the information of state within a certain distance . instead of the intelligent judgement made by super mario @xcite \n , here we use a machine ( repeater ) , which has nothing to do with living beings , to examine and try to recover the state . \n we show that if there are enough number of repeaters , the transferred state then might decay much more slowly , or even never decay , then a classical zeno effect occurs . \n this work is organized as follows . in section \n [ sec : class ] , we introduce the basic formulas for describing the classical transportation . in section [ sec : example ] , we take the emblem of the chinese university of hong kong ( cuhk ) as an explicit example to show how the classical zeno effect occurs during a classical transportation . a further discussion and a brief summary are given in section [ sec : dis ] and [ sec : sum ] respectively . \n through a classical channel . \n up : @xmath0 is transferred through the channel without any repeater and decays with the distance . \n low : a repeater t is installed to check the completeness of the state , then @xmath0 might decay more slowly . , width=302 ] \n to begin with , we consider a classical @xmath1-bit state describe by @xmath2 with @xmath3 , which in computer science can be saved physically by for instance in a flash disk or a perforated paper tape . \n now we want to transfer the state through a classical channel , which is subject to a noise background of temperature @xmath4 . during the transferring process \n , the state carried by each bit is protected via an energy gap @xmath5 . \n so if the temperature is zero , there is no background inference , and the state can be transferred over an infinite distance without loss of information . \n however , the thermal fluctuation of the surrounding might flip the state of bit . once the bit is flipped one or more times , \n we assume it loses the correlation to the original global state . \n the transition probability of each bit through a unit distance @xmath6 is determined by @xmath7where @xmath8 denotes uncorrelated state . \n then if the bit is transferred over a distance of @xmath9 ( in unit of @xmath6 ) , the surviving probability becomes @xmath10where @xmath11 . \n therefore , the classical state will decay exponentially to a complete random state with the transferred distance . \n explicitly , in the basis of @xmath12 , the initial state of the bit is @xmath13while the final state becomes@xmath14the distance between these two states can be measured by the fidelity @xmath15then at the very beginning , i.e. small @xmath9 @xmath16which decays algebraically . \n we notice that the leading term of the fidelity here is linear instead of quadratic in quantum fidelity . \n nevertheless , the algebraic decay of the fidelity ensure that we have chance to correct the lost information via a repeater . \n in this section , we give a simple example to illustrate how such a process can be realized in practice . \n we assume that alice wants to transfer a picture , i.e , the cuhk emblem , to bob who is at a long distance via a classical channel . \n the emblem is prepared in a bmp file with @xmath17 resolution and 256 colors . for simplicity , we assume alice and bob have already known all other structural information , such as 256 elemental colors and the size of the picture , except the image data , which can be expressed as a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 @xmath19with each element @xmath20 ( @xmath21,j\\in \\lbrack 1,200]$ ] ) being an 8-bit integer . during the transportation , \n each element of the matrix @xmath18 is subject to environmental interference . \n one of elements might be changed to a random 8-bit integer with the probability @xmath22 with @xmath23 over the unit distance @xmath6 . \n clearly , the lower the temperature , the more stable the data . meanwhile , as the transferred distance increase , the emblem s information will inevitably lose . \n we use the classical monte carlo method to simulate such a process . \n the leftmost column of fig . \n [ cuhk.eps ] shows the emblem at the various distance . \n we can see that the figure will finally be blurred .    in order \n to suppress the decay rate , alice and bob need to install repeaters on the channel they use . \n the repeater s first function is to check the integrability of data . \n secondly , if possible , it can partially recover the integrability or require the previous repeater to resend the data . \n for this purpose , they add row - column check code to the end of the matrix elements . \n @xmath24the row and column check codes are defined as@xmath25respectively . \n so if one of elements @xmath20 or @xmath26 is changed , the corresponding row and column check code do not match . since the eq . \n ( [ eq : checkcode ] ) are simple summation , in this case , the repeater is able to recover the lost information , that is@xmath27or@xmath28 if one of elements in @xmath26 is lost , the repeater recalculate @xmath29 from the matrix @xmath18 . _ for simplicity _ , \n if there are two or more elements are lost , we assume that the repeater is neither able to recover the integrability , nor requires the previous repeater to resend the picture again , but recalculate eq . \n ( [ eq : checkcode ] ) to ensure the integrability of data for next repeater . \n we show our results in fig . \n cuhk.eps . in the second column , \n the distance between two repeaters is @xmath30 . \n the emblem keep much more information than the first column . \n moreover , if we add more repeaters to the channel , the decay rate will be suppressed further . \n especially if @xmath31 , the emblem at @xmath32 is almost the same as the original one . \n we then call such a phenomenon as a repeater - assisted classical zeno effect in random processes . \n precisely , we can introduce the fidelity to describe the honesty of the state to the original one . in this case \n , the fidelity can be defined as @xmath33 the results are shown in fig . \n [ fidelity.eps ] , from which we can see that the decay rate can be significantly suppressed if enough number of repeaters are installed . on the other hand , if there are two or more elements that have been found to be lost and the repeater can ask the previous repeater to resend the data again , then the classical state will never decay . \n ( in unit of 20000 steps ) for various @xmath34 . , width=302 ] \n now the game is over . \n however , we find ourselves in an embarrassed situation \n . does such an issue still belong to physics ? \n the answer seems to be yes since there is no any interferences from living beings and the  repeater \"- like device needs energy only . \n nevertheless , a digitized state and its decay clearly neither belong to quantum mechanics nor newtonian mechanics . \n such a puzzle keeps a challenge for us and is not able to be answered easily in physical science .    on the other hand , \n the classical zeno effect is very popular phenomenon in the world . besides the case of super mario s prison break @xcite , the classical zeno effect exists in many fields , such as the medical field and the economical field . \n take the former as an example : a human being usually is in a metastable state . \n some small deceases can introduce some fluctuations around the equilibrium point . in these cases , the body s immune response and a suitable cure \n will recover the metastable . \n however , there exists a class of vital deceases , such as cancer , that will finally drag the state of human beings from the metastable point and never back if the state is far from the equilibrium point . \n necessary cures clearly can slow down or ever stop such a process . \n however , to stop such a process , the most important is to find and cure the decease as early as possible , then the probability to recover the metastable state is very high . \n in summary , we touched such a possibility of classical zeno effect in classical stochastic processes , as illustrated by a scenario of transferring a classical state through a noise channel . \n we show explicitly that the zeno effect is no longer a patent of quantum mechanics , but exists in classical stochastic processes . \n we gave an example of transferring a bmp file through a noise channel , as simulated by classical monte carlo method . \n the example manifests that the decay rate of the bmp file will be significantly suppressed , even never decay , if there are enough number of repeaters .", "StartTimeOffset":

{"ContextTokens": 2510, "GeneratedTokens": 76, "SynthesizedBody": "an embedding is a map from input data to points in euclidean space . \n machine learning researchers and developers often need to explore the properties of a specific embedding to understand the behavior of their model . an engineer who creates an embedding of songs for a recommendation system might want to verify that the nearest neighbors of `` stairway to heaven '' include `` whole lotta love '' and not `` let it go '' from frozen . \n meanwhile , a researcher may be interested in global geometric properties , such as linear relationships between meaningful subsets of embedded points . for both sets of users , gaining \n an understanding of embedding geometry is a key step in interpreting a machine learning model . \n an appealing approach to analyzing embeddings is to visualize them . \n since embeddings often exist in a space of hundreds of dimensions , an essential step is `` dimensionality reduction '' which projects points to a more approachable two or three dimensions . \n many tools exist to perform various types of dimensionality reduction , but they are largely non - interactive ( e.g. , matplotlib [ 3 ] , or the code released in [ 5 ] ) . \n unfortunately , these static views are generally inadequate for exploring high - dimensional data  although an important first step in the process , users then typically want to switch quickly between many views , zooming and filtering , and then closely inspecting details . \n indeed , there have been many toolkits created with the express purpose of exploring high - dimensional data ( e.g. , [ 2 ] , [ 8 ] ) , and a key lesson has been that rich interactivity coupled with multiple linked views is extremely helpful .    at the same time , the embeddings that arise in machine learning differ from the kind of data sets seen in conventional `` high - dimensional '' visualization . \n most notably , traditional systems often assume the underlying dimensions have a particular meaning ( the expression level of a given gene , or the age of a person ) . on the other hand , \n the basis vectors in a typical embedding are typically not meaningful  in fact , discovering semantically significant directions can be a goal in itself .    in this paper , we present the embedding projector , a system for interactive visualization and analysis of high - dimensional data . although designed to be a general - purpose tool , it is optimized for the use cases that arise in machine learning and includes special features to explore meaningful directions in a data set . \n we held informal interviews with engineers and researchers within our organization to learn how they worked ( or wanted to work ) with embeddings . \n we also looked at usage of existing internal tools . \n three themes arose consistently . \n [ [ task-1.-exploring - local - neighborhoods ] ] task 1 . exploring local neighborhoods + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    many users wanted to inspect the nearest neighbors of a given point . \n confirming that nearby points are semantically related represented an important step in establishing trust in an algorithm . \n [ [ task-2.-viewing - global - geometry - and - finding - clusters ] ] task 2 . \n viewing global geometry and finding clusters + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    several users were interested in finding large clusters of related points , as well as seeing the global geometry of the embeddings .

adding fog to fade out more distant points ; and initializing the view with an animated `` lazy susan '' motion . \n both modes exploit webgl to provide smooth , fluid interaction , which encourages exploration of the underlying space , supporting both task 1 and task 2 . \n to support task 1 , clicking on a point causes the right pane to show an explicit textual list of nearest neighbors , along with distances to the current point . \n the nearest - neighbor points themselves are highlighted on the projection . \n users sometimes wish to focus on a subset of points  an interesting cluster , or perhaps the set of nearest neighbors of a given point . \n zooming into the cluster gives some information , but it is sometimes more helpful to restrict the view to a subset of points and perform t - sne or pca only on those points . \n to do so , the user can select points in multiple ways : after clicking on a point , its nearest neighbors are selected ; after a search , the points matching the query are selected ; right - clicking and dragging defines a selection sphere . after selecting a set of points , \n the user can isolate those points for further analysis on their own with the `` isolate points '' button in the inspector pane on the right hand side .    in 3d mode , labels can appear as `` billboards ''  flat images that always face the user . fig . \n [ 3d - labels ] depicts this view . \n when there is an image associated with a data point , we can simply use the actual image as the `` label '' . \n a nice example is an embedding of mnist images shown in fig . \n [ mnist - colorized ] where each image has a background color according to its true label . \n [ [ collaborative - features ] ] collaborative features + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    early in the development process we saw that users of the embedding projector wanted to share specific views of their data . \n indeed , previous work in visualization has shown the benefits of allowing users to share the state of a visualization [ 7 ] .    to allow easy collaboration \n , the embedding projector lets users save the current state ( including computed coordinates of t - sne embeddings ) as a small file . the projector can then be pointed to a set of one or more of these files , producing the panel seen in the bottom right of fig . \n [ fig - main ] . \n other users can then walk through a sequence of bookmarks . \n the embedding projector is a new visualization tool that helps users interpret machine learning models that rely on embeddings . unlike other high - dimensional visualization systems , \n it is customized for the kinds of tasks faced by machine learning developers and researchers : exploring local neighborhoods for individual points , analyzing global geometry , and investigating semantically meaningful vectors in embedding space . \n the projector is part of the tensorflow platform , and seamlessly allows analysis and interpretation of tensorflow models . \n there are a number of directions for future work on the visualization . \n for example , when developing multiple versions of a model , or inspecting how a model changes over time , it could be useful to visually compare two embeddings . \n doing so would require nontrivial additions to the current visualizations . \n a second direction for future research is to make it easier for users to discover meaningful directions in the data . \n while the current interface makes it easy to explore various hypotheses , there may be ways for the computer to generate and test hypotheses automatically . \n thanks to shan carter for invaluable design contributions , and to our colleagues who provided thoughtful feedback . \n [ 1 ] m.  abadi , a.  agarwal , p.  barham , e.  brevdo , z.  chen , c.  citro , g.  s. corrado , a.  davis , j.  dean , m.  devin , et  al . \n tensorflow : large - scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems . , 2016 . \n [ 2 ] c.  ahlberg and b.  shneiderman . \n visual information seeking : tight coupling of dynamic query filters with starfield displays . in _ proceedings of the sigchi conference on human factors in computing systems _ , pages 313317 . \n acm , 1994 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2864901099717, "RequestID": "2332a54a8f4e466591c185831a209553", "TotalTokens": 2586}
{"ContextTokens": 3569, "GeneratedTokens": 266, "SynthesizedBody": "scattering by density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium causes multiple rays to interfere , producing frequency structure in the spectra of spatially coherent sources such as pulsars @xcite . \n the relatively high transverse velocities of most pulsars cause the spectra to change significantly on timescales of minutes to hours . \n when the spectrum is monitored over time , the resulting two - dimensional array or `` dynamic spectrum '' is often dominated by a random pattern of scintillation maxima with characteristic bandwidth and timescale @xcite . on occasion , however , more organized features are present . \n the best studied of these are periodic fringe patterns in the dynamic spectra due to the interference between two or more discrete bundles of rays or , equivalently , rays arriving from multiple images on the sky ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * hereafter rlg ) .    a less well - studied pattern in pulsar dynamic spectra consists of a crisscross of intensity maxima that are variably spaced perpendicular to the ridge lines of the maxima . \n cordes and wolszczan ( 1986 ) drew attention to these `` multiple drift rates '' in dynamic spectra , building on earlier work ( hewish 1980 ; roberts & ables 1982 ; hewish , wolszczan , & graham 1985 ; cordes , weisberg , & boriakoff 1985 ) . \n numerous examples of the phenomenon are evident in the dynamic spectra presented by gupta , rickett , & lyne ( 1994 ) in their multi - year study of 8 pulsars , but the autocorrelation analysis that they employed is not well suited to its full elucidation \n . the remarkable episode of `` fringing '' in the dynamic spectra of psr  b0834 + 06 that rlg explore is also accompanied at all epochs by this phenomenon . \n the central result of our study is to show that this crisscross pattern has a much clearer representation in transform space , where it is seen to be a high - q phenomenon with a characteristic parabolic curvature . \n we discuss the constraints that the presence of this pattern places on the image geometry and speculate on the physical structures that might give rise to this scattering geometry . \n our observations were made at the arecibo observatory at 430  mhz . \n spectra across a 10  mhz band centered on this frequency were produced by a fourier - transform - based spectrometer ( aoftm ) . \n rcp and lcp signals were summed in hardware , and spectra with 1024 frequency channels ( i.e. 10  khz frequency resolution ) were produced every @xmath2  1.6  ms . during later analysis \n the spectra were synchronously averaged at the pulsar period , calculated using tempo @xcite , and summed over 10  s time intervals , creating a cube with axes of time , frequency , and pulsar rotational phase . \n we used 512 phase bins across the pulsar period . \n dynamic spectra were created by producing an on - pulse spectrum from a window of phase bins centered on the pulse and subtracting an off - pulse spectrum to remove the baseline . \n we observed 19 pulsars during 1999 january and 11 pulsars during 2000 january . \n a typical observation lasted one hour ; we made 46 and 43 separate observations at the two observing epochs , respectively . \n following several previous studies ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rlg ) we produced two - dimensional power spectra from the dynamic spectra . \n these `` secondary spectra '' form the basis for most of the further analysis reported here . \n we normalized each secondary spectrum by its maximum and converted the relative power levels into a decibel scale . \n figure  [ fig : dynsec ] shows dynamic and secondary spectra for psr  b0834 + 06 . \n the crisscross pattern in the dynamic spectrum shows up in the secondary spectrum as two parabolic features , curving away from the conjugate time axis , that we call `` arcs '' . \n these arcs are remarkable for their narrowness and extent . in figure \n [ fig : coadded ] we present secondary spectra , averaged over multiple days to improve dynamic range . \n psr  b0823 + 26 and psr  b0834 + 06 showed a persistent arc pattern over both the 1999 and 2000 observing runs . in 2000 , psr  b0919 + 06 showed arcs that were relatively broad and faint and , hence , showed up only upon averaging of @xmath3 secondary spectra . \n however , we did not see arcs in two high - quality 1999 observations . \n psr  b1133 + 16 showed arcs during most of the 1999 and 2000 observations , but several high - quality 2000 observations failed to show them , even though they were made on days adjacent to those on which they were present . \n psr  b1933 + 16 did not show the arc pattern in either of two high - quality observations in 1999 or 2000 . \n time variability of the arcs will be the subject of a separate study . \n we detected arcs in the secondary spectra of pulsars b0823 + 26 , b0834 + 06 , b0919 + 06 , and b1133 + 16 . by using the relationship between fringe frequencies in the secondary spectrum and scattering parameters ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rlg ; gupta , bhat , & rao 1999 ) \n , we can analyze the arcs more quantitatively . here \n we summarize a more detailed study that will be reported elsewhere ( cordes 2001 ) . to simplify calculations \n , these treatments assume that the scattering takes place in a thin screen a distance @xmath4 from the pulsar , with the pulsar - observer distance @xmath5 . \n they show that the interference between two points @xmath6 on the image plane ( i.e. as seen by an observer ) will lead to two - dimensional fringing in the dynamic spectrum with fringe frequencies f_t & = & ( ) ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) , [ eq : ft ] + f _ & = & ( ) ( d- ) ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) . \n [ eq : fnu ] here @xmath7 is the conjugate time axis , @xmath8 is the conjugate frequency axis , and the effective velocity ( cordes & rickett 1998 ) is a weighted sum of the velocities of the source , screen and observer , = ( 1 - /d)+ ( /d ) - \n . we can introduce the dimensionless variables p & = & ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) = f _ , [ eq : pbar ] + q & = & ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) = f_t , [ eq : qbar ] where @xmath9 is a two - dimensional unit vector for the effective velocity . \n since @xmath10 is quadratic in image angles and @xmath11 is linear in image angles , @xmath10 will generally be quadratic in @xmath11 . \n this is essential to explaining the parabolic curvature of the arcs . \n if we make the reasonable assumption that the pulsar velocity is much greater than either the velocity of the earth or the screen , equations  ( [ eq : pbar])([eq : qbar ] ) can be simplified to p & = & f _ , [ eq : pnew ] + q & = & f_t , [ eq : qnew ] where @xmath12 , and we approximate @xmath13 by the measured proper motion speed , @xmath14 . a parabolic arc ( @xmath15 ) in the p - q plane then corresponds to a feature in the secondary spectrum of curvature f _ & = & ( ) f_t^2 . \n [ eq : dyn - arc ] in this model , the curvature of the arcs is determined solely by the screen placement , the pulsar distance , and the pulsar proper motion . \n thus , by measuring the curvature of the arcs in the secondary spectrum , we can determine a value for the screen placement that is consistent with the observations and assumed values of @xmath5 and @xmath16 , as in table  [ tab : screen ] . \n gupta ( 1995 ) used diffractive bandwidth and timescale measurements to determine @xmath17 , the speed of the scintillation pattern past the observer ( cordes and rickett 1998 ) . assuming that the scattering is dominated by a thin screen \n , one can determine the screen placement for which @xmath17 is consistent with @xmath16 . \n this is determined from gupta s @xmath18 parameter by @xmath19 . \n table  [ tab : screen ] shows that the values of @xmath20 agree well with those for @xmath21 , calculated with eq . \n although the values of @xmath20 agree well with those for @xmath21 , the agreement may be only proportionate because there are significant uncertainties in both the distances and the iss parameters used by gupta ; also , scattering is likely to receive contributions from the distributed ism as well as from a screen . in particular , a recent study of b0919 + 06 ( chatterjee 2001 ) that compares scintillation velocity estimates , which are epoch dependent , and the parallax and proper motion determined from vlba observations , finds that a thin screen must be combined with a distributed medium such as that of the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model to bring agreement between the two velocity estimates . at some epochs \n , the screen evidently causes multiple imaging of the pulsar .    from equation  ( 1 ) \n it can be seen that the vertical ( @xmath7 ) extent of arc features in the secondary spectrum is related to the angular extent of the scattering image along the effective velocity vector . \n table  1 shows the typical angular extent of the filament , @xmath22 , and the corresponding linear size on the screen , @xmath23 , inferred from the value of @xmath7 for a generic model . \n we analyze the distribution of power in the secondary spectrum with a sequence of vertical cuts , as in figure  [ fig : cuts ] . \n the rapid decline of power above the arcs strongly limits the image geometries that are consistent with the data . in order to exclude power above the arc \n , points must satisfy @xmath24 . referring to equations  ( [ eq : pbar])([eq : qbar ] ) , \n this constraint can be expressed as _ 2 ^ 2-_1 ^ 2 & & ( _ 2x-_1x)^2 , [ eq : inequality ] where the @xmath25  components are along the effective velocity vector . \n a single extended image has many image pairs that violate this condition and , hence , will produce a large amount of power above the arcs , inconsistent with the behavior seen . hence , a multiple image geometry is required to produce the clearly delineated arcs we observe . \n one configuration that satisfies eq . \n 9 , having no detectable power above the arcs , consists of a bright point - like image at the origin ( direct line of sight to the pulsar ) and a faint secondary image as a filled halo around it . \n the interference between a point at the origin and any other image point can not produce power above the arcs because @xmath26 . \n if the point - like image and halo have flux densities proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , then the point - like source will produce a point - like feature at the origin of the secondary spectrum with power proportional to @xmath29 ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ) . \n the inter - image interference between the point - source and the halo will produce power proportional to @xmath30 . \n the self - interference between regions of the halo ( which _ will _ produce power above the arcs ) will be proportional to @xmath31 . \n since this is smaller by another factor of @xmath32 from the inter - image term , then , for small @xmath32 , the only detectable power will be a point - source at the origin and power below the arcs . \n although the point - source plus halo model is consistent with the observations , the scattering material in the screen would need to be inhomogeneous enough that the direct image of the pulsar would shine through , but rays slightly off - axis would be scattered . in essence , we would need to be seeing the pulsar through a break in the interstellar `` clouds '' , consistent with the time - variability of the arcs . on the other hand , \n there is strong evidence for scattering geometries based on filamentary structures @xcite . \n however , the self - interference between filaments will lead to features which are inconsistent with our data . \n any viable model based on filamentary features in the image plane must somehow hide these self - interference features as well as produce the observed parabolic arcs . \n the formalism used here includes only geometric delays , whereas differential dispersive delays may be important in some cases . \n the fact that the observed arcs conform to the geometric -

{"ContextTokens": 3798, "GeneratedTokens": 279, "SynthesizedBody": "melting of crystals has always been a fascinating subject for more than a century since the discovery of the empirical lindemann s criterion @xcite . \n the lindemann s criterion says that if the average of vibration amplitude u , namely @xmath0 , exceeds a certain value , usually 10@xmath1 of the distance between nearest - neighbors , then the melting occurs . times and over again , many authors have tried to find out microscopic precursor mechanisms that lead a crystal to melt . until 30 years ago , one of the favorite pictures of melting is the softening of a phonon mode due to the temperature ( t ) . \n the atoms have no longer restoring forces which keep them staying close to their equilibrium positions : they move around and the system goes to a liquid state . \n the soft - mode picture has encountered some scepticism because in real crystals as well as in simulations one observes that well below the melting temperature ( @xmath2 ) , many defects , dislocations , interstitial atoms ... are excited . \n therefore , it is hard to believe that the system stays in a periodic structure with propagating phonon modes up to @xmath2 . \n evidence of defects is found in many works @xcite . \n another question that is unsolved in a clear manner is the form of the potential that binds the atoms together in a given lattice structure . in a microscopic point of view \n , the potential should come mainly from the symmetry of atomic orbitals . \n but ab - initio calculations are still far away from being able to use realistic hypotheses @xcite . \n empirical potentials have been used instead to study melting . \n one can mention the popular 6 - 12 power lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xcite , various similar power potentials , the many - body gupta s potential @xcite , the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential @xcite , and the tersoff potential @xcite . \n two - body potentials such as the lj one crystallize atoms in the fcc at low temperatures and nothing else ; this comes from the fact that lj potential is isotropic so the atoms are crystallized in the most dense isotropic structure , namely the fcc lattice . in order to stabilize other structures , several phenomenological potentials have been introduced , often without a microscopic justification . \n for example , the sw potential or the tersoff potential stabilize the diamond structure at low temperatures . \n these potentials have been used with success to calculate properties of si clusters @xcite and amorphous si crystals @xcite .    in this paper \n , we use the lj potential to study the melting of rare - gas crystals which have the fcc lattice structure at low temperatures . \n it is amazing that such a simple question was not studied with precision so far in spite of an abundance of experimental data on rare gas such as ar , xe , ne and kr . \n most of the melting studies concerning rare gas were done in particular cases : small clusters @xcite , adlayers on a substrate , etc . the main reason to avoid to study \n the bulk melting may be due to some technical difficulties such as periodic boundary conditions , volume expansion with temperature , etc . \n previous monte carlo ( mc ) studies of bulk melting have been carried out with lj potential but emphasize was put on the melting mechanism rather than on the precise melting temperature in real materials @xcite . \n the purpose of this paper is therefore to test whether or not the experimental @xmath2 can be reproduced by mc simulation using the values of the lj parameters deduced for rare gas in the gaseous state long time ago@xcite . \n we will show here that by appropriate choices of technical procedures , we are able to obtain melting temperature for various rare gas _ directly _ from our simulations , unlike previous simulations @xcite which have had recourse to various means and some thermodynamic functions to deduce it . \n we find in this work the melting temperatures for several rare gas higher than experimental values . \n a revision of the values of lj parameters widely used in the literature for more than 50 years should be made in order to better describe the solid state of rare gas . \n note that in a recent work @xcite , a hypothetical thermodynamic integration path is used to find the relative free energies of the solid and liquid phases , for various system sizes , at constant cutoff radius , in an attempt to explain the overestimate of the melting temperature with the lj potential . \n however , due to various approximations , several results were not physically clear , in particular why the melting temperature oscillates with increasing cutoff distance . \n section [ sec : level2 ] is devoted to a description of the model and our mc technique . \n the results are shown and discussed in sect . \n [ sec : level3 ] . \n concluding remarks are given in sect . \n [ sec : level4 ] . \n the lj potential is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants , @xmath9 denotes the distance between two atoms at @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here \n @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n we list for convenience the values of the above constants for various rare gas and their melting temperatures , using the data from ref . \n note that the constants @xmath5 and @xmath8 are those deduced with some approximations using experimental data of the gaseous phase of rare gas which have been described in the pioneer paper of bernardes@xcite . \n the listed values of the constants should be therefore viewed as approximate values . to our knowledge \n , there were not papers using these constants to verify if the melting temperature is correctly obtained , either by theoretical calculations or by simulations . \n the absence of works dealing with this point has motivated our present work .    in one of our previous works @xcite , we have used the lj potential to investigate the mechanism which initiates the melting . \n we have counted the number of defects created with increasing temperature ( @xmath14 ) and found that the melting occurs when these defects interact with each other forming a kind of chains of defects which break the solid periodic state at a temperature well below the melting point . in that work \n , we did not use the constants of the lj potential for any specific material . \n we used instead the reduced temperature and dimensionless parameters . \n it was not our purpose to clarify the value of melting temperature for a given kind of crystal . \n it is now the time to verify those constants to see whether or not they yield the correct value of @xmath2 for the melting of the solid phase of rare gas . \n ( color online ) the lennard -

gas crystal is certainly a necessity in order to reproduce the experimental @xmath2 . \n we have done simulations with different pairs of @xmath21 ) . \n it turned out that @xmath2 depends essentially on @xmath5 . \n there is however an optimal value of @xmath8 which is @xmath22   corresponding to the experimental nearest - neighbor distance @xmath23   of ar ( cf . \n table [ tab : table5 ] ) . \n we show in fig . \n [ epsilon_effect ] the curves obtained for two selected values of @xmath240.008767853 and 0.008951794 which give respectively @xmath25 k and 86 k. these values of @xmath2 are in agreement with the experimental value 84 k within statistical errors . \n note that the modified @xmath5 is about 15% smaller than the original bernardes value @xmath26 . \n ( color online ) energy per atom versus @xmath14 for two selected values of @xmath5 , with @xmath22  , for an ar crystal with @xmath27 . \n the arrows indicate @xmath2 for the two indicated values of @xmath5 . \n see text for comments . \n , width=302,height=188 ]      at this stage , a natural question we ask ourselves is `` what is the effect of the cutoff distance @xmath28 ? '' . \n we know that for a long - range interaction , the longer the interaction range is the lower the energy becomes . as a consequence , \n the melting transition is higher . \n however , as @xmath28 increases , the contribution of neglected neighbors becomes smaller . from a certain value of @xmath28 , \n @xmath2 does not vary significantly . \n this is observed in fig . \n [ rc_effect ] where @xmath2 is saturated for @xmath29 , i. e. @xmath30  . \n all the results shown above for @xmath28 are valid in the discussion of the size effect and the modification of @xmath5 and @xmath8 . \n ( color online ) energy per atom versus @xmath14 with various values of @xmath28 for ar crystal with @xmath27 . \n the left arrow indicates @xmath2 for @xmath31 and the right arrow indicates @xmath2 for @xmath32 and @xmath33  . \n note that @xmath34 is the fcc lattice constant which is equal to @xmath35 where @xmath23   is the nn distance . \n see text for comments . \n , width=302,height=188 ]      in order to show that our algorithm works well with other rare gas , we have plotted the curve of energy versus temperature , obtained for krypton and xenon in fig . \n [ evtkr ] . \n again here , we see that @xmath2 , even for a small size , is already higher than the experimental value for each crystal . \n we think that the bernardes parameters for kr and xe should be modified to get an agreement with experiments as what proposed above for ar . \n ( color online ) upper : energy versus temperature for a krypton perfect crystal with @xmath19 atoms . \n one observes that @xmath36 k while the experimental value is @xmath37 k. lower : energy versus temperature for a xenon perfect crystal with @xmath27 atoms . \n one observes that @xmath38 k while the experimental value is @xmath39 k. these curves have been obtained with the bernardes values of parameters . , \n title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ] ( color online ) upper : energy versus temperature for a krypton perfect crystal with @xmath19 atoms . \n one observes that @xmath36 k while the experimental value is @xmath37 k. lower : energy versus temperature for a xenon perfect crystal with @xmath27 atoms . \n one observes that @xmath38 k while the experimental value is @xmath39 k. these curves have been obtained with the bernardes values of parameters . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ] \n we have shown in this paper results of the melting temperature for rare gas , by performing extensive mc simulations with the lj potential . \n we have obtained directly from our simulations physical quantities such as internal energy , lattice constant and radial distribution as functions of temperature . \n we have shown that melting occurs with a large latent heat and a jump in the lattice constant . \n effects of system size and cutoff distance have been investigated . \n let us emphasize that the theoretical lj parameters widely used in the literature @xcite yield a melting temperature higher than the experimental one as seen above , from @xmath40 15% for kr to @xmath40 20% for ar . \n this is not a surprise because those lj parameters already yield theoretical nn distance , cohesive energy and bulk modulus different from corresponding experimental ones ( see table [ tab : table5 ] ) . \n we have demonstrated that , in order to reduce the melting temperature to fit with experiments , it is necessary to modify the original bernardes lj parameter @xmath5 in such a way to reduce the energy at @xmath41 . \n the effect of @xmath8 , within possible values of nn distance , is very small on @xmath2 . \n a good agreement on @xmath2 between experiments and simulations for ar is obtained with the modified values given in fig . \n [ epsilon_effect ] . for other rare gas such as kr and xe \n , we have to proceed to a modification of their barnardes parameters in a manner similar to that done above for ar if we want to get a good agreement with experiments . \n r. morris and x. song , j. chem . phys . \n * 116 * , 9352 ( 2002 ) . \n j. r. errington , j. chem . phys . \n * 120 * , 3130 ( 2004 ) . \n e. a. mastny and j. j. de pablo , j. chem . phys . * \n 122 * , 124109 ( 2005 ) . \n g. c. mcneil - watson and n. wilding , j. chem . \n phys . * 124 * , 064504 ( 2006 ) . \n d. p. laudau and k. binder , in _ \n monte carlo simulation in statistical physics _ \n k. binder and d. w. heermann , springer - verlag , new york ( 1988 ) . \n p. c. hohenberg and b. i. halperin , rev . \n phys . * 49 * 435 ( 1977 ) . \n a. m. ferrenberg and r. h. swendsen , phys . \n * 61 * , 2635 ( 1988 ) ; ibid * 63 * , 1195(1989 ) . \n a. m. ferrenberg and d. p. landau , phys . \n rev . b*44 * , 5081 ( 1991 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2914547392046, "RequestID": "bb69f00f067a48c5a510cefee4e1fba3", "TotalTokens": 4077}
{"ContextTokens": 2812, "GeneratedTokens": 272, "SynthesizedBody": "there is a significant body of literature in statistics , econometrics and ecology dealing with the modeling of discrete responses under biased or preferential sampling designs . \n they are particularly popular in the natural sciences when species distributions are studied . \n such sample schemes may reduce the survey cost especially when one of the responses is rare . \n a large part of statistical literature concerns the case - control design , retrospective , choice - based or response - based sampling @xcite . in the simplest case a sample of cases and a sample of controls are available and for each observation a set of `` attributes / covariates '' is observed in both samples . \n then inference is carried out following standard statistical procedures @xcite . \n + a case that has received increasing attention in the literature is the situation where the sample of controls is a random sample from the whole population with information only on the attributes and not on the response @xcite . \n this situation is fairly common in ecological studies where only species presence is recorded when field surveys are carried out . in the ecological literature , since the 1990 s such data are called _ presence only data _ ( see * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n @xcite define presence - only data as `` consisting only of observations of the organism but with no reliable data where the species was not found '' . \n atlases , museum and herbarium records , species lists , incidental observation databases and radio - tracking studies are examples of such data . \n + in recent years we find a considerably growing literature describing approaches to the modeling of this type of data , among the many ecological papers we recall @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , most notably , in the statistical literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . while in @xcite and @xcite to model the presence - only data poisson point processes are considered in the likelihood and bayesian framework respectively , in @xcite and @xcite a modified case - control logistic model is adopted in the likelihood and bayesian perspective respectively , in both papers there is no account for possible dependence structure in the observations . in @xcite \n the asymptotic relations between the two approaches are discussed . \n + a different approach , maxent , is based on the maximum entropy principle @xcite . in maxent \n @xcite the relative entropy between the distribution of covariates at locations where the species is present and the unconditional background distribution of covariates is maximized subject to some constrains concerning empirical statistics ( see philips et al . , 2006 , for details ) . as pointed by @xcite \n `` the maxent method requires knowledge of species prevalence for its estimator of occurrence to be consistent '' . \n + in what follows we are going to use the name _ presence - only data _ when referring to the above sketched general problem of having information on the presence and covariates jointly on a sample from a population , while information on only the covariates is available on any sample from the same population . \n this work is developed in the same discrete setting as in @xcite and @xcite , i.e. , we have a population of independent units , no dependence structure , such as spatial correlation , is anticipated . \n we defer the treatment of this extension to a subsequent work . \n + the main contribution of the paper is a new rigorous formalization of the logistic regression model with presence - only data that allows further insight into the inferential issues . \n this leads us to an algorithmic procedure that , among other results , returns a mcmc approximation of the response prevalence under general knowledge of the process generating the data . \n we also present a large simulation study involving 24,000 simulated datasets and comparing our approach to other two models representing optimal benchmarks . \n + the paper is organized as follows . \n section [ sec : reglog ] introduces a general framework for the presence - only data problems , section [ sec : bayes ] presents our bayesian approach , section [ sec : mcmc ] describes the mcmc algorithm while results related to the simulation study are reported in section [ sec : sim ] . \n finally in section [ sec : conc ] some conclusions are drawn and future developments briefly described . \n the analysis of a binary response related to a set of explicative covariates is usually carried out through the use of the logistic regression where the logit of the conditional probability of occurrence is modeled as a function of covariates . in this section , \n we first introduce a general framework for the modeling of presence - only data and then consider the case of the linear logistic regression . \n the approach proposed is built on two levels and we partially follow the formulation introduced by @xcite but adopting a bayesian scheme as in @xcite . \n let @xmath0 be a binary variable informing on the presence ( @xmath1 ) or absence ( @xmath2 ) of a population s attribute and let @xmath3 denote a set of highly informative , on the same attribute , covariates which are available on the same population . \n then , the presence - only problem can be formalized by considering a censorship mechanism that acts when observing the response @xmath0 , so that part of the population units are not reachable . in particular , we refer to the situation in which we are able to detect only a partial set of units on which the attribute of interest is present while the information on the covariates @xmath4 is available on the entire population . in this situation \n , we have to consider two types of uncertainty : the uncertainty due to the mechanism of censorship and the uncertainty due to the sampling procedure . \n moreover , since we are not able to collect a random sample of observable data , we need to adjust for the sampling mechanism through the use of a case - control scheme @xcite . \n + in order to build a bayesian model , in this framework we adopt the following conceptual scheme in two levels . \n +          let @xmath9 be the subset of @xmath5 where we observe @xmath1 . \n a modified case - control design is applied so that a sample of presences , considered as cases , is selected from @xmath9 and a sample of `` contaminated '' controls @xcite is selected from the whole population @xmath5 , with all the covariates but no information on @xmath0 .      here \n , we can not approach the model construction using only a finite population approach @xcite because of the censoring mechanism that `` masks '' distributional information on @xmath0 already at the population level . by the introduction of level 1 we can describe the censored observations as random quantities generated by the model @xmath8 . \n hence , the problem of presence - only data can be formalized as a problem of missing data @xcite .      at the first level , we assume that the law @xmath8 is defined in terms of the conditional probability of occurrence @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath11 , when the covariates are @xmath12 . \n moreover , we consider that the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is formalized through a regression function @xmath13 on the logit scale @xmath14 that is @xmath15 when the data @xmath7 are independently generated from @xmath8 , we denote by @xmath16 the empirical prevalence of the binary response @xmath0 in @xmath5 , expressed as the ratio of the number of presences @xmath17 to the size of the population , that is @xmath18      at the second level , we adopt a case - control design modified for presence - only data @xcite in order to account for the specific sampling procedure considered . \n the use of the case - control scheme is necessary at all times when it is appropriate to select observations in fixed proportions with respect to the values of the response variable . \n this can occur when the attribute of interest represents a phenomenon that is rare among the units of the population as for example a rare disease or a rare exposure in epidemiological studies @xcite . \n + now , let @xmath19 be a binary indicator of inclusion into the sample ( @xmath20 denotes that a unit is in the sample ) , let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the inclusion probability of the absences and the presences , respectively . under the assumption that , given @xmath0 , the sampling mechanism is independent from the covariates @xmath4 , the conditional probability of occurrence is modified through the bayes rule as @xmath23 hence , the corresponding case - control regression function @xmath24 defined as the logit of is given by @xmath25 in particular , if the selection of cases ( @xmath26 ) and controls ( @xmath27 ) is made independently without replacement , the inclusion probabilities are given in terms of the empirical prevalence @xmath16 by @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that the equation becomes @xmath30 in our framework , since the response variable @xmath0 is already censored at the population level , the standard case - control design can not be adopted but it should be modified in such a way that a sample of presences is matched with an independent sample drawn from the entire population , named the _ background sample _ @xcite . remark that in this sample the response variable is unobserved and only the covariates are available . \n + in this way , the complete sample @xmath31 is composed by a set @xmath32 of @xmath33 independent background data , where the response @xmath0 is not observed , drawn from the entire @xmath5 and by a set @xmath34 of @xmath35 independent observations selected from the sub - population of presences @xmath9 . \n this procedure implies that the reference population @xmath5 is augmented with its subset @xmath9 so that the total number of observations considered in the sampling scheme becomes @xmath36 . to illustrate the sampling framework we are going to adopt here , \n let us consider the following situation : we can label population units of type @xmath37 only when they are isolated from units of type @xmath38 . \n this can be formalized by introducing a binary stratum variable @xmath39 such that @xmath40 indicates when an observation is drawn from the entire population @xmath5 while @xmath41 denotes the sampling from the sub - population @xmath9 . \n remark that @xmath41 implies @xmath1 whilst @xmath40 implies that @xmath0 is an unknown value @xmath42 . \n moreover , by construction @xmath39 is independent from the covariates @xmath4 , given the response @xmath0 . \n the introduction of the variable @xmath39 allows us to define the structure of the data at the population level and at the sample level in terms of presences / absences ( @xmath0 ) and known / unknown data ( @xmath39 ) , as reported in table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] . \n di  lorenzo , b. , farcomeni , a. , and golini , n.

{"ContextTokens": 1243, "GeneratedTokens": 169, "SynthesizedBody": "as it was pointed out in one of the papers of @xcite , massive professional photometric surveys are today sources of many , often unexpected , discoveries ( e.g. the asas project of @xcite or the kepler mission of @xcite ) . on the other hand , databases collecting amateur photometric measurements are growing rapidly , as telescopes and ccd detectors are easily accessible nowadays @xcite . \n this gives us access to a number of valuable open astronomical archives , both professional and amateur , with a richness of data gathered during the past decades . \n we have now a great opportunity to trace photometric behaviour of a lot of variable objects , for instance dwarf novae stars . \n dwarf novae are cataclysmic binaries with a white dwarf as a primary and a low mass main sequence star , filling its roche lobe , as a secondary . \n due to the transfer of mass from the secondary onto the non - magnetic primary , an accretion disk is formed . \n such a mass transfer leads to outbursts in dwarf novae , as they are caused by sudden gravitational energy release due to accretion of this material onto the white dwarf . \n dwarf novae with shortest orbital periods ( @xmath0 ) are called su  uma stars . \n they are characterised by the presence of superoutbursts , next to normal outbursts , which are about @xmath1 brighter and about ten times less frequent than normal outbursts @xcite . \n the length of the supercycle , i.e. the time between two successive superoutbursts , is one of the most fundamental properties of su  uma stars and is specific for each of them . \n the nature of this feature is still uncertain . \n nowadays there is an open debate about the cause of superoutbursts . \n the thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model @xcite suggests that the sypercycle length ( @xmath2 ) is set by the mass transfer rate ( @xmath3 ) . \n according to this scenario , the observed @xmath2 is inversely proportional to @xmath3 . \n the tti model shows that normal outbursts remove less material from the disk than it has been accreted since the last normal outbursts . \n this makes the disk grow during a number of normal outbursts . \n when the disk reaches the critical radius ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the binary separation ) , it becomes eccentric and tidal effects occur , which causes superoutburst , during which the disk is shrinking again . \n although the tti model is commonly accepted , it still seems to need some improvements . for instance the tti simulations which reproduced the light curve of one of the most active dwarf novae , er  uma star , required an artificial increase of the mass transfer rate by the factor of ten in comparison to values expected from the theory based on gravitational radiation @xcite . \n another example is the fact shown by ( * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) that embedded precursors of superoutbursts are present also in systems with long orbital periods . \n this argues for a more general model , which is not restricted to the mass ratio of @xmath6 , as the tti model . \n recently @xcite presented evidence in favor of this model . \n although their analysis was based on variations of the negative superhump period of a single dwarf nova , v1504 cyg , they claimed that the cause of superoutbursts is finally revealed . \n however , @xcite showed that this object can not be considered as a representative for all systems which show negative superhumps . \n he also presented a number of arguments which suggest that superoubursts are caused by strongly enhanced mass transfer ( emt ) rate @xcite . \n recent observations @xcite surprisingly showed that the supercycle length of one of the most active dwarf novae , ix  draconis , has been increasing with a constant rate since the last twenty years . \n this is interesting in the context of evolution of such systems . \n encouraged by this fact , we decided to investigate the same issue for other well - observed active objects of the su  uma type . \n the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec - data ] \n we give information on the data used in this research . \n the analysis is presented in section  [ sec - analysis ] . \n results together with discussion are given in section  [ sec - res ] . \n we summarize the main conclusions in section  [ sec - conc ] . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - nextsteps ] \n we analysed a set of photometric data covering last decades of observations for the most active su  uma stars in order to study changes of their supercycle lengths . \n despite the common feature of the selected objects , which is the highest activity in this class of stars , they are diverse in terms of their orbital periods below the period gap . for all of the analysed objects we found positive values of period derivatives of their supercycle lengths . \n there are some subtle fluctuations for short time scales in the behaviour of @xmath2 , but the general trend is the same in each case . \n increasing supercycle lengths mean that the mean mass transfer rates have been decreasing for these objects over the last decades . \n this is in agreement with the scenario of the evolution of bk  lyn presented by @xcite , which seems to be a general case . \n this phenomenon is important in the context of evolution of such systems .", "StartTimeOffset": 2971857367599, "RequestID": "980bd6af2b704244ab9203dd74f7243e", "TotalTokens": 1412}

[ figsed ] ) . in the case of large opacities , \n the estimated sizes of the dust emission regions vary from 0.2 pc for the hottest component ( 1000 k ) , to @xmath7500 pc for the coldest one ( 20 k ) , and in the case of low opacities , the minimum estimated size is 0.3 pc , and the maximum 20 kpc . the comparison between the temperatures and sizes measured in the two extreme regimes , and the observed values in seyfert galaxies suggests that the cold dust is characterized by low opacity , while the warm / hot dust may be more opaque . as a consequence , the ir reradiation at long wavelengths ( t @xmath8 60 k ) will be isotropic , and orientation - independent . \n conversely , at shorter wavelengths ( t @xmath9 60 k ) the dust may self - absorb its emitted radiation , and the observed emission may depend on orientation . \n the steepness of the power law obtained by fitting all the ir data at wavelengths shorter than 60 @xmath0 m , where the effects of opacity become important , is an indicator of dust extinction . we compared the balmer decrement values ( h@xmath10/h@xmath11 ) , indicators of extinction at optical wavelengths , of the nls1 galaxies studied here with the slope of the power law obtained by fitting the observed data between 3 and 60 @xmath0 m ( see best - fit power laws in fig . \n [ figsed ] ) . \n the measured power law slopes range between 0.99 and 1.77 , which corresponds to a range in the visual extinction of 61 mag , provided that all objects have the same intrinsic ir power law . \n the variation in the h@xmath10/h@xmath11 values corresponds instead to a range in the visual extinction of only 2.8 mag . \n such a difference indicates that all the emitting dust can not be responsible for the reddening observed in the balmer lines . \n however , the two parameters , h@xmath10/h@xmath11 , and @xmath12 , are strongly correlated ( the spearman s correlation rank is 1.0 , with a null associated probability to obtain such a value from uncorrelated values ) . \n the corresponding values and their linear interpolation are shown in fig . \n [ red_ir]a , with filled diamonds and a dashed line , respectively . \n we selected 12 additional nls1 galaxies from a sample of 148 objects for which the balmer decrement and the ir spectrum were measured . \n the observed correlation is still present for the additional 12 nls1 galaxies ( the spearman s correlation rank is 0.61 , and the probability to obtain such a value from uncorrelated values is 1.13% ) , as shown in fig . \n [ red_ir]a ( the solid line represents the best fit line obtained considering all the 16 nls1 galaxies which are marked by empty diamonds ) . a correlation between @xmath12 and the line intensity ratio \n [ oiii]/h@xmath11 was also discovered ( see fig .

@xmath54 is calculated from the epicyclic approximation . \n the toomre s parameter of initial disk is @xmath55 , so we have the disk which is marginally stable for axisymmetric perturbations , but not , however , against strong non - axisymmetric ones . \n observations suggest that the majority of the interacting galaxies are located on nearly parabolic orbits . \n for all the collisions , disks were located in the plane of parabolic orbits , calculated from parameterized equations of the two - body problem , with a pericentric separation @xmath56 , and the time to pericenter @xmath57 . \n the direction of rotation of one of the disks ( disk 1 ) was in the same direction as the corresponding orbital - angular - momentum , i.e. , direct motion . \n the other disk ( disk 2 ) was in retrograde motion . \n the two colliding galaxies are initially identical . \n for the time evolution we use a barnes tree code type@xcite modified to include the newtonian contribution of the scalar fields as given by eqs . \n ( 4)-(8 ) @xcite . \n the forces were computed with a tolerance parameter @xmath58 , and including the monopole term only . for the gravitational potential we used the standard plummer model @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the softening parameter taken in our simulations to be @xmath61 . \n the equations of motion were integrated using the second order leap  frog algorithm with a fixed time step @xmath62 . with these parameters \n we obtain a good energy conservation ( @xmath63 ) and , also , good angular momentum conservation ( @xmath64 ) for all runs presented here .    to characterize quantitatively the bar amplitude , we consider the distortion parameter defined as@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 \n the particles that are outside of the spatial region of the original disk can affect the parameter under study . \n for instance , if we calculate the distortion parameter using all the particles in the disk , we have in both cases similar evolution curves . \n therefore , to avoid the noise , we exclude particles that are outside of the original radius of the disk . \n we first study isolated galaxy models with different values of @xmath1 . \n we consider four set of simulations followed up to time @xmath68 . \n the parameters and results of runs are presented in the table , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the initial and mean total energies , and @xmath71 is the relative change of the total energy during the evolution with respect to its initial value . \n though the scale of interaction @xmath1 and magnitude of @xmath0 are unknown , we choose their values arbitrarily , such that @xmath1 is equal to the cutoff radius of the disk , bulge and halo for models a1 , a2 and a3 , respectively , and a fixed amplitude of the sf , @xmath72 . \n the larger @xmath1 makes weaker the contribution of sf for a fixed galactic size . for @xmath73 \n one obtains the newtonian case , model a4 . \n previous studies of protogalactic interactions under influence of this sf@xcite were made for scales less than those considered here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + all models show a good energy conservation ( see table ) . \n the presence of the sf decreases the total potential energy due to shallower potential well at distances @xmath74 . \n the initial models reaccommodate rapidly due to potential modification , i.e. , shifts to a new equilibrium state . at the end of evolution , \n the components of galaxy models with the sf became slightly more extended . \n the velocity profiles of the components match the newtonian ones up to @xmath75 . \n for @xmath74 there is a slow decay in velocities , since the effective gravitational constant decreases . \n the distortion parameter shows a nearly equal noise level of surface density of the disks . \n the evolution of the toomre s local stability parameter @xmath2 shows a slow decay from @xmath55 to @xmath76 with mean values presented in the table for each run . \n then , we proceed to study the interaction of two equal galaxy models . during the orbital decay \n we analyze the bar s strength for different values of @xmath1 . \n because the equilibrium galaxy models were constructed with newtonian potential , we relax them up to time @xmath77 with modified sf potential in order to reach a new equilibrium state for a given @xmath1 . \n then we place relaxed galaxies on parabolic orbits and let them interact . \n the results are as follows . \n the first encounter occurs at time @xmath78 . \n this is the time of major transfer of orbital angular momentum , and then disk 1 forms a strong bar , while disk 2 is in retrograde motion and develops a very weak bar . \n figure 1 ( left ) presents the separation between the centers of mass , @xmath79 , of two galaxies as a function of time . \n all runs , except a1 , after several close approaches merge and form a remnant . in the run with model a1 , after the first approach the galaxies separate such a large distance that they will never encounter again . \n this is because the weaker gravity is , the more lessable the galaxies are to become bound : at distances larger than @xmath1 the potential diminishes in comparison with the pure newtonian . in the runs a2 and a3 \n the sf causes just a retardation of the subsequent interactions . \n the simulation with model a3 is practically identical to newtonian one .    in order to analyze the bar formation , we consider following only the disk 1 . in figure 1 ( right ) \n we plot the distortion parameters @xmath80 as a function of time for runs with galaxy models a2 and a4 only . as a consequence of gravity modification \n , the galaxies do not approach each other too closely as happens in the newtonian run . \n thus , weaker perturbations make the bar shorter . \n the run with galaxy model a3 is very similar to the newtonian case . \n the bar s phases are displaced due to orbit modification .     for two collision \n runs with models a1 and a3.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]   for two collision runs with models a1 and a3.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ] \n from simulations of isolated galaxy models with different @xmath1 , we can see that the addition of a non  minimally coupled sf slightly modifies the equilibrium of newtonian model , acting as a small perturbation , and it diminishes the total potential energy for @xmath74 , since the effective gravitational constant decreases in this range . \n our results show that the interaction of galaxies with the sf is weaker in comparison with the newtonian case . \n we have found that the inclusion of the sf changes the dynamical properties such as the collision time , bar morphology , and in general the remnant properties . \n all these changes depend on the pair ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , which on the other hand , can be constrained from observations . \n for instance , the duration of interaction can not be larger than the age of the universe , implying constraints on values of @xmath81 , which depends on @xmath82 and @xmath0 . \n these constraints can be provided from statistical data on the fraction of observed interacting galaxies . \n a wide range of parameters should be investigated and higher resolution have to be used in simulations in order to make predictions for particular interacting models . \n further investigations with more particles and self - consistent initial models are under way . \n this work was partly supported by sre and conacyt of mxico under contracts u43534-r , sep-2003-c02 - 44917 . \n m.  a.  rodriguez - meza , et al . , in _ exact solutions and scalar fields in gravity : recent developments _ , edited by a. macias , et al . \n ( kluwer academic / plenum publishers , new york , 2001 ) , p. 213 . \n arxiv:0907.2466 [ astro-ph.co ] . m.a . \n rodrguez - meza and j.l . \n cervantes - cota , _ rev . \n ( serie de conferencias ) _ * 17 * ( 2003 ) 43 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2992611774185, "RequestID": "38ec820c46fa48aea2c77dbd0b5ba178", "TotalTokens": 3881}
{"ContextTokens": 2754, "GeneratedTokens": 60, "SynthesizedBody": "tesla ( tev - energy superconducting linear accelerator ) is an @xmath0 linear collider designed to operate in the energy range beyond the mass of the z@xmath1 and up to the tev region . \n if approved , tesla would allow a wide physics program , focusing among other things on precision tests of the established standard model , the higgs mechanisms and the discovery of new particles .    to optimally exploit the physics potential of tesla \n , the detector has to satisfy some stringent requirements . \n it has to have a very good track momentum resolution to measure the z@xmath1 recoil mass , an excellent vertex resolution for heavy flavour identification , a high resolution in the reconstruction of electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the calorimeter , and has to be as hermetic as possible . the general concept of a detector fulfilling these criteria , discussed within the ecfa - desy study , is described in details in @xcite . \n + in this contribution , we describe the current design of the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the different ongoing studies concerning the readout technologies . \n a large tpc is proposed as the main inner tracker at tesla . \n the actual design , taking into account the different performance goals , is described in details in the tesla tdr  @xcite . \n the tpc , as shown schematically in figure  [ tpc-side-view.eps ] , is of cylindrical design with an inner radius of about 32  cm , an outer radius of about 170  cm and an overall length in the beam direction of about 2  @xmath2  273  cm . \n the internal radius is determined by the size of the mask system , whereas the external radius is constrained by the fact that the calorimeter is inside the coil . \n these large dimensions allow the tracks to be measured with about 200 @xmath3 space points , so that the global tracking efficiency remains close to 100  % in the overall volume and a momentum resolution @xmath4  /  gev in the central region can be achieved . \n in addition the tpc should measure the specific energy loss of particles thus aiding in the identification of charged particles . with ar - based gas mixtures , operating at atmospheric pressure \n , it is expected that a resolution of @xmath5 can be reached , enough , to provide a separation between pions and kaons of better than two sigma for momenta between 2 and 20 gev . \n operating a tpc in the environment at tesla presents a number of challenges . \n presently no dedicated hardware trigger is forseen within a bunch train , so that all detectors should be active throughout one full train about 1  ms . \n one readout cycle of the tpc will integrate over approximatively 150 bunch crossings at tesla , and many readout cycles will follow continuously until a train has passed . \n this makes it important that the readout is granular enough to resolve the expected number of hits . \n in addition means have to be found to avoid the need for gating the tpc to remove the buildup of positive ions : during one bunch trains ions will travel significantly into the tpc drift volume , potentially distorting the drift field . \n a possible solution to handle both the high granularity and to suppress the ions drift into the drift volume is the use of micro - pattern gas detectors as readout devices . \n possible candidates are at the moment micromegas chambers  @xcite or gas electron multipliers ( gem ) foils  @xcite . \n micro - pattern gas chambers , due to their intrinsically smaller distances between amplification elements compared to the traditional wire chambers , offer the promise to significantly reduce systematic distortions in the electron drift close to the amplification region due to the so - called @xmath6 effect . \n a challenging research and development program is underway to meet the current design goals for a tpc at a linear collider like tesla . \n institutes from a number of different countries are participating ( aachen , carleton , desy , ipn orsay , karlsruhe , krakow , lal , lbnl , mit , mpi munich , nikhef , novosibirsk , rostock , saclay and victoria ) . \n the main focus of the work is at the moment on the development of a valid amplification and ion - suppression scheme ( see reference  @xcite ) . over the next years , efforts to develop a compact readout scheme and to understand \n the design of the mechanical structure of such a large tpc are planned . in the following sections we present the different first results for these different key issues . \n several studies focus on the tpc readout using micro - pattern gas detectors instead of the wire used conventionally to produce the gas amplification that is necessary to read the tpc signal . \n gas electron multiplier ( gem ) and micromegas , sketched in figure [ gemmicromegas.eps ] , are two attractive candidates for the readout planes .        a gem foil is a sandwich consisting of thin conductive layers of copper separated by a thin polymer film of capton . \n the foil is perforated with small holes arranged in a hexagonal lattice . \n when operating in the detector , a potential applied to the two conductive layers generates a strong electric field , typically 80 kv / cm , in the small holes . \n the electric field lines guide charged particles through the gem holes , with minimal losses due to collisions with the foil . \n electrons are accelerated in the strong field lines within the gem foil , producing secondary ionizations and charge multiplication which are then transfered by the electric field to the readout pads where they are collected . \n a unique property of the gems is their capability to operate in cascade , i.e. in a multi - gem structure , offering several advantages like a higher gain and an effective ion feedback suppression . \n most of the groups working with gem readout use gem towers with two or more gems . \n an attractive alternative technology to gem is that of micromegas . \n an uniform high - field , typically 30  kv / cm , is produced between a thin metallic mesh , few microns thick , stretched at a distance of 50 - 100  @xmath7 m above the readout pad plane and held by insulating pillars . on top of the mesh , the electrons are transferred to the amplification gap , where they are multiplied in an avalanche process , resulting in a large number of electron - ion pairs . \n a micromegas has similar advantages to a gem as far as simplicity of construction , low cost and efficiency of ion - feedback suppression are concerned . \n it has an excellent potential for de / dx resolution due to the fact that the gain is nearly independent of the gap thickness . \n moreover it is robust and can be built at least in parts using commercially available components . \n r&d studies focus among other things on the gain stability and homogeneity to reach a de / dx measurement with 5% precision . \n this is illustrated in figure [ gainvsruntime.eps ] which shows the gain uniformity with time using a two - gem tower structure . \n a crucial issue at tesla is to prevent the ions produced during the amplification to return to the tpc drift volume and cause field distortions . \n the use of gems or micromegas promises to reduce the ion feedback . \n the degree of reduction depends strongly on the exact choice of operational parameters and the micro - pattern gas detector used . \n several ongoing studies , using gems and micromegas , demonstrated a suppression to the level of 10@xmath8 ( figure  [ saclay.eps ] ) . \n however , a level of suppression to a level of 10@xmath9 is needed to ensure that the positive - ion effects are at an acceptable level . in case \n this goal can not be reached and to guarantee a stable and robust chamber operation , the insertion of a gating plane , gated in between bunch trains , might be needed in order to minimize the effects of ion feedback .          to optimally exploit gems and micromegas and \n in addition to the experimental program , extensive simulation studies are being performed . \n these concern mainly the study of the charge transfer mechanism in gem or micromegas structures . \n these numerical simulations are of crucial importance , since they determine the optimal parameter choice needed to reach the different tesla tpc milestones . \n figure  [ aachen.eps ] shows , as the validation of the simulation of a gem hole , the comparison between measurement and simulation of the evolution of the primary and secondary extraction efficiencies respectively defined as the fraction of ions extracted from the gem holes into the drift volume per number of ions produced in the holes and the fraction of ions extracted from the gem hole into the drift volume per number of ions which have been collected in the gem hole . \n the charge produced during the avalanche in the gems is collected by readout pads located typically a few mm behind the last gem . \n since the number of pads is limited , the distance between pad centers is large compared to the size of the electron avalanche cloud ( typically a few to several 100  @xmath7 m ) . \n the charge from a track after amplification in the gems is therefore sometimes collected on a single pad . \n this effect is even more important with magnetic field at tesla since the transverse diffusion is then smaller . \n the major consequence will be that the centre of gravity method can not be applied anymore for position calculation . \n ongoing simulation studies investigate more sophisticated pad geometries , like chevron - shaped pads which may lead to a better point resolution if the charge sharing between neighboring pads is more important . \n figure  [ res_chevron_rect.2.eps ] shows the measured point resolution @xmath10 for rectangular and chevron shaped pad with a size of 14 @xmath2 14 mm@xmath11 and for different drift lengths using gems and without magnetic field . for small drift distances \n the point resolution with chevrons is better than with rectangles . \n this effect of the pad geometry gets smaller with increasing drift distances since the influence of the diffusion of the electron cloud gets larger . \n the improvement is clearly visible but simulation studies concerning mainly the pad response function description , the optimal induction gap between the last gem and the pad plane , are still required for a better description of the pad charge sharing mechanism . \n another approach to make the electron charge cloud broader , and get then a better point resolution , uses a resistive anode foil placed a few ten of @xmath7 m between the readout plane and the last gem . \n this work is illustrated by the plot on figure  [ carleton.eps ] showing the signal detected with a size of about 2  mm for an initial charge cluster size of 1  mm . \n the possibility to detect induced pulses in a gem setup is also being studied . during the buildup of charges in the gem hole a small induced pulse \n is expected in the pad opposite to this hole . \n this signal is also visible in the neighbor pads and can then be used to reconstruct the position of the avalanche and have a resolution significantly better . \n the price to pay for this improvement is that the readout electronics has to be able to detect the small pulses and that a very fast electronics is needed . \n several institutes have started a joint r&d effort with the goal of developing the technologies needed for a large tpc at the next generation of linear colliders . \n the main challenge is to design a continuous - tracking , high performance tpc which should be substantially more performant than any existing tpc . \n important progress has been made to better understand the different aspects of the tpc . \n particular emphasis is placed on the amplification , the ion - suppression scheme and the large scale - integration electronics . \n while first results concerning these different points look very promising , some open questions like the readout behavior in a strong magnetic field , or the results with large tpc prototypes , still remain unanswered and need more investigations in the near future . \n i wish to thank all the members of the ecfa - desy tpc study for providing material for this contribution . \n i m grateful to ties behnke for reading this manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 3011066860492, "RequestID": "07f9f427f29a40429c796001409137c9", "TotalTokens": 2814}

diameter geodesic structure surrounded the acrylic vessel and supported 9456 20-cm - diameter photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) pointed toward the center of the detector . \n a non - imaging light concentrator was mounted on each pmt to increase the effective photocathode coverage to 54%  @xcite . \n the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . \n sno was located in the vale creighton mine in ontario , canada at a depth of 2.092 km ( @xmath8 meters water equivalent ) with a flat overburden . at this depth , \n the muon rate incident over the geodesic sphere and integrated over the seasonal variation is @xmath9/day across an impact area of 216 m@xmath10@xcite . \n muons entering the detector produce cherenkov light at an angle of 42@xmath0 with respect to the propagation direction of the muon . cherenkov light and light from delta rays produced by the muon illuminate an average of 5500 pmts , whose charge and timing information are recorded . \n the amplitude and timing response of the pmts were calibrated _ in situ _ using a light diffusing sphere illuminated by a laser at six distinct wavelengths @xcite . \n this laser ball calibration was of particular relevance to the muon fitter because it provides a timing and charge calibration for multiple photon hits on a single pmt . \n other calibration sources used in sno are described elsewhere @xcite . \n data taking in the sno experiment was subdivided into three distinct phases for measurement of the solar neutrino flux . in the first phase , the experiment ran with pure d@xmath7o only . \n the solar neutral current reaction was observed by detecting the 6.25 mev @xmath11-ray following the capture of the neutron by a deuteron . for the second phase of data taking , approximately 0.2% by weight of purified nacl \n was added to the d@xmath7o volume to enhance the sensitivity to neutrons via their capture on @xmath12cl . in the third and final phase of the experiment , \n 40 discrete @xmath13he and @xmath14he proportional tubes were inserted within the fiducial volume of the detector . \n this enhanced the neutron capture cross - section to make an independent measurement of the neutron flux , by observing neutron capture on @xmath13he in the proportional counters . \n results from the measurements of the solar neutrino flux for these phases have been reported elsewhere  @xcite . \n the sno muon reconstruction algorithm fits for a through - going muon track based on the charge , timing , and spatial distribution of triggered pmts . using a maximum likelihood method , the fitter is able to determine a variety of muon tracking parameters , including the muon s propagation direction , impact parameter with respect to the center of sno , the total deposited energy , and a timing offset . \n the likelihood is defined as : @xmath15 \\label{eq : fti_lh}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of detected photons , @xmath17 is the probability of @xmath16 photoelectrons being detected for @xmath18 expected number of detected photoelectrons , @xmath19 is the probability of seeing charge @xmath20 given @xmath16 photon hits , and @xmath21 is the probability of observing a pmt trigger at time @xmath22 given @xmath16 photon hits . \n the heart of the fitter lies in the first probability term , which is calculated based on monte carlo simulations . \n muons were simulated at discrete impact parameter values with random directions through the detector . \n these simulations were used to create lookup tables for how many photoelectrons are expected to be detected by a pmt at a given position with respect to a muon track with a given impact parameter . \n the second term further refines the fit by including the charge information from the pmts , and allows an estimate of the total energy deposited by the muon , correcting for offline pmts and the neck of the detector . \n this probability was calculated by simulating multiple photon hits on all of the pmts in sno . for a given number of photon hits , \n the resulting charge distribution is modeled as an asymmetric gaussian with the widths extracted from simulations . \n this fit model agrees well with the simulations for many photon hits , and acceptably for few photon hits ( see figure  [ fig : q_prob ] ) . \n the third term in the likelihood refines the fit by including the pmt timing . for each pmt \n , the time residual can be calculated as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the recorded time on a given pmt , @xmath25 is the time offset term in the likelihood fit , @xmath26 is the distance the muon travels within the detector before emitting the cherenkov photon , @xmath27 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath28 is the distance the cherenkov photon traveled , and @xmath29 is the average speed of light in d@xmath7o / h@xmath7o medium ( 21.8 cm / ns ) \n . the cherenkov photon is assumed to have an angle of @xmath30 with respect to the muon track , making @xmath26 and @xmath28 well - defined . \n the probability of the time residual is modeled as a gaussian centered at zero with corrections to include estimates of prepulsing and late light as a function of the number of photon hits . \n the sno muon fitter maximizes the likelihood function for the impact parameter , direction , deposited energy , and timing offset using the method of simulated annealing with downhill simplex  @xcite . after determining the parameters that maximize the likelihood , a set of data \n quality measurements are used for background rejection .     the angular difference ( as defined in eq . \n [ eq : thetamr ] ) of monte - carlo muon tracks through the sno detector ( solid histogram ) . \n the angular distribution is fit to the function outlined in eq . \n [ eq : xtwogaus1 ] ( solid line ) . \n the results from the fit are given in table  [ tab : muon_recon ] . ]    the muon fitter is found to have good reconstruction accuracy on simulated muons . \n figure  [ fig : mcang ] shows the angle @xmath31 between the monte carlo generated muon direction ( @xmath32 ) and the reconstructed muon direction ( @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 this is fit to a weighted double gaussian function : @xmath35 \\label{eq : xtwogaus1}\\ ] ]    the additional @xmath36-dependence is introduced in order to account for the phase space available . \n the fit parameters are summarized in table [ tab : muon_recon ] . \n although the tails are non - gaussian , this fit gives a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty for the angular resolution . \n figure  [ fig : mcimp ] shows the impact parameter reconstruction accuracy . \n the distribution is fit to the sum of two gaussians :    @xmath37 \\label{eq : twogaus1}\\ ] ]    with the fit parameters also summarized in table [ tab : muon_recon ] . \n monte carlo studies show that the reconstruction accuracy of the muon direction and impact parameter are uncorrelated .     the impact parameter difference of monte -

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : ang_noshift ] shows the results of applying the two assumptions to the 30 reconstructed emus - sno events . \n the data are fitted to the functional forms of equations  [ eq : xtwogaus1 ]  and  [ eq : twogaus1 ] . due to the small number of events , the weights and relative widths of the secondary gaussians \n are fixed to their values from the earlier simulations . \n we find that the angular width is @xmath42 . \n the impact parameter bias is @xmath43 cm , while fit impact parameter width is @xmath44 cm . \n the combined data from the sno detector and the external muon system have demonstrated that the sno muon reconstruction algorithm is accurate to the level needed by the neutrino - induced atmospheric flux analysis . \n the emus analysis places a constraint on the angular reconstruction to better than @xmath42 and on the impact parameter bias to better than @xmath43 cm . \n the latter constraint is in good agreement with other methods using cosmic - ray data in sno  @xcite . \n we believe the method employed here is a unique , low - cost way to explicitly verify the validity of muon track reconstruction for deep underground experiments . \n this research was supported by : canada : natural sciences and engineering research council , industry canada , national research council , northern ontario heritage fund , atomic energy of canada , ltd . \n , ontario power generation , high performance computing virtual laboratory , canada foundation for innovation ; us : dept . of energy , national energy research scientific computing center \n ; uk : science and technology facilities council ; portugal : fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia . \n we would like to thank the university of indiana , los alamos national laboratory , and k. eitel for loan of equipment to make the measurement possible . \n we would also like to thank the sno technical staff for their strong contributions and vale ( formerly inco ) for hosting this project . \n 99 b. aharmim _ \n et al . _ , \n d 80 ( 2009 ) 012001 \n . y. ashie _ \n et al . _ , \n phys . rev . \n d 71 ( 2005 ) 112005 . \n p. adamson _ \n et al . _ , \n d 77 ( 2008 ) 072002 . b. a. moffat _ et al . _ , nucl . \n instrum . meth . a 554 ( 2005 ) 255 . \n g.  doucas _ et al . \n instrum . methods a 370:579 ( 1996 ) . \n j.  boger _ \n et al . _ , \n instrum . meth . a 449 ( 2000 ) 172 . \n m. r. dragowsky _ et al . \n . instrum . meth . a 481 ( 2002 ) 284 . \n et al . _ , \n 87 ( 2001 ) 071301 . \n et al . _ , \n ( 2002 ) 011301 . \n et al . _ , \n ( 2002 ) 011302 . \n b. aharmim _ \n et al . _ , \n c 75 ( 2007 ) 045502 . \n s.n . ahmed _ \n 92 ( 2004 ) 181301 . \n b. aharmim _ \n et al . _ , \n c 72 ( 2005 ) 055502 . \n b. aharmim _ \n et al . _ , \n ( 2008 ) 11130 . \n et al . _ , ieee trans . \n sci . 51 ( 2004 ) 878 . w. h. press , s. a. teukolsky , w. t. vetterling , and b. p. flannery , numerical recipes in fortran , cambridge university press , 2nd ed ( 1992 ) . \n h.  gemmeke _ et al . \n .  instrum . \n meth .   a 289 , 490 ( 1990 ) . \n a. peisert and f. sauli , cern-84 - 08 ( 1984 ) . \n r. veenhof ,  garfield \" , cern program library ( 1998 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3023228881845, "RequestID": "bcd1b019c80e4b5799e540cbb4b57155", "TotalTokens": 3944}

mass bds in the pleiades and to provide accurate first - epoch data for future proper motion determination . \n this paper is an extension of the @xmath8 survey described in festin @xcite . \n for a teide1-type object , the flux rises from 10 to almost 100% of its peak value between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . \n therefore , although providing a rather short wavelength baseline , @xmath11 was chosen as the primary temperature indicator . \n its efficiency is proved by the large gap between the pleiades sequence and the background stars in the @xmath9 vs @xmath11 diagram . \n most observational effort was spent on obtaining high - quality images in @xmath9 ( fig . \n [ figseeing ] ) to get good first - epoch coordinates and to clean out galaxies . to minimize the effects of nonuniform pixels and rotation angle , each @xmath9 field \n was observed at four different field angles ( 0 , 90 , 180 and 270 degrees ) . \n complementary photometry was taken in @xmath12 . \n +    all observations were carried out at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , la palma . \n the survey covers 648 arcmin@xmath0 in @xmath13 ( of which 240 arcmin@xmath0 were also covered in @xmath14 ) + 200 arcmin@xmath0 in @xmath15 only . \n the total area is 848 arcmin@xmath0 near the centre of the pleiades ( fig . \n [ figfield ] ) . \n a summary of the observations is given in table  [ tabobsoverview ] . \n .observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ figimf ] suggests a rising mf towards lower masses with a power - law index between 0 and 1 , but there are several uncertainties one should be aware of . \n the observed number of objects is small , but it remains clear that the lf drops from @xmath16 to the survey limit . \n we can not say how many pleiades bds that are lost in unresolved binaries . \n however , we estimate a likely upper limit by assuming that the 30% multiple fraction for m dwarfs @xcite applies to all our single pleiades candidates which are brighter than the bd limit at @xmath17 . if those companions all are below the bd limit , 8 bds would have been lost . of course \n , we do not know their possible distribution , but adding 8 bds to the lf still leaves it close to the @xmath18 curve . from this crude discussion it follows that lost companions are unlikely to raise the mf index significantly above 1 . \n there is also a normalization error , which does not affect the falling trend , however . \n the model in baraffe et al . \n @xcite is state - of - the - art and based on the latest generation of non - grey atmospheres and should provide the best possible mass - luminosity relations for the pleiades bd sequence . \n since it has not yet been possible to derive an empirical mass - luminosity relation for substellar objects , we do not try to estimate the uncertainties in mass that may arise from the model . \n we have performed a deep 850 arcmin@xmath0 @xmath1 survey in the central area of the pleiades cluster . \n photometry in @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath14 is presented for 32 previously known and 7 new likely members . \n four of those are below the bd limit , and the faintest one would be the lowest mass bd found in the pleiades so far , if its membership could be confirmed . \n the overall agreement in the photometry with other surveys is satisfactory . \n teide1 is an exception . \n we find @xmath19 , @xmath200.5 mag fainter than zrm . based on rgo archive data and a roughly constant @xmath10 magnitude \n we conclude that the reason for this discrepancy most likely sits in the photometry of zrm and not in intrinsic variability .      after splitting ppl15 and two other probable binaries into components , \n the pleiades lf was compared to model lfs derived from the most recent theoretical mass - luminosity relations . \n the observed lf supports an mf - index between 0 and 1 . \n thus , even if the mf seems to rise for low - mass bds in the pleiades , it is not steep enough to leave more than a few percent of the cluster s mass in bds , which is consistent with dynamical findings @xcite . \n i would like to thank the not opc for allocating time for this project which is an essential part in my coming thesis . \n thanks also to n.c . \n hambly who provided proper motions for some of my candidates and to i. baraffe who provided the model on ascii format . \n this work was supported by the nordic optical telescpe scientific association and the swedish natural science research council ( nfr ) . \n this research has made use of the rgo la palma archive . \n f. , hauschildt p. , 1997 \n , model atmospheres : brown dwarfs from the stellar perspective . in : r. rebolo , e. martin , m.  r. zapatero osorio ( eds . ) , brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets : asp conf . \n , in press                                                    g. , 1997 , searching for new brown dwarf candidates in a pleiades ijk imaging survey in : r. rebolo , e. martin , m.  r. zapatero osorio ( eds . ) , brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets : asp conf .", "StartTimeOffset": 3038694918214, "RequestID": "fd34c6eb49024351b192e6c5a95d93c7", "TotalTokens": 1854}

{"ContextTokens": 3964, "GeneratedTokens": 308, "SynthesizedBody": "broad - line radio galaxies are the radio - loud kin of seyfert 1 galaxies , and as such they offer the possibility of investigating why some agn show strong radio jets . understanding the origin of the radio - loudness is important , since the mechanical energy deposited through agn jet activity is thought to be a primary way that the agn can impact its host galaxy evolution @xcite . \n recent studies show that the cool gas necessary to re - trigger the agn activity needed to power the radio - loudness in radio galaxies , which are pre - dominatently hosted by ellipticals , is provided by galaxy interactions such as mergers @xcite . \n however , this still does not address the issue that , while some agn do launch powerful jets , many do not . \n it is possible that the magnetic field build - up and black hole spin are decisive factors for this @xcite . \n x - ray observations can provide both the determination of the black hole spin , as well as the detection of any changes in the inner accretion disk as one might expect them from significant changes to the magnetic flux strength . \n previous works in the x - ray band have indicated that a typical radio galaxy x - ray spectrum possesses a relatively flat photon index , weak cold reflection signatures , and in some cases a weak relativistic reflection component ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the distinctly flatter photon index raises questions as to whether the entire comptonization spectrum is different in this source class , implying differences in the balance of cooling and heating of the corona . \n the recent launch of the _ nustar _ \n observatory @xcite provides the opportunity to study the broadband spectra of agn with unprecedented sensitivity , allowing us to start directly addressing this issue in sources . to yield the best results the target s x \n - ray spectrum should possess a continuum dominated by comptonization , requiring only weak or no jet contribution . \n a recent study of a suitable source , the radio galaxy 3c382 , with _ nustar _ confirms the previous results of weak reflection and a flat photon index . \n additionally they show for the first time that the high - energy cut - off of the comptonization spectrum is time - variable in radio galaxies and possibly flux - dependent @xcite . \n this paper builds on this discovery and the need for a better understanding of comptonization spectrum in broad - line radio galaxies , focusing on the coronal parameters of the radio galaxy , 3c390.3 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , using a joint soft x - ray ( _ suzaku _ ) and hard x - ray ( _ nustar _ ) observation \n .    previous work in the x - ray band on 3c390.3 has found its timing properties not to differ from those of radio - quiet seyferts @xcite and there to be no noticeable contribution from jet to the x - ray emission @xcite . \n @xcite performed a detailed broad - band spectral analysis including _ xmm _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ swift_-bat data , determining that two different spectral models can describe the x - ray spectra well . \n the first model includes a continuum modeled by a cut - off power law ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , cold reflection ( @xmath9 ) and a narrow gaussian line to model the fexxv line detected in the data . \n the second model is similar to the first model but models the fexxv line with a highly ionized , blurred reflector ( @xmath10 ) . \n it has been shown by @xcite that the modeling of fexxv and ionized reflection can be ambiguous in broad - line radio galaxies . \n the paper is organized in the following way : we begin by providing an overview of how the data were reduced in  [ datared ] . \n this is followed by a description of the x - ray spectral modeling (  [ spec_modeling ] ) , and a brief study dedicated to the iron k band (  [ fe_modeling ] ) . \n the x - ray analysis is then supplemented by a study of spectral energy distribution of this agn (  [ sed_modeling ] ) and conclude with a discussion of our results (  [ disc ] ) . \n an overview of the observations considered in this work is given in table  [ nu_obs ] . \n .overview of observations and their characteristics . \n the exposures are the net exposures used during the x - ray broad - band spectral modeling given per xis in the case of _ suzaku _ and per fpm for _ nustar_. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also tested an alternative scenario similar to the one suggested by @xcite , where the accretion disk is covered by a warm layer producing a low temperature , optically - thick comptonization component that extends from the optical / uv into the soft x - ray band . \n this component is assumed to replace the standard accretion disk component . \n however , we find that such a component is unable to produce enough optical / uv flux without producing significantly more soft x - ray flux than observed . \n with a 2 - 10kev flux of @xmath11 the source was observed to be brighter in this observation than in any other previous high quality ccd data and slightly above the average flux of all previous _ rxte _ observations @xcite . from the 2 - 10kev flux \n , we estimate an eddington fraction of 1% using a bolometric correction of 6.33 as determined by @xcite . \n the results from the x - ray spectral analysis in this work are in good agreement with those of the previous broad - band analysis by @xcite . \n contrary to the softer - when - brighter trend seen in many seyferts , the photon index of the power law in this observation is similar to that of the previous high quality ccd observations at lower flux ( @xmath12 versus 1.72 ) , suggesting a rather stable shape for the primary continuum . \n the neutral reflection fraction on the other hand is found to be much smaller in this observation ( @xmath13 versus 0.81 ) and much more in the realm that is typically expected for broad - line radio galaxies . \n this could however be due to the inclusion of the bat data , which is non - simultaneaous in the @xcite analysis . \n attributing the discrepancy to such a technical problem seems reasonable given that the average pca+hxte spectra indicate reflection fraction of @xmath14 @xcite . in our observation \n we do not find evidence for any broadening in the iron k@xmath15 line (  [ fe_modeling ] ) , however we do find a weak soft excess that can be well described by a blurred ionized reflector . attempting to model the soft x - ray excess with an additional power law , which could physically represent either a low energy comptonization component @xcite or a jet component , leads to a worse fit than the reflection scenario . \n ( this is also confirmed by the sed fitting in  [ sed_modeling ] . ) \n therefore we conclude similar to @xcite and @xcite that an ionized reflector is present in the x - ray spectrum of this agn . \n the fact that it is not very apparent in this observation can be explained by a variable ionized reflector . \n a variable ionized reflector is predicted along with the formation of the new jet knots @xcite and would therefore not be surprising . \n the exact strength and shape of the ionized reflection component in 3c390.3 depends on the comptonization model , as we will see below . \n the overall exceptionally low reflection fraction observed in broad - line radio galaxies can be explained by an outflowing corona @xcite . \n if the corona is outflowing at mildly relativistic speeds , the emission is beamed away from the accretion disk lowering the amount of reflection . \n overall , we find that the x - ray spectrum of 3c390.3 can be well described by a model consisting of a primary continuum , cold and ionized reflection , and photoionized emission . for the primary continuum we consider three possibilities : a cut - off power law as a purely phenomenological model and the two thermal comptonization models ` comptt ` and ` eqpair ` . \n all continua yield fits of comparable quality and the total spectral models consequently appear almost identical in the observable 0.7 - 80kev band ( fig . \n [ models_comparison ] ) . \n however , the contribution of the different model components differs for the two comptonization models . in figure  [ models_comparison ] \n the dashed lines show the primary continuum for both cases , indicating that for the ` comptt ` case the primary continuum accounts for most of the flux at lower energies , while for ` eqpair ` this is not the case . \n the remaining , required soft x - ray flux in the ` eqpair ` case is made by neutral and ionized reflection , as the increase in the reflection fraction shows with @xmath16=0.09 to @xmath17=0.30 and @xmath18=0.07 to @xmath19=0.23 . at first glance \n one might therefore be tempted to reject the ` eqpair ` solution . \n the view changes , however , as one extends the models to energies above 80kev , where the models diverge . \n no x - ray data exists for those energies that are simultaneous with the _ suzaku_/_nustar _ \n observation , but we can use the average 70month _ swift_-bat spectrum as guidance on how the x - ray spectrum might look like at higher energies . \n the spectrum , which is overlayed on the best fit model in figure  [ models_comparison ] , agrees well with all best fit models below 40kev , above this energy it is systematically brighter . \n it is important to note here that it is inherent to comptonization models that they roll over more rapidly than the phenomenological exponential cut - off included in ` pexmon ` @xcite . comparing the two comptonization models \n , it seems that the ` eqpair ` solution produces fluxes better in agreement with bat spectrum . \n the high energy cut - off of our thermal comptonization spectrum of 117@xmath20kev is in very good agreement with a joint ibis / bat spectral analysis suggesting a cut - off temperature of @xmath21kev @xcite and the result from the joint epic - pn / xis / pin / bat fit by @xcite returning @xmath22kev . \n this would suggest that the coronal temperature was constant , however the large errorbars can not exclude a change . possibly , fig . \n [ models_comparison ] could be seen as weak evidence that at brighter fluxes the cut - off is lower . \n such a trend could be caused by increased coronal cooling from stronger uv emission ( more seed photons ) . \n indeed , when comparing the uvot fluxes to the om fluxes we find that the source was brighter in the new uvot observation ( the agn flux doubled in the u - band ) . \n it is likely that given the large errorbars a small change in the coronal temperature / high energy cut - off would be undetectable . \n the coronal temperature found for 3c390.3 is rather cool ( @xmath3kev ) , similar to what has been found in ic 4329a @xcite , swift j2127.4 + 5654 @xcite and mcg-05 - 23 - 016 @xcite . \n in contrast to these coronae with temperatures of @xmath23 , _ nustar _ has also found several sources with coronal temperatures above 150kev such as 3c382 @xcite and ark120 @xcite . \n the number of measurements is still too small to suggest a reason for the wide spread of the measured temperatures . \n one possibility could be that the coronal temperature is linked to the radiative compactness of the corona . while we have already noted that the hard over soft compactness measures the ratio of heating and cooling , the compactness by itself tells us about the importance of photon - photon interactions @xcite . \n if @xmath24 is much greater than 1 ( as is the case here ) these become important . \n if sufficient high - energy photons are produced via compton upscattering these will start to create electron / positron pairs until at some point there will be so many pairs formed that the temperature of the corona is decreased significantly . therefore there is a maximum temperature a corona can reach at any given compactness . \n below this temperature the corona would still be able to heat up further , but above it pair production will cool it down again . \n accurate predictions of this equilibrium temperature are difficult as it depends on the unknown geometrical layout of the disk corona system . \n however , @xcite show that the coronal temperature measurements with _ nustar _ do indeed show a dependency with the coronal compactness that is similar to that expected for a slab corona . \n the measurement of 3c390.3 , which is also included in @xcite , agrees well with the other measurements and supports the idea of an equilibrium temperature .    aside from the coronal temperature \n the other key parameter returned by the comptonization models is the optical depth of the corona . from our measurements we find it to be large ( @xmath25 ) , meaning that all soft photons entering the corona will be scattered multiple times . \n depending on the geometry of the corona this could lead to an apparent truncation of the accretion disk as the photons can not escape unscattered . \n this apparent truncation could be detected in the reflection spectrum and the accretion disk spectrum . \n unfortunately the _ \n swift_-uvot photometry does not allow a measurement of the accretion disk temperature for the unscattered component , which could indentify a blocked central region . \n however , our measurements of high spin and very high emissivity from the reflection spectrum , if taken at face value , suggest that we are seeing very close to the black hole . \n in fact the vast majority of the reflection would stem from a small ring around the black hole . \n the easiest way to bring this into agreement with the high optical depth of the corona would be a very compact corona ( see also below ) . \n we caution however that the extreme reflection parameters could also indicate that we have reached the limits of the current spectral models . \n curious is also the disagreement between uv predicted by the x - ray spectral and measured uv emission by about a factor of @xmath26 . \n a similar phenomenon has been found for 3c382 with also a factor of about 10 @xcite . \n this mismatch of predicted and measured uv / optical emission can be explained by the spatial compactness of the corona , which causes only a small fraction of the total disk emission to enter the corona and be comptonized . \n there is much observational evidence for the corona being of small spatial extent , for example microlensing ( e.g. , * ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , broad iron lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , and time lags ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the sed presented in figure  [ sed ] also reveals that a naive modeling of the sed as is performed in this work predicts detectable accretion disk flux in the very soft x - ray band . \n this small flux contribution from the accretion disk is inconsistent with the weak soft excess observed in the x - ray spectrum of 3c390.3 . with the continuum being describable by only thermal comptonization , no contribution from the jet to the x - ray spectrum \n can be found in 3c390.3 . \n this is another matter concerning radio galaxy x - ray spectra , which is generally still open to debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n our finding is in good agreement with the fermi non - detection of 3c390.3 suggesting that the jet emission is only very weak in the hard x - ray band @xcite . \n we thank the anonymous referee for their helpful comments . \n al thanks julien malzac for helpful discussions and acknowledges support from the erc advanced grant feedback . \n ft would like to thank m. coleman miller and brian morsony for the useful comments . \n m.b . acknowledges support from nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space science fellowship program , grant nnx14aq07h . \n this work made use of data from the _ nustar _ mission , a project led by the california institute of technology , managed by the jet propulsion laboratory , and funded by the national aeronautics and space administration . \n this research has made use of the _ nustar _ data analysis software ( nustardas ) jointly developed by the asi science data center ( asdc , italy ) and the california institute of technology ( usa ) . \n this research has made use of data obtained from the _ suzaku _ satellite , a collaborative mission between the space agencies of japan ( jaxa ) and the usa ( nasa ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3070724730096, "RequestID": "2d4c42fe4b6a4f63ba1b2b088ec600d8", "TotalTokens": 4272}

structures appear old and similar over moderate look back times ( peebles 1999 ) . \n galaxy clusters are the most massive virialised objects in the universe and are the latest systems to form , therefore they may reveal evidence for recent evolution . indeed , perhaps the strongest indication for evolution can be found by examining galaxy morphologies in rich clusters over the past 5 gyrs ( _ i.e. _ references within : sandage 1970 butcher & oemler 1978 , dressler 1980 , dressler & gunn 1983 , couch 1987 , binggeli 1988 , ferguson & sandage 1991 , binggeli 1991 , thompson & gregory 1993 , peterson & caldwell 1993 , lavery & henry 1994 , barger 1996 , dressler 1997 , balogh 1998 , couch 1998 , poggianti 1999 , bower 1999 ) . at @xmath0 we see that clusters of galaxies contain predominantly late type disk galaxies that have undergone a transformation into dwarf ellipticals ( dsph ) by the present day . there is also compelling evidence that the fraction of s0 galaxies decreases over the same look back time ( dressler 1997 ) , whilst at even earlier epochs , tentative evidence for the hierarchical growth of the cluster elliptical galaxies may be found ( van dokkum 1999 ) . \n the data suggest that the cluster environment is causing a morphological transformation between galaxy types . \n other indicators of environmental influences in clusters include the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) , signatures of star - bursts followed by a rapid truncation of star - formation in cluster spirals and k+a / a+k galaxies ( poggianti 1999 ) , the absence of low surface brightness disks in clusters ( bothun 1993 ) and the presence of a large component of diffuse star - light ( bernstein 1993 , freeman - this volume ) . in this paper \n we will discuss the role of environment and the proposed mechanisms that are responsible for driving galactic evolution in clusters and creating the `` morphological and spectroscopic butcher - oemler effects '' . \n several mechanisms have been proposed that can induce a morphological transformation between galaxy classes . \n toomre & toomre s ( 1972 ) pioneering n - body simulations of merging spirals gave rise to elliptical remnants . \n this process is most effective when the encounter velocity is comparable to the galaxies internal velocity , therefore mergers should be rare within rich virialised systems , a fact pointed out by many authors ( _ e.g. _ mamon - this volume ) , however see van dokkum ( 1999 ) . \n numerical simulations of clusters that formed naturally in a hierarchical universe show that mergers are indeed rare ( ghigna 1998 ) . \n galactic winds from supernovae are frequently cited as important mechanisms for dwarf galaxy evolution ( dekel & silk 1986 ) yet observational evidence for this process is not compelling ( martin 1998 ) and it is unlikely that feedback can reshape the stellar configuration . \n we therefore focus on the two mechanisms that are most likely to operate extensively in the cluster environment ( _ c.f . _ \n fujita 1999 ) . \n impulsive heating via rapid tidal encounters has been demonstrated to be an efficient mechanism at heating disk galaxies in clusters  termed `` galaxy harassment '' by moore ( 1996 , 1998 ) , tidal forces and internal cluster dynamics have been studied by many authors , including richstone & malmuth 1983 , icke 1985 , merritt 1985 , byrd & valtonen 1990 , valluri & jog 1991 , valluri 1993 , gnedin ( 1999 ) . \n gunn & gott ( 1978 ) suggested that the ram - pressure force of the hot intra - cluster medium could remove the atomic hydrogen from disks infalling into clusters . \n nulsen ( 1982 ) proposed that the viscous and turbulent stripping of gas would be equally as effective . \n morphological transformation by gravitational encounters is a process that requires several strong or frequent tidal collisions and acts over a timescale of several @xmath1 years . \n in contrast , hydrodynamic effects operate on a much shorter timescale , @xmath2 years . \n observational evidence for gas - dynamical interactions in clusters is scarce due to the speed at which the process occurs ( stevens 1999 ) , however the literature does contain some examples ( _ i.e. _ warmels 1988 , cayatte 1990 , gavazzi 1995 , kenny & koopman 1999 , and several recent studies in this volume by vollmer ( 1999 ) , ryder ( 1997 ) & j. solanes ) . \n the first 3-dimensional calculation of ram pressure stripping using realistic disk galaxy models was carried out by abadi ( 1999 ) . \n earlier work had studied the properties of spherical systems in two dimensions ( _ i.e. _ balsara 1994 ) . \n abadi found that the simple analytic argument proposed by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) balancing the ram pressure , @xmath3 , with the disk s gravitational restoring force works very well . \n simulations at @xmath4 and edge on to the motion through the intra - cluster medium suffered slightly less stripping than face on . \n however , even in the best case scenario for stripping , an @xmath5 disk galaxy moving through the center of the coma cluster at 3000 km s@xmath6 , a significant fraction of gas remained ( hi extending to a radius @xmath7 kpc ) that would continue to form stars . \n = 5.0truein     the time evolution of the diffuse hi component within a spiral galaxy falling into the coma cluster ( quilis 1999 ) . \n a more realistic treatment of the stripping process using a eulerian finite difference code revealed that the turbulent and viscous stripping processes help to remove more gas than just the ram pressure alone ( quilis 1999 ) . \n quilis also realised that disks are not smooth homogeneous mediums , but have a complex structure containing many holes and regions that are completely devoid of gas ( brinks & bajaja 1986 ) . once these \n are included , the icm streams through the holes , preventing `` backside infall '' and ablates away the gas from their edges , rapidly removing the entire hi content of disks . \n thus , these authors find that the stripping process alone , is in general 100% efficient at removing the hi component within a timescale @xmath8 years ( see figure 1 ) .    without fresh material to replenish gmc s , star formation will be rapidly truncated ( elmgreen & efremov 1997 ) . continued \n heating by tidal encounters with massive galaxies increases the disk scale height by factors of 23 . \n spiral features will be suppressed and these galaxies will resemble the s0 galaxies observed in nearby clusters . the efficiency of the stripping process increases rapidly towards the cluster center where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are maximum , thus we have a natural way of creating the morphology - density relation . whether or not the transformation of sa / sb galaxies to s0 s can reproduce the same scaling as observed remains to be tested . \n galaxy harassment will transform di / sc / sd disks into dwarf elliptical ( dsph ) galaxies over a timescale of several billion years - _ i.e. _ several cluster orbital periods . simulations of this process appear to produce remnant galaxies that closely match the observed cluster dwarf s ( moore 1996 , 1998 ) , although the sample of kinematical data is small . \n a fundamental prediction of the formation of de ( dsph ) galaxies by tidal heating is that the remnant galaxies are embedded in diffuse streams of stars , tidally removed from the progenitor disks ( see figure 2 ) . \n the surface brightness profiles of these galaxies are expected to be well fitted by an exponential profile over their central regions but a significant excess of stars will be found at 45 scale lengths ( moore 1999 ) . \n the surface brightness of this excess will occur fainter than @xmath11 per arcsec@xmath12 , an observable effect with 4 m or 8 m class telescopes . \n the presence of freely orbiting planetary nebulae in clusters ( freeman , this meeting ) provides strong support for the efficiency of this process . \n not surprisingly , low surface brightness disks are not found within clusters ( bothun 1993 ) . \n the shear extent of their stellar distributions and low central potentials make them unstable to tidal forces . \n once these galaxies enter the cluster environment , most of there stars are tidally removed and a diffuse spheroidal remnant remains ( moore 1999 ) . \n numerical simulations of this process can be used to study the diffuse cluster light component . \n = 3.0truein     an example of tidal tails from the galaxy harassment process from the cluster cl0054 - 27 at z=0.56 courtesy of ian smail . \n the image is roughly 150 kpc on a side . \n features this prominent are rare at this surface brightness ( @xmath13 per arcsec@xmath12 ) but are expected to surround all cluster de ( dsph ) galaxies at lower surface brightness levels . \n two mechanisms are necessary to reproduce the observed morphological evolution of galaxies in clusters . at the faint end of the luminosity function , \n disk galaxies are easily transformed into de ( dsph ) galaxies by galaxy harassment . \n numerical simulations of this process predict that all dwarf galaxies in nearby clusters will be embedded within very diffuse streams of stripped stars . \n low surface brightness disks with slowly rising rotation curves and shallow central potentials will not survive the fluctuating potentials of rich clusters and will be tidally shredded to form the bulk of the diffuse intra - cluster light \n . spirals with bulges are more stable to gravitational encounters \n . they would retain their stars and gas and continue to form stars to the present day . \n most , if not all of the atomic hydrogen of these galaxies must be rapidly removed upon entering the cluster environment in order to explain their star - formation histories . \n fluid dynamic simulations of realistic disks moving through a hot icm demonstrates that a combination of ram - pressure and viscous stripping can remove 100% of the hi from the igm within @xmath14 years \n . continued tidal heating by encounters will complete a transformation to the s0 class .", "StartTimeOffset": 3093483146986, "RequestID": "88fe7ee1de874ab0b4fa342e86a3cc3e", "TotalTokens": 2675}

{"ContextTokens": 2484, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "a possible influence of solar variability on climate has been discussed for some time . \n although the direct solar influence on climate is apparent , variations of the solar irradiance are estimated to be an order of magnitude too small to explain the observed changes in climate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) . therefore , an indirect mechanism linking solar variability to climate should be involved . according to some modeling studies , \n a response in atmospheric circulation can amplify the terrestrial effect of solar irradiance changes @xcite . on the other hand \n , cosmic rays can noticeably affect the earth s climate @xcite . while the energy deposited by cosmic rays into the earth s atmosphere is negligible compared to that from solar irradiance , \n they are the main source of ionization in the troposphere ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? \n a possible qualitative link has been proposed that relates cosmic ray induced ionization ( crii ) in the troposphere and cloud properties @xcite . \n ions created by cosmic rays rapidly interact with molecules in the atmosphere and are converted to complex cluster ions ( aerosols ) @xcite . \n these cluster ions may grow by ion - ion recombination or ion - aerosol attachment and thus affect the number of aerosols acting as cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn ) at typical atmospheric supersaturations of a few percent @xcite . \n others have suggested that a crii - cloud link could also arise through changes in the global electric circuit affecting aerosol - cloud interactions at the edges of clouds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * or a review of possible mecahnisms in _ harrison and carslaw _ , 2003 ) . \n both mechanisms require that an amplified effect of cosmic rays on climate is realized through the important role that clouds play in the radiation budget of the atmosphere by both trapping outgoing long wave radiation and reflecting incoming solar radiation . \n although a detailed physical model quantifying this connection is still missing , correlation studies support its validity . \n @xcite found a highly significant correlation between low clouds below @xmath1 3.2 km ( rather than clouds at other altitudes ) and the cosmic ray flux during the period 19831994 . \n this basic result has subsequently been confirmed by other independent studies @xcite . \n there is also evidence for the reduction of cloud coverage during strong forbush decreases at time scales of a few days @xcite . \n this implies that the proposed cloud - cosmic ray relation may also be significant at short - time scales . \n more recently @xcite found that the low cloud - cosmic ray correlation can be extended until 2001 but only after the globally averaged cloud data are re - calibrated . \n however , the variability in low cloud amount ( lca ) can not be uniquely ascribed to a single mechanism when using globally averaged data since the observed long - term changes in the global lca correlate with different solar - related indices including solar irradiance and cosmic rays .    in this paper \n we study the spatial distribution of lca and crii over the period 19842000 . in all previous studies \n the count rate of a single neutron monitor was used as a measure of cosmic rays , and assumed to represent the global crii@xmath2 . \n although useful for qualitative correlation studies , this approach does not give quantitative estimates since the cosmic ray intensity varies strongly over the globe due to the shielding by the geomagnetic field . \n here we study the global distribution of crii and compare that with the measured lca distribution . \n following previous studies @xcite , we use the low cloud amount obtained from the isccp - d2 database limited to ir radiances . \n isccp provides monthly observations of the global cloud cover based on an intercalibration of up to 5 satellites for the period from july 1983 to september 2001 . \n satellites detect a cloud when radiance observations differ significantly from clear sky values . \n however , uncertainties can arise if atmospheric transparency is influenced by processes other than clouds , e.g. , aerosol loading from mt . \n pinatubo @xcite . \n we note that lca as defined from satellite observations is restricted to clouds with their tops below 640 hpa ( 3.2 km ) , which is different from ground - based observations . in the present analysis \n annual lca averages are used ( in order to avoid seasonal variations ) on a 5@xmath3x5@xmath3 latitude - longitude grid for the period 19842000 inclusive . \n recently , the global distribution of crii has been calculated for the troposphere ( 010 km ) since 1951 @xcite . \n first , the electromagnetic - nucleonic cascade initiated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere was simulated for different conditions using the corsika monte - carlo package @xcite . \n then the annually averaged ion production rate in the troposphere at a given latitude was calculated using the respective cosmic ray spectra parameterized by the average heliospheric modulation strength @xcite . \n finally , the equilibrium ion concentration was calculated at a given location , taking into account processes of recombination and aerosol attachment . \n here we use crii values calculated at 3 km altitude which corresponds roughly to the limiting altitude , as defined by isccp - d2 , below which low cloud forms . \n .correlation coefficients ( and their significance levels in parentheses ) between lca and crii for the period of 19842000 for different regions : global ( @xmath4 ) , tropics ( @xmath5 ) , and mid - latitudes ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the latitudinal zones with highly significant c.c.s ( see fig . \n [ fig:2_zonal ] ) we try to quantify the relation between detrended lca and crii ( fig . \n [ fig:5_detrended ] ) . for want of a physical model relating lca to crii , a quantitative phenomenological relation is assumed in the form of a direct proportionality between normalized variations of lca , @xmath8 , and crii , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the zonal mean crii value during 19842000 . \n the scatter plot of @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 is shown in fig . \n [ fig:6_scatter]a . despite the wide scatter of points , \n there is a highly significant correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( c.c.=0.6 , s.l.@xmath1398% ) , with the corresponding linear relation as follows : @xmath14 the fact that the proportionality coefficient is close to unity implies that inter - annual variations of lca around the long - term trend can be directly ascribed to the variations of crii . \n moreover , the amplitude of cyclic relative variations in @xmath11 and @xmath12 shows a similar latitudinal dependence ( fig . \n [ fig:6_scatter]b ) . \n these results strongly favor the idea that the variations of lca are related to crii rather than other mechanisms , e.g. , solar irradiance , which can not naturally explain such a latitudinal dependence . \n while in earlier studies data from a single neutron monitor was used as a proxy of cosmic ray intensity , we have explored the quantitative relationship between temporal and spatial variations of lca and crii over the globe for the period 19842000 . \n we suggest that the lca time series can be decomposed into a long - term slow trend and inter - annual variations , the latter depicting a clear 11-year cycle in phase with crii . \n the trend whose nature is beyond the scope of the present study , is strong in tropical regions and possibly masks the lca - crii relation . \n we then find a highly significant correlation between the detrended inter - annual lca variations and crii over the globe ( polar regions being excluded ) . \n a quantitative regression model was obtained ( eq .  [ eq : lin2 ] ) , which implies a one - to - one relation between the relative variations of lca and crii over the latitude range 2055@xmath0s and 1070@xmath0n . the amplitude of relative variations in lca was found to increase polewards , in accordance with the amplitude of crii variations but in contrast to the insolation which decreases polewards . \n these results thus support the idea that lca is modulated by crii , rather than by solar irradiance , at inter - annual timescales between 1984 - 2000 . \n we thank henrik svensmark for useful discussions . \n the financial support by the academy of finland is acknowledged . \n ogg and gak were partly supported by the program `` non - stationary processes in astronomy '' . \n the cloud data are obtained from isccp d2 web - site ( http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/products/browsed2.html ) . \n gringel w. , j.a . \n rosen , and d.j . \n hofmann , electrical structure from 0 to 30 kilometers , in studies in geophysics : the earth s electrical environment , p166 - 182 , natl . \n acad . press , \n washington d.c . , \n 1986 . \n hoppel , w.a . \n andersen , and j.c . \n willet , atmospheric electricity in the planetary boundary layer , in studies in geophysics : the earth s electrical environment , p159 - 165 , natl . \n acad . press , washington d.c . , 1986 . \n marsh n. , and h. svensmark , galactic cosmic ray and el nio - southern oscillation trends in international satellite cloud climatology project d2 low - cloud properties , _ j. geophys . \n _ , * 108*(d6 ) , aac 6 - 1 , doi:10.1029/2001jd001264 , 2003b .            tinsley , b.a . , influence of solar wind on the global electric circuit , and inferred effects on cloud microphysics , temperature , and dynamics in the troposphere , _ space sci . \n _ , * 94*(1 - 2 ) , 231 - 258 , 2000 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3128169455878, "RequestID": "d43e7e27e8af4012a7fa8d73cc261a6c", "TotalTokens": 2713}

called analysing plane . \n the barrier potential is generated by a 54 cm long cylindrical electrode , held at a voltage @xmath16 . in the analysing plane \n the magnetic field is about 5 times lower than in the decay volume . \n protons travel from the decay volume to the analysing plane , gyrating about a magnetic field line . as a result of the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment , \n part of the proton s momentum transverse to the field line is transferred into parallel momentum . in the adiabatic approximation , \n the probability that a proton overcomes the potential barrier can be analytically calculated as a piecewise function : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kinetic energy and @xmath19 the charge of the proton . \n this transmission function @xmath20 depends only on @xmath16 and the ratio of the magnetic fields in the analysing plane and the decay volume , @xmath21 . \n further details of the spectrometer design and systematic effects may be found in @xcite .    after the electrostatic barrier the magnetic field increases to focus particles that overcome the barrier onto a silicon drift detector ( sdd ) @xcite . \n the detector is held at a high negative potential to post - accelerate the protons to detectable energies , and to ensure that the protons overcome the magnetic mirror created by the increasing field . \n a sdd is a semiconductor detector based on the principle of sidewards depletion @xcite , which allows the depletion of a large detector volume with a small readout node . in the spectrometer \n , one chip with 3 detector pads ( @xmath22@xmath23 each ) is used . \n the first amplifying transistor as well as a diode for temperature measurement are implemented on the chip . \n the detector signal is amplified and digitised by a continuously sampling 12 bit analogue to digital converter with a 20mhz clock . \n the data is then analysed on -

acceleration voltages from @xmath25 to @xmath26kv were used . some pulse - height spectra with different acceleration voltages \n are shown in fig.[spectra ] . \n protons hit the detector with slightly different incident angles and energies due to the distribution of initial angles and energies , thus an angle or energy dependence in the detection probability leads to a systematic effect . \n although first simulations show that this effect is rather small , it will be investigated experimentally at a proton source dedicated for detector tests @xcite . \n @xmath0spect was set up at the cold neutron beam line pf1b @xcite at the institut laue - langevin . \n the neutron beam was shaped by apertures made from sintered boron carbide in the beam tube before the spectrometer ( pressure @xmath27 mbar ) and apertures from isotopically enriched @xmath28lif inside the spectrometer ( @xmath29 mbar ) . \n the vacua were separated by 250@xmath30 m thick mgal3zn1 windows . \n a fast neutron shutter in front of the beam tube permitted to open and close the neutron beam during data taking . behind the spectrometer , a beam stop from boron carbide with an integrated neutron flux monitor was installed . \n the thermal neutron flux at the exit window of the spectrometer was @xmath31 . outside the spectrometer \n the beam was shielded by several layers of @xmath32b loaded rubber and 10 cm of lead . \n all information in this section is preliminary . \n the proton spectrum was determined by setting the analysing plane electrode to 7 different voltages @xmath16 . \n 50v is used for the normalisation of the count rates , 400v approximately provides the best statistical sensitivity towards @xmath0 @xcite . \n the background was quantified by measurements with 780v . \n most of the background is caused by beam - related electrons from neutron decay which are also guided towards the detector . at 780v \n no proton can overcome the barrier , whereas the background is only marginally influenced . \n the pure proton count rate is obtained by subtracting the background from the measurements with lower voltages . to learn about systematic effects and to gain a more precise knowledge of the shape of the spectrum 0v , 50v , 250v , 400v , 500v , 600v , and 780v were measured . \n typically , about 470 events per second with pulse - heights in the integration window from 160 to 900 adc channels ( fig.[spectra ] ) at 50v analysing plane voltage were counted on one detector pad . at @xmath33v \n the count rate in the same window was about 7 counts per second . \n this means , approximately 460 protons per second were detected . with closed neutron shutter \n the count rate dropped to 0.2 counts per second in the integration window .    in our previous beam time , the background count rate without neutron beam at @xmath33v was higher than at @xmath34v by several hz @xcite . \n for this beam time , changes were made to the detector high voltage and the rest of the electrodes system to suppress the dependence of the background count rate on the analysing plane voltage . \n so far , such a dependence was not clearly identified in the present beam time . \n for example , for a run of 16 hours , the background count rate measured during the periods with closed neutron shutter was @xmath35hz for @xmath34v and @xmath36hz for @xmath33v . \n the absolute height of the potential barrier has to be known precisely to determine the transmission function , eq.([eq : transmissionfunction ] ) . \n the voltage applied to the electrode is monitored by a precise multimeter . \n the accuracy of the voltage settings was better than 5mv , limited by the multimeter s calibration . \n stability and reproducibility of the voltage were much better . \n however , the electrostatic potential inside the electrode is affected by the work function of the electrode surface . in a cylindrical sample electrode at room temperature , \n a variation of up to 100mv was found . to investigate this effect , further measurements with a kelvin probe are ongoing .    protons and positive ions with too low energy to overcome the potential barrier \n are trapped between the electrostatic mirror and the analysing plane . \n they are removed by an @xmath37 electrode between the decay volume and the analysing plane ( see fig.[sketch ] ) . \n this electrode consists of two half cylinders set to different voltages @xmath38 and @xmath39 . \n trapped particles oscillate between the mirror and the analysing plane . every time they pass the electrical field produced by the @xmath37 electrode they drift into the same direction , perpendicular to both @xmath40 and @xmath41 . \n in addition , electrons and negative ions may be trapped in the region of the analysing plane electrode . \n these trapping effects were investigated with two methods :    1 .   for each analysing plane voltage @xmath16 , \n the measurement started with closed neutron shutter during a time @xmath42 , then the shutter was opened for @xmath43 , and closed again for @xmath44 . \n this mode allowed us to investigate the environmental , not beam - related background and possible differences in the background count rate before and after the shutter was opened \n . a higher count rate in the last part would point to either trapped particles inside the spectrometer or activation of some material . typically , the total measurement time with closed shutter was about half as long as the time with open shutter ( @xmath45 ) . \n the analysing plane was set to 780v so that no protons should be able to overcome the barrier and the @xmath37 drift potential was reduced from the standard setting of @xmath46 = @xmath47v@xmath48v on the two half cylinders of the electrode in several steps down to @xmath49v@xmath50v . \n a comparison of two measurements with @xmath49v@xmath50v and @xmath51v@xmath50v is shown in fig.[exb ] . \n for the lowest drift voltage of @xmath52v there are only some counts before the shutter is opened , this is the environmental background . \n as soon as the shutter is opened , protons are trapped and the count rate starts to fluctuate . even after the shutter is closed again , there are still particles that reach the detector . \n already a potential of @xmath25v@xmath50v reduces this behaviour strongly , and with @xmath51v@xmath50v the count rate is stable as long as the shutter is open and drops back to the environmental background count rate immediately after the shutter is closed again . \n the knowledge of the magnetic field in both decay volume and analysing plane is important for the calculation of the transmission function , eq.([eq : transmissionfunction ] ) . to determine the magnetic field ratio @xmath53 \n , the magnetic field has been measured in the spectrometer installed at the beam position , before and after the beam time . \n there was no significant change in the ratio or the absolute values of the fields . \n to check the response of the spectrometer , the ratio was changed by about @xmath54 by additional , external coils . \n these coils do not change the homogeneity or the shape of the magnetic field in both analysing plane and decay volume . as expected , the count rates for the different measured voltages @xmath16 changed due to the altered transmission function , but the value for @xmath0 is , within statistical errors , still the same if we use the adapted ratio of the magnetic fields @xmath53 in eq.([eq : transmissionfunction ] ) .    to monitor the ratio @xmath53 , \n it is planned to install a nuclear magnetic resonance system with polarised @xmath55he . \n the nmr frequency will be measured in two cells close to decay volume and analysing plane , respectively . \n the ratio of those frequencies is proportional to @xmath53 . \n the superconducting magnet coils show some hysteresis which might alter the field values if the magnet is set to a different strength . \n measurements showed that despite the hysteresis magnetic field settings can be reproduced if for each change in the coil setting the same procedure is used , which starts with warming up the coils above their critical temperature . \n then they are cooled down again and finally ramped directly to the desired current . \n another systematic effect we investigated is the so - called edge effect . \n the neutron beam profile in the decay volume is projected onto the detector by the magnetic field . \n close to the edge of the detector , two cases may occur : on the one hand , protons produced outside the directly projected volume can hit the detector , since they gyrate about a magnetic field line . \n this increases the detected count rate . on the other hand , protons produced within the projected area might miss the detector , resulting in a loss of detected count rate . as the gyration radius of a proton depends on its momentum , the proton count rate gain and loss is momentum dependent . \n as long as the beam profile is perfectly flat and the detection efficiency of the proton detector is uniform the two effects cancel . \n but if the profile is non - flat the probabilities for the two cases become different . \n this leads to an energy - dependent systematic effect . \n the effect can be calculated using monte carlo simulations . \n still , the neutron apertures were simulated and designed to obtain a beam profile as flat as possible to minimise the effect . to verify our calculations of the edge effect \n , data was taken for different beam profiles . \n these profiles were generated with an additional aperture in front of the spectrometer . \n each profile was measured by copper foil activations in front of and behind the spectrometer . \n in the recent beam time we showed that our spectrometer is capable of measuring the proton recoil spectrum with high precision . compared to a previous beam time , the major improvements were the new proton detector , the redesign of several electrodes , and a better vacuum . from the investigated systematic effects and the collected statistics , we expect a total relative error well below 5% .    with the knowledge of the systematic effects gained in this beam time we should be able to improve @xmath0spect to permit a measurement of @xmath0 with its design accuracy , which is 0.3% in a further beam time . \n + we thank jim byrne and gerd petzoldt for their contributions in the earlier stages of the experiment , and d. dubbers and b. mrkisch for the @xmath28lif apertures . \n we also gratefully acknowledge pnsensor gmbh and the mpi halbleiterlabor for supporting this experiment with their excellent sdds .", "StartTimeOffset": 3133868535348, "RequestID": "0698c63aca92494fa35be0bfd1ce78b5", "TotalTokens": 3895}

ray bursts in several neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries . \n these oscillations are remarkably coherent and their frequencies are very stable from burst to burst in a given source @xcite . \n these oscillations are therefore thought to be at the stellar spin frequency or its first overtone . \n this suggests that the oscillations are caused by rotational modulation of a hot spot produced by non - uniform nuclear burning and propagation . \n analysis of these oscillations can therefore constrain the mass and radius of the star and yield valuable information about the speed and type of thermonuclear propagation . in turn , this has implications for strong gravity and dense matter , and for astrophysical thermonuclear propagation in other contexts , such as classical novae and type ia supernovae .    a comparison of theoretical waveforms with the observations \n is required to extract this fundamental information . here \n we exhibit waveform calculations that we have produced using general relativistic ray - tracing codes . \n we survey the effects of parameters such as the spot size , the stellar compactness , and the stellar rotational velocity , and demonstrate that our computations fit well the phase lag data from sax  j18083658 . \n to compute observed light curves , we do general relativistic ray tracing from points on the surface to the observer at infinity in a way similar to , but more general than , @xcite and @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the exterior spacetime is schwarzschild , that the surface is dark except for the hot spot or spots , and that there is no background emission \n . the amplitudes would be reduced by a constant factor if there were background emission . \n the angular dependence of the specific intensity at the surface depends on both radiation transfer effects and doppler boosting ( see @xcite ) . for each phase of rotation \n we compute the projected area of many small elements of a given finite size spot . \n we then build up the light curve of the entire spot by superposing the light curve of all the small elements . \n the grid resolution of the spot is chosen so that the effect of having a finite number of small elements can alter the value of the computed oscillation amplitudes by a fraction no larger than @xmath0 . \n after computing the oscillation waveform using the above approach , we fourier -

spot model is large - amplitude brightness oscillations with a high contrast in strength between the dominant harmonic and weaker harmonics , as is observed in several sources . the curves for the first harmonic illustrate the general shape of most of the first harmonic curves . \n initially , the amplitude depends only weakly on spot size . \n however , once the spot grows to an angular radius of @xmath1 there is a steep decline in the oscillation amplitude which flattens out only near the tail of the expansion . \n this expected behavior appears to be in conflict with the decline in amplitude observed by strohmayer , zhang , & swank ( 1997 ) from 4u  172834 , in which the initial decline is steep . \n the cause of this could be that the initial velocity of propagation is large , or that the observed amplitude is diminished significantly by isotropization of the beam due to scattering ( weinberg , miller , & lamb 1999 ) . \n panel ( b ) of figure  1 shows the fractional rms amplitude at the second harmonic under the same assumptions but for two identical , antipodal emitting spots . \n the range in spot size here is @xmath2 since two antipodal spots of @xmath3 radii cover the entire stellar surface . \n note that in this situation , there is no first harmonic . \n these figures show that when there is only one emitting spot , the fundamental is always much stronger than higher harmonics . \n thus , a source such as 4u  1636536 with a stronger first overtone than fundamental @xcite must have two nearly antipodal emitting spots . \n as described in detail in @xcite , we confirm the results of @xcite and @xcite that the rms amplitude decreases with increasing compactness until @xmath4 , then increases due to the formation of caustics . \n we also find that a finite surface rotational velocity increases the amplitude at the second harmonic substantially , while having a relatively small effect on the first harmonic ( left panel of figure  2 ) .    as an application to data , in the right panel of figure  2 \n we use our models to fit phase lag data from the millisecond accreting x - ray pulsar sax  j18083658 . \n the waveforms from the accreting spot are expected to be similar to the waveforms from burst brightness oscillations , and the signal to noise for this source greatly exceeds that from burst sources such as aql  x-1 @xcite . as is apparent from the figure \n , the fit is excellent . \n further data , especially from a high - area timing mission , could be used to constrain the stellar mass or radius from phase lag data .", "StartTimeOffset": 3165258035255, "RequestID": "06f0986ed2e44b0f8b79d5285aa86977", "TotalTokens": 1508}

frame '' ) . \n the first two modes with the lowest frequencies ( 49 and 52hz ) are likely to shift when gpi is attached to the telescope . \n this is one of the reasons why no tmds have been installed yet . \n the decision was taken to revisit this study once enough on - telescope experience is gained to evaluate if tmds are required . to this point \n no tmds are installed and so far it seems that no tmds are required . \n the main vibration line in our error budget ( 60hz ) is not on a structural mode assuming that the two low frequency structural modes of gpi have not shifted through the mounting at the telescope in an unfortunate way . \n the topic of vibration in general is complex and is a topic prone to misunderstandings between mechanics , opticians , electrical engineers and scientists . \n an awareness of context and language is critical in this interdisciplinary field . coordinating a sensible and successful vibration mitigation effort in an effective way \n is a challenge and requires its resources and roles such as an interconnected project manager and a `` vibration officer '' . \n there is a constant struggle with hard decisions : does it make sense to spend the extra dollar to finish a study that runs out of funding ? and avoiding the `` sunk cost '' effect in a `` prototype '' development environment is never easy . \n gpi has the strongest constraints on its wavefront error budget of all gemini south instruments and certainly has risen the observatory s awareness of vibrations in the telescope environment . \n the mitigation using an lqg controller for both pointing and focus has been implemented successfully . \n this is an intriguing demonstration of how new technologies can be used to mitigate vibration effects from the controller side . in that sense , using the lqg controller , the impact of the cryocooler vibrations on gpi s performance is low if not negligible . \n the only exception is the high - order wavefront front sensor of the cal unit . \n it is a mach - zehnder type interferometer and the loss in fringe contrast due to the vibration prevents its commissioning . \n fortunately , this is not critical , since the basic functionalities of the cal ( keeping the star bore - sight , and low - order wavefront sensing ) are not impacted . \n furthermore , the gpi team has developed further alternatives to treat ncpa such as speckle - nulling . and so far , even though other instruments such as gems _ can _ see the vibration signal on their wavefront sensors , it seems that there is no impact on performance . \n nevertheless , a `` root treatment '' is always preferable and it is in the observatory s natural interest to keep its `` vibration '' spectra as clean as possible . \n recently , sunpower has developed an active cancellation system ( acs ) as add - on for its gt cryocooler series and we are investigating to upgrade our coolers with it . \n there is widespread use of tmds for aircrafts , machinery , in the car industry , for trains and railways , buildings , power lines and in optical systems . and certainly there is still plenty of room to make a better use of these devices in the field of astronomical instrumentation and optical telescopes .    a good infrastructure of acceleration sensors is required to effectively understand and solve unwanted vibrations . \n otherwise measurements are difficult to obtain and to confirm , and resources of the observatory are wasted in large overheads . in the case of the gemini observatory it seems recommendable to have at least 5 sensors around the cell of m1 ( and \n one could dream about having each hydraulic m1 actuator equipped with a sensor ) . \n elts will take this matter ( hopefully ) serious , plan for an integrated design and maybe feature a dedicated `` vibration control room '' . \n as gpi and other ( xao ) instruments can always be seen as pathfinders for future telescopes and instrumentation , sharing our challenges is hopefully helpful to find suitable solutions in other complex environments . \n gpi can serve as a good example for the successful implementation of a mitigation strategy and for how powerful mitigation strategies such as lgq filtering of the wavefront have become . \n the authors thank paul langlois for suggestions and improvements on the figures . \n the gemini observatory is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , ministrio da cincia , tecnologia e inovao ( brazil ) and ministerio de ciencia , tecnologa e innovacin productiva ( argentina ) \n .      , b. , graham , j.  r. , ingraham , p. , konopacky , q. , marois , c. , perrin , m. , poyneer , l. , bauman , b. , barman , t. , burrows , a. , cardwell , a. , chilcote , j. , de rosa , r.  j. , dillon , d. , doyon , r. , dunn , j. , erikson , d. , fitzgerald , m. , gavel , d. , goodsell , s. , hartung , m. , hibon , p. , kalas , p.  g. , larkin , j. , maire , j. , marchis , f. , marley , m. , mcbride , j. , millar -

{"ContextTokens": 2537, "GeneratedTokens": 109, "SynthesizedBody": "the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , radiating mainly as gamma - rays and x - rays , has defied any simple explanation , despite the presence of a rich observational material and great theoretical efforts . \n this is in contrast to the afterglow emission , in many cases detected all the way from x - rays to radio wavelengths , which is successfully described by synchrotron emission from a forward shock moving at great speed into the surrounding medium . \n synchrotron emission is also a natural candidate for the prompt emission since it arises naturally in an ultra - relativistic outflow in which the kinetic energy is dissipated through , for instance shocks or magnetic reconnections , and shared between the magnetic field and particles . \n however , there are several observational facts that contradict such a simple picture , most importantly the existence of spectra which are much too hard , see for instance the spectra from grb930214 in figure 1 and grb960530 in figure 2 . in many cases such \n spectra are fitted well by a thermal emission function @xcite . \n furthermore , ryde @xcite showed that spectra from more typical bursts , that is , bursts having spectra which are consistent with the synchrotron model , can indeed be fitted with a hybrid model which is dominated by a thermal component , but that is overlayed with a non - thermal emission component as well . in many cases such a model \n gives a statistically better fit . \n such an example is given in figure 3 . \n even though bursts appear to have a variety , sometimes complex , spectral evolutions , the behavior of the two separate components is remarkably similar for all bursts , with the temperature describing a broken power - law in time . \n the non - thermal component is , in most cases , consistent with emission from a population of fast cooling electrons emitting optically - thin synchrotron emission or non - thermal compton radiation , giving a power - law slope of the photon spectrum of @xmath0 . \n however , in the case of grb960530 , shown in figure 2 , @xmath1 is closer to @xmath2 , which is expected for slow cooling @xcite . \n it is very important to note that it is the _ instantaneous _ spectra of grbs that most closely should reveal the radiation mechanism . \n this is because of the strong spectral evolution that normally occurs during a burst and that will make the spectral shape of the _ time - integrated _ spectrum differ from that given by the emission process . \n this is in particular the case for complex bursts with several emission peaks . \n the time - integrated spectrum can easily be found from the instantaneous spectra and the spectral evolution , which was shown analytically by ryde & svensson @xcite ; the spectra always become softer . \n it was early recognized that the spectra of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have a non - thermal character , with emission over a broad energy range ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n this typically indicates emission from an optically - thin source and an initial proposal for grbs was therefore an optically - thin synchrotron model from shock - accelerated , relativistic electrons ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n the number density of the radiating electrons is assumed to be typically a power law as a function of the electron lorentz factor @xmath3 above a minimum value , @xmath4 , with index @xmath5 . \n such a distribution gives rise to a power - law photon spectrum with photon index @xmath6 below a break energy @xmath7 and a high - energy power - law with index @xmath8 . \n however , as mentioned above , this model has difficulties in explaining the observed spectra of grbs , which show a great variation in @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) . in particular \n , a substantial fraction of them have @xmath11 , which is not possible in the model in its simplest form , since @xmath6 is the power - law slope of the fundamental synchrotron function for electrons with an isotropic distribution of pitch angles @xcite . \n the problem becomes even more severe for the case when the cooling time of the electrons is shorter than the typical dynamic timescale . in the typical \n setting of grbs having a relativistic outflow with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath12 , the time scales for synchrotron and inverse compton losses are @xmath13 s @xcite , which is much shorter than both the dynamic time scale @xmath14 , and the integration time - scale of the recorded data , typically 64 ms to 1 s. in such a case the low - energy power - law should be even softer , with @xmath15 @xcite , now contradicting a majority of the observed spectra . \n furthermore , the observed distribution of @xmath9 from _ instantaneous _ spectra is smooth ( see @xcite ) and does not show any indication of preferred values , such as @xmath2 or @xmath16 . \n other variations of the synchrotron or / and inverse compton model have been suggested ( see e.g. @xcite ) to account for these hard spectra . \n the peak energy from the above distribution of electrons is given by @xmath17 . \n in the external shock model @xmath18 and @xmath19 are proportional to the bulk lorentz factor , which makes @xmath20 , which is a very strong dependence , which poses a problem in explaining the relative narrowness of the distribution of peak energies @xcite , even including the x - ray flashes . for the internal shock model the @xmath21 , which is the relative lorentz factor between the two shells that collide and @xmath22 however , the sharing of the energy between the kinetic energy of the electrons and the magnetic fields should lead to a larger dispersion . \n a third complication arises in explaining the observed correlation between peak energy and the luminosity which was discussed by lloyd - ronning et al . @xcite and amati \n @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; the peak energy is correlated with the isotropically equivalent energy given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the actual gamma - ray energy emitted and @xmath27 is the jet opening half - angle of the collimated outflow . \n equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) shows that in the internal shock model @xmath28 is proportional to the lorentz boosted magnetic field strength . the total energy density @xmath29 the typical radius for the internal shocks to occur is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the typical variability time scale , and thus @xmath32 to get a relation similar to that in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) both @xmath33 and @xmath31 have to be quite similar for all bursts , which is difficult to imagine . even though there is no direct way of determining the bulk lorentz factor , various physical models give suggestions on plausible relations between the luminosity and the bulk lorentz factor . \n for instance , @xcite argued for @xmath34 . \n such a relation would thus give @xmath35 , that is , an anti - correlation , in contradiction to the observed behavior ( see also @xcite ) . \n additional assumptions are needed to explain the positive correlation . \n invoking poynting flux and/or pair dominated models the correlation also becomes positive @xcite . \n if the prompt phase is indeed dominated by a thermal component these three issues become natural consequences . \n first , as shown by ryde ( 2004 , 2005 ) the relative strength and the slope of the non - thermal component will determine the value of the low - energy power - law index , @xmath9 , that would be found if the band et al . \n @xcite function were to be used . \n if the thermal component is strong and/or the non - thermal component is hard , the resulting spectrum will have a hard @xmath9 ( see fig.2 ) . \n while if the non - thermal component becomes relatively stronger and/or softer the measured @xmath9-value would be softer ( see fig . \n the observed distribution of @xmath9-values is therefore consistent with this picture and in particular the spectra beyond the `` line - of - death '' @xcite are not conspicuous . a strong spectral evolution , for instance , in a large change in the measured value of @xmath9 , is also easily explained . \n second , the peak of the spectrum is now determined of @xmath36 and is less sensitive to the bulk lorentz factor . \n in fact , if the photosphere occurs during the acceleration phase it is practically independent of @xmath33 . \n rees & mszros @xcite suggest a model where the photospheric emission can become enhanced by dissipative effects below the photosphere ( magnetic reconnections , shocks ) and subsequent comptonization , see also @xcite . \n typical values for the peak energy would be hundreds of kev . \n third , the correlation in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) has a natural explanation since for a thermal emitter the luminosity and the temperature are correlated . \n for instance , equating @xmath28 with the energy density , one gets @xmath37 using that the pair photosphere occurs at @xmath38 ( see rees & mszros @xcite ) then @xmath39 . in the last step , \n @xmath40 was again assumed . \n similarly if the photosphere is emitted during the acceleration phase its temperature will be constant in the observer frame since the comoving cooling by adiabatic expansion is compensated for by the increase in @xmath33 . \n @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the radius at which the linear acceleration starts . \n assuming , for instance , that @xmath43 then again @xmath44 ( see further rees & mszros @xcite ) . finally , for extremely photon starved plasmas @xmath45 . \n the radiative efficiency of the thermal emission can in plausible scenarios be radically increased by , for instance , dissipation processes below the photosphere @xcite . these processes \n would naturally produce large amount of electron - positron pairs with modest lorentz factors , which would compton up - scatter the thermal radiation . \n the observed peak would then be this comptonized peak . \n the non - thermal emission seen in the spectra , could be due to synchrotron emission or inverse compton emission from dissipation regions outside the photosphere . \n ryde @xcite showed that the energy flux in the thermal and the non - thermal components are correlated which might indicate the latter .    in summary , thermal emission \n could indeed dominate over non - thermal emission in standard settings of a grb jet . \n in such scenarios a correlation between the peak energy and the luminosity naturally arises , the details somewhat depending on the dissipation processes . \n in addition , the dispersion in @xmath28 would be smaller and the observed spectral shapes and spectral evolution get natural explanations .", "StartTimeOffset": 3259045105171, "RequestID": "b8e738cc327740aa9f505d76c053b76d", "TotalTokens": 2646}
{"ContextTokens": 3511, "GeneratedTokens": 263, "SynthesizedBody": "after the discovery of the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) , that fills the universe as a sea of photons , with a mean temperature of 2.7 k at present epoch , greisen @xcite and zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite independently pointed out that the mbr would make the universe opaque to uhecr particles with energies approximately @xmath1 ev and above . this hypothesis is well accepted and is known as the gzk cutoff . \n so far , observational data of several experiments about uhecr have report events with energies beyond the gzk cutoff @xcite . \n in addition , the present data show strong discrepancies in the uhecr energy spectrum . on one side , \n the agasa ( extensive air shower ) experiment claims a spectrum beyond the gzk cutoff , without any evidence of the gzk cutoff , on the other side the hires ( air fluorescence ) experiment is in agreement with the expected universal distribution of sources and showing the gzk cutoff in the energy spectrum . \n this means at least that there is a systematic error , probably in the energy determination , in one of the experiments . \n however , this discrepancy can also be attributed to latitude effects , due to the limited coverage of the sky by experiments located in the northern hemisphere . \n so far only experiments with a full ( sugar experiment @xcite ) or partial ( agasa experiment @xcite ) coverage of the galactic central region have reported a cosmic ray excess in the energy region of approximately @xmath0 ev in the direction of the galactic center . \n the accumulating data from auger ( extensive air shower plus air fluorescence ) experiment @xcite , whose southern part is now in progress , on the basis of a larger data set will tell us which is the correct alternative in the near future .    in the past years \n , there are some surveys about a statistical correlation between uhecr events and compact sources at high redshift . depending on the data set , in some cases \n a positive correlation has been reported @xcite , but there are also negative results @xcite . \n the identification of compact objects like bl lac or quasars at high redshift as uhecr sources reinforces a cosmological origin , and has taken to formulate new scenarios such as the violation of the lorentz invariance @xcite as responsible for the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic ray with energies above the gzk cutoff . \n in addition to the top - down models @xcite , where the collapse or decay of super - massive particles like magnetic monopoles , superconducting strings , as well as the @xmath2 z burts @xcite inside a volume with a radius less than 50 mpc from the earth can explain the uhecr data above the gzk cutoff . \n the hypothesis that gamma ray burst ( grb ) might be responsible for the origin of uhecr has been suggest earlier @xcite . \n the grbs are probably the most powerfully events in the universe , and it is believed that protons can be accelerate in a grb by internal shocks taking place in a collimated jet direction . \n the grbs have been observed in spacecraft experiments as short flashes of gamma rays that outshine the rest of the entire gamma - ray sky at a rate of around one event per day @xcite , mostly in the energy band of kev to mev . \n the first measurements of the redshifts in grb afterglows @xcite , together with the highly isotropic distribution of their arrival directions , have established a cosmological origin for them . \n the association of grbs and uhecrs is further supported by the similarity of energy generation rates . \n the average rate of gamma - ray energy emitted by grbs is comparable to the energy generation rate of uhecrs . \n in addition , the almost isotropic distribution of the arrival directions of uhecr and grbs is also an ingredient in favor of an association between them . \n the main constraint on the association between grb and uhecr is that uhecr events above the gzk cutoff require only grbs inside a volume of radius less than 50 mpc from the earth can contribute to the uhecr flux . \n what is the expected rate of grbs in this volume \n ? a pessimistic answer on the basis of only cosmological origin to the grbs gives an estimative of about one grb per 100 years . on the other hand , from an optimistic point of view \n , statistical surveys have shown that it is not always possible to spectroscopically determine the red shift even in some long well located grbs accompanied by x - ray , optical and radio afterglow . \n a plausible explanation for these results is the assumption of a local origin . \n that is to say , they are close to our galaxy or inside it . \n around 70 percent of the observed grbs are the long - soft type with approximately 30 s duration . \n some of these bursts have their measured red shifts clustering in @xmath3 , consequently they have a cosmological origin and they are connected with supernovae events . there is also another category of grbs , the short - hard type with approximately 0.2 s duration , where no red shift and no afterglow have been detected from these bursts . \n probably these short bursts result from a different engine than long bursts , they could be connected with compact binary mergers , like two neutron stars or with a black hole component , as well as binary pulsar . \n they are expected at a high rate of @xmath4 per year in a galaxy like the milk way @xcite . \n these characteristics suggest the two component model ( tcm ) , galactic and extra - galactic for the origin of the grbs . \n another characteristic that strongly support the tcm for the grbs origin is their isotropic distribution of the arrival direction . \n they are regarded to have a uniform distribution in galactic coordinates . \n a more accurate analysis of the angular distribution of grb shows some deviations from a simple isotropic distribution @xcite . under certain assumptions such as an euclidean space and standard candle grbs , \n the formulation of the tcm is plausible . here \n we make an extension of these assumptions to the uhecr events . \n we point out here that a tcm for the uhecr is further supported by the experimental evidences of a uhecr particle excess around @xmath0 ev energies from the direction of the galactic central region . \n a consequence of the seeliger s theorem is the following . \n if sources are uniformly distributed in a spherical volume @xmath5 of radius @xmath6 , and have fixed brightness , then the flux @xmath7 obtained from a source is proportional to @xmath8 , while the number @xmath9 of sources observed down to a given flux limit is proportional to @xmath10 @xmath11 this relation has been observed in radioastronomy as the @xmath12 plot @xmath13 where @xmath14 provided that the sources are homogeneously distributed in an euclidian space . \n then , if a true deviation from this value eventually takes place , we will have the evidence that the space is non - euclidian or / and the sources are inhomogeneously distributed . \n the black line in fig.1 shows the @xmath12 plot obtained for the grbs on the basis of 2704 burst from batse catalog . \n we can see from this figure that a simple @xmath15 ( blue line ) does not fit the data . \n this means that the spatial distribution of grbs is not consistent with a homogeneous case . \n as already has been commented , a possible interpretation for this result is to invoke a non - euclidian space . \n however , another alternative is to introduce a second population of grbs with a gaussian distribution that reflects the radial distribution of matter in the galaxy and its surrounding halo . \n the fluencies of the observed grbs between @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xmath18 imply isotropic burst energies up to approximately @xmath19 erg . while taking beaming angle corrections of about 5 degrees into account , it is expected a narrow distribution around @xmath20 erg . here \n , we assume the same value as in @xcite that gives @xmath21 erg to the gaussian peak which corresponds to a mean flux of 2.8 . \n the best fit is obtained for an amplitude of about 7.5 percent of the first component and a r.m.s . \n value of 13.4 . in short , \n the tcm spatial burst distribution is given by the following cumulutive function @xmath22 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] _ _ _ _ the red line in fig.xx represent this function . \n under the assumption of an association between grbs and uhecr , the hypothesis of a second population of grbs of galactic origin implies also the existence of uhecr of galactic origin . due to the small statistics , especially in the energy region above the gzk cutoff , it is still not possible to mount the log n @xmath23 log s(e ) plot , only on the basis of uhecr data . \n consequently , we make a calibration to obtain the tcm uhecr distribution on the basis of the tcm grbs distribution . \n the detection of an excess of cosmic ray from the direction of the galactic center region observed by agasa and sugar in the energy range of @xmath0 ev opens the door to the possibility that uhecr above the gzk might be created also in our galaxy . \n we assume that the excess of cosmic ray from the direction of the galactic center in the energy range of @xmath0 ev corresponds to the peak of a gaussian distribution and represent the second population of the uhecr . \n this assumption permits us to make a calibration between the grb flux and the energy of the uhecr . \n the other parameters of this second population distribution of uhecr are the same as the grbs distribution . \n figure 2 summarizes the situation where the cumulative distributions for uhecr and for three different energies in the peak of the gaussian distribution are shown . \n it is possible to see that the contribution of the second population to the uhecr flux around the gzk cutoff is sensitive to the value of the gaussian peak . \n the comparison of the predictions of the tcm and the experimental data is shown in fig.3 . \n under the assumption that grbs might be responsible for the origin of uhecr , we have presented here an extension of the two component model of grbs ( galactic , and extra - galactic ) to explain the origin of uhecr . \n the inclusion of a local galactic source for the uhecr origin is further supported by the experimental evidences of an uhecr excess around @xmath0 ev from the direction of the galactic center region . \n this excess can be considered as the peak of a gaussian distribution of the second component and permits us to make a calibration among the grb flux and the uhecr energies . \n perhaps the main constraint to the tcm is , if the uhecr sources are close , why the arrival direction of the events does not point toward their sources ? \n so far , the uhecr distribution does not follow the galactic star distribution . \n this means that probably its surrounding diffuse halo and even the local distribution of galaxies can lodge uhecr sources . \n uhecr event rates beyond the gzk cutoff as observed by agasa experiment can be linked at least in part to grbs of short - hard type , because these grbs neither have afterglows nor redshift suggesting that some of these grbs sources are close to or inside of our galaxy . \n these results are in agreement with others surveys @xcite , showing that grbs with time duration below @xmath24 ms appear to form a separate class of grbs , because from their asymmetry plot the events appear to originate nearby within the galaxy . \n the short - hard grbs probably are formed for instance by coalescence of corotating binary neutron star systems . \n this process is dominated by a strong magnetic field . \n thus , magnetic deflections of the uhecr in the first stages of their propagation can be responsible of a arrival direction of events without pointing toward their sources . \n we are waiting for the next round of the auger experiment . certainly only after a large set of data that we can confirm or refute the tcm for the origin of uhecr . \n this work was partially supported by faperj ( the research fostering foundation of the state of rio de janeiro ) and cnpq ( the national council of research and development ) of brazil . \n k. greisen , phys rev . \n 16 , 748 ( 1966 ) . \n g. t. zapsepin and v. a. kuzmin , sov . \n phys .- jetp lett . \n 1966 , 4 , 78 n. hashida , phys . \n 73 , 3491 ( 1994 ) . \n d. j. bird et al . \n 71 , 3401 ( 1993 ) . \n lawrence , r. j. o. reid and a. watson , j. phys . \n 17 , 733 ( 1991 ) . \n r. clay , publ . \n 18 , 148 ( 2001 ) . \n n. hashida et al . , astrophys . \n j. 10 , 303 ( 1999 ) . \n j. w. cronin , nucl . \n b ( proc . suppl . ) 97 , 3 ( 2001 ) . \n s. l. dubovsky , p. g. tinyakov and i. i. tkachev , phys . \n 85 , 1154 ( 2000 ) . \n d. f. torres , s. reucroft , o. reimer and l. anchordoqui , astrophys . \n j. 595 , l13 ( 2003 ) . \n s. coleman and s. l. glashow , phys . \n d 59 , 116008 ( 1999 ) . c. t. hill , nucl . \n b 224 , 469 ( 1983 ) . \n d. fargion , b. mele , and a. salis , astrophys . \n j. 517 , 725 ( 1999 ) . \n e. waxman , phys . \n 75 , 386 ( 1995 ) . \n w. s. paciesas et al . , astrophys . \n js , 122 , 465 ( 1999 ) . \n e. costa , nature , 372 , 652 ( 1997 ) . \n v. kalogera et al . , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3890, "GeneratedTokens": 173, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery of a large number of short - period extrasolar planets has generated renewed interests in the study of tidally induced migration of protoplanets in disks . \n the basis of migration is the gravitational interaction between a gaseous disk and an orbiting perturber , and has been analyzed well before extrasolar planets were actually discovered @xcite . \n it has been suggested that this tidal interaction induces the embedded protoplanet to migrate under two different circumstances . in type  i migration , \n the protoplanet mass is small and the disk structure is weakly perturbed . in this limit \n , the disk response can be analyzed with a quasi - linear approximation . \n linear calculations have revealed an intrinsic imbalance of inner and outer disk torques @xcite , so the planet could migrate quite quickly inward . in type ii migration , the protoplanet mass is sufficiently large for it to open up a gap in the disk @xcite . \n the protoplanet s orbital evolution is locked to the evolution of the disk , which is likely to be on the viscous timescale @xcite . \n both types of migration have been basically confirmed by the non - linear numerical simulations . \n the high mobility of small mass protoplanets or embryo cores of giant planets from type i migration has presented a challenge to the formation of giant planets . \n the absence of deep oceans is contrary to the inference that any terrestrial planet in the solar system may be formed well outside the snow - line and migrated to their present location . \n it is thus imperative to explore the cause which may have inhibited the type i migration . \n one potential contributor to this process is the disk response to low mass planets , especially in the co - orbital region where only sketchy analytical arguments have been developed . \n there are , however , two notable recent exceptions . \n masset ( 2001 , 2002 ) has evaluated the co - orbital corotation torque and found that they can play a crucial role for the migration rate . \n extensive numerical simulations of viscous disks have been performed to understand the torque dependence on the planet mass , sound speed , disk viscosity , and the torque saturation mechanism . \n one generic behavior he found is that the total torque on the planet first shows an oscillation consistent with the librating fluid motion in the co - orbital region then it levels off to a constant due to the disk viscosity . \n another study is by balmforth & korycansky ( 2001 ) , who used matched asymptotic expansions to explore the non - linear dynamics of the flows in the co - orbital region . \n they investigated the role of re - arranging the potential vorticity profile as a response to the planet s driving and its role in the corotation torque saturation . for inviscid flows , they also noticed the formation of vortices which they attributed to the secondary instabilities in a forced critical layer problem ( the critical layer in this case is the corotation resonance ) .    in this _ \n letter _ , we present results on the non - linear dynamics of the co - orbital region , based on direct , high resolution numerical simulations (  2 ) . \n our approach is quite similar to that of masset s except that we have focused on the inviscid limit simulations . as a consequence , the total torque on the planet exhibits some interesting new behavior , instead of leveling off to a constant as in the case of viscous disks . \n some of the findings are similar to what balmforth & korycansky have found in the excitation of vortices (  3 ) . \n we provide an interpretation of why these vortices are produced in  4 and discuss the implications of our results in  5 . \n we assume that the protoplanetary disk is thin and can be described by the inviscid 2-d euler equations in a cylindrical @xmath0 plane with vertically integrated quantities . \n two gravitating bodies , a central star and a protoplanet , are located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively and the 2-d disk is modeled between @xmath3 . \n the planet is on a fixed circular orbit at @xmath2 . \n the self - gravity of the disk is not included .    the mass ratio between the planet and the central star is taken to be @xmath4 . \n its hill ( roche ) radius is @xmath5 . \n the disk is assumed to be isothermal with a constant temperature throughout the simulation region ( i.e. , it is attached to a thermal bath ) . the isothermal sound speed , scaled by the keplerian rotation speed @xmath6 at @xmath2 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the disk scale height . \n we used a set of three sound speeds @xmath9 . in the simulations presented here , \n we choose an initial surface density profile with @xmath10 , in order that the ratio of vorticity to surface density ( potential vorticity ) has a flat radial profile @xmath11 ( note that @xmath12 has a small deviation from being a precise constant due to the finite pressure gradient which slightly modifies @xmath6 from its keplerian value . ) with this choice of initial condition , we avoid the generation of inflection points due to the rearrangement of @xmath12 distribution as it is carried by the stream lines . \n we have also made other runs which have an initial potential vorticity gradient and we find that the results presented here also hold for them . \n the detailed analysis of these results will be presented elsewhere .    since @xmath13 for all three different sound speeds , the planet is embedded . \n the planet s gravitational potential is softened by an approximate 3-d treatment . \n the key approach is to take the surface density at each cell spreading it out vertically based on a gaussian density profile with a scale height determined by the local temperature . \n the gravitional force between the planet and the disk matter is calculated using this 3-d configuration but all the forces with the same @xmath0 positions are summed together . \n this gives a correction factor @xmath14 to the gravitational forces , which effectively softens the gravitational potential . \n the torque overestimation in a 2-d geometry was studied in @xcite which arises only from locations near the planet . as a test \n if our key finding is affected by the 3-d treatment , we excluded several roche radii from the torque calculation and show that it is not the case . \n although there are some accumulation of gas near the planet , we do not allow any disk gas to be accreted onto it . \n this boundary condition is equivalent to that of sufficiently low - mass protoplanets with quasi hydrostatic envelopes ( pollack _ et al . \n the planet s potential is switched on over 10 orbits in order for the disk to make an adiabatic adjustment . \n ( we have used other , longer turn - on times but the results do not depend on them . )    simulations are carried out using a 2-d code whose basic algorithm was based on fargo by @xcite and @xcite . \n the co - rotating frame is used so that the positions of the central star and the planet are fixed at @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( acceleration due to frame rotation is also included , see @xcite ) . \n runs are made using several radial and azimuthal grids to study the influence of resolution , and those presented here have @xmath17 . \n outflow boundary conditions are used at both the inner and outer radial boundaries . \n the simulations typically last several hundred orbits at @xmath2 . \n one key difference between our simulations and previous studies is that our simulations are performed in the inviscid limit , i.e. , we do not explicitly include a viscosity term , though numerical viscosity is inevitable and is needed to handle for example shocks . \n in addition , our simulations tend to be of higher resolution . with a radial @xmath18 ( some runs go up to @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 , the diameter of the hill sphere of a planet with @xmath21 is resolved by at least @xmath22 cells in each direction . using a nested - grid technique , \n @xcite have also made very high resolution simulations , though their simulations include an explicit viscosity . \n our simulation results are generally in agreement with previous simulations for the planet on a fixed circular orbit ( see * ? ? ? \n * ) in terms of the generic structures produced in the disk by the tidal interactions between the planet and its surrounding flows . \n since the planet mass is relatively small , only density dips are produced without gaps ( at least during a few hundred orbits simulated here ) . \n we define the co - orbital region here as @xmath23 . \n the co - orbital region can be separated into several parts depending on their streamline behavior ( see * ? ? ? \n * ) , including the horseshoe ( or librating ) region @xmath24 , the separatrix region @xmath25 , and the streaming region @xmath26 . \n the horseshoe region can be further divided into real horseshoe streamlines enclosing all three libration points ( @xmath27 ) and tadpole like streamlines enclosing either @xmath28 or @xmath29 . \n our key finding is shown in fig . \n [ fig : torq_t ] which displays the total torque on the planet from the disk . \n it has two very distinct phases : phase i : the total torque is negative and smooth , modulated by a period that is similar to the libration period near the l4 and l5 points ( @xmath30 where @xmath31 is one orbit at @xmath2 ) . \n phase ii : the total torque shows very large amplitude and fast oscillations with a quasi - period of a few orbits . \n we see such a behavior in all the runs with three different sound speeds , though the times when the `` phase '' transition occurs are different . \n they are at @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . \n the obvious question is what causes such large amplitude and fast changes in torques . \n closer inspection of the co - orbital region at times around @xmath36 ( using @xmath37 as an example ) reveals that vortices are generated in the separatrix region . \n this development is shown in fig . \n [ fig : kh ] , which depicts maps of potential vorticity @xmath12 through the times when the system undergoes its `` phase '' transition . \n one can see that these vortices are anti - cyclones which are also blobs of higher densities ( not shown here ) . \n being in the separatrix region , they experience very close encounters with the planet repeatedly , thus exerting strong `` impulses '' to the planet . \n this results in the large amplitude and fast variations in the torque evolution .    to understand this phenomenon further , in fig . [ \n fig : pv ] , we plot the azimuthally averaged radial potential vorticity profile @xmath38 for @xmath37 at different times @xmath39 . \n one sees that this profile deviates progressively away from the initially flat radial profile , developing two prominent structures at @xmath40 , with a minimum at @xmath41 and a maximum at @xmath42 . comparing with fig . \n [ fig : kh ] , vortices apparently emerge from the minima . \n the existence of the extrema ( or inflection points ) in the potential vorticity profile is usually regarded as a necessary condition for non - axisymmetric instabilities in rotating shear flows ( drazin & reid 1981 ) . \n the progressive steepening of this profile , say , at @xmath43 until @xmath44 and the subsequent flattening ( see the curve at @xmath45 ) strongly suggest that there is a secondary instability which is excited around @xmath41 and vortices are the non - linear outcome of such an instability . \n how could the potential vorticity profile develop such inflection points / structures from an initially flat and stable profile ? \n as can be seen from the evolution equation for potential vorticity @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the lagrangian derivative , that @xmath12 is conserved along the streamlines in 2d ( korycansky & papaloizou 1996 ) . \n thus , the initial uniform @xmath12 distribution should be preserved in an inviscid disk . \n this conclusion , however , is only true provided that streamlines can be defined everywhere in a dissipationless flow .    disk flows in the co - orbital region around the planet , however , do not satisfy this condition ( except perhaps for flows within @xmath48 ) because of the two sets of spiral shocks produced by the planet . \n these two sets of shocks emanate from close to the planet and cut through the whole disk . \n flow lines which encounter these shocks are broken and the dissipation in shocks breaks the potential vorticity conservation . the consequence of the shock is equivalent to that of a strong viscous stress in the momentum equation , the curl of which , does not vanish .    to establish the role of shocks in breaking the potential vorticity conservation , we have performed three runs with different sound speeds @xmath49 . even though they only span a small range , but the effects are quite clear . in fig . \n [ fig : pv3cs ] , we plot the azimuthally averaged potential vorticity profiles for these three runs at a time just before the emergence of vortices . \n vortices first appear at the minimum of the `` valley '' in the profiles which moves outwards as @xmath50 increases . \n this growth pattern is consistent with the fact that the starting location of the shocks is also moving away from the planet when the sound speed increases . \n note that the cause for the emergence and growth of inflection points in the azimuthally averaged @xmath12 distribution presented here is different from that due to its re - arrangment along the horseshoe orbits ( balmforth and korycansky 2001 ) . in our calculation with a more general initial @xmath51 ( and @xmath12 ) distribution , we confirm that onset of the shearing instability occurs at an earlier epoch . \n the appearance of the subsequently self - excited vortices is quite similar to the development of the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability observed at shear interfaces . \n a detailed study on the properties of this secondary instability , such as its threshold and growth rate , will be presented in a forthcoming paper . \n in this paper , we consider the tidal interaction between a protostellar disk and an embedded planet with a modest mass . \n linear torque calculations suggest that such interaction leads to angular momentum transfer and inward migration of the planets . for planets with mass comparable to that of the earth , the inferred migration time scale ( ward 1997 ) \n is much shorter than the observationally determined depletion time scale of the disk @xcite . \n this analytic result raises a problem for the formation of giant planets through the core accretion process ( pollack _ et al . \n we reinvestigate this process in an attempt to resolve this paradox . \n the embedded protoplanet induces a circulation flow pattern near its corotation region in the disk . \n we show here that even in disks with initially uniform potential vorticities , inflection points may emerge and grow spontaneously as potential vorticity is generated near the spiral shock in the vicinity of the protoplanet . \n these inflection points lead to the onset and growth of secondary instabilities . \n the existence of secondary instabilities and their non - linear outcome as vortices indicate that the flows in the co - orbital region are perhaps more complicated than linear analyses have suggested . \n these vortices should exert strong torques on the planet . \n one limitation of our current study is that the planet is being artificially held on a fixed circular orbit . \n such strong and rapidly varying torques from the vortices on the planet might cause the planet to `` oscillate '' and lose its phase coherence with the surrounding flow . \n this feedback process should have important implications for the type i migration problem . allowing the planet to migrate radially \n must be included in order to understand the planet s response to such torques . \n these issues will be addressed in a forthcoming publication . \n we wish to thank neil balmforth , darryl holm and edison liang for useful discussions . \n this research was performed under the auspices of the department of energy . \n it was supported by the laboratory directed research and development program at los alamos and by lanl / igpp . \n we are also supported in part by nasa through nag5 - 11779 , nag5 - 9223 , and nsf through ast-9987417 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3278500947274, "RequestID": "81b501b5cee441ffa2d820d896e8fa67", "TotalTokens": 4063}

antiparticle pair and immediately after they quickly annihilate each other . however , it is always possible that the one with negative energy ( in order to conserve the total energy ) falls into the bh while the other possessing the positive energy escapes to spatial energy as hr . today , hr is also called the bekenstein - hawking radiation in virtue of bekenstein s remarkable contributions @xcite to this phenomenon .    since 1975 , \n the studies concerning hr have been carrying on . up to the present times , \n many different methods for the hr are proposed ( the reader may refer to @xcite and references therein ) . among them , the most fascinating quantum tunneling methods are parikh and wilczek s null -

carrying particles [ photons and the massive vector bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) ] , except for a major glitch : all of these particles emerge without a mass ! although this is true for the photon , we know that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons must have mass , nearly hundred times that of a proton . \n the problem of spontaneously broken gauge theories in curved spacetime is well known in literature @xcite . so far , the higgs mechanism @xcite is the experimentally confirmed mechanism to solve the generation of mass problem in particle physics , which satisfies both the unitarity and the renormalization of the theory .    in this paper , we make a brief review for the derivation of the wave equation for the mass generating ( massive and charged ) scalar particles . applying the resulting equation obtained to the general 4-dimensional static and spherically symmetric metric , we obtain the general radial integral solution for the action of hamilton -

minimal interaction of the scalar field @xmath9 @xcite with gravity . in other words , \n the minimally coupled scalar fields correspond to @xmath10 . \n it is worth noting that this coupling constant @xmath8 can also be used to stabilize the vacuum expectation value @xmath11 near the event horizon of a bh @xcite . \n the gauge - covariant derivative is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant ( i.e. the planck charge ) of the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath14 . \n the variation of the action ( 1 ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath15 leads to the einstein equations of motion as follows @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the energy - momentum tensor . \n its overlong expression can be seen in the study of moniz et al @xcite . \n significantly , when one applies the variation to the action ( 1 ) with respect to @xmath18 , the following wave equation is obtained @xmath19   + \\xi \\re\\phi+\\partial_{\\phi^{\\dag}}v=0 . \\label{4}\\ ] ]    the mass generating potential was also defined in @xcite as follows @xmath20    where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant and the coupling constant @xmath22 is dimensionless in 4-dimensional spacetime . without loss of generality , it is assumed that @xmath22 has a positive definite value . \n as clearly stated in @xcite , the vacuum expectation value must satisfy the condition of @xmath23 , which requires that @xmath24 must have a minimum at @xmath25 . to obtain the bounded solution for the hamiltonian \n , @xmath26 must be negative since @xmath22 is positive . \n due to this reason , we shift @xmath27 . \n hence , using eq . \n ( 5 ) , we have @xmath28   \\phi . \\label{6}\\ ] ]    after assigning the reduced planck constant back to its original value @xmath29 , eq . \n ( 4 ) can be rewritten as @xmath30   + \\frac{1}{\\hslash^{2}}\\left [   \\xi\\re -

jona - lasinio model @xcite . \n moreover , in the standard model , the higgs fields possess the values of @xmath8 within the range of @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite . \n the line - element for the 4-dimensional generic static ( spherically symmetric ) bh metric is given by@xmath36 where the metric functions @xmath37 are only the function of @xmath38 . \n any horizon @xmath39 should satisfy the condition of @xmath40 and @xmath39 is , in general , a function of the mass and charge of the bh . \n the hawking temperature of a bh described by the metric ( 8) is given by @xcite @xmath41    where @xmath42 and the prime over a quantity denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath38 . \n furthermore , the ricci scalar @xcite for the metric ( 8) can be found as @xmath43    in order to study the quantum tunneling of the mass generating particles from the generic bh ( 8) , we use the wkb approximation and assume an ansatz for the scalar field @xmath9 as follows @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the amplitude of the wave and @xmath46 stands for the classically forbidden action of the trajectory . \n metric ( 8) admits two killing vectors @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , which show the existence of the symmetries . \n therefore , one can assume a solution for the action as @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes energy , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are radial and angular functions , respectively . \n ( 12 ) @xmath55  is a complex constant . \n since @xmath7 represents the electromagnetic vector potential , for a dyonic bh with electric and magnetic components one should have @xmath56   $ ] . under the guidance of the hamilton - jacobi method @xcite , we first insert eqs . \n [ 11 - 13 ] in eq . \n ( 7 ) and then consider the terms with the leading order of @xmath57 . \n thus , we obtain the following lenghty expression @xmath58   r^{2}-2\\left [   \\left (   g^{\\prime}r^{\\prime } -2 + 2gr^{\\prime\\prime}\\right )   f+gf^{\\prime}r^{\\prime}\\right ]   fr+r^{\\prime } f^{2}g\\}\\xi\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath59   \\mathrm{\\sin}^{\\mathrm{2}}\\theta-(ea_{1}-{j_{\\varphi}})^{2})f+r\\mathrm{\\sin}^{\\mathrm{2}}\\theta e_{net}^{2}\\right\\ }   = 0 , \\label{13}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . from eq . \n ( 13 ) , we derive an integral solution for @xmath53 as follows @xmath63   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}dr , \\label{14}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    since @xmath67 , the near horizon form of eq . \n ( 14 ) becomes @xmath68    which is essential expression for computing the quantum tunneling rate . \n now , we test the above result obtained via the drnbh geometry @xcite whose the metric functions and electromagnetic vector potential components are given by @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    where the physical quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the drnbh s characteristic parameters : @xmath72 is the electric charge and @xmath73 is the magnetic charge . \n the outer or event ( @xmath74 ) and inner ( @xmath75 ) horizons of the drnbh are given by @xmath76    where @xmath77 . \n ( 22 ) the parameter @xmath78 represents the mass of the drnbh . \n since @xmath79 consequently @xmath80 around the event horizon . here , one can immediately criticize why the @xmath81 parameter including the particle s mass @xmath31  quickly drops out of the considerations . \n however , one can experience from the previous studies @xcite that the non - differential terms coupled to the wave function @xmath9  ( for example , in eq . ( 7 ) , it corresponds to @xmath82   \\phi$ ] ) apart from the operator term acting on @xmath9 ( like the laplacian operator : @xmath83 ) always looses its effiency near the horizon . \n that is why , for instance , the hr is independent from the particle s mass @xcite . \n thus , eq . ( 18 ) reduces to @xmath84    meanwhile , we now have @xmath85 . \n it is obvious that the above integrand possesses a simple pole at the event horizon . to evaluate integral ( 23 ) \n , we first expand the metric function @xmath86 as follows @xmath87    substituting the above expression into eq . \n ( 23 ) and choosing the contour as a half loop going around this pole from left to right , one obtains @xmath88    thus , the imaginary part of the action ( 12 ) becomes @xmath89    thence , we compute the probabilities of ingoing and outgoing particles tunneling the drnbh horizon as @xmath90 @xmath91    classically , having a bh is conditional on the no - reflection for the ingoing waves , which meants full absorption : @xmath92 . \n this is possible simply by setting @xmath93 ( for similar and recent works , the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein ) which results in @xmath94    consequently , we read the quantum tunneling rate for the drnbh as @xmath95    employing the boltzmann formula @xmath96 @xcite , the surface temperature of the drnbh can be computed as @xmath97    which is exactly equal to the standard hawking temperature of the drnbh @xcite . \n temperature versus mass plotting is depicted in fig . \n ( 1 ) for @xmath98 . as it can be seen from fig . \n ( 1 ) , the locations of the peaks on the @xmath78-axis ( which are very close to their associated starting mass value @xmath99 : the extreme bh case , @xmath100 ) shift towards right with increasing @xmath78-value , however the peak values decrease when @xmath101 gets bigger numbers . \n moreover , while @xmath102 all the curves of the temperatures rapidly reach to the curve of the schwarzschild ( @xmath103 ) bh s hawking temperature , which goes to zero with increasing @xmath78-value .     versus drnbh mass @xmath78 . \n the plots are governed by eq . \n the starting masses are governed by @xmath99 . ] \n in this paper , we firstly reviewed the derivation of the wave equation for the mass generating scalar particles in the concept of the spontaneous symmetry breaking theory . to this end \n , we introduced an action involving a non - minimal scalar field coupled to the gravity . by using the hamilton - jacobi method with a suitable wkb ansatz \n , the quantum tunneling of the mass generating bosons from a generic static bh is thoroughly studied . \n we then obtained the general integral solution for the radial function ( 14 ) for the hamilton - jacobi action @xmath46 . \n drnbh geometry whose the metric functions satisfy the equality @xmath104 is considered as a test background for our computations . \n it is seen that scalar particle mass @xmath31 , the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath8 , and the potential constant @xmath22 are not decisive for the quantum tunneling rate , however the charge @xmath13 is . in the semiclassical framework , we computed the probabilities of the ingoing and outgoing particles to get the quantum tunneling rate for the drnbh . \n finally , we managed to read the standard hawking temperature of the drnbh via the boltzmann formula of the tunneling rate .    in future work \n , we plan to extend our analysis to a bh ( might be a spherically non - symmetric ) having @xmath86 , which does not vanish at the event horizon : @xmath105 . because in such a case eq . \n ( 18 ) may yield such @xmath106 values ( having now the potential constant term @xmath22 ) that the quantum tunneling rate can deviate from its pure thermal character @xcite and give contribution to the information loss problem @xcite . \n we also aim to extend our analysis to the dynamic , rotating and higher / lower dimensional bhs . in this way \n , we will analyze the hr of the mass generating particles from various bhs . \n the authors are grateful to the editor and anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the paper .", "StartTimeOffset": 3315829632887, "RequestID": "683cf674395d4ad6860757a4f8b4131a", "TotalTokens": 4091}

[ sec : ligo_cavs ] was simulated with this limited map , resulting in 815ppm impurity in the circulating beam . \n this is a very good improvement on the original impurity of 0.114 , illustrating that a high beam purity is achievable with these mirror requirements . to achieve an even higher beam purity \n will involve reducing the amplitudes of these polynomials further , as well as additional zernike requirements . \n we have investigated the coupling which occurs when laguerre - gauss modes are incident on a mirror with surface distortions . \n taking an analytical approach we used zernike polynomials to represent mirror surface distortions and derived an approximate equation for the significant coupling when an lg mode is reflected from a surface defined by a particular zernike polynomial . \n this derivation resulted in a condition for significant coupling , @xmath19 , where @xmath8 is the azimuthal index of the zernike polynomial and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the azimuthal indices of the incident and coupled modes respectively . \n this is a significant result as it allows us to predict which order 9 modes will be largely coupled by particular zernike polynomials and suggest which modes will have large amplitudes in the arm cavities    we investigated the performance of lg@xmath0 in high finesse cavities by simulation with advanced ligo mirror maps . \n this illustrated the degraded purity of the circulating beam in realistic cavities due to higher order mode degeneracy . \n the results were then analysed by looking at the zernike polynomials representing our example mirror map . \n the analysis and results were consistent with the predictions made from eq . \n [ eq : k_eq ] . \n this suggested that astigmatism was causing a significant amount of coupling , particularly into the lg@xmath22 and lg@xmath23 modes . \n this was confirmed when the cavity was simulated again with the astigmatism removed from the mirror map and we observed a dramatic increase in the lg@xmath0 mode purity . \n the analytical description enabled us to identify the specific zernike polynomials which cause large couplings as well as the lg modes which would dominate as a result . using this \n we were able to derive certain requirements for our example mirror map , etm08 , in terms of limits on the amplitudes of the zernike polynomials z@xmath24 , z@xmath25 and z@xmath26 ( table  [ table : limits ] ) . using this map \n the resulting circulating beam impurity was found to be 815ppm , a significant reduction from the original impurity of 0.114 . \n this investigation has demonstrated that a high beam purity is achievable using an lg@xmath0 beam when modifications are made to the low order zernike polynomials in advanced ligo mirrors . implementing the lg@xmath0 beam in gravitational wave detectors \n will be challenging as we require very small amplitudes on these lower order polynomials . \n we should also consider that the example mirror surfaces considered here refer to uncoated substrates . \n the coating process is likely to add to the lower order features in the mirror surfaces . \n however , using this analytical approach we can derive specific requirements for the mirror surfaces leading to designs for suitable mirrors for these higher order beams . \n we would like to thank garilynn billingsley for providing the advanced ligo mirror surface maps and for advice and support on using them . \n we would also like to thank david shoemaker and stefan hild for useful discussions . \n this work has been supported by the science and technology facilities council and the european commission ( fp7 grant agreement 211743 ) . \n this document has been assigned the ligo laboratory document number ligo  p1100081 . \n the product of two laguerre - gauss modes is : @xmath27 the following derivation follows from eq . \n [ eq : m_condition ] . \n currently we are concerned with the magnitude of the coupling coefficients , so we ignore any constant phase shifts and integrate with respect to @xmath12 : @xmath28 in order to further simplify the equation the following variable substitution is made : @xmath29 and a new limit to the integral : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the zernike radius . \n this gives the integral : @xmath32 substituting in the sums representing the laguerre polynomials and the radial zernike function as a function of @xmath33 gives : @xmath34 this type of integral results in the lower incomplete gamma function : @xmath35 when @xmath36 is equal to @xmath7 , an integer , the function is given by the following sum : @xmath37 therefore , the final equation for this approximation of the magnitude of the coupling coefficients is given by : @xmath38 \n clipping loss is given by : @xmath39 where the integral represents the normalised power reflected by a perfect mirror . \n @xmath40 defines an infinite plane perpendicular to the beam axis . \n the magnitude squared of an lg mode is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the beam radius , @xmath43 and @xmath20 are the mode indices and @xmath4 is the radial position . integrating over the surface and taking a similar approach as for the coupling coefficients \n we get : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath31 is the radius of the mirror and @xmath46 is the lower incomplete gamma function . \n for certain zernike polynomials ( those with non - zero @xmath8 ) their amplitudes in a surface depend on the orientation of that surface with respect to the zernike surface . \n for example , consider the two polynomials responsible for astigmatism , z@xmath47 . \n the two polynomials actually describe the same shape , with one just rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other . therefore , rotating a surface , such as the one described by mirror map etm08 , will change the amplitudes of these two polynomials within the surface . fig . \n [ fig : etm08_zs_rotated ] illustrates this effect . \n the plots show the amplitudes of the order 2 zernike polynomials present in the etm08 mirror surface as it is rotated . \n as expected the amplitude of the z@xmath48 polynomial remains constant as it has no angular dependence . \n the amplitudes of the z@xmath47 polynomials oscillate and , at a certain rotation ( around 120@xmath49 ) the astigmatism of the surface is completely described by z@xmath50 , and 90@xmath49 later completely described by z@xmath51 . \n the root mean squared amplitude ( @xmath52 ) of the polynomials remains constant . \n we have used zernike polynomials to describe mirror surface distortions and analyse the coupling that occurs from lg@xmath0 into other order 9 modes . \n this approach appears to be very suitable as we have been able to identify specific polynomials which extract significant amounts of power from the input mode . \n however , there is an alternative method used to investigate mirror surface distortions , which involves looking at the spatial frequencies present in real mirrors . in this section \n we compare these two methods . \n to look at the spatial frequencies present in realistic mirrors we perform a 2d fourier transform of the surface height data . \n the resulting spectra is then analysed and synthetic maps are created with the same spatial frequencies . \n this method focuses on identifying particular spatial wavelengths which cause a large degree of coupling from lg@xmath0 . \n many synthetic maps are created and used in simulations of gravitational wave detectors . a statistical approach \n is then taken to determine the extent of the coupling when specific spatial frequencies are present in the mirror .    in the zernike approach \n we look at the different polynomials present in mirror surface distortions . \n this can be thought of as equivalent to looking at the spectra of the mirror surfaces as the different polynomials represent different spatial frequencies . \n the plot in fig . \n [ fig : map_spectra ] illustrates this . \n the spectrum of the etm08 advanced ligo mirror map is shown , along with the spectra of maps made up from the zernike polynomials present in the etm08 mirror . \n each of the zernike maps recreates the ligo map with polynomials up to a certain order . \n the plots show that as the order of zernike polynomials present increases the higher spatial frequencies are represented in the mirror map . \n this is because these higher order polynomials represent the higher order spatial frequencies . \n looking at the spatial frequencies present in the zernike polynomials we found that the frequencies depended on the order , @xmath7 . \n a consequence of this is that if we just consider the spatial frequencies present in the mirror maps we will not be able to distinguish between polynomials with different @xmath8 . as we have seen , the azimuthal index is very significant as it determines which modes are largely coupled from lg@xmath0 . therefore looking at the spatial frequencies does nt identify the important shapes in the mirror surfaces . \n the zernike approach would seem to be the most suitable as this allows us to identify the interesting polynomials and modes .                                ` \n zernike polynomials and their use in describing the wavefront aberrations of the human eye ' ( stanford university , 2003 ) http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/2003/psych221/projects/03/pmaeda/index.html", "StartTimeOffset": 3321401054725, "RequestID": "2bb7e4a01bfd44958cd6f5eef3589393", "TotalTokens": 3723}

caccin , gomez , & severino 1993 ) . \n the spin and orbit decouple when the splitting due to the external magnetic field overwhelms that due to the fine - structure effect . in figure  1 \n , the feature appears as a strong triplet at @xmath215862 , 5892 , and 5924 . the observed splitting is not only considerably larger than the 6    fine - structure effect , but the pattern is centered near the mean wavelength of the nonmagnetic doublet . \n hence , we conclude that the paschen - back approximation is appropriate and we analyze the feature as an ordinary linear zeeman triplet with an insignificant quadratic component . \n the displacements of the @xmath22 components are then @xmath23  @xmath24 and @xmath2592  @xmath24 for @xmath265862 and @xmath265924 , respectively . \n ( it is customary in atomic spectroscopy to use wavenumber units . ) from the linear zeeman effect , the mean surface field ( cf . \n garstang 1977 ) is computed according to @xmath27 which yields an average value for the two components of @xmath28  g = 1.92  mg . there are , in fact , direct laboratory measurements of the d lines which overlap this field strength and corroborate the accuracy of the linear approximation . \n garn et al . \n ( 1966 ) reported splittings between the @xmath22 components that from 30    for a longitudinal field of 0.94  mg up to 163    at 5.1  mg . \n our measurement of 1.92  mg is the mean surface field strength . \n detailed modeling of the line profile , preferably supported with spectropolarimetric observations , is necessary to draw conclusions about the field geometry . \n a dipolar geometry is usually an adequate approximation , though the pattern is often offset significantly from the center of the star . \n time - dependent observations might determine if the star rotates , and allow the modeling of periodic changes in the geometric view . \n both @xmath22 components and , to a lesser extent , the @xmath29 component should be circularly polarized , while linear polarization and polarization of the continuum should be small . \n the subordinate triplet connects levels @xmath30 with @xmath31 for @xmath215167.3 , 5172.7 , 5183.6 , respectively . in lhs  2534 \n the region shows 4 principal components at wavelengths of @xmath15149   , 5180   , 5205   , and 5235   . modeling each component of the parent triplet as a simple zeeman triplet in a field of @xmath32  mg \n indeed produces a complex with only 4 lines due to overlapping of some of the 9 components . \n the short - wavelength edge matches that of the data , but the splitting between lines is somewhat less than observed and thus the feature does not extend sufficiently far to the red . \n we take this as evidence that the linear zeeman approximation has broken down for this ion , where the fine - structure effect is comparable to the magnetic interaction . \n we are aware of no computations of the behavior of in this intermediate regime . \n the ion is isoelectronic with , but has spin - orbit splitting which even exceeds that of the features and results in the well - known `` h '' ( 3933   ) and `` k '' ( 3968   ) doublet components being well - resolved even at low spectral resolution in zero field . since the linear magnetic term in the hamiltonian is thus comparable to the spin - orbit term , the splitting at such a low field is more complicated still . \n calculations have been published by kemic ( 1975 ) . at a field strength of 1.9  mg , the 10 zeeman components of the doublet group themselves into 3 features centered around @xmath33 , and comprised primarily of transitions from upper levels @xmath16 @xmath34 , @xmath16 @xmath35 , and @xmath15 @xmath36 \n these are heavily blended for the observed line widths , and together result in the broad depression centered near 3957   . \n strong absorption features due to and many other heavy elements are prominent in the spectra of late type stars shortward of 4000   , and may also contribute in lhs  2534 . \n finally , the strong neutral calcium resonance line at 4226    shows a complex structure , and any magnetic components are severely blended . \n inr would like to thank fred chaffee for undertaking the keck service observations . \n we are grateful to d.t . \n wickramasinghe for helpful discussions . \n jl acknowledges the hospitality of the institute for theoretical physics , u.c . \n santa barbara , at which part of this work was completed . \n the itp is supported in part by the national science foundation grant phy 94 - 07194 . \n gds thanks the australian national university for hospitality and support during a sabbatical leave . \n support for the study of magnetic stars and stellar systems at steward observatory is also provided by the nsf through grant ast 97 - 30792 to gds .", "StartTimeOffset": 3334749121960, "RequestID": "037d6860d3484a1a80a545a0083a1281", "TotalTokens": 2845}
{"ContextTokens": 2645, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "while there exist quite deep and high - resolution wfpc2 and nicmos images at the hdf - n , it has been desired to have the ground - base @xmath4-band data at the field with comparable depth and image quality in order to study more rest - frame optical properties of high - redshift galaxies . for the purpose \n , we obtained the very deep @xmath0-band image using the subaru telescope equipped with a nir camera , cisco . with about 10 hours of net integration under the condition of 0.3 - 0.6 arcsec seeing \n , we reached to the depth of @xmath5 as the peak of the counts of the detected galaxies .    using the data , combined with the archived hst data taken in the wfpc2 @xmath6 as well as nicmos @xmath7 bands \n , we studied the ( i ) rest - frame optical morphology of the galaxies at @xmath8 , ( 2 ) stellar mass distribution of high - redshift galaxies , and ( 3 ) correlation between galaxy properties with the stellar mass . \n figure 1 shows the subaru @xmath0-band image together with the hst @xmath9-band images . \n there is no clear hubble sequence for galaxies at @xmath10 . \n the morphological feature seen in the hst wfpc2 images are well recognized in the subaru @xmath0-band image . \n figure 2 shows the obtained stellar mass distribution for the @xmath0-band selected galaxies between @xmath11 and 4.5 . \n this is obtained by fitting the hst @xmath12 and subaru @xmath0-band photometric data by the stellar evolutionary synthesis models ( gissel96 ; buruzual and charlot 1993 ) changing the star - formation history , imf , age , extinction , etc ( papovich et al . \n 2001 , shapley et al . \n the filled circles show the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift and those only with photometric redshift are by the open circles . \n we note that the stellar mass of the hdf - n @xmath0-selected galaxies are typically very small , in the range between @xmath13-@xmath14 @xmath15 .    in figure 3 , we present the possible correlation between stellar - mass and the rest - frame @xmath16 color for the galaxies \n there are few massive ( in stellar mass ) galaxies with t he bluest color and the massive galaxies tend to have redder @xmath16 color . \n if the rest @xmath16 color represents the age difference , then massive objects tend to have rather old average age , which may imply that the star - formation in these galaxies have been occurred rather successively , may be through the merging or assembly process . \n we also obtained moderately deep @xmath17 and @xmath0-band images at the field of a radio galaxy 53w002 at z=2.4 where pascarelle et al . \n ( 1996 ) discovered a dozen of emission - line objects and candidates using the hst wfpc2 intermediate - band image . \n keel et al . \n ( 1999 ) also discovered that the field lies in the high - density region of strong emission line objects from the ground - base narrow - band images . \n we studied ( i ) the rest - frame optical properties of the emission - line selected objects and ( ii ) surface density of old quiescent galaxies at the redshift in the field using the subaru data combined with the hst wfpc2 and nicmos archive data . \n the detailed results are presented in yamada et al . \n ( 2001 ) . in brief summary \n , many of the emission - line objects are faint in nir wavelength and so they are intrinsically compact and small objects dominated by the on - going star formation , and there are few developed quiescent galaxies that are older than @xmath18 gyr in the field . \n the detailed discussion about the mass of the radio galaxy 53w002 itself based on the subaru ohs and cisco spectra is presented in motohara et al . \n ( 2001 ) . \n figure 4 shows the @xmath19 color - magnitude diagram of the @xmath0-selected galaxies in the field of 53w002 ( filled circles ) . \n we also noticed a somewhat conspicuous change of the color distribution at @xmath20 . while the brighter objects show the colors distributed over the expected color rang for old and young galaxies at @xmath21 , below @xmath20 , \n most of the galaxies have blue colors ( @xmath22 ) and a small fraction have further red colors ( @xmath23 ) . \n there are few galaxies with intermediate color range and thus there is a conspicuous color gap or void in the diagram . \n this trend is also seen in the @xmath24 vs @xmath4 diagram ( yamada et al . \n then we compare the color - magnitude distribution on these two fields . \n the data for the objects in hdf - n are shown by the open squares in figure 4 , and strikingly , the color - magnitude distributions in the two fields are quite similar , although faint red population is not seen in hdf - n . \n it suggests that this kind of color - magnitude distribution is a typical aspect of the universe if not an average .    what causes the conspicuous bluing of the @xmath25 colors ? \n similar trend has in fact been reported by previous authors ( cowie et al . \n 1995 , mccraken et al . \n 2000 , gardner 1995 , sarraco et al . \n 2001 , but see sarraco et al . \n we found that at least two phenomena are responsible for the distribution , namely , ( i ) deficit of intrinsically faint ( @xmath26 ) red galaxies at intermediate redshift ( z > 0.5 - 1 ) , and ( ii ) deficit of red galaxies including luminous ones at @xmath27 . \n this can be well recognized by comparing the data with the passive evolutionary models for the color - magnitude relation in the coma cluster ( kodama et al . \n 1998 ) that are also shown if figure 4 . \n three lines represent the tracks of passively - evolving galaxies that are formed at @xmath28 and have @xmath29 at present epoch . \n the cosmology is @xmath30=1 , @xmath31=0.3 , @xmath32=0.7 , and @xmath33=70 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 .    for the galaxies in hdf - n , we have the data of spectroscopic and photometric redshift . \n we can see clear deficit of faint red galaxies for those between @xmath35 and @xmath36 as shown in figure 5 . \n this is quite puzzling and interesting phenomena , since it can not be explained by simple field - to - field variation effects because there are a certain number of luminous red galaxies at the same redshift . \n the number density of low - mass objects are expected to be larger than that of the luminous objects since the local luminosity function have exponential cut - off at the luminous end at any band . \n our result may imply that we rarely see the less massive galaxies that are dominated by old - stellar population at the intermediate redshift where old massive galaxies exist . \n it may be related to the negative faint - end of the local e / s0 luminosity function . \n kajisawa and yamada ( 2001 ) investigated a complete volume - limited sample of galaxies with @xmath37 up to z=2 in the hdf - n . based on their careful morphological classification as well as evaluation of the possible uncertainty in photometric redshift , they concluded that the number density of early - type galaxies in hdf - n have very conspicuous decrease above z=1 . \n so the deficit of red galaxies at @xmath38 seen in figure 4 may not be surprising although we still do not fully understand why such rapid change of the number density is observed at @xmath39 after considering the possible effects of field - to - field variation and dust extinction , etc . \n we are planning to conduct more extended deep nir and optical survey with subaru to fully resolve these questions . \n bruzual a. , g.  & charlot , s.  1993 , apj , 405 , 538 cowie , l.  l. , hu , e.  m. , & songaila , a.  1995 , aj , 110 , 1576 dickinson , m.  2000 , royal society of london philosophical transactions series , 358 , 2001 gardner , j.  p. , cowie , l.  l. , & wainscoat , r.  j.  1993 , apjl , 415 , l9 kajisawa , m.  & yamada , t.  2001 , pasj , 53 , 833 keel , w.  c. , cohen , s.  h. , windhorst , r.  a. , & waddington , i.  1999 , aj , 118 , 2547 kodama , t. , arimoto , n. , barger , a.  j. , & aragon - salamanca , a.  1998 , a$a , 334 , 99 mccracken , h.  j. , metcalfe , n. , shanks , t. , campos , a. , gardner , j.  p. , & fong , r.  2000 , mnras , 311 , 707 motohara , k.  et al . \n 2001 , pasj , 53 , 459 pascarelle , s.  m. , windhorst , r.  a. , keel , w.  c. , scoville , n. , & armus , l.  1996 , american astronomical society meeting , 189 , 8302 papovich , c. , dickinson , m. , & ferguson , h.  c.  2001 , apj , 559 , 620 saracco , p. , giallongo , e. , cristiani , s. , dodorico , s. , fontana , a. , iovino , a. , poli , f. , & vanzella , e.  2001 , a&a , 375 , 1 saracco , p. , dodorico , s. , moorwood , a. , buzzoni , a. , cuby , j .- \n g . , & lidman , c.  1999 , a&a , 349 , 751 shapley , a.  e. , steidel , c.  c. , adelberger , k.  l. , dickinson , m. , giavalisco , m. , & pettini , m.  2001 , apj , 562 , 95 yamada , t. et al . \n 2001 , pasj , 53 , 1119 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3345153121348, "RequestID": "70c67e5c169444bdb53d36729bcb58df", "TotalTokens": 2815}
{"ContextTokens": 3921, "GeneratedTokens": 311, "SynthesizedBody": "it was firstly proposed by s. hod that the scalar field can have real bound states in the near - extremal kerr black hole @xcite . soon later \n , it was reported in @xcite that massive scalar fields can form bound states around kerr black holes by using the numerical method to solve the scalar field equation in the background . \n this bound states are the stationary scalar configurations in the black hole backgrounds , which are regular at the horizon and outside . \n they are named as scalar clouds . \n more importantly , it was shown that the backreaction of clouds can generate a new family of kerr black holes with scalar hair @xcite . \n it is suggested that whenever clouds of a given matter field can be found around a black hole , in a linear analysis , there exists a fully non - linear solution of new hairy black hole correspondingly . \n however , it requires that the field originating clouds yields a time independent energy momentum tensor . \n generally , the field should be complex , and have a factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the superradiance critical frequency . \n for instance , real scalar fields can give rise to clouds but not hairy black holes @xcite . \n so , it seems that the studies of scalar clouds in the linear level are very important for us to find the hairy black holes in the non - linear level . \n this subject has attracted a lot of attention recently @xcite . \n generally speaking , the existence of stationary bound states of matter fields in the black hole backgrounds requires two necessary conditions . \n the first is that the matter fields should undergo the classical superradiant phenomenon @xcite in the black hole background . \n this condition can be satisfied by the bosonic fields in the rotating black holes or the charged scalar fields in the charged black holes @xcite . \n when the frequencies of these matter fields @xmath11 are smaller than the superradiant critical frequency @xmath10 , there are time growing quasi - bound states . \n when @xmath12 , the fields are time decaying . \n so , the scalar clouds exists at the boundary between these two regimes , i.e. the frequencies of the fields are taken as the superradiant critical frequency @xmath10 . for the rotating black holes , the critical frequency @xmath10 is @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal index and @xmath2 is the horizon angular velocity . while for the charged black holes , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charge of scalar field , and @xmath5 is the horizon electrostatic potential . \n the second one is there should be a potential well outside the black hole horizon in which the bound states can be trapped . \n this potential well may be provided by the mass term of the field , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass of the scalar field . however , \n sometimes the artificial boundary conditions can also play the same role .    in this paper , we will study the scalar clouds in a spherically symmetric and charged background . \n specifically , we will consider the charged scalar field in the backgrounds of the charged stringy black holes . at first sight \n , it seems that the massive scalar field can form the clouds in this background . \n however , it is proved that the the massive charged scalar field is stable in this background and there is no superradiant instability @xcite . to generate the superradiant instability @xcite \n , the mirror - like boundary condition should be imposed according to the black hole bomb mechanism @xcite . \n the analytical and the numerical studies on this subject can be found in @xcite and @xcite . correspondingly , the scalar clouds are only possible with the mirror - like boundary condition . using the numerical method \n , we will study the dynamics of the massless charged scalar field satisfying the frequency condition @xmath3 and the mirror - like boundary condition . \n we will show that , for the specific set of black hole and scalar field parameters , the clouds are only possible for the specific mirror locations @xmath6 . \n it will be shown that the analytical results of mirror location @xmath6 for the clouds are perfectly coincide with the numerical results . \n in addition , we will show that the scalar clouds are also possible when the mirror locations are close to the horizon . \n at last , we will provide an analytical calculation of the specific mirror locations @xmath6 for the scalar clouds in the @xmath8 regime .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii \n , we will present the background geometry of charged string black hole and the dynamic equation of the scalar field . in \n particularly , we will give the superradiant condition and the boundary condition of this black hole - mirror system . \n in sec.iii , we describe the numerical procedure to solve the radial equation under the certain boundary condition . in this section , \n the numerical results are also illustrated . \n some general discussion on the numerical results are also followed . in sec . \n iv , an analytical calculation of the mirror radius @xmath6 for scalar clouds in @xmath8 regime is present . the conclusion is appeared in sec . \n we shall consider a massless charged scalar field minimally coupled to the charged stringy black hole with the mirror - like boundary condition . \n the black hole is a static spherical symmetric charged black holes in low energy effective theory of heterotic string theory in four dimensions , which is firstly found by gibbons and maeda in @xcite and independently found by garfinkle , horowitz , and strominger in @xcite a few years later . \n the metric is given by @xmath16 and the electric potential and the dilaton field @xmath17 the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass and the electric charge of the charged stringy black hole , respectively . \n the event horizon of black hole is located at @xmath20 . \n the area of the sphere approaches to zero when @xmath21 . \n therefore , the sphere surface of the radius @xmath21 is singular . when @xmath22 , this singular surface is surrounded by the event horizon . \n in this paper , we will always assume the cosmic censorship hypothesis , i.e. we will only consider the black hole with the parameters satisfying the condition @xmath22 . \n the dynamics of the charged scalar field is then governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath23 where @xmath4 denotes the charge of the scalar field . by taking the ansatz of the scalar field @xmath24 , where @xmath11 is the conserved energy of the mode , \n @xmath25 is the spherical harmonic index , and @xmath1 is the azimuthal harmonic index with @xmath26 , one can deduce the radial wave equation in the form of @xmath27 where we have introduced a new function @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the potential function is given by @xmath31    the superradiant condition of the charged scalar field is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electric potential at the horizon@xcite . \n it is proved in @xcite that the massive charged scalar field is stable in this black hole background . to have superradiant instability \n , we should impose the mirror - like boundary condition @xcite . in order to study the bound states , \n we shall focus on the critical case that the scalar frequency equals to the superradiant critical frequency , i.e. @xmath34    to solve the radial equation ( 5 ) , we should impose the following boundary conditions , which are given by @xmath35 the first line indicates that the scalar field is regular near the horizon and the second line implies that the system is placed in a perfectly reflecting cavity . \n the numerical methods employed in this problem are based on the shooting method , which is also called the direct integration ( di ) method @xcite . \n it is shown that the di method is specially suited to find stationary field configuration with the mirror - like boundary condition . \n firstly , near the event horizon @xmath20 , we require the radial function is regular and expand the radial function @xmath36 as a generalized power series in terms of @xmath37 as have done in the first line of eq.(9 ) . because the radial equation is linear \n , we can take @xmath38 without loss of generality . substituting expansion of the radial wave function into the radial equation ( 5 ) \n , we can solve the coefficient @xmath39 order by order in terms of @xmath37 . \n we have only considered six terms in the expansion . \n the @xmath39s can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath40 , which are not exhibited here . \n then , we can integrate the radial equation ( 5 ) from @xmath41 and stop the integration at the radius of the mirror . in this procedure \n , we have taken the small @xmath42 as @xmath43 \n . the procedure can be repeated by varying the input parameters @xmath40 until the mirror - like boundary condition @xmath44 is reached with the desired precision . \n we can use a numerical root finder to search the location of the mirror that support the stationary scalar configuration . \n we have found that , for the given input parameters @xmath40 , scalar clouds exist for a discrete set of @xmath6 , which is labeled by the quantum number @xmath45 of nodes of the radial function @xmath36 . \n firstly , we make a comparison of the numerical and analytical results . from the analytical result eq.(35 ) in ref.@xcite , one can obtain the mirror radius that supports scalar cloud can be approximately given by @xmath46 we have labeled the @xmath47-th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath48 as @xmath49 . \n the numerical results show that this `` quantum number '' is closely connected with the nodes number @xmath45 of the radial function @xmath36 towards the simple relation @xmath50 . \n it should be noted that this analytical expression for the mirror radius is only valid for the case of @xmath7 . with the condition @xmath7 \n , the asymptotic expansion matched method can be employed to solve the radial equation approximately @xcite . in fig.(1 ) , we have displayed the analytical results and the numerical results of the mirror location @xmath6 in terms of the black hole charge @xmath19 . here \n , we do not consider the naked singularity spacetime , so that the value range of black hole charge @xmath19 is @xmath51 $ ] , where we have fixed the black hole mass as @xmath52 . \n it is shown that the analytical results of mirror location @xmath6 for the clouds are perfectly coincide with the numerical results , even in the region where the analytical approximation is unapplicable . \n when @xmath53 , the analytical approximation is always precise in all range of @xmath19 . \n when @xmath54 , the analytical results have obvious difference with the numerical results only for large @xmath19 .    in fig.(2 ) , we have drawn the mirror location @xmath6 that support the scalar cloud as a function of the black hole charge @xmath19 for various values of node number @xmath45 of the radial function . \n it is observed that , when the black hole charge @xmath19 increases , we need to place the reflecting mirror more closer to the horizon in order to have a scalar cloud . when the node number @xmath45 of radial function increases , the plotted lines become away from the axis . \n this observation is coincide with the analytical result ( 10 ) in the regime of @xmath7 .    in fig.(3 ) and ( 4 ) , we display the mirror location @xmath6 as a function of the black hole charge @xmath19 for various different @xmath25 and @xmath4 \n . we can observe that , the lines become far away from the axis when increasing @xmath25 , while the lines become more closer to the axis when increasing the scalar charge @xmath4 . \n this is also expected from the analytical result ( 10 ) . \n in addition , fig.(3 ) and ( 4 ) together with fig.(2 ) show that , when @xmath55 , @xmath56 . \n this indicates that there is no massless scalar cloud for schwarzschild black hole with the mirror - like boundary condition @xcite , even thought it is possible for massive scalar fields in schwarzschild black hole to have arbitrarily long - lived quasi - bound states @xcite . \n we also consider the radial dependence of the massless scalar clouds . in fig.(5 ) and ( 6 ) , we have fixed the mirror radius as @xmath57 . \n we can solve the radial equation numerically and obtain a discrete set of black hole charge @xmath19 which is labeled by the node number @xmath45 of the radial wave equation . \n then we can integrate the radial equation for the fixed node numbers and obtain the corresponding numerical solutions of the radial wave functions . \n it is shown that the radial profile have the typical forms of standing waves with the fixed boundary conditions . \n we have also calculated the case that @xmath58 . \n the results is not present here . \n the general form of the radial wave function is similar to the profiles in fig.(5 ) .    in fig.(7 ) \n , we consider the case that the mirror location is very close to the horizon . \n we take the mirror radius as @xmath59 . from our previous analytical and numerical work on the superradiant instability of scalar field in the background of the charged stringy black hole plus mirror system , we need a large scalar field charge @xmath4 . here , we set @xmath60 . \n we can see that , the scalar field can be bounded by the reflecting mirror very near the horizon to form the clouds . the radial wave function in this case have the similar profiles as fig.(5 ) and ( 6 ) . \n in the above numerical calculations , we find the radial equation becomes hard to integrate when the scalar charge @xmath4 is large . \n so it is important to make an analytical study of the stationary charged scalar clouds in the @xmath8 regime . in this section \n , we will give an analytical expression of special mirror radius @xmath6 in @xmath8 limit , for which the charged scalar field can be confined to form stationary cloud configuration . \n following @xcite , it is convenient to introduce new dimensionless variables @xmath61 in terms of which the radial equation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath62r=0\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have submit the superradiance critical frequency @xmath3 in the above equation . \n this equation can be solved by bessel function in the double limit @xmath63 in this asymptotic regime , the radial equation can be reduced to @xmath64 the solution is then given by the bessel function of the first kind @xmath65 i.e. , the stationary scalar field is then described by the above function . by taking account to the mirror - like boundary condition @xmath66 , we can obtain the special mirror radius @xmath6 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath45th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath69 . from this expression \n , we can see that , when @xmath70 , the reflecting mirror should be placed very near the horizon to form the cloud configuration . \n this is consistent with the near horizon condition @xmath71 . \n in summary , in this paper , we have studied the massless scalar clouds in the charged stringy black holes with the mirror - like boundary conditions . \n the scalar clouds are stationary bound states satisfying the superradiant critical frequency @xmath3 . \n the scalar clouds in rotating black holes @xcite can be heuristically interpreted in terms of a mechanical equilibrium between the black hole - cloud gravitational attraction and angular momentum driven repulsion . for the charged black hole cases , \n the charged clouds can not be formed because gravitational attraction and electromagnetic repulsion can not reach equilibrium @xcite . \n additional mirror should be placed at special location to reflect the charged scalar wave . \n we show that , for the specific set of black hole and scalar field parameters , the clouds are only possible for the specific mirror location @xmath6 . \n for example , for the fixed parameters of black hole and scalar field @xmath72 , the discrete set of the mirror location @xmath6 is characterized by the node number @xmath45 of the radial wave function . \n it is shown that , the analytical results of mirror location @xmath6 for the clouds are perfectly coincide with the numerical results in the region of @xmath7 . \n however , the agreement becomes less impressive for @xmath73 values . \n in addition , we also show that the massless scalar clouds are also possible when the mirror locations are very close to the horizon . at last , \n we present an analytical calculation of the specific mirror locations @xmath6 for the scalar clouds in the @xmath8 regime . \n the authors would like to thank dr . \n hongbao zhang for useful discussion on the numerical methods . \n this work was supported by nsfc , china ( grant no . \n 11205048 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3375181204729, "RequestID": "1372964c6a34443d881b8f472c5fc532", "TotalTokens": 4232}

{"ContextTokens": 4026, "GeneratedTokens": 116, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum mechanics and general relativity are core physics theories . intense research is performed today to obtain a unified theory which will address the current incompatibilities between the two theories . \n it is conceivable that one or both of the theories would have to be generalized in order to obtain a coherent theory of nature . \n this paper attempts to eliminate an entire class of potential quantum mechanics generalizations that were proposed to address closed timelike curves ( ctc s ) , or  time machines \" which occur naturally in general relativity . \n in special relativity causality holds due to the hyperbolic nature of the minkowski metric that clearly separates past from future . in general relativity however , because the einstein equations are local equations and space - time can be curved by matter , one can construct solutions that exhibit closed timelike curves on a global scale . \n there are a surprisingly large number of such solutions @xcite , and here is only a partial list : van stockum spacetime @xcite , gdel s rotating universe @xcite , tipler s cylinders @xcite , kerr geometries @xcite , wheeler wormhole @xcite , morris - thorne traversable wormholes @xcite , gott s infinite cosmic strings @xcite , and alcubierre s  warp drive \" spacetime @xcite . \n thus ctcs can not be easily discarded as unphysical solutions . \n it is not hard to imagine paradoxes created by time travel . \n let us start by reviewing the usual problems of closed causal loops . \n there are only two known classes of time travel paradoxes : the grandfather paradox , and the creation of information from nothing .    in the grandfather paradox \n , a time traveler goes back in time and prevents his grandfather to meet his grandmother , thus preventing his own birth . in the information paradox , \n a person is handed the blue - prints of a time machine by its older self , constructs the machine and use it to hand himself the blue - prints . who invented the blue - prints ? \n the grandfather paradox is usually encountered in classical mechanics . \n a typical philosophical argument against ctcs is  free will \" : when i go back in time it is my free will to kill my younger self . \n the  free - will \" counter - argument is as follows : it is my free will to walk on the ceiling , but the laws of physics prevent it and in the same way when i want to complete an inconsistent ctc the laws of physics would prevent it no matter how hard i try . \n all i can achieve is a consistent ctc @xcite . \n since  free - will \" is a fuzzy philosophical concept , to make the problem mathematically tractable , it is usual to consider the collision of billiard balls at the mouth of a wormhole . \n a well known general relativity solution exhibiting time travel is the wormhole solution . \n a spherically symmetric and static traversable wormhole is represented by the following spacetime metric : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath3 @xcite . \n acceleration of one of the wormhole mouths can introduce a time delay which transforms the wormhole into a time machine . \n in this case we have to address the  polchinski paradox\"@xcite . \n consider that a billiard ball falls through a wormhole , travels back in time , and collides with its younger self , preventing it to fall in the wormhole in the first place . \n similar paradoxes have been obtained by rama and sen@xcite when they considered collisions of objects of different mass . \n there is only one way to avoid those paradoxes : eliminate the initial conditions that can lead to them@xcite . \n a self consistent collision would look like the interaction shown in fig . \n [ figure6 ] .        restricting initial conditions is very disturbing , because no such mechanism is known in the macroscopic world . \n just the mere presence of a ctc region in our causal future would have consequences here and now . \n we may not be visited by time travelers from the future because we are uninteresting , but nobody has yet observed any evidence of restricted initial conditions . \n elementary particles can be accelerated very precisely in any direction one wants . \n originally it was suggested that quantum mechanics may play a role in achieving the selection of the appropriate initial conditions @xcite and cure the classical multiplicity of solutions ( which may also include inconsistent collisions ) . \n for example , by performing a sum - over - consistent - histories in a wkb approximation we may obtain only the correct and unique initial condition corresponding to the consistent self - interaction . \n it is true that a final theory of quantum mechanics in curved space - time does not exist yet , and maybe close to the wormhole mouth new physical laws may be at play . \n the problem is that the world line of the billiard ball originates far away from the wormhole in flat space - time where regular physics is applicable . \n now , however unlikely , assume that such restrictions are somehow in place , due to a future , yet undiscovered , unified theory . \n are ctcs compatible with quantum mechanics ? \n first , the grandfather paradox does not occur in quantum mechanics because in quantum mechanics one encounters qbits . \n the classical contradiction could coexist in a superposition of quantum states@xcite , and the only way to get a real contradiction is if summing over all states the total probability is no longer one . therefore the contradiction would manifest itself as a unitarity problem @xcite . propagating along a ctc , the wavefunction can become causality trapped . \n when the probability to detect the particle outside the ctc region is more than one , this corresponds to the paradox of creating information from nothing . when the probability is smaller than one , then part of the original physical system becomes causally trapped inside the ctc region in a cyclical history that repeats itself forever . \n but the problem is even worse . \n quantum mechanics as it is known is incompatible with ctcs as pointed out by jacobson@xcite : there are ambiguities in computing expectation values . \n this is expected if one has non - unitary evolution since the cauchy problem is ill defined . \n several possible generalizations for quantum mechanics were proposed by hartle@xcite , anderson@xcite , and fewster@xcite . \n one may argue that those generalizations may have objectionable feature like the fact that the presence of a ctc region in our causal future can imply measurable departures from today s predictions of standard quantum mechanics . \n we have already encountered those features in the classical physics in the form of restriction to initial conditions , and the fact the free will may only be an illusion . if the ctc region is well ahead in our causal future , then the measurable effects of those departures from standard quantum mechanics and the usual classical physics may be negligible . to be able to reject those generalizations we need to investigate additional consequences of those theories . \n for example hawking showed that quantum coherence is lost@xcite in a ctc and therefore one can not gain any information from time travelers from the future . \n but while time travel may be of no value to gain the knowledge of the future , this is no argument to reject time travel altogether . \n also we can construct non - contradictory quantum field theories on curved space - time only on global hyperbolic spaces@xcite . \n again , the lack of our current knowledge does not constitute a proof that a future , yet undiscovered , unified theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics may not be able to provide the correct generalization of quantum mechanics and the justification of the initial condition selection . \n there is yet another reason to believe that time travel is impossible as pointed by hawking in his `` chronology protection conjecture''@xcite . \n the vacuum polarization effects will get amplified by a ctc region resulting in a gravitational back - reaction that will destroy the ctc region . \n since we lack a unified theory , we can not just base the rejection of time travel on semi - classical approximations . \n as a counter example visser showed that a roman ring of wormholes can create a time machine without stability problems @xcite .    a way to solve the paradoxes of time travel \n is to demand a global self consistency condition that will guarantee that all self - interactions are consistent @xcite . \n the laws of physics are usually defined locally and the fundamental reason for this is that on a curved manifold , the tangent space is defined at each point . \n local laws seem to prevent the existence of any global constraints . \n there are two possible counter arguments to the local physical laws argument . \n first , quantum mechanics is non - local . \n second , consider the motion in phase space or that of an incompressible fluid . in this case closed trajectories do form and there are no local contradictions . \n this is actually a very intuitive way to picture what should happen on ctc region that is globally consistent .    for the first counter - argument \n , we will investigate below the consequences of a global self - consistency principle and find that it leads to non - renormalizable theories . \n for the second counter - argument , one can not define a metric on a phase space . \n there is much more local freedom on a metric manifold , than on a symplectic manifold . on a symplectic manifold \n one can define only a skew - symmetric bilinear form and have only global invariants . in phase space \n one can not have arbitrary changes of coordinates , because that would violate hamilton s equations . \n let us consider more and more violent collisions of the billiard ball in the polchinski - type collision . \n at some point , the billiard balls will break and generate a paradox . \n equivalently , one can consider repeating the consistent self - interaction with the same initial conditions , but with more and more brittle billiard balls of the same mass and shape . \n one can even consider manufacturing billiard balls made of @xmath4 pieces , with a small explosive in the middle that will break the ball in its constituent pieces during any collision . \n the key point is that one repeats the experiment with all those balls , preserving the same initial conditions corresponding to a self - consistent interaction .    with those preparations , \n let us assume that the billiard ball is made of two equal halves ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) that are loosely connected ( by a weak material ) and will separate if during the collision the momentum transfer in the center of mass referential system exceeds a particular threshold value . \n now repeat the collision experiment with the same initial condition but with increased brittleness ( reduced threshold for separation ) of the billiard balls of the same shape and mass . from the point of view of a global self - consistency principle , nothing is changed .    in one of the repeated experiments , at some point the momentum transfer is going to exceed the threshold value in a center of mass coordinate system and the billiard ball will break . \n one can enforce the pieces separation after breaking for example by adding a positive electric charge to each piece . \n after the collision , there are three possible outcomes :    1 . \n no piece enters the wormhole , 2 . \n only one piece enters the wormhole and causes the earlier collision , 3 . \n the two pieces @xmath5 and @xmath6 remain together and follow same self - consistent trajectory \n .    if no piece enters the wormhole , then the earlier collision did not take place and we have a paradox . \n if only one piece causes the collision , because it s mass is half of the original billiard ball , the momentum transfer falls below the separation threshold , and no longer causes the breaking , resulting in another paradox . \n only if the billiard ball pieces stay together are all paradoxes avoided . \n this implies that the self - consistency principle requires infinite strength to maintain cohesion for _ all _ billiard balls participating in a self - consistent interaction and this is just not true . \n the global consistency condition imposes an impossible unphysical demand on the local physics of collision which can also happen far away from the wormhole mouths where standard physics is applicable .    when indestructible elementary particles are used instead of billiard balls , the contradictions are not avoided because at high enough energies other particles are going to be generated . as other particles \n are generated , the energy of the original particle is reduced below the generation threshold thus preventing the generation in the first place and again a contradiction ensues .    _ \n if even in classical physics one encounters infinities , wherever the correspondence principle is valid there is no hope to obtain a renormalizable quantum theory in curved space - time containing ctcs . _    the only possible escape of the conclusion is if the correspondence principle may not hold and classical physics can not emerge from the quantum world . \n this may be the case at plank scale where the regular space time manifold may cease to be well defined . in this range \n we do need a unified theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics . \n we can now conclude that closed causal loops are forbidden in general in nature in the range of the validity of the correspondence principle . \n quantum mechanics can only be defined on global hyperbolic manifolds and all general relativity solutions exhibiting time travel are unphysical . as hawking put it , the world is indeed safe for historians . \n 99 m.  visser , _ the quantum physics of chronology protection , _ arxiv : gr -

diagonal on product basis , are reduced . \n this approach , turning the entangled state into a classical correlation , obviously offers a possible way of obtaining a classical limit of the teleportation process . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : telep ] the class of bipartite states in argument is described , and bennett s protocol of quantum teleportation of a qubit is summarized in a consistent density matrix formalism . \n the latter can be regarded as a special case of the treatment of e. g. @xcite or @xcite . by replacing the ideal epr pair with the states investigated , \n we obtain our main result . starting from this , \n two examples are studied in detail : in section [ sec : class ] the purely classical limit is introduced , and in section [ sec : stat ] cases between the ideal quantum teleportation and the classical limit are analyzed by examining a gedankenexperiment . \n section [ sec : concl ] summarizes the results . \n we restrict ourselves to two - level systems , and use the terminology of spin-@xmath2 particles . \n the results can be applied to any representation of qubits , e. g. for the polarization of single photon states , for which quantum teleportation is experimentally feasible @xcite . \n the spin @xmath3-component eigenstates of the particles are denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n density matrices of the bipartite systems , if not otherwise stated , are represented on the natural product state basis @xmath6 . \n we will also use the notation @xmath7 for the four bell - states .    let us examine bennett s scheme of quantum teleportation @xcite of a qubit : the sender , alice has particle 1 of @xmath2 spin in the state @xmath8 and wants to teleport it to bob . \n the upper indices of density matrices ( and other operators ) refer to the number assigned to the particles . \n they share particles 2 and 3 in a state @xmath9 as an entangled resource , and there is also a classical communication channel between them . \n alice has an ideal bell - state detector , and bob can carry out unitary transformations on particle 3 given to him . as a starting point of our investigation , let us suppose , that the state of particles 2 and 3 is described by the following density matrix : @xmath10 the lower indices in the kets indicate the number assigned to the particles . \n let @xmath11 be real parameter between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , \n thus in this case alice and bob share an epr pair . \n this is the case of ideal quantum teleportation . otherwise , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are multiplied by @xmath16 . for @xmath17 \n the density matrix is diagonal in the product state basis , describing classical statistics only . \n this state is the mixture of the product states @xmath18 . \n such a state can be generated by a _ classically stochastic _ source emitting particles with opposite spins , with equal probability of sending `` up '' and `` down '' state both for particles 2 and 3 . \n the states in equation ( [ eq : entangled ] ) may be rewritten in the bell - basis , we find @xmath19 that is , the state is a mixture of the two @xmath20 bell - states . \n the class of states examined here is a subclass of werner states ( which were examined from teleportation s point of view in references  @xcite ) where the two @xmath21 states do not occur . \n let us consider now the entire teleportation process . \n initially , the state of the whole system of the three particles is the product of the states in eqs . \n ( [ eq : instate ] ) and ( [ eq : entangled ] ) : @xmath22 alice carries out a bell - state measurement , which is described by one of the operators including projection of subsystems 1 and 2 to a bell - state , @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for one of the four bell - states , and @xmath25 is the identity operator for the hilbert - space of particle 3 . \n the result of the measurement is @xmath26 , corresponding to the @xmath26-th bell - state . \n this information is sent to bob via the classical channel . because the detection of each bell - state occurs with probability @xmath27 \n , the operator is multiplied by @xmath28 in order to preserve the norm of the state obtained . \n the state of the system after the measurement is given by applying the operator in equation  ( [ eq : bellmeas ] ) to the state in equation  ( [ eq : in123 ] ) . from this \n we obtain the state of bob s particle by tracing out in the other two particles : @xmath29 in the last step , bob has to apply a unitary transformation @xmath30 on state @xmath31 , according to alice s measurement result @xmath26 , which is the identity operator in case alice has detected @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for detecting @xmath34,@xmath35 , and @xmath36 respectively . carrying out the calculations described , we obtain our main result : the state teleported to bob reads @xmath37 it can be seen that _ the reduction of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix describing the entangled resource is inherited by the teleported state . \n _ thus teleportation acts as a phase - damping channel . \n as a first example , let us examine the case of `` teleporting '' a classical bit . \n assume , that @xmath17 , that is the density matrix describing the entangled resource is diagonal . according to ( [ eq : result ] ) , only the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix of the input state , i.e. the statistics of the measurement of the spin-@xmath3 component is preserved . \n therefore , let us suppose , that the input state in equation  ( [ eq : instate ] ) is already diagonal : @xmath38 . in this section we consider measurement of the @xmath3 components of the spins .    under these circumstances our particles can be exactly identified with classical bits . \n the states of these classical bits , denoted by @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , are identical with the basis quantum states @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the diagonal density matrix of the input quantum state describes a classical probability distribution of bit 1 . \n this is transferred into bit 3 via a classical communication channel and a _ classical _ correlation . \n the process itself can be interpreted in the following way : the source of bits 2 and 3 broadcasts correlated bit - pairs @xmath41 or @xmath42 with equal probability . \n this can be regarded as the classical limit of an epr - pair . \n bit 2 is obtained by alice , who makes a measurement , which tells whether bit 1 and 2 are the same or different . \n one can not speak of superpositions in this classical context , and therefore the two @xmath20 and the two @xmath21 bell - states coincide in this limit : the former two mean simply `` the two bits are different '' ( @xmath20-detection ) , and the latter `` the two bits are the same '' ( @xmath21-detection ) . thus the bell - state measurement degenerates to an `` exclusive or '' operation , resulting in a single bit of information , communicated to bob . \n bob has to carry out the proper transformation to regain the `` teleported '' bit . \n there is no phase of the probability amplitudes for classical probability , thus the transformations in equation  ( [ eq : u ] ) degenerate to a conditional not operation : in case of `` @xmath20 detection '' , bob has obtained bit 3 in the proper state , while in case of `` @xmath21 detection '' he has to invert bit 3 . \n finally bit 3 is left with the original value of bit 1 . \n since the values of bits 1 or 2 are irrelevant from the `` bell - state measurement '' , it is not necessary for alice to be aware of the actual value of bit 1 to be `` teleported '' . \n therefore the method works for `` teleporting '' an unknown classical bit as well , similarly to the quantum protocol .    the classical protocol described here is well known as the one - time - pad in classical cryptography @xcite . \n this is , in some sense , the classical protocol most similar to quantum teleportation . \n it is the `` teleportation '' of the ( optionally unknown ) state of a classical bit via a classical communication channel and a classical correlation . \n the classical correlation provides noise in the lack of the classical communication channel , while the classical channel itself is useless for reconstruction of the result without the correlation . \n note that instead of measuring the state of bit 1 and simply communicating its value , only a comparison with a reference has been made . \n having described the classical analogue , we may now examine @xmath43 , which interpolates between the classical and the quantum case . \n we calculate the consequence of ( [ eq : result ] ) to the result of a teleportation experiment . for simplicity , \n let us suppose , that we want to teleport the state @xmath44 , having @xmath3-component of @xmath45 , rotated by a given angle @xmath46 around the @xmath47 axis of the coordinate system . \n the operator of this rotation ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath49 @xmath50 being the first pauli - matrix , and thus we have the state @xmath51 to be teleported . according to ( [ eq : result ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 as result of the teleportation process . in order to verify the teleportation , one may measure the spin along an axis obtained by rotating the @xmath3 axis with the angle @xmath53 around the x axis . \n the probability of finding this component of the spin @xmath45 is in this case is @xmath54 for @xmath14 we obtain the familiar cosine - type result valid for ideal teleportation , @xmath55 which is equal to @xmath13 for @xmath56 , meaning perfect teleportation to any direction . for a given input state @xmath57 , the probability for finding the output in the input state after the teleportation is the fidelity of the teleportation of the input state . \n this fidelity is @xmath58.\\ ] ] in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] we have plotted this function . \n it is equal to 1 in the case of ideal teleportation . \n the basis states @xmath59 and @xmath60 are always properly teleported , as we have seen in the classical case . \n the minimum of the fidelity for any @xmath16 occurs for the equal superposition of the two basis states ( @xmath61 ) . \n the minimum value for @xmath17 is @xmath2 , expressing that the result of the measurement can be either @xmath62 or @xmath63 with equal probability , thus this state is not at all teleported . \n increasing the purity of the mixed state increases the domain of the angles in which teleportation can be regarded as reliable . \n we have studied the role of the off - diagonal density matrix elements of the entangled pair in the teleportation of a qubit . by setting these to zero , \n we have obtained the classical one - time pad cypher , as a classical limit of quantum teleportation . \n we have demonstrated the result on the behavior of statistics and fidelity of a gedankenexperiment . \n we have found , that the fidelity of the teleportation is most sensitive to the loss of the quantum entanglement in the epr pair for a state at a right angle to the quantization direction . \n this work was supported by the research fund of hungary ( otka ) under contracts nos . \n t023777 , t034484 and f032346 . t. k. acknowledges the support of the hungarian academy of sciences ( bolyai jnos kutatsi sztnd ' ij ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3400319920144, "RequestID": "993fa4c8b52b406abeb5477f5f334b71", "TotalTokens": 3663}
{"ContextTokens": 4026, "GeneratedTokens": 103, "SynthesizedBody": "in quantum systems with well - defined parities , one- and two - photon processes can not coexist due to the electric - dipole selection rule @xcite . \n however , this does not apply for quantum systems with a broken symmetry , e.g. , chiral molecules whose symmetry is broken naturally , asymmetric quantum wells , or artificial `` atoms '' with broken symmetry , in which optical transitions will be allowed between any two levels . \n recently , symmetry - broken artificial atoms @xcite in a superconducting flux qubit circuit were investigated . by biasing the external magnetic flux @xmath0 away from @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath3 is the planck constant and @xmath4 the electronic charge ) \n , the symmetries of both the potential and the interaction hamiltonian can be broken . in this case , when only the lowest three levels are considered , the flux qubit circuit is a cyclic - type ( or @xmath5-type ) system , which is different from the usual @xmath6-type ( or ladder - type ) system in which the optical dipole - selection rule does not allow a transition between the lowest and the uppermost of the three levels . by investigating \n the generalized stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap @xcite ) , one can achieve a pulse - phase - sensitive adiabatic manipulation of quantum states . \n the population can be cyclically transferred by controlling the amplitudes and/or phases of the coupling pulses . \n a cyclic system involving the coupling of nonclassical ( quantized ) optical fields has been investigated in @xcite . \n adiabatical ( or dynamical ) quantum information transfer between the collective excitations of a cyclic `` atomic '' ensemble and quantized optical fields has also been studied @xcite . \n the existence of chiral molecules is one of the fundamental broken symmetries in nature . \n chiral molecules can be modelled as being in a mirror - symmetric double - well potential @xcite : left - handed states are in the left well and right - handed ones in the right . strictly speaking , left-/right- handed states in the left / right wells are not the eigenstates of double - well potential due to the tunnelling between the left and right wells . but the tunnelling rates are usually very small , so left-/right handed states can be considered as stable eigenstates of chiral - molecule systems . \n chiral purification and discrimination @xcite of a mixture of chiral molecules are among the most important and difficult tasks in chemistry . \n the usual purification methods for chiral molecules are based on asymmetric synthesis , e.g. , gas or liquid chromatographic methods @xcite . \n methods of achieving purification solely by optical means have also been investigated theoretically @xcite . \n recently , krl _ et al . _ \n @xcite proposed an optical cyclic population transfer scheme to distinguish mixed left- and right - handed molecules . \n each kind of chiral molecule ( left - handed or right - handed ) can be modelled as a cyclic system if only the three lowest levels are considered . \n the left - handed cyclic system behaves like the right - handed one except the intrinsically - different total phases of the three rabi frequencies if three transitions are coupled to three optical fields , respectively . \n the idea was to optically transfer chiral molecules which are in their initial respective ground states to final levels at different energies . \n this population transfer was achieved by adiabatical ( or diabatical ) optically coupled processes .    in another development , \n there has been considerable interest to implement pseudo - spin dependent optically - induced gauge potentials for cold atoms to achieve a spatial separation of pseudo - spin states @xcite . based on this scheme , we recently considered consequences of the induced gauge potential in systems of cold chiral molecules that manifest themselves as a generalized stern - gerlach effect @xcite , where the orbital motion of mixed chiral molecules will be chirality - dependent and pseudo - spin - dependent . \n thus , it can be used to distinguish molecules with different chiralities , suggesting a discrimination method to separate chiral mixtures .    in this paper \n , we will use a dynamical ( rotation ) method to transfer the states of cyclic three - level systems with broken symmetry by applying ultrashort @xmath7- or @xmath8 optical pulses . \n interestingly , we can distinguish mixed left- and right - handed molecules ( in their respective ground states ) by dynamically driving them to different - energy final states . \n the general cyclic three - level system coupled with three classical optical fields respectively can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite in the rotating - wave approximation ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the energies of the states @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the frequencies of the optical fields coupling to the transition @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the rabi frequencies which can be controlled by varying the field strength @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the dipole matrix element between the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 . \n the analytic instantaneous eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions have been evaluated in refs . @xcite . at resonance , @xmath20 , \n the above hamiltonian can be rewritten in the interaction picture as @xmath21    -type ( or cyclic ) system , which is resonantly coupled to three classic optical fields with rabi frequencies @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24.,width=7,height=4 ]    the goal of this paper is to present a purely dynamic method to separate left- and right - handed chiral molecules . \n if left- and right - handed three - level cyclic molecules are driven by three optical fields , one or all of the three rabi frequencies @xmath25 for the two kinds of chiral molecules differ by a sign @xcite . \n we will specify our model by choosing the coupling strengths ( that is , rabi frequencies ) of the left-/right- handed molecules as @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28,@xmath29 ( see fig . \n [ a1 ] ) . here , the superscripts @xmath30 [ @xmath31 refer to left - handed [ right - handed ] molecules . \n we now consider an ensemble of left- and right - handed molecules prepared in their ground states @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively . \n we aim to distinguish the two kinds of molecules by transferring them to different - energy final states . \n our separation protocol consists of the following steps ( see fig . \n [ a2 ] ) :    _ step i _ : at time @xmath34 , we start with a pump pulse @xmath35 for the left - handed molecules \n . the corresponding hamiltonian will reduce to @xmath36 here we control the pulse to cause a @xmath37 rotation @xcite for the left - handed molecules , @xmath38 for the right - handed ones , the rabi frequency is @xmath39 , which leads to a @xmath40 rotation @xmath41 with the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath42    _ step ii _ : now we keep @xmath43 and add two pump pulses of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which satisfy @xmath46 hence , the hamiltonian ( [ hamil - res ] ) for the left - handed molecules reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . \n the instantaneous eigenfunctions for eq . \n ( [ hamil - d2 ] ) are @xmath50 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath51    hence , for the left - handed molecule , the corresponding time - evolution of the state is given as @xmath52 where @xmath53 . if @xmath54 is chosen to cause a rotation by @xmath7 corresponding to the transition @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 , the evolved state is @xmath57    the same treatment applies to the right - handed molecules by replacing `` l '' by `` r '' in eqs . \n ( [ hamil - d2]-[eigen - state ] ) . \n since the state @xmath58 @xmath59 is always the dark state for the hamiltonian @xmath60 , it is invariant during the @xmath7 rotation in this step . \n thus , we obtain the following state after step ii : @xmath61 for the right - handed molecules . \n _ step iii _ : \n now we keep @xmath62 and apply the pump pulse @xmath35 leading to a @xmath63 rotation for the left - handed molecules ( the corresponding rabi frequency is @xmath64 with a @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) rotation for the right - handed ones ) . \n the left - handed molecular state @xmath67 remains unchanged : @xmath68 on the other hand , the @xmath65 rotation pulse acting on the right - handed molecules will transfer the state @xmath69 to the final state @xmath70 here , the corresponding hamiltonians for the chiral molecules are again given by eqs . \n ( [ hamil - left1],[hamil - right1 ] ) , respectively .     and @xmath71 rotation pulses of three optical coupling strengths ( rabi frequencies ) . here \n , the notation @xmath72 is used to indicate a @xmath7 rotation pulse for the effective rabi frequency @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , and _ not _ for the rabi frequencies @xmath75 and @xmath45 . , width=7,height=4 ]    the above protocol , which includes several simple ultrashort rotations , will bring the initial state @xmath76 for the left - handed molecules and @xmath77 for the right - handed ones . \n the fact that differently - handed chiral molecules are transferred to different long - lived states means perfect discrimination of both kinds of chiral molecules in our idealized treatment . \n figure [ a3 ] shows an illustration of this separation procedure . \n initially , all the molecules are assumed to be in the ground state @xmath78 as shown in fig . \n [ a3](a ) . by using simple optical pulses , i.e. , switching on / off the optical fields as shown in fig . \n [ a2 ] , the two kinds of chiral molecules are dynamically transferred from the initial state @xmath78 to the final state @xmath67 and @xmath79 , respectively ( see fig .  [ \n a3](b ) ) . these different states may be separated ( see fig . \n [ a3](c ) ) using a variety of energy - dependent processes , such as ionization , followed by extraction of the ions by an electric field as suggested in ref . \n @xcite .     before the coupling to the optical fields ( here \n the optical fields can be coplanar or not ) . \n the labels of spin - up [ down ] refer to the left- [ right- ] handed molecules . \n ( b ) after driving the optical pulses in the protocol as shown in fig . \n [ a2 ] , the chiral molecules are dynamically transferred to the final state @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively . \n the dark [ bright ] spheres indicate the states @xmath82 [ @xmath83 . \n ( c ) the different - handed chiral molecules may now be separated , e.g. , by ionization or choosing different trapping potentials for different energy levels.,width=283,height=151 ]    the scheme proposed here is different from the generalized stern - gerlach effect @xcite in the following respects : ( i ) there is no need to invoke the spatial motion of the molecules in the scheme presented here ; it is enough to consider their internal dynamics . \n ( ii ) the internal degree of freedom of a three - level system is reduced to the lower two ( pseudo - spin ) states in @xcite by assuming a large detuning . here \n , we discuss the molecular dynamics in the space of three levels with all the optical coupling resonant to the corresponding transition . \n ( iii ) different chiral molecules can be separated spatially ; here , we only focus on how to distinguish different chiral molecules according to the different final states as in ref .  @xcite . \n the present protocol is also different from the methods described in refs . \n @xcite , where molecules with different chirality are distinguished by adiabatical processes via controlling three overlapping optical fields . \n the dynamical rotation method proposed here provides another possibility to distinguish mixed chiral molecules by using several simple optical ultrashort pulses . \n in contrast to the scheme described in ref . \n @xcite , we assume the molecules to be pre - oriented ( similar to refs . \n @xcite ) in order to ensure that the rabi frequencies are identical for all the molecules in the mixture ( up to a phase factor ) when coupling to a same optical field .    in the present separation scheme as well as similar ones @xcite , the molecular temperature \n is assumed to be low enough such that the molecules are prepared in the ground state initially . \n we neglect finite - temperature effects and molecular interactions .    in the protocol described above , all three kinds of optical fields couple resonantly to the molecular transitions . \n that means the optical fields satisfy the energy conservation condition @xmath84 . \n this resembles sum - frequency generation in nonlinear media @xcite , which requires energy conservation as well as momentum conservation ( along a certain direction ) . \n sum - frequency generation is one of the techniques used to probe ( but not separate ) molecular chirality @xcite . \n the separation protocol described in our paper is not related to sum - frequency generation and is not constrained by the momentum conservation of optical wave - vectors ( that is why the three optical fields can be coplanar or not ) . \n recently , many studies about preparing , measuring and teleporting superpositions of chiral states @xcite have appeared in the literature . in these works , \n superposition states are obtained by involving a symmetric or antisymmetric higher excited state which can couple to the left - handed or right - handed states by optical fields . in this paper \n , we aim to separate mixtures of left - handed and right - handed chiral molecules . \n so the external excited state is not introduced , and superpositions of chiral states are not considered here . \n decoherence processes are the biggest obstacle for any quantum state transfer operation . due to \n the fact that our protocol only uses dynamic ultrashort - pulse operations and does not require adiabaticity assumptions , our method will work faster and make decoherence effects less important . \n in conclusion , we have presented a protocol to separate left- and right - handed molecules . \n this protocol , which consists of several simple dynamical rotation operations of optical pulses , can be implemented on a short time scale compared with the decoherence time due to spontaneous emission . \n we would like to remark that all three kinds of optical couplings have to be used ( though not at the same time ) during the rotation operations in this separation protocol . \n physically , this is because the two kinds of chiral molecules can be distinguished only by the total phase of the three rabi frequencies ( which differ by @xmath7 ) . \n if only two kinds of optical couplings are used , the molecular system will reduce to the @xmath85- , @xmath86- or ladder - type three - level system , which can not be used to distinguish different chiralities . \n stirap is a well - studied pump - probe control scheme for manipulating the population of quantum states of atoms or molecules , see , e.g. , k. bergmann , h. theuer , and b.  w. shore , rev . \n * 70 * , 1003 ( 1998 ) . \n p. krl , i. thanopulos , and m. shapiro , phys . \n a * 72 * , 020303(r ) ( 2005 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3372, "GeneratedTokens": 134, "SynthesizedBody": "most maps of large scale structure use redshifts of galaxies to indicate position . \n such maps are known to have distortions , the most familiar of which are the so - called fingers - of - god , elongated artifacts pointing at the observer and caused by velocities of galaxies within clusters . on scales larger than a typical finger - of - god , \n the maps show other features , such as great connected walls of galaxies . on these scales , are redshift - space maps essentially accurate representations of the real - space distribution ? can they be treated as fuzzy photographs of the universe ?    in this paper \n we show that the answer may be _ \n no_. a spectacular feature seen in redshift surveys \n the curving `` great wall '' of galaxies which together with the pisces - perseus chain seems to form a giant ring encircling us ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite)may get its visual punch from a redshift - space distortion we call the bulls - eye effect .    using an n - body simulation \n , we find that structures perpendicular to the line of sight are enhanced in redshift - space , due both to the finger - of - god distortion and a distortion caused by infall . \n we can further strengthen the effect by applying a magnitude limit . \n the result is that any observer concludes , erroneously , that he or she is encircled by galaxy walls in a bulls - eye pattern . \n when peculiar velocities are small and uncorrelated , redshift maps are just fuzzier versions of real - space maps . \n however , large correlated velocities produce striking artifacts . \n one example of such an artifact is the finger - of - god produced by the random orbital motions of galaxies in a bound cluster . \n another artifact , not as well known but important for this paper , is caused by the inward flow of material toward either a single center or an extended region . \n such a flow produces an artifact because infalling material on the near - side of the accreting center or extended region has peculiar velocity away from the observer and material on the far - side has peculiar velocity toward the observer . \n therefore , in redshift - space , the near - side is moved back and the far - side moved forward , squashing the material together along the radial direction . \n for example , studies show that spherical infall produces an extended saucer - like artifact face on to the observer , encircling the cluster finger - of - god like an outspread skirt or tutu ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ps ) . \n these results are generalizable to aspherical flows . \n it is easy to show that _ any _ infall field will produce a similar artifact : see the discussion of fig .  1 in ps . \n kaiser ( 1987 ) speculates that infall distortions may be `` well able to account for '' connected features seen in redshift surveys . \n likewise , the schematic fig .  6 of ps shows how an observer in a universe with many clusters might see a bulls - eye pattern in redshift - space . \n more realistic scenarios than the isolated cluster model can produce an even stronger effect : bulls - eyes are present ( but uncommented on ) in figures presented by park(1990 ) and ryden & melott ( 1996 ; hereafter , rm ) . \n weinberg & gunn ( 1990a;b ) comment on `` hints of circular symmetry '' visible in their plots ( which show the effect less clearly ) , but attribute it to the selection function . as we will show below , the full bulls - eye effect is a true distortion in redshift - space , and the selection function plays only a secondary role . \n we wish to emphasize that walls and filaments are _ real _ features that arise from long - wave motion producing `` pancakes '' by gravitational instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and so do not require additional explanation such as in kaiser ( 1987 ) . on the other hand \n , we find that redshift effects selectively enhance pancakes forming perpendicular to the line of sight , accelerating their apparent collapse . the toy model of an oblate spheroid may be useful here . \n collapsing with its short axis along the line of sight , it may look very thin and dense in redshift space . with short axis perpendicular to the line of sight , \n redshift distortions make it look smaller and more nearly spherical . \n before comparing redshift surveys with simulations of gravitational clustering , the two sets of data should be transformed to the same coordinate system . \n observers usually work with selection effects in redshift - space , whereas simulations give complete information in real - space . \n since it is presently impossible to deconvolve an observed data set to a complete real - space distribution , we must simulate realistic observational constraints , as done by park ( 1990 ) and weinberg & gunn ( 1990 a;b ) . \n the simulation we choose to look at is from a set of two - dimensional studies described in detail in beacom et al . \n ( 1991 ) and kauffmann & melott ( 1992 ) . \n rm calculated the properties of voids in three simulations in real - space and redshift - space . \n of the three , the one with initial power spectrum of the form @xmath0 shows the bulls - eye effect most strongly . \n this index corresponds to @xmath1 in three dimensions , which is a reasonable approximation to the observed power spectrum over a wide range of scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for these spectra \n , displacement varies logarithmically with @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , which can cause structure to `` pile up '' . \n the main effect of the reduced dimensionality of the simulation is the absence of the occasional very long finger - of - god due to clusters like coma seen in the first cfa slice ( @xcite ) . \n figure  [ fig : twoobs](a ) shows this simulation in real - space , and fig .  [ fig : twoobs](b ) in redshift - space , as seen by two hypothetical observers whose positions are labeled on the plot . \n the simulation has periodic boundary conditions , so the figure shows the original points tiled together with copies . as in rm , \n we ve first reduced the number of particles by randomly selecting one out of every four . \n the square has a side of approximately @xmath3 mpc , where @xmath4 is the fudge factor in the hubble constant : @xmath5 , and where we let @xmath6 for convenience . \n the assumed value of @xmath4 affects only the selection function , not redshift displacement . \n the redshift - space maps made by the observers each have a radius of about @xmath7 and overlap as indicated . \n each map includes a selection function simulating the effect of a magnitude 16 limited survey . \n specifically , the luminosities of the points are assumed to obey a schechter luminosity function : @xmath8 , where we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) . \n we also assume that the `` volume '' of the observer s sample increases with distance as in a constant angle slice . \n that is , we randomly select points so that the surface density at distance @xmath11 goes as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the luminosity corresponding to the magnitude limit at the distance @xmath11 . \n note that when we apply the selection function above , we essentially treat the two - dimensional simulation as if it were a three - dimensional slab . \n this is admittedly a swindle , but we believe a not inaccurate approximation for a thin slice . \n our maps are similar in appearance to those in park ( 1990 ) , which were constructed from a three - dimensional model . due to the high resolution of our simulation , the number of points exceeds the number of galaxies that would lie in a thin slice . since we wish to show the origin of the effect as clearly as possible ( rather than compare our results with specific surveys ) , we have normalized the selection function to keep all the subset simulation particles in the region of its maximum . \n the difference between the real - space distribution in fig . \n [ fig : twoobs](a ) and the redshift - space maps in fig . \n [ fig : twoobs](b ) is readily apparent . in the first , \n the distribution of `` galaxies '' is fairly uniform , whereas in the second , the galaxies seem to lie in curving walls which roughly circle the observer , regardless of position ! why are the two maps so different ? \n figure  [ fig : unselsel ] shows the simulation from the point of view of the first observer in more detail . \n note : ( 1 ) the positions of the galaxies are distorted in redshift - space into smeared arclets concentric around the observer . \n figure  [ fig : unselsel](a ) shows the points plotted in real - space and redshift - space without the selection function . \n this pair of plots should be compared with fig .  2 of rm , which shows a similar pattern appears for an observer at the center of the original square . \n ( 2 ) the selection effect of the magnitude limit enhances arclets at the distance where the selection function peaks . \n figure  [ fig : unselsel](b ) shows the real - space and redshift - space distribution of the points when the selection function is applied . \n this time the magnitude limit is 17 , to show the effect of an increase ( compare with fig .  [ fig : twoobs ] ) \n . the selection function is picking out bulls - eye rings already existing in redshift - space : it does not _ \n produce _ the pattern , as suggested by weinberg & gunn ( 1990a;b ) . \n the mechanism underlying the bulls - eye effect is redshift - space distortion caused by peculiar velocity . \n both infall onto clusters and orbital motions within clusters contribute , as can be seen in an expanded piece of the simulation . \n figure  [ fig : wedge ] shows a @xmath14 wedge of the simulation in real - space and redshift - space , from the point of view of an observer at the center of the original square ( fig .  2 of rm ) looking north . \n it shows several points clearly :    \\1 . \n the distortion due to infall tends to empty voids and pancake galaxies on top of each other in redshift - space , perpendicular to the line of sight . note how the two filaments on the left - hand side of the wedge between 100 and 150 mpc are squashed together in redshift space . \n the finger - of - god artifacts give structures lying perpendicular to the line of sight more visual weight , by smearing the points out along the line of sight . \n a careful inspection of the loose filament running along the top of the wedge between 250 and 300  mpc reveals that points are just smeared out from their positions right on top of each other . \n furthermore , the fingers - of - god can be seen to be longer in dense regions with more tightly bound clumps . \n this correlation further increases the visual contrast . \n the bulls - eye pattern appears because only structures perpendicular to the line of sight are enhanced . \n the long filament running down the center of the wedge from 200 to 300  mpc is not particularly enhanced in redshift - space . however , \n if the observer was located to the left or right of this filament , it would appear darker and thicker than it does in this view . \n again , we reiterate that the effect is caused by both the infall compression distortion and the more subtle finger of god smearing distortion . \n we have looked at two simulations in which one or the other distortion is suppressed . in one , \n small scale clustering ( and thus fingers of god ) are suppressed : the result is a bulls - eye pattern which is not quite as striking as the ones shown here , rather like the figures in weinberg & gunn ( 1990a;b ) . in the other , \n peculiar velocities were reassigned randomly , removing infall : the result is a much more uniform pattern with only extremely weak suggestions of walls . \n note that the velocities in our simulation are not large . \n a few hundred km / s displacement is enough to produce the effect . \n in the simulation examined above both motions within clusters and flows toward clusters produce distortions in redshift - space which enhance structures perpendicular to the line of sight . \n redshift maps thus give the impression that the observer is surrounded by concentric walls of galaxies : the bulls - eye effect . \n it is not implausible that the bulls - eye effect may be responsible for the visual impact of wall - like features concentric about our position , such as the great wall of galaxies . \n we would not argue that there is no physical structure underlying these features , but that existing structure may be enhanced by a simultaneous smearing and compressing distortion as in the simulation . \n we note that a full view of the simulation in redshift - space shows multiple rings , separated by fairly uniform intervals . \n a corresponding prediction is that as the magnitude limit of magnitude complete redshift surveys is increased , other sets of walls concentric on our position but at larger distances should become apparent . \n indeed , the map produced by the las campanas survey ( @xcite ) is similar in appearance to fig . \n [ fig : unselsel](a ) above . \n we also suggest a possible relationship to other findings based on `` core - sampling '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n it is possible that the bulls - eye effect is giving a misleading impression about the nature of the large scale structure of the universe . \n the distribution of galaxy clusters and filaments may be more uniform than impressions from redshift - space maps imply . \n we wish to emphasize that our simulation only demonstrates the effect qualitatively . a detailed comparison with observational data demands \n the use of a three - dimensional simulation with a power spectrum more closely matched to that observed in the local universe . \n the spacing and intensity of this effect will depend on details of the power spectrum and mass density of the universe . \n in fact , characteristic ring spacing combined with the measured angular power spectrum should measure bulk flows and provide information on @xmath15 . \n future work should include examination of the effect with a variety of three dimensional spectra and background cosmologies . \n we wish to thank s. schneider , i. praton , s. shandarin , d. weinberg , and j. gott for helpful comments . \n alm wishes to acknowledge financial support from nasa grant nagw 3832 , the nsf epscor program , and space telescope science institute award number 6007 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3443398893591, "RequestID": "3651249f9ca44ed985e7bd55a7df9772", "TotalTokens": 3506}
{"ContextTokens": 4033, "GeneratedTokens": 211, "SynthesizedBody": "the successful idea of replacing a many  body , non  local interaction by an effective one  electron equation opened up the possibility of studying extremely complex systems with high accuracy . in this context , the success of the kohn  sham density  functional theory@xcite ( dft ) began when crucial developments in its exchange  correlation terms gave the theory predictive power to compete with well  developed wavefunction methods@xcite . \n the importance of the exchange \n correlation potentials in chemical physics has been emphasized by bartlett@xcite . \n exchange potentials are in general constructed by local approximations to the nonlocal hartree  fock exchange operator ( i.e. the slater potential@xcite , the optimized effective potential@xcite , the krieger \n iafrate@xcite and several others@xcite ) .    the atomic collision community , on the other hand , is also eager to accurately determine effective one  electron local potentials which would allow to generate in a simpler way the wavefunctions of the particles interacting in a scattering process . in particular , \n we need to represent an orthonormal set of bound and continuum states to calculate the transition probabilities . this should include detailed @xmath0orbital potentials , a feature missing in most of the standard density functional methods . \n soft pseudopotentials like abinit@xcite or uspp@xcite can not be used because they overlook the information of the internal region of the wavefunctions . \n the features of this region can play a very important role , such as the cusp conditions in the processes of electron capture and ionization . in an attempt to meet the needs of both chemist and collisionist communities \n , we strove to obtain accurate and simple specific @xmath0orbital local potentials . \n how to determine central potentials from known electron wavefunctions and densities is a well studied subject in the dft community@xcite . \n the extraction of the true kohn  sham exchange \n correlation potential from near  exact electronic densities has been demonstrated , with particular reference to two  electron systems like he@xcite , he \n isoelectronic ions@xcite , and h@xmath1@xcite as well as exact soluble models ( for example , an external harmonic potential as in filippi _ _ et al__@xcite ) . \n some other works start with a particular kohn \n sham potential and solve the corresponding equations , obtaining the ks orbitals@xcite . through inversion , they obtain a reconstructed ks potential , which agrees almost everywhere with the original one , except in some regions where huge oscillations arise . in some cases , the reconstructed potential may be distorted beyond recognition@xcite . \n the same type of procedure was suggested many years ago by hilton _ \n et al . _ , \n in applications circumscribed to the calculation of photoionization processes of atoms@xcite , water@xcite and other molecules@xcite . \n these papers , in turn , refer to the earlier work in atomic polarizability carried out by sternheimer@xcite and dalgarno and parkinson@xcite . however , they focused on the final photoionization cross section results , and did not provide details about the quality of the potentials and the wavefunctions they generated .    assuming the validity of the separation between exchange and correlation functionals \n , we will focus here only on the calculation of the exchange contribution to the potential . since hartree  fock \n does not include the correlations , our approach allows to obtain the `` exact '' one  electron local potential representing the exchange interactions . strictly speaking \n , the method does not rely on the ks inversion formula since the hartree \n fock solutions were the ones used for the inversion . \n that is , we solved a ks  type equation , but rather than having ks  orbitals , we operated directly with the hartree \n fock wavefunctions . for open  shell atoms \n , we were able to find orbital spin \n polarized exchange potentials , this being crucial , for instance , to find the hyperfine coupling constants@xcite . \n however , this is not a simple task , and probably that is why the method presented here has not been widely applied in the past . \n if the wavefunction has nodes , it will produce huge poles in the potential . \n moreover , even for nodeless states , the asymptotic decaying behavior of the bound wavefunctions produces severe numerical difficulties , making the inversion operation intractable sometimes . in our method \n , a depuration procedure follows the inversion . \n this depuration implies , first , the annihilation of the poles . \n then , a careful optimization of the potential which ensures the fulfillment of the appropriate boundary conditions . \n the work is organized as follows . \n section [ sec : theory ] describes the method , which includes the inversion procedure ( [ subsec : directinversion ] ) , the potential depuration ( [ subsec : depuration ] ) and its further optimization ( [ subsec : optimization ] ) . section [ sec : results ] presents the resulting effective potentials for the orbitals corresponding to the ground states of different noble gases , including a thorough examination of the wavefunctions generated by these potentials ( [ subsec : resultsdim ] ) . \n the corresponding exchange potentials are discussed in ( [ subsec : exchange ] ) , comparing the potentials for specific@xmath0 orbitals with averaged potentials . \n results of the same calculations for the nitrogen atom are provided in ( [ subsec : nitrogen ] ) . \n atomic units are used unless otherwise specified . \n the radial part of the schrdinger equation for an electron in a local and central potential  is @xmath2 u_{nl}(r ) =   \\varepsilon _ { nl}\\,u_{nl}(r ) \\ , . \n \\label{eq : schrodks}\\ ] ] we assume the following hypothesis : if the wavefunctions @xmath3 are replaced by the solutions of an hartree  fock calculation @xmath4 , then , the corresponding effective local potentials @xmath5 that generate such wavefunctions should exist . based on this we converted the hf method into a set of kohn  sham equations , whose solutions are the hartree \n fock wavefunctions : @xmath6 u_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}(r )     = \\varepsilon_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}\\ , u_{nl}^{\\mathrm{hf}}(r ) \\ , . \n \\label{eq : ks}\\ ] ] the effective potentials given by , @xmath7 are composed of the external potential @xmath8 ( the coulomb field of the nucleus ) , the direct ( or hartree ) potential @xmath9 ( the electrostatic electron repulsion ) , and the orbital exchange potentials @xmath10 . \n we have ignored the correlation term since the hf solutions do not include  it .    since the solutions @xmath4 are known ( calculated numerically with the hf code by c. f. fischer @xcite , and the nrhf code by w. johnson @xcite ) we proceeded to directly invert the kohn  sham  type equations : @xmath11 obtaining the _ hf inverted potential _ @xmath12 . assuming a coulombic  type shape , it is convenient to define an _ hf inverted charge _ @xmath13    the direct computation of ( [ eq : v ] ) is known to pose serious numerical problems@xcite . \n _ first _ , the presence of ( genuine ) nodes in the wave function to be inverted produces poles and unrealistic features around them . \n this has led to the general consensus that the inversion method can only be used for nodeless orbitals@xcite . _ \n second _ , numerical rounding up of the exponential decay of the bound states hinders the corresponding inverted potential from having the physically desired asymptotic form . \n moreover , there is a _ \n third _ problem at the very heart of the hartree fock method : the exact solutions may have oscillations ( and therefore , spurious nodes ) in the large  r or `` tail '' region of the functions . \n the existence of these spurious nodes in hartree fock was already suggested by fischer@xcite . \n this failure is not caused by the numerical scheme but it is inherent to the method . probably , these nodes are surviving long  range exchange effects due to the non  local character of the hartree  fock wavefunctions : the behavior of a particular orbital depends on all others . \n we have found the same spurious nodes at the same places even using different numerical codes . as a general rule , the spurious nodes appear at very long distances , in regions where the amplitude of the wavefunction is very small . therefore , their existence has no practical consequences , and they can be ignored in any general hartree  fock calculation . \n however , this is not true as far as the inversion procedure is concerned , as we will discuss in the next section . \n other examples where the presence of orbital nodes ( both formal and those in the tail region ) can be problematic in inversion procedures can be found in the literature ( see for instance peach _ \n et al._@xcite ) . \n the difficulties mentioned above make it very hard to obtain the correct @xmath12 potentials using the simple inversion formula given by eq . \n ( [ eq : v ] ) . to overcome these troubles \n we have developed a depurated inversion method ( dim ) which optimizes the effective charges rather than the effective potentials . \n we managed to constrain any potential to have the right boundary conditions by enforcing the _ effective depurated inverted charge _ to behave as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nuclear charge . \n once the charge is determined at the boundaries , we can obtain a smooth analytic expression for @xmath16 , fitting the @xmath17 for the largest possible range , except in the neighborhood of the nodes . \n all this can be accomplished by imposing the effective dim charge to fit the following analytical expression : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .    as a clear instance of the numerical problems mentioned and the way \n propose to solve them , we show , in figure [ fig:2skr ] , the orbital @xmath20 of the ground state of the kr atom ( part ( a ) ) , and its correspondent effective charge @xmath21 ( dashed line curve , in part ( b ) ) . \n first , note that the @xmath22 orbital has a genuine node at @xmath23 a.u . which produces the first pole in the effective charge , as shown in the lower graph . \n the node appears at a relatively low@xmath24 value , so the corresponding charge ( see eq . \n ( [ eq : zeff ] ) ) is not very sensitive to its presence . \n therefore , it is very easy to eliminate the pole from the effective charge ( by just erasing a few points around this radius ) . \n corresponding to the ground state of the kr atom . \n it presents two nodes , a genuine one at @xmath23 a.u . , and a spurious one at @xmath25 a.u . \n ( shown in the inset ) . \n ( b ) dashed line : the corresponding inverted effective charge @xmath21 , spoiled by the presence of poles . solid line : depurated @xmath26 effective charge.,width=319 ]    all the bound wavefunctions decay exponentially beyond the last turning point @xmath27 , defined as the position in which the energy equals the effective potential . at first glance \n , it seems that the turning point of @xmath28 is located around @xmath29 , and from that point on , the wavefunction should start to decay exponentially . \n from the numerically point of view , @xmath30 is a good point to stop the inversion , since beyond there , the effective charge could begin to diverge . \n thus , one might infer that by erasing the points belonging to the neighborhood of the first node , and by stopping the inversion about @xmath31 , the inversion procedure will work well . \n however , the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig:2skr](b ) shows a completely unphysical @xmath32 resulting from the inversion . a very careful examination of the @xmath20 orbital function evidences the presence of a spurious node at @xmath33 a.u . \n , in a region where the amplitude of the wavefunction is less than @xmath34 times the maximum value ( see the inset of fig . \n [ fig:2skr](a ) ) . \n even though this node is completely innocuous for practical matters , it produces devastating effects in the inversion procedure , evidenced by the second huge peak in the @xmath21 curve ( see figure [ fig:2skr](b ) ) . \n this pole is so big that it affects a broad vicinity and causes the abrupt rising of the effective charge for @xmath35 a.u .. this is really a surprising result since _ a priory _ there is no reason to suspect that a negligible oscillation in the tail of the wavefunction would produce such a big drawback at small distances . \n care must be taken then to discard these kind of undesired effects . \n the adjustment of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 also requires carefull work . \n the key issue in the successful approximation is the region chosen for the fitting : it has to be as large as possible , in such a way that @xmath16 overlaps the inverted @xmath17 across a broad range , allowing an accurate fitting procedure , but discarding the points surrounding the nodes . also , the inversion must be halted at a particular ( as large as possible ) @xmath24 value , as soon as the amplitude of the function is too small . \n further on , the inversion procedure diverges . \n another issue to consider is the self consistency within the computer codes used in the calculations and the particular code used to generate the input wavefunctions . to that end \n , we make sure that the same specific numerical grid is used , including the derivatives and integrals at the same pivots . the optimization procedure is completed by a number of iteration steps , in which the parameters are optimized to give accurate energies and wavefuntions . \n most density functional approximation methods are based on a variational principle , minimizing the density functionals according to energy ( others are defined by density ) . without underestimating its importance , \n energy is only one of the many parameters that characterizes a quantum state . \n different trial functions ( having different forms ) can produce , through a variational procedure , the same final energy . \n a simple example is given by bartschat @xcite in which two different potentials ( one having exchange , the other omitting it ) led to producing very similar and accurate energies of the rydberg series in several quasi \n one electron systems . \n however , a further examination of these potentials shows large discrepancies in scattering calculations @xcite . \n therefore , in addition to the energy criterion , we have included in our optimization method a variational procedure to reproduce accurately the wavefunctions . \n this is achieved by optimizing the mean values @xmath38 ( which characterize the quality of the wavefunction near the origin ) , and @xmath39 ( probing it at longer distances ) . \n furthermore , we defined the quantity @xmath40 to determine the accuracy of the orbitals generated by the diagonalization of the dim potentials and the original hf orbitals . \n the effective depurated inversion charge @xmath26 corresponding to the @xmath22 orbital of the kr atom resulting from the optimization is shown solid curve in figure [ fig:2skr](b ) . \n as seen in the figure , both boundary conditions are fulfilled ( at the origin , @xmath41 , and asymptotically @xmath42 , as stated in eq . \n ( [ eq : zasympt ] ) ) . \n the fitting parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 defining the effective charges @xmath16 in eq . \n ( [ eq : atomseq ] ) for the noble gases helium , neon , argon and krypton , are given in table [ tab : parameters ] . \n we have limited the @xmath36 and @xmath37 to six ( about two per shell ) . \n for kr , we would probably need two more since there are four shells involved .    .fitting parameters for the effective charge @xmath16 for he , ne , ar , and kr , applying eq . ( [ eq : atomseq ] ) . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n a crucial requirement of the density functional method is the accurate representation of the exchange functional . on the other hand \n , the atomic collision community needs accurate one \n electron potentials in order to generate the bound and continuum states on the same footing for further calculations of collisional processes . \n these potentials need to be worked out for any @xmath0specific orbital , a feature that in general is not present in the chemistry community functionals . in the present work we devised and implemented a depurated inversion method , which allows to obtain the intended potentials through a very simple analytical expression of the effective charges . \n the method consists in the inversion of a kohn  sham equation , in which the ks orbitals have been replaced by the hartree \n fock orbitals . by means of diagonalization \n we have achieved accurate wavefunctions having almost perfect agreement with the original hartree \n fock wave functions . \n the quality of the potentials obtained by the present method is remarkably good . \n we applied the developed methodology to the calculation of the ground state orbitals of noble gases and the nitrogen atom . \n it is worth mentioning that the same technique can be used for any other level , i.e. , it is not limited to the ground state .", "StartTimeOffset": 3456033075329, "RequestID": "6a17cb5df769453eb405a869b206a276", "TotalTokens": 4244}

program simulating the sznajd model in the mentioned variant on a square lattice is listed in @xcite . \n the method of _ damage spreading _ was first used by s. kaufmann in biology @xcite and is an useful tool to investigate the development of two systems that obey the same kind of dynamic rules and differ only in a slight modification . \n the strategy is very simple : + a replication @xmath6 of the initial system @xmath7 is created and a certain amount of elements is changed in @xmath6 ( _ initial damage _ ) . \n then both systems develop under exactly the same conditions ( i.e. the same sequence of random numbers ) towards consensus and one observes the impact the initial damage has . + here the systems are two lattices , the initial damage consists in a single persons opinion change and the rule for the dynamics is the sznajd rule . \n the effect of the opinion change can be measured by the fraction of different opinions on both lattices at a certain moment and is called the _ damage _ @xmath8 ( consistent to the already defined initial damage ) or _ hamming - distance_. the damage is determined by a site - by - site comparison of both lattices while going through the lattice like a typewriter . \n each site with a difference in opinions is summed up . \n the first used of _ damage spreading _ in the sznajd model was in @xcite where more than one opinion were changed . \n + in the sznajd model two different szenarios are possible : + the damage dies out ( @xmath8@xmath90 ) or the damage spreads over the whole lattice ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath2 ) . \n the last case ends up in a reversal of the consensus opinion of the unchanged lattice and is called _ \n total damage_. when one of these two _ equilibrum states _ is reached , the simulation can stop . \n + as already mentioned , the state of consensus is determined by the probability @xmath3 for opinion 1 if @xmath3@xmath10@xmath11 . \n a single change of opinion does not alter this probability . \n therefore the most interesting case is @xmath3@xmath12@xmath11 where total damages are most probable ( see fig . \n [ tdl ] ) although the values are very low . \n the further investigation was therefore limited to this case and it was decided to change the opinion in the center of the lattice to know the initial location of the damage . furthermore it should be mentioned that lattice - sizes of a prime number are used to enable long periods and minimal correlations of the random - number - sequences generated by multiplication with 16807 . \n the _ distance _ of a damaged site to the initial damage ( in the center ) is measured in the _ manhattan - metrics _ and the _ range _ of the damage in every timestep is the maximal distance occurring in that timestep . \n all values were averaged over 10,000 simulations . \n one result of the simulations concerning the temporal spreading of the damage is that the timespans needed to reach equilibrium ( in the sense mentioned above ) of the lattice size obey a power law . \n this could be found in cases of extinction as well as in cases of total damage ( see figure [ power1 ] ) . \n similarly the differences in times needed to reach consensus as a function of the lattice size follow a power law ( figure [ power1 ] ) . \n this means that a consensus can be delayed or accelerated dependending on the size of the system and is a quite interesting effect : it could be sometimes quite crucial whether a consensus happens in this moment or ten years later . + \n furthermore it is supposed that in cases of extinction the time @xmath13 scales with the systems size @xmath2 and the damage is a function of this scaled time ( @xmath14 ) ( see figure [ scalet ] ) . \n the distance scales with @xmath16 and the value ( damage @xmath17@xmath16 ) is a function of this scaled distance ( @xmath18 ) . \n this relation causes a comparison to a diffusion process for which such a @xmath16-dependence is characteristic . if the range of the damage ( see fig . \n [ reichweite ] ) is averaged over only those runs in which the damage is still alive at the moment considered , the damage increases @xmath19@xmath16 and therefore spreads like in a diffusion process ( see inset of fig . \n [ reichweite ] ) but finally dies out . \n finally : + can the change of an opinion into the consensus - opinion of the benchmark - simulation cause a total damage ? + \n the simulations show that it is indeed possible that an opinion changed into the consensus opinion causes the opposite consensus . \n +      the results confirm the intuitive assumption that there is hardly any chance for one person to change the consensus , that the effect of this change dies out after a certain time and its range decreases with time . \n the _ consensus times _ were compared and it turned out that the consensus can be delayed or accelerated by this slight modification and that the amount of the difference in the consensus times obeys a certain power law as well as the lifetime of the effect . \n + moreover two _ scaling laws _ concerning temporal and spatial aspects could be observed up to a certain size of population . \n 99 b. m. roehner , d. sornette und j.v . \n andersen , _ int . \n c 15,809 ( 2004 ) _ \n r. geipel , r. hrta , j. pohl , risiken i m mittelrheinischen becken , _ deutsche idndr -

\n this is what we will attempt to address here . \n at z@xmath55 , there have been a number of significant spectroscopic surveys investigating the nature of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , or `` v- or r - band dropouts '' ) , two of which has been lead by some of the authors . \n there are now over 100 confirmed redshifts in total at z@xmath25 through the work of our eso large program ( the eso distant galaxy survey  ergs ; douglas et al . \n 2007 , in preparation ) and the study of the `` bdfs '' ( e.g. , lehnert & bremer 2003 ; lehnert et al . \n 2007 , in preparation ) . \n the eso lp is based on the ediscs fields , which are 10 widely separated intermediate - redshift cluster fields , while the `` bdfs '' are four adjacent fields observable from paranal in winter . \n our total sample constitutes the largest sample of z@xmath05 lbgs ( `` r - band drop outs '' ) with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts . in all of these fields \n , we have deep r- , i- , z - band , and irac data ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath6 m ) . some of the fields also have observations in other optical / infrared bands , including mips 24@xmath6 m data and hst acs imaging . \n in addition , we have been studying a similar population of galaxies in the goods - s , taking advantage of the deep multi - wavelength data set ( verma et al . 2007 ) . \n from our analysis of some of these extensive data sets ( verma et al . 2007 ) , we conclude :    @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 are young , with typical ages less than 100 myrs , compact , with typical half - light radii of about 1 kpc , and are rapidly forming stars , 10 to 200 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 . \n these ages are very young suggesting that they have been intensely forming stars for only a few dynamical times ( estimated from stellar mass estimates and sizes ) . \n they therefore may likely represent a population of `` primordial galaxies '' . \n @xmath7 these sources are generally so young that they likely did not substantially contribute to reionization . \n the estimates of their ages from sed suggests that they formed at redshifts of about 6 - 7 . their contribution to re - ionization would likely be after the universe was already substantially ionized . \n @xmath7 from sed fitting from the rest - frame uv through optical , the lbgs at z@xmath85 are typically about a factor of 10 less massive that similarly selected galaxies at z@xmath83 ( few x 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 compared to few x 10@xmath12 m@xmath9 ; shapley et al . \n these galaxies represent about 1% of the local mass density ( verma et al . \n 2007 ) . \n @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 have high stellar mass surface densities , @xmath13@xmath82 - 6 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath9 kpc@xmath15 and have very roughly approximated core phase densities of 10@xmath16 pc@xmath17 km@xmath17 s@xmath18 \n . both of these are similar to that of bulges and spheriods of m@xmath19 galaxies at low redshift . \n @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 have high star - formation intensities , well above that needed to drive winds at low redshift , @xmath200.1 m@xmath9 kpc@xmath15 yr@xmath10 ( figure 1 ; heckman 2001 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ) . \n @xmath7 if the z@xmath85 drive strong outflows then they may be able to solve the `` pre - enrichment problem ''  whereby the metallicity of the igm does not appear to evolve strongly with redshift at least out to almost z=6 ( songaila 2001 ; ryan - weber et al . \n quantitatively ( crudely ) estimating the likely metal contribution of these galaxies suggests that they are able to solve the pre - enrichment problem ( see figure 2 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3531546274377, "RequestID": "11557323dc89483eba493e84f03b1567", "TotalTokens": 1709}

chamber quality images they can provide . \n the unique combination of position resolution , calorimetry , and scalability provided by lartpcs make them a possible technology choice for future massive detectors . \n there is an active program in the u.s . to develop lartpcs , with the final goal of constructing a massive detector that can be used as a far detector in a long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment . \n the argon neutrino teststand , or argoneut , project is an important early step in this program , and it will be the focus of this document . \n the lartpc technique has been around for several decades , with pioneering work done as part of the icarus experiment @xcite . \n a wire chamber is placed in highly - purified liquid argon , and an electric field is created within this detector . \n neutrino interactions with the argon inside the detector volume produce ionization electrons that drift along the electric field until they reach finely segmented and instrumented anodes ( @xmath0 - wireplanes ) , upon which they produce signals that are utilized for imaging and analyzing the event that occurred , as shown in fig . @xmath1 . applying proper bias voltages to the wireplanes , \n such that electrons drift undisturbed through the initial planes , allows several complementary views of the same interaction that can be combined into a three - dimensional image of the event@xcite . \n calorimetric measurements can be extracted from the pulses observed on the wireplanes . \n this technique allows for very precise imaging , the resolution being dependent on several factors : wire pitch , plane spacing , sampling rate , and electronics s / n levels . \n the wire pitch is typically on the order of several millimeters , the specific value being chosen to maximize resolution without sacrificing s / n levels . \n the rapid sampling rate ( @xmath25mhz ) characteristic of the readout electronics , combined with the slow drift speed of ionization ( @xmath21.5mm/@xmath3s ) at nominal electric field values , equates to an image resolution of fractions of a millimeter along the drift direction ( which is the coordinate common to all the wireplanes of the tpc ) . \n the technology is further made attractive in that the number of electronics channels required for the detector does not scale directly with the volume of the detector if the drift distance is increased appropriately . \n this scaling feature , along with the relatively low cost of argon , makes lartpcs an intriguing option for future massive neutrino detectors .    while lartpcs are an intriguing detector technology , they are not without their challenges . \n one of the biggest challenges is producing and maintaining argon that is pure enough to allow the ionization to drift for the required distances . to address this issue new filters that can cleanse the argon to the required purity levels necessary for a lartpc experiment , and can also be regenerated when they have become saturated , have been developed@xcite . \n these new filters are a necessary step along the path to massive detectors , and they have already been used by several test stands built in the u.s . with the goals of studying detector material effects on argon purity , and looking for cosmic - ray events in a lartpc @xcite . \n argoneut is a lartpc that is currently running in the numi beamline at fermilab . \n the argoneut project was started in order to gain experience building and operating lartpcs in a real beam environment , and also to collect a very interesting data sample that will be used to develop simulation and reconstruction code . \n argoneut will provide a sample of neutrino interactions in liquid argon for the first time ever in the u.s . \n , and for the first time ever in a low - energy beam . \n the only previous lartpc to operate in a neutrino beam was a 50-liter tpc built as part of the icarus program that ran in the wanf beam at cern in the late 1990 s @xcite . \n the energy of the numi beam ( peaking at @xmath23 gev ) is significantly lower than that of the wanf beam ( mean energy of @xmath224 gev ) , making the data accumulated by argoneut particularly interesting since this is an energy - range relevant to neutrino oscillation physics . \n argoneut s tpc is a rectangular volume measuring 90 cm x 40 cm x 48 cm , containing an active volume of @xmath2175 liters of liquid , that is positioned inside of a vacuum jacketed cryostat . \n figure [ fig : tpc_pics ] depicts the tpc before and after it was inserted into the inner cryostat volume . \n the tpc consists of three wireplanes , each with 4 mm wire pitch . \n the innermost induction plane has vertical wire orientation , but is not instrumented with readout electronics and is used primarily for pulse shaping . \n the middle induction plane has 240 wires oriented at + 60@xmath4 with respect to the horizontal beam direction , while the outermost collection plane has 240 wires oriented at -60@xmath4 with respect to the horizontal beam direction . \n both the middle induction plane and the collection plane are instrumented with readout electronics . \n the maximum drift distance in the tpc , from the cathode to the first induction plane is 48 cm . \n the operating cathode voltage of 25kv creates an electric field of 500v / cm , at which the drift speed is 1.55 mm/@xmath3s . \n the inside of the tpc contains 23 field  rings \" that are 1 cm in thickness , formed from machined copper - clad g10 sheets , with consecutive rings connected by four 100m@xmath5 resistors in parallel . \n a custom electronic readout system has been built for the argoneut detector . \n bias voltage distribution cards ( bvdcs ) , that provide filtered voltage to the wireplanes , are placed directly on the tpc . \n each bvdc connects to 24 tpc wires , and sends output signals to ribbon cables that connect to a custom feedthrough circuit board designed by fermilab . \n preamplifier boards , each of which contain 16 fet preamplifiers , reside in a faraday - cage enclosure surrounding the signal - feedthrough board flange . \n the input signals to the preamplifier boards are sent through a wide bandwidth filter that removes frequencies outside of the expected range . \n the amplified signals are sent to digitization boards ( adf2 cards , on loan from the d0 experiment ) which sample the waveform at 5mhz ( 198ns / sample ) . \n the daq system is triggered by a clock signal associated with the numi beam spill , causing each channel to begin recording 2048 adc samples with 10-bit resolution . \n the total readout time for a single trigger is @xmath2400@xmath3s , which is significantly longer than the maximum drift time of particles in the tpc ( 333@xmath3s ) allowing for pre / post - sampling of each spill . \n the pre / post - sampling information is useful for removing spurious tracks that come from outside of the beam window . \n figure [ fig : electronic_pics ] shows several of the components of the tpc readout system . \n the main component of the argoneut cryogenic system is a 550 liter vacuum - insulated cryostat that houses the tpc and contains feedthrough ports for all of the instrumentation of the experiment . \n argoneut uses a self - contained recirculation system to continually pass the liquified argon in the system through the new fermilab style filters . \n boil - off vapor from the inner cryostat is directed vertically up to a 300w gifford - mcmahon cryocooler , where it is condensed and directed back down through one of three return paths to the inner cryostat . \n two of these return paths contain filters , while the third is a bypass line that is used during maintenance of the other pathways . \n the three return lines merge before entering the cryostat , wherein they are guided down to the bottom of the liquid volume and empty through a sintered - metal cap . \n figure [ fig : cryo_pics ] shows the argoneut detector as it looked in the summer of 2008 during a commissioning run on the surface . in this figure \n the outer cryostat flange is removed , showing the inner cryostat wrapped in superinsulation . \n the experiment is outfitted with numerous safety features to maintain the oxygen deficiency hazard ( odh ) rating of the numi tunnel . \n all cryogenic plumbing contains relief valves that are routed to a vent line that extends up the numi shaft and out to the surface . in this way \n any argon gas that is vented , or that might leak from a pipe , is not released into the tunnel but rather is guided out to the surface \n . the outer cryostat acts as a secondary containment vessel in case the inner vessel leaks , and a  bathtub \" acts as tertiary containment in case both cryostats develop leaks . \n the  bathtub \" contains odh sensors that trigger alarms and mixing fans if a leak is detected . \n a dedicated process - control system was built for argoneut that allows remote monitoring of all systems and remote control over important valves . \n argoneut is currently running in the numi tunnel at fermilab , where it is positioned approximately in the center of the beam , and directly upstream of the minos near detector . \n argoneut s tpc is too small to contain the majority of muons produced in neutrino interactions from the energetic numi beamline . to compensate for the information lost by particles exiting the detector \n , argoneut will utilize the minos near detector as a range stack to capture the full trajectories of these particles . since minos is magnetized \n there is the possibility to perform charge identification by matching a track in argoneut with a track in minos . \n despite argoneut s small detector volume , it will collect a significant sample of neutrino / antineutrino interactions . as was mentioned previously \n , this will be the first such sample from a lartpc operating in the u.s . \n , and the first sample ever in a low - energy ( few gev ) neutrino beam . \n there are several physics analyses that can be carried out with the argoneut data sample , with one of the most interesting coming from the several thousand charged - current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) events that will be collected in antineutrino mode . \n these events will be recognized by a muon created in the volume of the tpc , possibly accompanied by one or more proton tracks created by a final - state neutron . by utilizing the minos near - detector to \n range - out muons originating from argoneut their energy can be determined , allowing a first measurement of the ccqe cross - section on argon for neutrinos in the few - gev range . \n this result will be particularly interesting for neutrino oscillation physics , since knowledge of the ccqe cross - section is crucial to oscillation analyses . \n the ability of lartpcs to see low - energy nuclear fragments created in neutrino interactions , and to determine their impact on the cross - section measurements , may also prove to be very interesting . \n members of the argoneut collaboration are working on developing a full software environment for analyzing their data . \n the software being developed will be utilized for everything from simulating neutrino interactions in a lartpc to reconstructing the interactions starting from the raw tpc data . \n such software does not currently exist in the u.s . , but is a necessary tool for any future large lartpc detector where the statistics of the data will be greatly increased . \n one of the main goals of argoneut is to utilize this new software to fully develop the @xmath6 particle identification technique , and to provide a measurement of the capabilities of the technology to separate electron tracks from photon tracks . \n this software will be used for future lartpc detectors , such as the microboone experiment , so early experience gained from argoneut will be important . \n argoneut was filled with liquid argon for the first time in its underground location in may 2009 . \n the initial electron lifetime was much lower than anticipated , but after several weeks of recirculating through the closed - loop filtration system the lifetime had recovered significantly . \n many neutrino events were recorded during this initial run before the summer 2009 fermilab shutdown . \n the raw data from several of these events are displayed in figs . \n [ fig : argoneut_event1 ] , [ fig : argoneut_event2 ] , and [ fig : argoneut_event3 ]    each event display depicts the information from the instrumented induction and collection plane of argoneut . \n the horizontal axis is the wire number within each of the planes , while the vertical axis is the sampling time of the daq , which is common to both the induction and collection views . \n figure [ fig : argoneut_event3 ] depicts the collection plane view , and also shows the raw pulse information for a particular wire ( @xmath7140 ) of the collection plane . \n there are three clear pulses visible in this wire , with the third pulse containing a double - peak that indicates the presence of two closely spaced tracks . \n the collaboration is currently developing algorithms for analyzing the tpc data . \n the dark vertical bands visible in the collection view of figures [ fig : argoneut_event2 ] and [ fig : argoneut_event3 ] are a result of a baseline shift in the adcs after recording energetic hits . \n fourier deconvolution can be performed on the raw data to accurately remove this baseline shift and return the true waveform . \n several hit finding methods are being considered to isolate the important sections of the waveforms recorded after each trigger . extracting overlapping hits , such as those depicted in figure [ fig : argoneut_event3 ] , will provide information about the two - track separation achievable in these detectors . \n the author would like to acknowledge the support staff at fermilab for their invaluable contributions in the planning and construction of argoneut . \n also , the department of energy and the national science foundation .    9 the liquid -

ray are measured for the reconstruction of the compton scattering . \n we did not use the energy of the recoil electron , because the volume of the prototype micro - tpc is so small that the recoil electrons of more than 100 kev escape from the micro - tpc . \n therefore we used the energy of an incident gamma - ray as a known parameter for the reconstruction . \n now we select the events under the following conditions . \n * fiducial volume : we use the events which are in the fiducial volume of the micro - tpc and the scintillator . * @xmath21 : to know the recoil direction , we fit the initial 3 points of the electron track with a straight line . \n therefore we required number of hits ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 . \n * forward - coming gamma - rays : we obtain the gamma - ray images only for the forward - coming gamma - rays , and exclude backward - coming gamma - rays . \n * multiple scattering : the tracks of bad fitting ( rms @xmath24 mm ) are not included in the images . * limit of @xmath3 : we required @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the kinematically minimum of the angle @xmath3 and calculated for a given energy of the incident gamma - ray . * recoil angle : the recoil angle ( @xmath27 in fig . \n [ fig : detector ] ) does not exceed @xmath28 . \n we required @xmath29 . \n * @xmath3 cut ( kinematical background rejection ) : for the kinematical fit , we required @xmath30 as the kinematical constraint .    with these conditions , we obtained images of gamma - rays for 0.3 - 1.3 mev with a high signal - to - noise ratio . \n [ fig : image ] is the image for 356 kev gamma - rays . in this figure \n the white region means 0 events , and it shows the signal - to - noise ratio is very high . it should be noted that we can obtain images of low energy gamma - rays because of the gaseous tracker . \n the source position is @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 . in this image , \n the white region means 0 events.,width=211 ]       kev gamma -

tpc , \n the calculated efficiency is very small , because the area covered by the scintillator is not large enough . \n the calculated efficiency is expected to be very close to the compton scattering probability when we develop a larger scintillator . \n now , for the higher efficiency and better angular resolutions , we are developing a large size micro - tpc with a @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath2-pic and the pixel - type scintillation cameras with larger areas , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : detector ] . \n when we develop a micro - tpc of large size , this camera will have the sensitivity to higher energy gamma - rays . \n we developed a prototype advanced compton camera , and reconstructed the compton - scattering of gamma - rays photon by photon . \n this result proved the principle of the gamma - ray detection . \n because we use a gaseous tracker with a good position resolution , our detector can detect lower energy gamma - rays and has a good spd resolution . \n that clearly shows the significance of the recoil electron tracks for the compton imaging . \n this work is supported by the grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan and grant -

{"ContextTokens": 1771, "GeneratedTokens": 118, "SynthesizedBody": "the measurement of electromagnetic observables in relativistic nuclear collisions has constituted a vigorous experimental effort at different facilities around the world for several decades , and it is fair to write that this program has lived up to its promises . \n indeed , photons ( real and virtual ) carry information complementary to that in hadronic observables , as they suffer essentially no final state interaction . \n one may show @xcite that the photon emission rate in a finite - temperature medium is directly related to the in - medium retarded self - energy of the photon : a valuable quantity . however , the measured signal is comprised of several contributions which have to be under simultaneous theoretical control before significant claims can be substantiated . \n as in nucleon - nucleon interactions , nucleus - nucleus collisions will produce prompt photons during the early collisions of the nuclear constituents . \n the prompt ( direct + fragmentation ) photon spectrum can be calculated in @xmath2 collisions at next - to - leading order @xcite . \n the direct contribution comprises both compton and annihilation components : @xmath3 the nlo effects are contained in the k - factors ; their list of arguments has been omitted for brevity . in principle , the prompt photon spectrum depends on the choice of renormalization , factorization ( @xmath4 ) , and fragmentation ( @xmath5 ) scales ; in the above the first has been set equal to the second . choosing them to be @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the photon transverse momentum , yields a photon spectrum in proton - proton collisions in good agreement with observation @xcite . \n this can be then be used as a baseline for calculations of photon production in nucleus - nucleus collisions . in this case , isospin effects are included in the parton distribution function , by using the parton species for the proton or for the neutron , as appropriate . \n shadowing corrections are also taken into account .      in a thermal environment , whether composed of partons or of hadrons in the confined phase , the photons produced are calculated simply by performing an integral over the space - time history of the strongly interacting system : @xmath8 the differential photon production rate , @xmath9 , is evaluated in the local thermal rest frame , and at a given time will consist of partonic and/or hadronic contributions . \n another process which depends on the temperature is that of jet - thermal photon production . \n this happens when a jet crossing the hot medium undergoes a photon - producing interaction with a thermal parton . \n this can further be divided in two classes , those which will benefit from collinear enhancements , and those which will not @xcite . \n all of the rates introduced so far need to be integrated using with a realistic time - evolution model of the relativistic nuclear collision . \n we will use a two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical approach - azhydro - which provides a good global description of hadronic observables @xcite and , importantly , is not tuned to specifically reproduce electromagnetic measurements . \n the initial jet energy profiles calculated from qcd are evolved in time according to amy @xcite . \n the evolution of the parton energy profile , @xmath10 , is determined by solving a set of coupled fokker - planck rate equations which have the following generic form : @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transition rate for processes where partons of energy @xmath12 loose energy @xmath13 is @xmath14 . the energy gain channels are included through the possibility for @xmath13 to be negative . \n also , amy smoothly handles the crossover between the bethe - heitler and landau - pomeranchuk - migdal regimes @xcite . \n a free parameter of the model is @xmath15 , the strong coupling , which is adjusted to reproduce @xmath16 . \n the calculated photon spectra , together with their different components , are shown in figure [ pho_spec ] . \n the reader may judge of the good agreement between theory and data . \n no parameters have been tuned to generate these figures . \n two other useful representations of the experimental data are displayed in figure [ r_aav2 ] . \n the first ( left panel ) is the ubiquitous @xmath0 variable , while the second is a plot of the photon azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath1 .    in both panels , \n the data does not yet permit an accurate determination of model parameters and ingredients . \n however , the fact that @xmath17 1 at high values of @xmath18 is a consequence of the fragmentation photons being affected by the energy loss of the fragmenting jets ( as well as by an isospin effect @xcite ) : should this trend be confirmed experimentally , a link would exist between the nuclear modification factor of photons and that of strongly interacting particles also borne out of fragmentation .    turning to @xmath1 \n , one observes that the azimuthal anisotropy associated with the jet - plasma photons is indeed negative , as originally suggested @xcite . \n however , the net value of @xmath1 appears to be essentially zero for @xmath19 4 gev . \n the reason for this is two - fold . \n first , the geometric anisotropy of the medium in the realistic 2d+1 model is rather small initially , and then proceeds to shrink as time evolves . \n second , the geometry of the initial jet profile is evaluated here with a realistic woods - saxon distribution , rather than using a hard sphere profile . \n however , these results do show that the photon @xmath20 is rather sensitive to early time dynamics in relativistic nuclear collisions : precise measurements thus have the potential to stringently constrain the time - evolution scenarios . \n a global picture is emerging where the physics of qcd jets and the generation of electromagnetic radiation in nuclear collisions need to be treated simultaneously and consistently . \n the results displayed here are being generalized to include energy loss by elastic collision processes @xcite , and the effects of a 3d+1 hydrodynamical evolution . \n 10 kapusta j and gale c 2006 _ finite -

{"ContextTokens": 2746, "GeneratedTokens": 312, "SynthesizedBody": "in a recent paper@xcite , the bgr - collaboration presented results on light hadron ( down to @xmath4 ) quenched spectroscopy with two different actions : the parametrized fixed point ( fp ) action@xcite and the ci action which is a combination of the lscher - weisz gauge action@xcite with a chirally improved dirac operator@xcite . in this paper \n we extend the scaling analysis in ref.@xcite on the fp action by adding new results on an @xmath5 lattice with lattice unit @xmath6fm . \n this extension is necessary , since our scaling test in @xcite referred to a small @xmath7fm spatial size lattice with low statistics , while our large @xmath8fm lattice results with good statistics could be compared with other simulations only . \n the new data have been used already in a scaling test on the @xmath9 scattering length@xcite . \n no cut - off effects were seen there , but it is difficult to measure the scattering length precisely . \n we need reliable information on the cut - off effects in the quenched approximation since these results help to choose the parameters of future full qcd simulations the bgr collaboration is moving towards . \n in addition , this information might be helpful when comparing the results from different actions for consistency . \n indeed , there exist unclarified inconsistencies between different works in light hadron spectroscopy . on the ape plot , for example , \n the cp - pacs@xcite continuum extrapolated numbers lie significantly below the data obtained with most of the different improved actions . for a recent comparison of numerical data obtained with different actions see ref . \n @xcite .    the parametrized fp dirac operator lives on the hypercube , has 81 offsets , a large number of paths , uses all the elements of the clifford algebra@xcite and satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation up to parametrization errors . \n the setup of the present simulation and the analysis follows closely those applied in ref.@xcite . \n we generated 180 gauge configurations separated by 500 alternating metropolis and pseudo over - relaxation sweeps at gauge coupling @xmath10 . \n at this coupling the lattice unit is @xmath6fm as determined from the sommer parameter @xmath11fm@xcite . \n as it is well known , it is difficult to give an estimate on the systematic errors of @xmath12 if the lattice is not fine . at this resolution \n , the systematic error should be on the percent level , while the statistical error is smaller than @xmath13@xcite . \n the spatial extension of the lattice is @xmath14fm . in our earlier results obtained at @xmath15fm and @xmath8fm at resolution \n @xmath16fm we saw no finite size effects beyond the statistical errors . \n our scaling analysis might be influenced by small finite size effects , however , and these physical effects might mix with the topological finite size artifacts as we discuss below .    before summarizing our results , \n let us make two general remarks concerning scaling analyses in light hadron spectroscopy . \n although the most interesting part of the spectrum for physics is where the quark masses go to their small physical values , the heavier quarks bring more information for scaling studies : the hadrons are more compact , they are more difficult to resolve and the cut - off effects are expected to be larger . \n in addition , the statistical and systematic errors are smaller , so the analysis is more conclusive . \n the second remark refers to a special artifact of _ quenched _ light hadron spectroscopy : the topological finite size artifacts . \n the discrete zero modes of the dirac operator at @xmath17 are not suppressed in the quenched approximation and , in a finite volume at sufficiently small quark masses , they will corrupt the hadron propagators@xcite . in ref.@xcite we eliminated / reduced the topological finite size artifacts by using special hadron correlators in the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , nucleon ( n ) and delta ( @xmath18 ) channels . \n unfortunately , in the vector channel we did not find a natural solution for this problem and the artifacts turned out to be larger at @xmath6fm than at @xmath19fm in the same physical volume @xmath15fm . \n the effect is seen in the vector meson mass at the lightest quark masses in fig . \n [ fig : rawdata ] , where the dimensionless hadron masses are shown as the function of the dimensionless quark mass . \n this feature ( namely , the bending down of the vector meson curve at small quark masses ) is very similar to the artifacts we saw earlier appearing in smaller volumes , and then disappearing in our largest box with @xmath8fm@xcite . \n these quenching artifacts should be separated from the cut - off effects in a scaling test . \n this is relevant in particular in the vector channel , since the vector meson mass is used traditionally ( unfortunately ) as a unit for other hadron masses . \n the problem occurs at sufficiently light quark masses only , which gives an additional argument to avoiding this region in scaling studies . \n the hadron masses as the function of the quark mass in lattice units at @xmath20fm in a box of size @xmath15fm.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we give here a brief summary of our conclusions . considering mass ratios ( like in the ape plot , or measuring the masses in units of a well determined fixed hadron mass ) we see small cut - off effects in the baryon channel when comparing the results at @xmath16 and 0.102fm resolutions . \n the effect is seen for relative heavy quarks beyond the statistical errors . in the @xmath21 channel \n this is a several standard deviation effect and has a size of up to @xmath22 in the ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the vector meson mass . in the nucleon and delta channels the cut - off effects are smaller , but for heavy quarks they are also visible beyond the statistical errors \n this small shift brings the fp results on the ape plot closer to and essentially consistent with the cp - pacs continuum extrapolated results with wilson fermions@xcite . \n the improved staggered ( asqtad@xcite ) data at @xmath25fm@xcite with heavier quarks lie a few standard deviations higher and are close to the cp - pacs results at @xmath26fm . in addition , unlike at @xmath16fm , we see a discrepancy in the overall scale obtained in the gauge sector from the sommer parameter @xmath27 and the scale from the spectrum of light hadrons . \n the hadron sector prefers a scale of @xmath28fm as opposed to the scale of @xmath6fm . in this case \n , however , it is difficult to estimate the systematic errors . \n concerning the details of the analysis we refer to ref.@xcite . in order to avoid very busy figures we shall use a few selected results only from other works in this paper . \n one can get a more complete picture by combining the figures here with those in ref.@xcite . \n the measured new data are collected in tables 1 and 2 . \n [ fig : overview ] gives a quick overview on the cut - off effects in the different channels . in this figure \n the hadron masses are measured in @xmath29 units , where @xmath29 is the vector meson mass at @xmath30 . \n this figure indicates already that the change due to cut -

{"ContextTokens": 4086, "GeneratedTokens": 171, "SynthesizedBody": "according to several researchers , the puzzling pseudogap ( pg ) phenomenon in high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htsc ) is caused by some sort of hidden order . \n this is supported by the observation of a depression in the density of states at the fermi level , with no order parameter responsible for this depression observed yet @xcite . \n rotating antiferromagnetism ( raf ) has been recently proposed as a possible candidate for this hidden order , and several physical quantities have already been calculated within the raf theory ( raft ) with good agreement with available experimental data @xcite . \n raf is one of several other proposals for the pg ( see ref . \n @xcite for a discussion ) . \n contrary to theories of circulating currents @xcite , raf is based on the concept of an order parameter that has a finite magnitude below a critical temperature but a time - dependent phase @xcite . \n note that all the physical quantities that have so far been calculated within raft do not depend on the phase of the order parameter in raf @xcite . \n the lack of the time dependence profile for this phase limited however the full understanding of the nature of raf . \n the purpose of this work is to calculate this phase as a function of time using a combination of raft and the heisenberg equation . \n we show that it varies linearly with time . as a consequence of this time dependence \n , raf can be interpreted as a @xmath2 unusual spin wave around a zero local magnetization or as a synchronized larmor - like precession of all the spins in the system . because the phase of this order parameter is time dependent , it was not possible to calculate it in raft alone , which is a mean - field approach . \n this paper is organized as follows . \n first in sec . \n [ sec2.1 ] we rederive raft using the spin ladder operators , which are necessary for the phase calculation . in sec . \n [ sec2.2 ] , we review raft . then in sec . \n [ sec2.3 ] we use the heisenberg equation to get the time dependence for the spin ladder operators , which yields the time dependence of the phase of the rotating order parameter . in sec . \n [ sec2.4 ] , the interpretation of raf as an unusual @xmath2 spin wave is explained . \n finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . \n as we are only interested in understanding the nature of the pg phase of htscs in this work , we restrict ourselves to the non superconducting phase . \n consider the @xmath3-@xmath4 hubbard model in two dimensions : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 designate summation over nearest and second - nearest neighboring sites , respectively . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are electron hopping energies to nearest and second - nearest neighbors , respectively . because the phase of raf is related to the spin ladder operators , it is useful to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) using these operators . \n using the spin ladder operator written in second quantization @xmath8 , the onsite coulomb repulsion term @xmath9 can on one hand be cast in the form @xmath10 and on the other hand as @xmath11 . summing and dividing by 2 yields the symmetrized expression @xmath12 . \n the latter can be proved by calculating the action of each side of the equality on the possible states @xmath13 due to pauli exclusion principle , and @xmath14 . for our many - body system , sites are neither full nor empty , but are on average occupied by a density smaller than 1 away from half filling . \n therefore , the terms @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are responsible for onsite spin - flip excitations , will contribute by lowering energy for the sites that are partially occupied by the same density of spin up and down electrons . \n one can decouple this term in mean - field theory using @xmath17 , which leads to a collective behavior for the spin - flips , and the results obtained in this way are the same as in raft @xcite . in this state , a spin flip process at site @xmath18 is simultaneously accompanied by another one at another site @xmath19 ; the occurrence of the spin flips is synchronized . \n thermal motion has obviously an effect on this order as it does on conventional orders ; i.e. , above a critical temperature ( identified with the pg temperature ) the spin - flip processes become uncorrelated , leading to the disappearance of the long - range non conventional order . \n the spin - flip processes , which are purely quantum , continue to exist even above this critical temperature , but in an incoherent disordered manner . \n the occurrence in raft of a second - order phase transition at the pg temperature is consistent with experimental data supporting its existence @xcite . \n we rederive raft , which deals with the static part ( magnitude ) of the order parameter @xmath20 , using the spin ladder operators then for the dynamic ( phase ) part we will use the heisenberg equation to find its time dependence . to the best of our knowledge the combination of mean - field theory and the heisenberg equation of quantum mechanics constitutes a novel approach for the pg in htscs .    the parameter latexmath:[$q_i={\\langle c_{i,\\uparrow}c^{\\dag}_{i,\\downarrow}\\rangle } = -\\langle s_i^-\\rangle \\equiv    of the @xmath3-@xmath4 hubbard model . \n consider the ansatz where @xmath22 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 labeling any two adjacent lattice sites . except for this difference of @xmath23 between the phases of the order parameter on two adjacent sites , the phases @xmath24 are site independent and assume any value in @xmath25 $ ] . \n the normal state hamiltonian in raft @xcite is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of sites , and @xmath28 is the expectation value of the number operator . because of antiferromagnetic correlations the lattice consists of two sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , even though there is no long - range static antiferromagnetic order . \n the summation runs over the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) . \n the nambu spinor is @xmath31 , and the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath32 yielding the energy spectra @xmath33 where @xmath34 \\cr % & & + 4t_5\\cos(2k_x)\\cos(2k_y ) % + 4t_6[\\cos k_x\\cos(3k_y ) + \\cos(3k_x)\\cos k_y ] ; $ ] , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 \\cr % & & -2t_4[\\cos(3k_x ) + \\cos(3k_y ) ] ; $ ] . because the energy spectra @xmath37 do not depend on the phase @xmath38 one should be able to transform @xmath39 to a matrix that does not depend on the phase \n this can indeed be done using the spin - dependent gauge transformation @xmath40 and @xmath41 . \n this transformation is equivalent to performing a rotation by angle @xmath42 about the @xmath43 axis for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 components of the spin operator . \n indeed , upon using this gauge transformation , the spin ladder operators transform according to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which yields : @xmath48 the thermal averages of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by @xmath51 note that @xmath52 for @xmath18 in both sublattices . because the phase @xmath38 assumes any value between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see below ) , rotational symmetry will not look broken for times greater than the period of rotation . \n however if the typical time scale of a probe is much smaller than this period symmetry may appear broken . \n the magnitude @xmath55 , which was calculated using the minimization of the mean - field free energy @xcite , behaves as in a second - order phase transition in agreement with experimental evidence in @xcite . \n next we calculate the phase using the heisenberg equation @xmath56 $ ] . \n we consider the limit where electron hopping is neglected in comparison to @xmath57 . \n the limit considered here is @xmath58-@xmath59 ; this is an intermediate coupling limit where @xmath60 but smaller than the bandwidth @xmath61 when @xmath62 . \n it is justified to use this approximation because spin dynamics is faster than charge dynamics ; i.e. , an onsite spin flip needs a time @xmath63 to be realized , while a charge hopping between adjacent sites takes a longer time @xmath64 , ( @xmath60 ) . in the heisenberg equation \n the undecoupled interaction is used instead of raft s hamiltonian ( [ raft hamiltonian ] ) in order to treat as best as possible quantum fluctuations . to carry on the calculation \n , we keep in mind that any site @xmath19 is on average only partially occupied , and that @xmath65 . for this reason , terms like @xmath66 and @xmath67 \n should be kept until the end ( these terms normally give zero when acting on a spin up state , but a nonzero contribution is expected when applied to a partially occupied state where thermal averages are meaningful and suitable ) . in the commutator of the heisenberg equation @xmath68\\approx -\\frac{u}{2}[s_j^+,(s_j^+s_j^- + s_j^-s_j^+)]$ ] , we need to calculate @xmath69=[s_j^+,s_j^+s_j^- ]   + [ s_j^+,s_j^-s_j^+]=2\\hbar(s_j^+s_j^z + s_j^zs_j^+)$ ] . using the fundamental commutation relation @xmath70=\\hbar s_j^+$ ] , one gets @xmath71 , which leads to @xmath72 again we stress that this equation is obtained in the intermediate coupling limit ( @xmath73 smaller than the bandwidth but higher than hopping energies ) , where spin dynamics is not governed by the heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath74 suitable for the strong coupling limit . \n ( [ heisenberg eq ] ) gives zero when acting on state @xmath75 or @xmath76 . \n however , for a collective state where any site is only partially occupied , one has to take the thermal average of eq . \n ( [ heisenberg eq ] ) . \n one then replaces @xmath77 by its raft s thermal average , which is zero . integrating eq . \n ( [ heisenberg eq ] ) gives for the thermal average @xmath78 which yields @xmath79 modulo @xmath54 when @xmath80 is identified with @xmath81 , ( @xmath82 ) , for sublattice @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 . \n the angular frequency is thus @xmath85 , and period @xmath86 is the time required to perform a spin - flip process , or the time needed for the rotating order parameter @xmath87 to complete a @xmath54 revolution in a classical point of view . \n the magnetic configuration ( [ mag config ] ) takes on the following form @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath90 , @xmath91 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath30 , and @xmath92 for @xmath18 in sublattice @xmath29 or @xmath30 .      to illustrate well rotating magnetic order , consider first the much simpler example of the time evolution of a single spin in a magnetic field @xmath30 along the @xmath43-axis , with the initial state given for a spin pointing in the positive @xmath44-direction by @xmath93 . \n the time - dependent expectation values of the spin components are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 . \n @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the charge and mass of the electron , respectively , and @xmath100 is the speed of light . \n classically speaking , the spin is confined to rotate about the @xmath43-axis in the @xmath101 plane with larmor angular frequency @xmath102 . \n a rotating ferromagnetic state can be realized by placing @xmath27 such states with the same frequency on a lattice made of @xmath27 sites . for a rotating antiferromagetic state , \n opposite initial states ( @xmath103 : spins point in opposite directions on the @xmath44-axis ) are required on each two adjacent sites of the lattice . to relate raf to spin flip processes , we note that @xmath104 in this example . \n note that in this example is model independent , which may indicate that all model parameters will do is changing multiplying physical factors , not the physics itself . in a given model , \n a coupling is necessary for providing the building bloc for raf , which is the precession of a spin ( with no local magnetization ) for each lattice site . \n the raf state constructed in this way shows a hidden order that can be realized even at finite temperature without violating the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . \n the example above allows us to interpret raf as a state where spins precess collectively in a synchronized manner in the spins @xmath101 plane around an effective staggered magnetic field @xmath105 caused by onsite coulomb repulsion . for our many - body system , @xmath106 in @xmath107 \n is replaced by the magnitude of the raf order parameter @xmath55 , which can assume values smaller than @xmath108 due to thermal averaging . this state is strongly doping dependent . \n when doping increases , @xmath55 rapidly decreases then vanishes at a doping identified as the quantum critical point underneath the superconducting dome @xcite . in comparison to ordinary spin waves in an antiferromagnet , \n raf s state could be viewed as a @xmath0 spin wave in an antiferromagnet with zero magnetization . \n note however that for our system ( where @xmath52 ) , spin - wave theory is not applicable because the spin - wave theory is built around a stable nonzero @xmath109 state . \n the rotating antiferromagnetism theory and heisenberg equation are combined in order to calculate the phase of the rotating order parameter . \n this phase behaves linearly in time . \n this allows us to interpret rotating antiferromagnetism in terms of a larmor - like spin precession about an effective magnetic field , which is proportional to onsite coulomb repulsion . \n another way to see rotating antiferromagnetism is as an unusual spin - wave at @xmath0 around a zero magnetization . \n this work was necessary for unveiling the nature of rotating antiferromagnetism , which has been proposed for explaining the pseudogap behavior in high-@xmath1 materials . \n rotating antiferromagnetic order is an example of hidden order , which is a serious candidate for the pg state in htscs . \n this is supported by the good success of the rotating antiferromagnetism theory in the calculation of thermodynamics @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , raman @xcite , and angle -

{"ContextTokens": 3894, "GeneratedTokens": 231, "SynthesizedBody": "zirconium alloys are widely used as fuel cladding and structural materials in water cooled nuclear reactors . the principal role of the cladding is to provide a physical barrier between the fuel and the coolant thereby ensuring radionuclides remain contained within the fuel pin , while protecting the nuclear fuel from a strong flow of hot , potentially corrosive water or water / steam mix .    in the past four decades \n a number of compositional and processing changes have been made to improve the mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of zr alloys@xcite . \n concurrently with the increased durability and reliability of the cladding ( and structural elements of the reactor core ) the fuel burnup has also increased , leading to a reduction in energy production costs . \n one of the limiting factors for a further increase in fuel burnup is the hydrogen pick - up of zr alloys . \n the presence of h in the cladding is of concern for a variety of reasons including dimensional changes , reduced ductility of the metal , and the formation of hard , brittle hydrides , which in turn may increase corrosion rates or cause failure by delayed hydride cracking@xcite . \n new nuclear fuel cycle regulations that take into account hydrogen levels in the cladding are also being considered@xcite . \n it is , therefore , essential to develop a deeper understanding of the processes responsible for the h pick - up , in order to deliver improved reactor performance , from both economic and safety standpoints . \n recent work@xcite has been carried out to investigate , from first principles , the structure , stability and mechanical properties of hydrides within the zr metal . \n the current work , instead , focuses on interaction between h and the second phase particles ( spps ) formed within the zr alloys . \n most alloying elements that are typically used in zr alloys have very limited solubility in @xmath0-zr , and therefore tend to precipitate as intermetallic spps@xcite . \n the main exceptions are sn , which exhibits solid solubility in @xmath0-zr at alloying concentrations of interest , and nb , which precipitates out as @xmath2-(zr , nb ) solid solution at operating temperature and below , as well as forming intermetallic spps in the presence of fe . \n further details are provided in section  [ sec : xtal ] . \n the interaction between the spps and h is not yet well understood . \n it remains unclear whether the spps act as traps for h , provide nucleation sites for hydrides , or whether they may act as a preferred transport path through the outer oxide layer for ingress of h into the metal@xcite .    in our previous work@xcite \n we employed atomic scale computer simulations , based on density functional theory ( dft ) , to investigate the solubility of h in zr intermetallics of particular importance for zircaloy-2 and zircaloy-4 alloys . here \n , the study is extended to other binary intermetallics of zr ( containing cu , fe , mo , ni , nb , sn and v ) , which are either directly relevant to fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors , or have been used in model alloys to understand the role spps play in controlling the h pick - up . \n all dft simulations were carried out using castep@xcite . the exchange and correlation functional employed was the generalized gradient approximation , as formulated by the perdew burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite . \n ultra - soft pseudo potentials with a consistent cut - off energy of were used throughout . a high density of * k*-points was employed for the integration of the brillouin zone , following the monkhost - pack sampling scheme@xcite : the distance between sampling points was maintained as close as possible to and never above . in practice \n this means a sampling grid of @xmath3 points for the largest intermetallic supercells . \n the fast fourier transform grid was set to be twice as dense as that of the wavefunctions , with a finer grid for augmentation charges scaled by 2.3 . due to the metallic nature of the system , density mixing and \n methfessel - paxton@xcite cold smearing of bands were employed with a width of . \n testing was carried out to ensure a convergence of was achieved with respect to all of the above parameters . \n no symmetry operations were enforced and all calculations were spin polarised , taking particular care in finding the lowest energy spin state of phases containing magnetic elements . \n the energy convergence criterion for self - consistent calculations was set to . \n similarly robust criteria were imposed for atomic relaxation : energy difference @xmath4  , forces on individual atoms @xmath4   and for constant pressure simulations stress component on cell @xmath4  . \n many different types of spps have been reported in the literature relating to zr alloys , often with little agreement on their chemical composition and crystal structure . in this section \n we report a summary of the possible spps that can form between zr and each of the alloying elements under investigation ( see table  [ tab : supercells ] ) .    . \n [ tab : supercells ] overview of all compounds investigated for the accommodation of h , together with the size of the largest supercell simulated in terms of the number of atoms ( @xmath5 ) and smallest distance between the h defect and its replicas ( @xmath6 ) . for laves phases , \n m = cr , fe , mo , nb , v. [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the zrm@xmath1 phases , little variation in the accommodation of h was observed between the three laves structures @xmath7 , therefore the results from zrm@xmath1 simulations have been condensed into a single value for each element and the statistical error is reported . \n similarly , the three models of the zr@xmath8sn@xmath9 phase were reported as one . \n the exact values of @xmath10(h ) were @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ev for @xmath14 respectively . \n for the case of zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 , the lowest energy site was the only unoccupied @xmath16 wyckoff site . \n it is reasonable to expect a large number of unoccupied sn self - interstitial sites in this phase , therefore the defect energy was calculated as an interstitial defect into a phase with one unoccupied sn self - interstitial site , rather than the substitutional defect h@xmath17 in the fully occupied zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 structure . \n zr@xmath8sn@xmath9 , exhibits two preferred sites : the @xmath18 site between 3 zr atoms , and , directly above and below it , the @xmath16 site between 6 zr atoms . \n the relative preference for h of one site over the other changes as a function of sn content . at a content of three sn atoms per formula unit , the trigonal @xmath18 site is preferred ( against of the octahedral site ) . as the sn content increase to 3.5 , half of the @xmath16 sites \n are occupied by the excess sn . \n the presence of a sn atom in the @xmath16 site , causes a reduction in space in the neighbouring @xmath18 sites , while only marginally affecting the configuration of other ( unoccupied ) @xmath16 sites in the cell . \n this is reflected in the solution of h in the two sites : the @xmath18 site becomes significantly less favourable ( ) , while the @xmath16 provides a similar solution enthalpy as in the previous case ( ) . in the case of zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 all of the @xmath16 sites are occupied , consequently the @xmath18 sites are compressed by two sn atoms , one above and one below , reducing the volume available for accommodation of h even further , and the enthalpy associated with accommodating an h atom in that site becomes positive and large ( ) . \n the current work shows that @xmath2-zr accommodates h more readily than @xmath0-zr ( in agreement with experimental data@xcite ) , and that @xmath2-nb exhibits the same value of @xmath10(h ) as @xmath0-zr . \n this suggests that , if the @xmath2-(nb , zr ) solid solution found in binary zr - nb alloys behaves similarly to its two end members , those alloys do not contain any strong sinks for h. nevertheless , the formation of metastable zrnb@xmath1 phases may affect this , as discussed below .    regarding the zrm@xmath1 laves phases , \n the solution enthalpy of h generally decreases with increasing number of @xmath6 electrons in the transition metal m : from highest to lowest affinity nb , v , cr , mo and fe . \n the same trend has been observed with respect to h solution capacity@xcite . whilst h does not prefer to dissolve in the laves phases containing the latter three elements \n ( i.e. cr , mo , and fe ) compared to @xmath0-zr , the intermetallics formed with either nb or v offer favourable sites for the accommodation of h. this suggests that if these binary spps are present in the cladding , h will likely segregate to them , which may deplete the h content in the zirconium metal . \n the beneficial effect of the h sinks may , however , be limited to the initial stages of the fuel cycle . at higher burnups , \n the intermetallic particles are likely to dissolve@xcite , amorphise or oxidise , thereby releasing any stored h. in addition to zrnb@xmath1 and zrv@xmath1 , all zr - rich phases provided lower @xmath10(h ) values compared to @xmath0-zr . \n furthermore , for each element where more than one stoichiometric phase is present ( cu , fe , ni and sn ) , those with the largest zr / m ratio provided the lowest solution enthalpy for h ( see figure  [ fig : h_sol - m_content ] ) . \n zr is known to exhibit higher affinity for h compared to cu , fe and ni ( see the extremes of figure  [ fig : h_sol - m_content ] ) , therefore a decrease in enthalpy of solution with increasing zr content is expected . however , from a volumetric standpoint , intermetallic phases have a lower packing fraction compared to the pure metals , offering a larger number of interstitial sites with varying amounts of space . \n for this reason intermetallic phases are expected to exhibit lower defect volumes ( and associated strain fields ) when accommodating an h interstice . as a result of the two competing processes \n chemical bonding and volumetric effects  the lowest solution enthalpies are found , as mentioned above , for zr - rich intermetallic phases that provide interstitial sites with 4-fold zr - coordination .    unlike other alloying additions , \n fe forms a wide range of intermetallic compounds , and their relative stability is greatly affected by other alloying elements : zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) spps are commonly observed in the absence of cr additions , while in cr - containing alloys , zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 laves phases become the dominant spps@xcite . in the presence of nb , hexagonal zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 laves phases and cubic ( zr , nb)@xmath1fe phases have been reported@xcite . \n similarly , the few records of sn - zr spps also report some fe solubility into these particles@xcite . \n this suggests that the addition of fe does not influence which intermetallic phases form , rather it will go into solution in all or most of the spps present . assuming that a ternary phase behaves similarly to its binary end members , solution of fe in zrm@xmath1 laves phases and zr@xmath1x phases , is expected to reduce their affinity to h , since zrfe@xmath1 and zr@xmath1fe exhibit less favourable @xmath19 compared to all other phases with the same stoichiometry and structure . \n the opposite can be said for the zr@xmath20fe - type spps . \n owing to the fact that both zrcr@xmath1 and zrfe@xmath1 have unfavourable @xmath19 values , it is predicted that the ternary zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 phase , found predominantly in zircaloy-4 , does not getter h from the surrounding @xmath0-zr . as for the zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) , which is the predominant spp in zircaloy-2 , both of its binary end members offer favourable solution enthalpies for h. nonetheless \n , the difference in affinity to h with respect to @xmath0-zr is rather small ( on the order of ) , and is expected to diminish with increasing fe content . \n such small differences in energy may easily be overcome by thermal and entropic effects , consequently zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) are not expected to be strong sinks for h in solution . whilst it is possible to speculate on the behaviour of ternary phases where both binary end members have either positive or negative @xmath19 values , it is much harder to predict the h affinity of other ternary spps such as zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 found in zirlo alloys . \n it is possible , however , to expect that the behaviour of such spps is strongly correlated to their chemical composition , and more specifically the nb / fe ratio of the intermetallic particle . \n if @xmath21 then the spps may act as h sinks , whilst with a composition of @xmath22 they are not likely to accommodate any h.    under irradiation , fe has been reported to diffuse out of the spps faster than other elements@xcite . in the case of laves phases , and \n especially nb - containing laves phases , the current work suggests that this would increase the affinity of the residual spp for h. however , concomitantly to the dissolution of fe , the spps are reported to undergo amorphisation and at present it is impossible to predict how this will affect the interaction between h and the spp . \n dft simulations have been employed to calculate the enthalpy of solution of h in pure zr , nb and in intermetallic phases of zr . \n pure @xmath2-zr exhibits more favourable solution enthalpy for h relative to @xmath0-zr , however the difference is predicted to diminish in the presence of nb . regarding the laves spps , the presence of nb or v is predicted to increase the affinity with h , whilst the presence of cr , mo and fe will reduce it . \n cu , ni and sn additions may form a number of binary intermetallic phases , but tend to stabilise as zr - rich phases . \n all zr - rich phases , namely zr@xmath20fe , zr@xmath1ni , zr@xmath1cu and zr@xmath20sn , provide lower energy sites for h accommodation , compared to @xmath0-zr , suggesting that their presence in the alloy could provide sinks for h.    with regards to the more commonly observed ternary spps , it is predicted that zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) ( found mainly in zircaloy-2 ) and @xmath2-(zr , nb ) precipitates ( present in all nb containing alloys ) exhibit an affinity to h similar to that of @xmath0-zr , and are therefore not expected to strongly getter h from their surroundings . \n zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 spps found in zircaloy-4 are predicted to have very unfavourable solution enthalpies for h and therefore not to accommodate any h. the affinity to h of the zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 spps , present in zirlo alloys , is expected to vary strongly with nb / fe ratio : high nb content spps are expected to trap h , whilst high fe content spps will reject it . \n we would like to thank the epsrc , ansto and the uk -

{"ContextTokens": 3772, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "unlike its common perception , a vacuum is surprisingly strange and mysterious . \n although the name implies emptiness or nothingness , the reality is quite different . before the twentieth century , in order to come up with an explanation of the mysterious nature of light , a vacuum was often thought to be filled with aether that acted as a medium for the light wave . \n after einstein formulated special relativity without requiring aether , the idea of an aether - filled vacuum faded away . \n however , with the development of quantum theory , it soon became evident that even vacuums contain non - zero energy . \n this quantum effect became problematic again with physics at the cosmological scale . \n while the cosmological constant from observation yielded a value close to zero , the theoretical computation yielded a huge discrepancy @xcite .    in this paper , we wish to argue that this discrepancy may have resulted from the error of looking at the structure of the universe at the fundamental level . for centuries , science has been studied based on causality . \n that is , for a given result , there is a corresponding cause . \n this method of revealing an objective pattern in natural phenomenon began to shatter with the development of quantum mechanics at the beginning of the twentieth century . indeed , rather than the objective description for a given physical system , quantum theory started to describe the subjective relation between the observer and the object being observed .    in @xcite , it was noticed that this subjective description , which was often considered an incomplete aspect of a full description @xcite , may correspond to not only the limit of scientific knowledge but to existence itself . by considering the observable in quantum theory as the reference frame of the observing party \n , it was discussed that the two - picture formulation of quantum theory no longer correctly described self - observing consciousness . \n moreover , it was argued that this contradiction could be solved by changing the way we look at the structure of the universe at the fundamental level . \n that is , the observer and the object being observed ( i.e. , the universe ) , are inseparable . \n number of irreversible computations , fills up the universe @xcite . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    in @xcite , motivated by the black hole information problem @xcite , a more specific description of what it means for the observer and the universe to be inseparable has been provided . in particular , it was argued that the two - system measurement protocol , which places the observing party on the same footing as the object being observed objectively , could be made equivalent to the single - system copenhagen measurement protocol , which treats the observing party with a special status . in @xcite , \n the argument with black hole case was extended to the cosmological model . \n in particular , the nature of negative sea was discussed in more detail by identifying it as the time reversal of the irreversible computation since the big bang . in this paper \n , we wish to discuss the difference between the theory and experiment in the context of the previously proposed universe model with negative sea , or the aether @xcite , filling up the universe . \n when the general theory of relativity was first published in 1915 , the universe was known to not be expanding or shrinking , at least in the cosmological scale . \n indeed , in order to come up with a static model of the universe , einstein originally introduced an additional constant term , @xmath3 , in his field equation . \n based on the assumption that the universe is isotropic , meaning it looks symmetric rotationally , and homogeneous , meaning its density is roughly the same anywhere , the metric can be simplified greatly at a sufficiently large scale . from the metric \n , einstein s field equation yields a solution which was found by friedman . \n this then implies adding a new vacuum energy density to the universe with @xmath4 .     to @xmath5 ( i.e. , in time - forward manner ) \n , the classical vector @xmath6 chooses @xmath7 . in ( ii ) , the quantum vector @xmath8 evolves to equate itself with the classical vector from @xmath5 to @xmath9 . \n this cyclical process is equivalent to the self - observing consciousness discussed in @xcite . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    in 1998 , two research teams @xcite measured the cosmological parameters with the observation of a type ia supernova . \n surprisingly , it was found that the universe is accelerating in its expansion with non - zero cosmological constant value . in order to determine the value of @xmath3 \n , astronomers used the equation that relates the luminosity of distant stars and the redshift , and the cosmological constant value was estimated to be @xmath10 while the vacuum energy density was estimated to be @xmath11 .    in @xcite , \n the subjective aspect of existence was motivated by the contradiction appearing in the self - observation of consciousness . \n in particular , it was argued that one may consider the observable as the reference frame of the observer observing the given quantum system @xcite . \n another mysterious and highly debated subject was in regard to free will ( see @xcite ) . \n this is due to the newtonian deterministic worldview until the development of quantum theory . \n however , with randomness as an essential part of the theory , many suspected quantum theory may open the opportunity of free will . in fact \n , it has two seemingly contradictory aspects : first , the observer can freely choose ; second , the choice should be random and unpredictable .    , which therefore leads to the observation of the energy difference as seen in quantum theory . \n however , in the case of self - observing consciousness , the observer observes his or her own reference frame of @xmath0 as seen in ( ii ) . \n this is the case of vacuum observation . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    the statistical meaning of black hole entropy has been debated over the years @xcite , and the quantum memory model @xcite suggests that it corresponds in a number of ways to the observer s choice in measuring the black hole . \n it is interesting to note that free will associated with black hole entropy indeed has the dual aspect discussed above . \n that is , from the observer s subjective view , he or she is able to freely choose , yet its randomness comes from quantum probability .    in @xcite \n , it was further elaborated how free will may play an important role in building the model of the universe using nondeterministic computation . \n the nondeterministic computation chooses the acceptable path of computational process ( i.e. , the observer s choice ) , which is different from probabilistic computation @xcite . again , considering nondeterministic computation as free will fits the dual aspect discussed above . in computational complexity , \n it is known as the language accepted by the algorithm .    , from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the classical vector performs an irreversible computation with energy @xmath0 . from @xmath5 to @xmath9 , the quantum vector performs the computation with energy @xmath0 as well . \n , title=\"fig : \" ] \n it was discussed @xcite that , in the subjective model ( fig . \n [ diracsea ] ) , the entropy of the observable universe corresponds to a logarithm of possible choices the observer is able to choose . \n indeed , it was argued that among equally accessible microstates of the universe , existence corresponds to the observer s freely chosen will . \n therefore , the subjective model proposed in @xcite suggests that the observer s freely chosen will is actual existence , subjective reality , and it has the dual aspect of free will discussed earlier .    in order to discuss the difference between the observed and quantum vacuum energies , \n let us review cyclical time @xcite . \n unlike linear time as commonly used in physics , cyclical time evolves from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , @xmath5 to @xmath12 , etc . , and \n at certain @xmath13 , @xmath14 evolves back to @xmath9 . in @xcite , a cyclical model of consciousness with @xmath15 \n was introduced . as shown in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] , two vectors are considered ; one is a quantum reference frame , or an observable , and the other is the corresponding classical vector . \n as discussed in @xcite , quantum vectors are defined in complex vector space , and the observation of these vectors takes place in classical space in terms of eigenvalues . \n therefore , the process of measurement involves the object of quantum vector and the corresponding classical vector , as well as the quantum and classical reference frames . in the case of self - observation , \n the object to be observed is the reference frame itself ; therefore , only quantum and classical reference frames are considered , as shown in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] . \n initially , both vectors are pointing at @xmath16 in the bloch sphere notation . from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the classical reference frame points at @xmath7 ( fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] ( i ) ) . in the cyclical model , \n @xmath5 evolves back to @xmath9 , which is the case of quantum evolution ( fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] ( ii ) ) . \n the interpretation could be considered as while the physical ( or classical ) choice is made in a time - forward manner , being aware of the choice is done through the quantum process ( i.e. , the dirac - type negative sea of consciousness ) . \n it is noted that the presented cyclical model of consciousness incorporates both the classical and quantum aspects and places them on an equal footing .     in a time - forward manner . \n the cyclical model adopts small and large cycles of time . \n ( ii ) in one large cycle , the quantum vector may evolve backward in time all the way to the big bang with @xmath2 number of computations . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    let us now consider the cyclical process of consciousness in terms of energy . \n the unit of irreversible computation with dissipated energy , which will be called @xmath0 , was considered in @xcite . in @xcite \n , it was discussed that the degrees of freedom for reference frame ought to be the same as that of the state vectors . \n for example , if the outcome of a spin is up or down , the reference frame in measuring the spin is up or down as well . in a similar manner , in regard to the observation of energy states , the observer s reference frame is in one of the states as well . \n therefore , the observer observes only the relative difference ( fig . \n [ va ] ( i ) ) . \n however , in the case of consciousness , the observer is observing his or her own reference frame .    in the case of observing energy \n , the vacuum corresponds with the observer observing his or her own reference frame of the ground state energy ( fig . \n [ va ] ( ii ) ) . the observation of the vacuum energy as consciousness in cyclical time may be considered as follows : from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the physical or classical irreversible computation is carried out with energy @xmath0 . \n next , the cyclical time evolution takes place , and , from @xmath5 to @xmath9 , the quantum process is carried with the energy of @xmath0 of negative sea ( fig . \n [ circle ] ) .    in @xcite , \n small and large cycles of time were discussed . in particular , it was discussed that time circulates in small and large cycles in such a way that small cycles of time make up a larger cycle . for example , small cycles of seconds make up a larger cycle of a minute , minutes make up an hour , etc . the cyclical model of consciousness , as in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] , may also be considered as a large cycle . as shown in fig . \n [ cyclical2 ] , while the classical vector chooses , i.e. , one unit of classical computation is carried out in the time forward manner , the quantum vector may evolve backward in time not only a single unit of computation as in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] ( ii ) , but all the way back to big bang as seen in fig . \n [ diracsea ] with @xmath2 number of computations . \n the energy in the process of the classical computation should correspond to classical vacuum energy while the energy corresponding to the negative sea would be @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the number of computations since the big bang , which has been estimated in @xcite as , @xmath18    previously , it was often considered that the vacuum energy predicted from quantum theory may correspond to the observed value of the vacuum energy , which resulted in one of the largest discrepancies between the theory and experimental verification . \n however , as argued above and as a continuation of the specification of the subjective model , the energy calculated from quantum theory should correspond to the energy of the negative sea , or the aether , that fills up the universe as the conscious state of the observer ( fig . [ \n fill ] ) . \n is filled with the dirac - type negative sea of energy @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of computations since the big bang.,title=\"fig : \" ] \n we have discussed the difference between observed and theoretical values in regard to vacuum energy . in particular , we have used the previously proposed subjective model and the cyclical time to discuss that      that is , a classical vacuum should correspond to the unit of computation which is filled with the negative energy of the time - reversal process of irreversible computation since the big bang . \n one of the puzzling aspects in physics has been the seemingly different classical and quantum worlds . the argument presented in this paper explains how classical is connected to quantum in such a manner that it explains the difference between the classical and quantum vacuum energies . \n preskill j. do black holes destroy information ? \n arxiv : hep - th/9209058 . \n reynolds m. axiomatisation and decidability of f and p in cyclical time . \n j phil logic 1994 ; 23 : 197 - 224 . \n riess ag et al . \n observational evidence from supernovae for an accelerating universe and a cosmological constant . \n astron journ 1998 ; 116 : 1009 - 1038 . \n ryden b. introduction to cosmology . \n addison - wesley ; 1st edition , 2002 . \n sol j. cosmological constant and vacuum energy : old and new ideas . \n j phys : conf ser 2013 ; 453 : 012015 . \n song d. non - computability of consciousness . \n neuroquant 2007 ; 5 : 382 - 391 . \n arxiv:0705.1617 [ quant - ph ] . \n song d. unsolvability of the halting problem in quantum dynamics . \n int j theor phys 2008 ; 47 : 1785 - 1791 . \n arxiv : quant - ph/0610047 . \n song d. immeasurability of zero - point energy in the cosmological constant problem . \n int j theor phys 2009 ; 48 : 2147 - 2153 . \n song d. einstein s moon . \n phys usp 2012 ; 55 : 942 - 943 . \n arxiv:1008.2892 [ physics.gen-ph ] . \n song d. negative entropy and black hole information . \n int j theor phys 2014 ; 53 : 1369 - 1374 . \n arxiv:1302.6141 [ physics.gen-ph ] . \n song d. the p versus np problem in quantum physics . \n neuroquant 2014 ; 12 : 350 - 354 . \n arxiv:1402.6970 [ physics.gen-ph ] . \n song d. quantum measurement and observable universe . \n arxiv:1508.03495 [ physics.gen-ph ] . \n song d. remarks on nondeterministic computation , choices , and formal language . \n neuroquant 2016 ; 14:702 - 707 . \n song d. semantics of information . arxiv:1611.02980 [ physics.gen-ph ] . \n song d. comment on information and dualism . submitted to neuroquant 2016 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3710042779982, "RequestID": "939fffd643254a43a421311a0058ffc6", "TotalTokens": 3883}

( [ beta ] ) \n thus , the parameter @xmath2 occurring in the tsallis statistics is shown to be entirely induced by the fluctuations of the parameter of the usual exponential distribution @xcite . following this interpretation , \n the average process employed to obtain @xmath24 characterizes an implicit connection with the tsallis statistics . \n to apply our distribution , eq . \n ( [ q - w ] ) , to investigate experimental and numerical simulated data , we consider the cumulative distribution for @xmath24 , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath44,\\ ] ] with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in connection with the @xmath2-exponential function , the @xmath2-logarithm function \n is usually defined as @xcite @xmath47 thus @xmath48=\\exp_q[\\ln_q(x)]=x$ ] . by using eq . \n ( [ q - rank ] ) , we obtain that the graph of @xmath49 $ ] versus @xmath9 gives a straight line since @xmath50\\,=\\beta\\,ln(t)\\,-\\,\\beta\\ln(\\alpha).\\ ] ] therefore , if a cumulative distribution relative to the dielectric breakdown for a given set of data , @xmath51 , is well described by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , then the @xmath2 parameter present in the @xmath2-logarithm is obtained through a linear adjustment , and the parameter @xmath17 is the slope of the graph . this procedure introduced here \n will be referred as a @xmath2-weibull plot .    to compare the usefulness of the weibull and the @xmath2-weibull distributions , we analyze experimental @xcite and simulation results . \n figure [ fig1](a ) , which is adapted from the work of wu et _ al . _ \n @xcite , shows a curvature in a graph @xmath52 $ ] versus @xmath7 $ ] . \n the variation of this slope is associated with oxide thickness fluctuations . \n in fact , wu _ et al . \n _ @xcite were able to generate this slope variation by performing simulations in which the oxide thickness obeyed a gaussian distribution . \n extrapolation of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles ( conventional experimental window ) to lower failure percentiles leads to an error in @xmath3 projection and , consequently , in projection of reliability . \n it is necessary to use large and time - consuming sample sizes ( thousands of devices ) in order to obtain @xmath3 distributions down to lower percentiles and avoid erroneous projections . \n the same @xmath3 data can be correctly fitted in the entire range of percentiles by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , as shown in fig . [ \n fig1](b ) . in the @xmath2-weibull plot \n , the data follow a straight line . \n we conclude that , by taking the fluctuations of the modal parameter of the weibull distribution into account , one obtains a statistical distribution which completely describes @xmath3 data when oxide fluctuations are present . \n therefore , the @xmath2-weibull distribution allows improved @xmath3 projection for ultra - thin oxides and does not require a very large number of samples , _ \n i.e. _ , correct @xmath3 extrapolation can be performed in the conventional experimental window . \n this is a striking benefit brought by the @xmath2-weibull distribution . \n in addition to correct @xmath3 projection , we have found that the @xmath2-weibull also improves area scaling , another important consideration for reliability studies @xcite . in fig . \n [ fig2](a ) , we have used the data from the work of teramoto _ et al . _ @xcite . \n they studied the time - dependent dielectric breakdown for @xmath10 thin sio@xmath4 oxides with samples areas of @xmath12 and @xmath53 , and subjected to a @xmath54 applied field . \n it is clear , when comparing fig . \n [ fig2](a ) and fig . \n [ fig2](b ) , that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better area scaling than the weibull one , another remarkable benefit . \n when @xmath3 data are plotted in a limited range of percentiles , the differences between the @xmath2-weibull and the weibull distributions become less apparent , but can still be seen . as an example , we consider the simulations performed by sombra _ \n they developed a percolation model to describe the dielectric breakdown of a mos capacitor investigating effects of bias polarity , oxide film thickness and electric field strength . \n the hot electron injection is either through the gate or the substrate . in fig . \n [ fig3](a ) we have performed a linear fit of the simulation data of sombra @xcite with the weibull distribution , while in fig . \n [ fig3](b ) we depict the same data but with a linear fit through the @xmath2-weibull distribution . \n one can see once more that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better fit than the weibull one , for small and large @xmath3 . \n in summary , we conclude that : ( _ i _ ) fluctuation on the modal value is a mechanism to explain deviations from the weibull distribution in reliability studies of electronics devices ; ( _ ii _ ) this fluctuation leads to a generalization of the weibull distribution ( @xmath2-weibull distribution ) and a connection with the tsallis statistics ; and ( _ iii _ ) the generalized weibull distribution leads to a better adjustment of experimental and simulated data in comparison with the weibull one , giving improved @xmath3 extrapolation and area scaling . \n finally , the results presented here can be very useful for an improved description of the dielectric breakdown in the high dielectric constant materials @xcite which will be present in future generations of advanced mos devices . \n the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the brazilian national research council ( cnpq ) under contract cnpq - nanosemimat # 550.015/01 - 9 , and the ministry of planning ( finep ) through ctpetro under contracts # 65.00.02.80.00 and # 5000013/01 - 2 , during the development of this work . \n g. d. wilk , r. m. wallace , and j. m. anthony , j. appl . \n phys . * 89 * , 5243 ( 2001 ) ; r. a. mackee , f. j. walker , m. f. chisholm , phys . \n . lett . * 81 * , 3014 ( 1998 ) ; r. a. mackee , f. j. walker , m. f. chisholm , science * 293 * , 468 ( 2001 ) ; v. fiorentini and g. gulleri , phys . \n 89 * , 6101 ( 2002 ) ; d. muller , t. sorsch , s. moccio , f. baumann , k. evans - lutterdodt , and g. timp , nature * 399 * , 758 ( 1999 ) .                                c. tsallis , j. stat . phys . * 52 * , 479 ( 1988 ) ; c. tsallis , r. s. mendes and a. r. plastino , physica a * 261 * , 534 ( 1998 ) ; c. tsallis , in : s. abe , y. okamoto ( eds . ) , _ nonextensive statistical mechanics and its application _ , lecture notes in physics , springer , heidelberg , 2001 ; see http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br for periodically updated bibliography on the subject .", "StartTimeOffset": 3728192341663, "RequestID": "530cd066a2f542c793c7edc46f86998c", "TotalTokens": 4183}

{"ContextTokens": 4062, "GeneratedTokens": 282, "SynthesizedBody": "the recent discoveries of x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts by the beppo sax satellite @xcite have revolutionized the approach to these phenomena . for the first time since \n their discovery 30 years ago @xcite gamma ray bursts have been identified with sources at other wavelengths . in consequence \n optical afterglows have been discovered @xcite , which lead to identification of host galaxies @xcite . at the time of writing more than a dozen afterglows \n have been identified . \n the optical lightcurves of the grb afteglows decay as a power law @xmath0 with the typical values of the index @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in some cases the host galaxies have been found by observing the flattening of of the lightcurve . \n the underlying steady flux is identified as the emission of the host galaxy . in a few cases \n the host galaxies themselves were found as extended objects . \n this allowed to measure the offset between the location of the gamma - ray burst and the center of the host galaxy . \n a list five grbs and the offsets from their host galaxies is shown in table  [ table1 ] . \n the offsets are generally small and the afterglows lie directly on the host galaxies . in other cases where the host galaxy have been only found from the flattening of the lightcurve we know that the location of the host galaxy and the grb do not differ substantially from the simple fact that the host galaxies have been identified . \n there are two basic categories of theoretical models of the central engines of gamma - ray bursts within the cosmological model . \n the first class connects gamma - ray bursts with mergers of compact objects , e.g. neutron stars and/or black holes . \n there exist numerous scenarios in this set of models , some of them link grbs with the coalescence of a black hole neutron star binary @xcite . in other models like in the recent paper by @xcite the grb events are related to mergers of two neutron stars . \n compact object merger model provides enough energy to power a grb , and it has been showed in the numerical simulations @xcite that the coalescence may last up to a second . \n the analytical estimations of @xcite extend this timescale up to a minute . \n the second class of models @xcite relates grbs to explosions of supermassive stars , so called hypernovae . \n a direct prediction in this class of models is that gamma - ray bursts are related to the star forming regions . \n the relation between the grb location and the host galaxies does not have to be true in the models that relate grbs to compact object mergers . \n tutukov and yungelson have calculated the compact object merger rates , and also found that compact object binaries may travel the distances up to @xmath3kpc before merging . in a more detailed study \n @xcite calculated a population of compact object binaries using the population synthesis method of pols and marinus and then calculated the spatial distribution of mergers in the potentials of galaxies for w few representative masses . \n they found that approximately @xmath4% of mergers take place outside the host galaxies ) . \n they have used the a maxwellian kick velocity distribution with @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 @xcite    in this work we use the the population synthesis code based on @xcite and extended by belczyski and bulik . \n we concentrate on the dependence of the properties of the compact object binaries on the parameters used in the population synthesis code . \n we find that the most important parameter that determines the population of compact object binaries is the kick velocity a neutron star receives at birth , however this distribution is poorly known . \n iben and tutukov claim that the properties of pulsars can be explained by only the recoil velocities with no need for the kicks . \n blaauw and ramachandran find that a single kick velocity of @xmath7kms@xmath6 suffices to reproduce the pulsar population . \n cordes and chernoff proposed a weighted sum two gaussians : 80 percent with the width @xmath8 km  s@xmath6 and 20 percent with the width @xmath9  km  s@xmath6 . \n we outline the model of the binary evolution and propagation in a galactic potential in section  2 . \n the results of the calculation are presented in section  3 and we discuss them in section  4 . \n in order to study the spatial distribution of compact object mergers we use the population synthesis method . \n we use the population synthesis code @xcite which concentrates on the population of massive star binaries , i.e. those that may eventually lead to formation of compact objects and compact object binaries . \n we include the evolution of the binaries due to interaction and mass transfer and also the kicks that a newly born neutron star receives in supernova explosion . \n a binary may be disrupted in each of the supernova events . \n the surviving binaries obtain center of mass velocities , which change their trajectories and may even eject them from their galaxy . \n while the evolution of single stars depends only on their mass and metallicity the evolution of binaries is also a function the initial orbit ( semimajor axis @xmath10 , and eccentricity @xmath11 ) of the two stars . \n we assume that the distribution of the initial parameters can be expressed as a product of distributions of four parameters : the larger star ( primary ) mass @xmath12 , the mass ratio of the less massive to the more massive star in the binary @xmath13 , and the orbital parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e that this quantities are independent . \n the distribution of primary masses used here is @xcite @xmath14 and we adopt a flat distribution of the mass ratio @xmath13 . \n the semi major axis distribution is scale invariant , i.e. @xmath15 with the limits @xmath16 , and we draw the eccentricity from a distribution @xmath17 . \n we assume that the kick velocity distribution is a three dimensional gaussian , and parameterize it with its width @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 we generate population of compact object binaries for a few values of @xmath18 in order to asses the sensitivity of our results to this parameter . \n .grbs with measured offsets from the centers of their host galaxies . [ cols=\"<,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the kick velocity distribution is not very well known . \n therefore , we use the population synthesis code with four values of the kick velocity distribution width : with no kick velocities @xmath20 km  s@xmath6 , and with @xmath21 km  s@xmath6 . \n this covers the range of values this distribution is likely to have . \n this the same approach as adopted in our previous work @xcite . \n the binaries receive kicks for two reasons . \n first , the envelope of the supernova is lost from the system and it carries away some momentum . thus even in the case when there is no kick velocity a binary achieves an additional velocity @xcite . \n second , if the supernova explosion is asymmetric both the newly formed compact object may receive a kick velocity which affects the orbit of the binary after the explosion as well as its center of mass velocity . \n the fate of a binary system in a supernova explosion depends on the value and direction of the kick velocity , on the orbital phase at which the explosion occurs , and on the parameters of the binary : the masses and orbital parameters @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . \n we present the population of compact object binaries in the plane spanned by the center of mass velocity ofter the second supernova expolsion and time to merge in figure  [ vt ] . \n the orbital @xcite effects are isolated and shown in the top left panel of figure  [ vt ] , where we present the results of the simulation with @xmath22 . \n there is a tail of long lived systems with lifetimes much longer than the hubble time and small velocities , stretching outside of the boundaries of the plot to the lifetimes even of @xmath23years . \n these systems originally had large orbital separations , and hardly interacted in the course of their binary lifetime . in the case when there are no kicks the center of mass velocity of the comapct object binary depends on the amount of mass lost in the supernova explosion . in the extreme case of large mass loss , the center of \n mass velocity approaches the orbital velocity at the moment of supernova explosion , and it can never exceed it . \n the velocity of the system increases with increasing mass loss , however the systems that loose too much mass become unbound . \n this is why the lower part of the plot below @xmath24years is empty . \n with increasing the kick velocity also the typical velocity of a system increases and there appear short lived systems in tight orbits . \n they can now survive a large mass loss when the kick velocity has a favorable direction . \n thus as the kick velocity is increased only the tightly bound systems ( with short merger time ) can survive the supernova explosions . \n another effect of the kick velocity is that the long lived systems with @xmath25 much longer than the hubble time , which were present in the case @xmath26 km  s@xmath6 disappear . \n the typical velocity of a system increases with the kick velocity . \n however , the population of the comapct merger binaries is not much affected when the kick velocity becomes large , e.g. changing the kick velocity distribution width from @xmath26 km  s@xmath6 to @xmath7 km  s@xmath6 produces a much stronger effect than going from @xmath27 km  s@xmath6 to @xmath28 km  s@xmath6 . \n most of the systems are disrupted by such high velocities , and the surviving ones are only those for which the kick are not so large and have a favorable direction . \n another effect of increasing the kick velocity is that the typical lifetime of a system becomes smaller . \n when the kick velocity is large only very tight , and/or highly eccentric systems survive , hence the typical lifetime of compact object binaries decreases . \n it should be noted the typical center of mass velocity of the compact object binaries increases roughly linearly with the kick velocity , while the lifetime decreases approximately exponentially .    in figure  [ vt ] \n we also plot following @xcite the lines corresponding to the hubble time ( the dashed line ) , and we mark the region with the stars that will escape from a galactic potential . in order to escape a binary must satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) it has to have a velocity larger than the escape velocity , ( ii ) the distance @xmath29must be larger than the size of the galzxy . \n we also draw the line at @xmath30myrs , to denote the systems that merger within the hubble time . \n all the systems to the right of the solid line in figure  refvt have velocities above @xmath7 km  s@xmath6 , and live long enough to travel further than @xmath31kpc . \n we should also note that although each panel in figure  [ vt ] contans @xmath32 systems , the production rate of compact object binaries decreases exponentially with the increasing kick velocity ( see eq . 13 in belczyski and bulik ) .    in figures  [ distuz ] and  [ distvt ] we present the cumulative distributions of the projected distance from the center of the host galaxy in case ( i ) and from their the place of birth in case ( ii ) , respectively , of the systems that merge within the hubble time . \n when the binaries propagate in the potential of a large galaxy the kick velocity only weakly influences the the distribution of the mergers . below the radius of @xmath33kpc the distribution \n is determined by the potential well . \n this is where all short lived and slow systems merge . \n there exists however a tail of high velocity , long lived systems ( see figure  [ vt ] ) that manage to escape . \n the escaping fraction is a weak function of the kick velocity . \n typically the number of systems that merge further than @xmath31kpc from the center of the host galaxy is @xmath34% , except for the unphysical case of no kick velocities when it drops below @xmath35% .    in the other extreme case of small host galaxies for which we neglect the gravitational potential \n the escaping fraction can be even larger . \n the escaping fraction decreases from @xmath36% for the kick velocity @xmath37 km  s@xmath6 to about @xmath38% for @xmath39 km  s@xmath6 . \n the reason for such behavior is clearly seen from figure  [ vt ] . in the product of center of mass velocity and time to merge the dominant role is played by the fast decrease of the time to merge with the increasing kick velocity @xmath18 . \n these quantitative results are visualized in figures  [ empty - dot ] and  [ gala - dot ] . here \n we show the distribution of @xmath32 mergers around massive galaxy and in the empty space . \n we are showing four panels that cover the scales from @xmath33kpc to @xmath33mpc . in the case of the propagation in a massive galaxy \n we are showing the projection in the plane of the galactic disk so the effects of the rotational velocity and the asymmetry of the potential well are visible . \n both calculations have been done for the case of the kick velocity distribution width @xmath37 km  s@xmath6 . \n we find that a significant fraction i.e. more than @xmath35 percent of compact object mergers take place outside of the host galaxies . \n the figures obtained for our case of no gravitational potential should be considered as an upper limit only . \n in contrast the observations show that the grb afterglows lie on the host galaxies @xcite . \n however , our sample of the observed grbs with afterglows is yet limited to the bursts longer than @xmath40s as bepposax triggers on this timescale . \n long bursts could be connected with the hypernovae - like events and therefore they are closely associated with the galaxies . \n compact object mergers may be connected with the short bursts , although it has been argued that mass transfer in the coalescence of compact object may last much longer @xcite . \n our results are consistent with the calculation by @xcite , for the case of a massive galaxy and the kick velocity distribution width @xmath41 km  s@xmath6 . \n we have verified the dependence of the distribution of compact object mergers on @xmath18 . \n our results show that for the case of massive galaxies the escaping fraction weakly depends on the distribution of kick velocities . \n we include also binaries with objects that are higher mass than the canonical @xmath42 . \n these binaries are formed through accretion from a giant companion onto the neutron star . in this calculation \n the highest mass of a compact object is below @xmath43 . \n the distribution of these more massive binaries is slightly more concentrated around the galaxies . \n it has to be noted that there is a numnber of potential selection effects which may affect the results of this study . assuming that compact objcet mergers are reponsible for grbs there may be qualitative differences between the ns - ns mergers and ns - bh mergers . as indicated above \n , their spatial distribution around host galaxies is different . \n also the typical timescale of the bursts may be different between these two classes . \n gamma - ray bursts form two separate classes ( long vs. short ) with different brightness distributions and spectra ( short burst are harder than the long ones ) . \n so far the study of afterglows has been possible only for the long bursts \n . it may be the case that compact object mergers are connected with the short bursts for which so far no information about the host galaxies exist . \n the host galaxies have been identified in a long observational procedure : a gamma - ray burst lead to identification of a fading x - ray source , and then to discovery of the optical afterglow . \n precise observations of the optical afterglows lead to the disory of host galaxies . \n there are bursts for which the x - ray or optical afterglows were not found . \n since afterglows are usually connected with external shocks , gamma - ray bursts that take place outside of galaxies have much weaker afterglows because of the low density of intergalactic matter . \n begelmann etal . \n begelman and meszaros argue that the afterglow emission depends scales only with the square root of the density of the outside medium . \n the mean external densities measured from the analysis of the known afterglow lightcurves are typically @xmath44  @xmath45 @xcite , while the intergalactic medium may be as rarified as @xmath46@xmath45 . \n hence the afterglow of a burst taking place outside a galaxy may be up to two orders of magnitude weaker than the one in a galaxy . \n it shows that there may be a strong preference against identification of host galaxies for the bursts that take place outside of galaxies \n .    acknowledgments . \n this work has been funded by the following kbn

{"ContextTokens": 1120, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "the understanding of galaxy formation remains a primary goal in astrophysics . within the current accepted scenario of structure formation \n , small galaxies are built up first and larger objects are assembled through the merging of less massive building blocks , in a hierarchical way . in this context , mergers and interactions play a crucial role modifying the properties of galaxies such as their mass distribution and star formation activity and affecting the subsequent evolution of the systems . \n the formation of disc - like systems is still a matter of debate and several scenarios have been proposed in order to explain the growth of these two components and their interactions . \n the simplest scenarios currently accepted for the formation of the bulges are two : the first one establishes that the bulge and the disc are formed independently ( andredakis et al . \n 1995 ) , and the second one assumes that the disc forms first and the bulge emerges from it as a consequence of gas inflow during a period of secular evolution ( courteau et al . \n 1996 ) . \n numerical simulations are a powerful tool to tackle galaxy formation since they can account for the joint evolution of baryons and dark matter in a cosmological framework . \n we use smooth particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulations to investigate the effects of mergers and interactions on the determination of the structural properties of galaxies . \n we analize galactic objects identified from numerical sph simulations that take into account the gravitational and hydrodynamical evolution of the matter in cold dark matter universes . \n we run two simulations with @xmath0 ( s1 ) and @xmath1 ( s2 ) total number of particles and the following cosmological parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( s1)and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( s2 ) , where ( @xmath8 ) . \n the simulated boxes represent cubic volumes of @xmath9 ( s1 ) and @xmath10 ( s2 ) mpc length . \n we select galaxy - like objects ( glos ) at @xmath11 by using a density - contrast criterium and follow their evolution with look - back time , constructing their star formation and merger histories ( see scannapieco & tissera 2003 for details ) . with the aim at investigating the effects of mergers on the structural properties of the systems we perform bulge - disc decompositions to the projected mass surface density of the glos at @xmath11 , and of the progenitors during merger events , assuming an exponential profile for the discs and the srsic law for the bulges . \n galaxy - like objects identified in our simulations are found to have structural parameters similar to those of observed spiral galaxies ( siz et al . \n 2001 ) . \n tissera et al . \n ( 2002 ) showed that during merger events , early gas inflows can be triggered depending on the stability properties of the systems . \n those with shallower potential wells are more likely to suffer gas inflows since they can be more strongly perturbed from the incoming satellite . \n secular evolution phases feed the bulge components which significantly contribute to the stability of the discs . \n the actual fusion of the baryonic cores increases the star formation activity which in turn affect the subsequent properties of the systems . \n understanding the effects of these two processes ( i.e. secular evolution and fusion ) on the growth of the disc and bulge components in galaxies can help us to enlighten the picture of galaxy formation . to this end \n we analize the evolution of the mass distribution of galaxy - like objects during merger events by studying the variation of their structural parameters . \n we find that secular evolution during the orbital decay phase produces the largest changes in the structural parameters of the systems : bulges get larger with respect to the discs and with more exponential profiles . \n these changes are found to be more important in unstable systems with shallower potential wells . \n fusions introduce further modifications in the opposite direction although they are less important . \n we also find that secular evolution phases contribute to establish the observed fundamental relations : after secular evolution , bulges tend to satisfy the observed fundamental plane and the disc components the tully - fisher relation . \n fusions may add some dispersion but do not significantly change them ( smith castelli et al . \n departures from the fundamental relations could be indicating a lack of secular phases . \n our findings suggest that interactions play a fundamental role being able to transform discs into spheroids . \n discs can also survive violent events , being either partially destroyed or just feeded by the colliding object . \n the stability properties of the initial system seem to be a fundamental point in the response of the disc to the incoming satellite . \n other factors such as orbital parameters and relative masses of the colliding objects would also affect the determination of the structural properties of the outcome systems . \n the different possible histories of evolution of galactic systems in hierarchical universes could potentially explain the diversity of galaxies in our universe .", "StartTimeOffset": 3786341361332, "RequestID": "2ef8bf6135e84daa9bfb35bc594ed22b", "TotalTokens": 1257}

{"ContextTokens": 2513, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "rotating radio transients ( rrats ) were first discovered by mclaughlin  ( * ? ? ? \n * ( 2006 ) ) and are characterized by occasional single radio pulses , with no underlying periodicity easily detected , in contrast to typical rotation - powered pulsars . \n the discovery of rrats was surprising and important as it revealed a class of neutron stars that had previously been missed by pulsar surveys , thereby suggesting a potentially enormous increase in the inferred neutron - star birthrate . \n moreover the discovery raised the issue of why some neutron stars show such sporadic emission , whereas others are ` on ' continuously . \n rrats may exhibit up to @xmath01000 periods of separation between detected pulses , and as such are not detected in periodicity searches . \n furthermore , observational biases against detecting rrats suggest that these sources represent a significant fraction of radio - active galactic neutron stars , yet the current known population is very small . today \n @xmath070 rrats are known however the vast majority do not yet have their basic properties measured . \n those rrats whose properties have been measured tend to have longer periods and are mostly seen to lie between the regular pulsars and the magnetars , as shown in the @xmath1 diagram in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] . \n this may suggest an evolutionary link between rrats and other pulsar classes , but with such a small known rrat population , it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding their place within the global pulsar population .    since the initial discovery of the first 11 rrats , there has been a major paradigm shift in radio pulsar searches . \n single - pulse searches are now routine and a large number of new rrat discoveries are being made ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? \n * keane  2010 ) ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , \n a lot of human involvement is required in examining the output of single - pulse searches in order to look for rrat - like patterns . \n this , along with the already present biases against finding rrats , makes expanding and studying the rrat population a difficult task . \n hence , it is imperative to make automated rrat searches a routine part of radio pulsar searching . \n we have developed new post - processing techniques for automatically identifying single bright astrophysical pulses , such as those emitted from rrats . in implementing this search algorithm on data from the green bank telescope 350 mhz drift - scan survey \n , we have discovered 33 new rrat candidates , of which 6 have already been confirmed . \n here we describe these techniques and present our discoveries . \n diagram for all known neutron stars outside of globular clusters . \n the 18 rrats with measured @xmath2 are indicated by triangles , and dots represent other neutron stars . \n lines of constant magnetic field are solid and lines of constant characteristic age are dashed . \n as can be seen , these 18 rrats tend to have longer periods and larger magnetic fields than the bulk of long - period pulsars.,width=283 ] \n we have searched for rrats in data from the green bank telescope ( gbt ) 350 mhz drift - scan survey . \n this survey was conducted over the summer of 2007 , while the azimuth track of the gbt was undergoing repairs , and thus the telescope was stationary at several fixed elevations , collecting data as the sky drifted over it . \n the data were analyzed in 140-s sections , corresponding roughly to the time it takes a point on the sky to pass through the full width half maximum of the telescope beam . \n this survey produced 134 tb of data , covering over 10,000 square degrees of the sky , and has yielded 34 pulsars thus far . for more information on this survey , see @xcite and @xcite . \n these data were then processed using the presto software suite ( @xcite ) , which included radio frequency interference ( rfi ) excision , de - dispersion , searches for periodic signals in the fourier domain , and single - pulse searches . in single - pulse searches , signals in the de - dispersed time series that deviate from the mean \n significantly are identified , and information such as signal - to - noise , time , dispersion measure ( dm ) , and pulse width is recorded . \n diagnostic  single - pulse plots \" summarizing this information are then produced for each beam and saved for human inspection . in this survey , \n the data were divided into 30,000 140-s  pointings \" , producing 120,000 such diagnostic plots ( 4 plots per pointing , each plot spanning a different dm range ) that then required visual examination . \n this is a tedious , time - consuming task , and can thus be a bottleneck in discovering single - pulse sources . \n we have developed an automated search algorithm in order to identify rrat candidates in the output of single - pulse searches described above , eliminating the need for manual inspection of each diagnostic plot produced . \n our algorithm is based on the following concepts :    1 . \n [ dmrange ] a bright signal will be detected over a range of dms , with the strongest detection at the optimal dm and weaker detections above and below this dm . \n [ rfidm0 ] since signals are strongest at the optimal dm , we expect that signals of terrestrial origin ( namely rfi ) will peak at a dm of 0 . \n we can thus classify any signals that peak at dm@xmath00 as not astrophysical and reject them . \n concept ( [ dmrange ] ) means that a given pulse , whether astrophysical or not , will be associated with many statistically significant  single - pulse events \" that will be found in the single - pulse search . \n these events will be spread over a small range of dms , and will occur at approximately the same time . \n the first step in our algorithm is thus to * group * events that belong to the same pulse by checking whether they satisfy this criterion , that is , lie within some small window of dm and time . \n once the single - pulse events in a beam have been divided into groups , we * examine each group s collective properties * in order to decide whether it behaves like an astrophysical pulse , and * rate * it based on these results . \n the first test we employ is group size . \n if a group has too few events , we classify it as noise . \n the following test examines signal - to - noise vs. dm behaviour . from concept ( [ rfidm0 ] ) \n , we expect that a group of events that is due to an rfi signal will have a peak signal - to - noise at dm@xmath00 . \n thus , any groups that satisfy this criterion are classified as rfi . \n finally , we again make use of concept ( [ dmrange ] ) by looking for groups that have peak signal - to - noise at some given ( non - zero ) dm , which then decreases above and below that given dm . \n these groups are classified as likely astrophysical pulses , and depending on the peak signal - to - noise attained , are classified as  likely \" to  very likely \" pulses . \n once the beams have all undergone this search algorithm , those that have been flagged as having  very likely \" pulses are visually examined . for those beams that indeed look like astrophysical sources , \n we then generate  waterfall plots \" , which are frequency vs. time plots that show arrival times of the signal in different frequency bins . \n since astrophysical signals experience a frequency - dependent dispersive delay while propagating through the interstellar medium , we use these waterfall plots as a final means of testing the astrophysical nature of a signal , before deciding whether it is a candidate worthy of follow - up . \n we have processed all 30,000 pointings of the gbt drift - scan survey with the search algorithm described above , resulting in a total of 33 rrat candidates . of the 7 candidates that have been followed up , 6 have been confirmed . \n the remaining sources look extremely promising , based on their strong single - pulse detections , as well as dispersive behaviour shown in waterfall plots . it should be noted that , remarkably , the number of rrat candidates found is comparable to that of regular pulsars ( 34 ) found in the drift -

{"ContextTokens": 3318, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "memory - based learning of classification tasks is a branch of supervised machine learning in which the learning phase consists simply of storing all encountered instances from a training set in memory @xcite . \n memory - based learning algorithms do not invest effort during learning in abstracting from the training data , such as eager - learning ( e.g. , decision - tree algorithms , rule - induction , or connectionist - learning algorithms , @xcite ) do . \n rather , they defer investing effort until new instances are presented . \n on being presented with an instance , a memory - based learning algorithm searches for a best - matching instance , or , more generically , a set of the @xmath0 best - matching instances in memory . \n having found such a set of @xmath0 best - matching instances , the algorithm takes the ( majority ) class with which the instances in the set are labeled to be the class of the new instance . \n pure memory - based learning algorithms implement the classic @xmath0-nearest neighbour algorithm @xcite ; in different contexts , memory - based learning algorithms have also been named lazy , instance - based , exemplar - based , memory - based , case - based learning or reasoning @xcite )    memory - based learning has been demonstrated to yield accurate models of various natural language tasks such as grapheme - phoneme conversion , word stress assignment , part - of - speech tagging , and pp - attachment @xcite . \n for example , the memory - based learning algorithm ib1-ig @xcite , which extends the well - known ib1 algorithm @xcite with an information - gain weighted similarity metric , has been demonstrated to perform adequately and , moreover , consistently and significantly better than _ eager - learning _ algorithms which do invest effort in abstraction during learning ( e.g. , decision - tree learning @xcite , and connectionist learning @xcite ) when trained and tested on a range of morpho - phonological tasks ( e.g. , morphological segmentation , grapheme - phoneme conversion , syllabification , and word stress assignment ) @xcite . \n thus , when learning nlp tasks , the abstraction occurring in decision trees ( i.e. , the explicit _ forgetting _ of information considered to be redundant ) and in connectionist networks ( i.e. , a non - symbolic encoding and decoding in relatively small numbers of connection weights ) both hamper accurate generalisation of the learned knowledge to new material . \n these findings appear to contrast with the general assumption behind eager learning , that data representing real - world classification tasks tends to contains ( i ) redundancy and ( ii ) exceptions : redundant data can be removed , yielding smaller descriptions of the original data ; some exceptions ( e.g. , low - frequency exceptions ) can ( or should ) be discarded since they are expected to be bad predictors for classifying new ( test ) material . \n however , both redundancy and exceptionality can not be computed trivially ; heuristic functions are generally used to estimate them ( e.g. , functions from information theory @xcite ) . \n the lower generalisation accuracies of both decision - tree and connectionist learning , compared to memory - based learning , on the above - mentioned nlp tasks , suggest that these heuristic estimates may not hold for data representing nlp tasks . \n it appears that in order to learn such tasks successfully , a learning algorithm should not forget ( i.e. , explicitly remove from memory ) any information contained in the learning material : it should not abstract from the individual instances \n .    an obvious type of abstraction that is not harmful for generalisation accuracy ( but that is not always acknowledged in implementations of memory - based learning ) is be the straightforward abstraction from tokens to types with frequency information . \n in general , data sets representing natural language tasks , when large enough , tend to contain considerable numbers of duplicate sequences mapping to the same output or class . \n for example , in data representing word pronunciations , some sequences of letters , such as ing at the end of english words , occur hundreds of times , while each of the sequences is pronounced identically , viz . \n /i/. instead of storing all individual sequence tokens in memory , each set of identical tokens can be safely stored in memory as a single sequence type with frequency information , without loss of generalisation accuracy @xcite . \n thus , forgetting instance tokens and replacing them by instance types may lead to considerable computational optimisations of memory - based learning , since the memory that needs to be searched may become considerably smaller . \n given the safe , performance - preserving optimisation of replacing sets of instance tokens by instance types with frequency information , a next step of investigation into optimising memory - based learning is to measure the effects of _ forgetting instance types _ on grounds of their exceptionality , the underlying idea being that the more exceptional a task instance type is , the more likely it is that it is a bad predictor for new instances . \n thus , exceptionality should in some way express the unsuitability of a task instance type to be a best match ( nearest neighbour ) to new instances : it would be unwise to copy its associated classification to best - matching new instances . in this paper \n , we investigate three criteria for estimating an instance type s exceptionality , and removing instance types estimated to be the most exceptional by each of these criteria . \n the criteria investigated are    1 . \n typicality of instance types ; 2 .   class prediction strength of instance types ; 3 . \n friendly - neighbourhood size of instance types ; 4 . \n random ( to provide a baseline experiment ) . \n we base our experiments on a large data set of english word pronunciation . \n we briefly describe this data set , and the way it is converted into an instance base fit for memory - based learning , in section  [ data ] . in section  [ experimental ] we describe the settings of our experiments and the memory - based learning algorithm ib1-ig with which the experiments are performed . \n we then turn to describing the notions of typicality , class - prediction strength , and friendly - neighbourhood size , and the functions to estimate them , in section  [ criteria ] . \n section  [ results ] provides the experimental results . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the obtained results and formulate our conclusions . \n converting written words to stressed phonemic transcription , i.e. , word pronunciation , is a well - known benchmark task in machine learning @xcite . \n we define the task as the conversion of fixed - sized instances representing parts of words to a class representing the phoneme and the stress marker of the instance s middle letter . to generate the instances , \n windowing is used @xcite . \n table  [ overall - windows - ex ] displays example instances and their classifications generated on the basis of the sample word booking . \n classifications , i.e. , phonemes with stress markers ( henceforth pss ) , are denoted by composite labels . \n for example , the first instance in table  [ overall - windows - ex ] , _ _ _ book , maps to class label /b/1 , denoting a /b/ which is the first phoneme of a syllable receiving primary stress . \n in this study , we chose a fixed window width of seven letters , which offers sufficient context information for adequate performance , though extension of the window decreases ambiguity within the data set @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n figure  [ edited - gs ] displays the generalisation accuracies in terms of incorrectly classified test instances obtained with all performed experiments . the leftmost point in the figure , \n from which all lines originate , indicates the performance of ib1-ig when trained on the full data set of 222,601 types , viz . \n 6.42% incorrectly classified test instances ( when computed in terms of incorrectly pronounced test words , ib1-ig pronounces 64.61 of all test words flawlessly ) . \n the line graph representing the four experiments in which instance types are removed randomly can be seen as the baseline graph . \n it can be expected that removing instances randomly leads to a degradation of generalisation performance . \n the upward curve of the line graph denoting the experiments with random selection indeed shows degrading performance with increasing numbers of left - out instance types . \n the relative decrease in generalisation accuracy is 2.0% when 1% of the training material is removed randomly , 3.8% with 2% random removal , 10.7% with 5% random removal , and 20.7% with 10% random removal . \n =    surprisingly , the only experiments showing lower performance degradation than removal by random selection are those with class - prediction strength ; the other criteria for removing exceptional instances lead to worse degradations . it does not matter whether instance types are removed on grounds of their typicality : apparently , a markedly low , neutral , or high typicality value indicates that the instance type is ( on average ) important , rather than removable . \n the same applies to friendly - neighbourhood size : instances with small neighbourhood sizes appear to contribute significantly to performance on test material . \n it is remarkable that the largest errors with 1% and 2% removal are obtained with the friendly - neighbourhood size criterion : it appears that on average , the instances with few or no nearest neighbours are important in the classification of test material . \n when using class - prediction strength as removal criterion , performance does not degrade until about 5% of the instance types with the lowest strength are removed from memory . \n the reason is that class - prediction strength is the only criterion that detects minority ambiguities , i.e. , instance types with prediction strength 0.0 , that can not contribute to classification since they are always overshadowed by their counterpart instance types with majority classes , even for their own classification . in the training \n set , 9,443 instance types are minority ambiguities , i.e. , 4.2% of the instance types ( accounting for 3.8% of the instance tokens in the original token set ) . \n thus , among the tested methods for reducing the memory needed for storing an instance base in memory - based learning , only two are performance - preserving while accounting for a substantial reduction in the amount of memory needed by ib1-ig :    1 . \n replacing instance tokens by instance types accounts for a reduction of about 63% of memory needed to store instances , excluding the memory needed to store frequency information . \n when frequency information is stored in two bytes per instance type , the memory reduction is about 54% . \n removing instance types that are minority ambiguities on top of the type / token - reduction accounts only for an additional memory reduction of 2% , i.e. , for a total memory reduction of 65% ; 56% with two - byte frequency information stored per instance . \n as previous research has suggested @xcite , keeping full memory in memory - based learning of word pronunciation strongly appears to yield optimal generalisation accuracy . \n the experiments in this paper show that optimisation of memory use in memory - based learning while preserving generalisation accuracy can only be performed by ( i ) replacing instance tokens by instance types with frequency information , and ( ii ) removing minority ambiguities . \n both optimisations can be performed straightforwardly ; minority ambiguities can be traced with less effort than by using class - prediction strength . \n our implementation of ib1-ig described in @xcite already makes use of this knowledge , albeit partially ( it stores class distributions with letter - window types ) . \n we note that with @xmath1 ( in our tested implementation of ib1-ig , @xmath2 ) , removing minority ambiguities may distort performance , since taking more than single nearest neighbours into account may allow for minority ambiguities to play a constructive role in classification . \n our results also show that atypicality , non - typicality , and typicality @xcite , and friendly - neighbourhood size are all estimates of exceptionality that indicate the importance of instance types for classification , rather than their removability . as far as these estimates of exceptionality \n are viable , our results suggest that exceptions should be kept in memory and not be thrown away .      * \n the tested criteria can be employed as instance weights as in each @xcite and pebls @xcite , rather than as criteria for instance removal . \n instance weighting may add relevant information to similarity matching , and may improve ib1-ig s performance rather than just preserving it . \n * the tested implementation of ib1-ig performs a @xmath0-nn search through instance space with @xmath2 . \n when @xmath3 , ib1-ig s performance may change , as well as the effect of applying the instance - removal techniques tested here . removing instances from memory may have a less drastic effect when more instance types at more distances are allowed to match a new instance . \n daelemans , w. 1996 . \n abstraction considered harmful : lazy learning of language processing . in h.  j. van den herik and a.  weijters , editors , _ proceedings of the sixth belgian  dutch conference on machine learning _ \n , pages 312 , maastricht , the netherlands . matriks . \n daelemans , w. and a.  van den bosch \n generalisation performance of backpropagation learning on a syllabification task . in m. \n f.  j. drossaers and a.  nijholt , editors , _ twlt3 : connectionism and natural language processing _ , pages 2737 , enschede . \n twente university . \n daelemans , w. , a.  weijters , and a.  van den bosch . \n empirical learning of natural language processing tasks . \n lecture notes in artificial intelligence , , number 1224 , pages 337344 . \n berlin : springer - verlag . \n rumelhart , d.  e. , g.  e. hinton , and r.  j. williams . \n learning internal representations by error propagation . in d. \n e. rumelhart and j.  l. mcclelland , editors , _ parallel distributed processing : explorations in the microstructure of cognition _ \n , volume 1 : foundations . \n cambridge , ma : the mit press , pages 318362 .            , a. , w.  daelemans , and a.  weijters . \n morphological analysis as classification : an inductive - learning approach . in k. \n oflazer and h.  somers , editors , _ proceedings of the second international conference on new methods in natural language processing , nemlap-2 , ankara , turkey _ , pages 7989 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3890201671230, "RequestID": "53de4346f0b34b46b96fc188f1da6ecd", "TotalTokens": 3524}

loss phenomena are common in the earliest stages of stellar evolution . \n this activity can be traced by water maser emission ( rodrguez et al . \n moreover these masers provide a good characterization of the age of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , since class 0 sources are the most probable candidates to harbor this emission ( furuya et al . \n 2001 ) .    in order to diagnose the physical conditions around ysos , and study the dynamics and the stage of evolution , we have analyzed the properties of ccs , nh@xmath5 , and water masers in the cloud surrounding the far - infrared source b1-irs ( iras 03301 + 3057 ) , a class 0 source ( hirano et al . \n 1997 ) located in the b1 molecular cloud . \n simultaneous observations of the j@xmath6=2@xmath7 - 1@xmath8 transition of ccs ( rest frequency = 22345.388 mhz ) and the 6@xmath9 - 5@xmath10 transition of h@xmath11o ( rest frequency = 22235.080 mhz ) were carried out on 2003 april 4 using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( usa ) in its d configuration .    we have also processed vla archive data of the nh@xmath5(1,1 ) transition ( rest frequency = 23694.496 mhz ) . the observations were made on 1988 august 13 , with the d configuration . \n in addition to all these radio data , we have retrieved a k - band image from the image data of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , to get a better position for the infrared source . \n this image was processed with aips , and convolved with a gaussian of 5@xmath1 fwhm , to search for extended emission . \n the most interesting characteristics of the ccs emission are its clumpy spatial distribution and the observed velocity gradient \n . there are three main clumps surrounding the central source , all of them are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the b1 core ( @xmath12 = 6.3 km s@xmath13 , hirano et al . \n the molecular gas in all these clumps shows clear velocity gradients , with less redshifted velocities at positions closer to the central object ( see fig . \n the ammonia emission is very extended ( @xmath14 ) and clumpy . \n the general tendency observed consists in a spatial anticorrelation with respect to the ccs emission , never reported before at such small scales ( @xmath04@xmath1 , 1400 au at 350 pc ) . \n we think that this anticorrelation is related to the chemical evolution of the source , but we need to continue with this kind of studies in other sources similar to b1-irs to derive consistent conclusions about the meaning of this distribution . \n our water maser observation shows a cluster of 23 spots , most of them are redshifted with respect to the main cloud velocity . \n they form an elongated structure ( see fig 2 ) , with a length of @xmath0 1.@xmath13 ( 455 au at 350 pc ) . \n we have detected a point - like source at 2 @xmath4 m from the 2mass archive . \n convolving the k - band image with a gaussian of 5@xmath1 fwhm , we have noticed an extended emission elongated south west from the point source . \n the point - like source detected at 2 @xmath4 m is located inside the error box of the iras source ( see fig 3 ) , at a distance of @xmath15 6@xmath1 from the iras catalog position and at @xmath161@xmath1 ( 350 au ) from the water masers . due to their proximity \n , it is very probable that this 2 @xmath4 m source is the exciting source of the maser emission and of the molecular outflow . \n the extended ir emission detected in the k - band is a reflection nebula elongated in the same direction as the water masers . \n our dynamical calculations reveal that motions of the water masers are unbound , since a mass of @xmath1712 m@xmath18 within 175 au would be needed to bind them . \n such a high mass is not consistent with our nh@xmath5 and ccs data . \n due to their proximity to the exciting source , and the shape and size of the distribution of the masers , it is very likely that the maser emission delineates the inner ( 1@xmath1 ) part of the jet that is driving the co outflow , near b1-irs and detected by @xcite . \n the velocity pattern observed in the ( redshifted ) ccs clumps can be interpreted in terms of infalling clumps which are strongly interacting with the outflow . \n what we see could be foreground ccs clumps falling toward the central source , but being stopped by the wind , explaining in this way the less redshifted velocities observed in the ccs lines at positions closer to the central source ( fig . \n however , an alternative possibility is that we could be observing the ccs clumps in the background moving away from the source and being accelerated by the molecular outflow . \n the moderately - high velocity blueshifted co emission detected by @xcite was proposed to be in a near pole - on configuration due to the position of the iras source with respect to the outflow , which was located just at the center of the blueshifted emission ( fig . \n 3 ) .      first , \n the 2 @xmath4 m point - like source , which is probably powering the outflow ( as suggested by its association with the water masers ) , is not located at the center but at the tip of the blueshifted co emission . \n the extended 2 @xmath4 m emission is elongated in the same direction that the cluster of water masers , and it is coincident with the shape of the co outflow . \n this coincidence further reinforces that the 2 @xmath4 m source marks the position of the powering source , and that the blueshifted lobe of the outflow is oriented towards the southwest of it . \n moreover the velocity gradient of the ccs can not be explained by a pole - on outflow . \n an outflow in the plane of the sky , however , could sweep the ccs material providing the velocity gradient observed . \n the geometry on the plane of the sky is reinforced by the lack of a velocity gradient of the water masers along its jet -

{"ContextTokens": 3777, "GeneratedTokens": 98, "SynthesizedBody": "a key motivation for tev scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is that it provides a natural dark matter candidate if the lightest neutralino is the lsp . \n however the regions of parameter space that yield neutralino dark matter in agreement with wmap look very restricted . \n we recently studied the naturalness of dark matter in @xcite . \n questions of fine - tuning have long been considered in the case of electroweak symmetry breaking . in many of these studies \n the degree of fine - tuning required was quantified through a measure of the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the input parameters of the mssm @xmath2 . \n we use a similar measure @xcite to quantify the degree of fine - tuning required of the mssm parameters to produce an lsp that reproduces the observed dark matter relic density : @xmath3 we take the total tuning of a point to be @xmath4 . \n the calculation of @xmath5 primarily depends on @xmath2 through their effect on the annihilation cross - section of the lightest neutralino @xmath6 . \n this is primarily determined by the mass and composition of @xmath6 . \n this in turn is determined by diagonalising the neutralino mass matrix at low energy . \n the matrix depends upon @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . \n if one of these is much lighter than the others @xmath6 will be primarily of that form . \n this allows us to divide up the mssm parameter space depending on the composition of @xmath6 . \n a wino lsp ( @xmath10 ) or higgsino lsp ( @xmath11 ) annihilates very efficiently , resulting in too little dark matter , @xmath12 . \n a bino lsp ( @xmath13 ) annihilates primarily via t - channel slepton exchange . \n this process is only efficient for light sleptons and so bino lsps generally result in too large a relic @xmath14 .    therefore to fit the observed dark matter density we are required to move to unusual regions of the parameter space . \n one possibility is to consider a mixed lsp . \n if we have a bino lsp with just enough of either wino or higgsino mixed in , we can fit @xmath15 . \n this is the so called `` well - tempered '' neutralino championed in @xcite . \n alternatively we can consider a bino lsp in which the annihilation cross - section is enhanced via some means . \n this can occur in a few different ways . \n firstly , if there are light sfermions , t - channel sfermion is enhanced . \n secondly if @xmath16 the neutralinos can annihilate to an on - shell boson . \n finally if the nlsp is quasi - degenerate in mass with the lsp , there will be a significant nlsp number density at freeze out and we must factor in annihilations of the nlsp into our calculations of the susy relic density . \n all of these effects can enhance annihilation of a bino lsp to the extent that we fit the observed dark matter relic density . \n we would expect each region to exhibit a different sensitivity to the mssm input parameters . to study these regions we take 4 different sets of boundary conditions on the mssm input parameters @xmath2 at @xmath17 , beginning with the familiar case of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) . \n the rest of this talk is set out as follows . in section [ cmssm ] \n we consider the cmssm , which provides us with a useful reference point against which the subsequent non - universal cases may be compared . in section [ scalar ] \n we allow the third family soft sfermion and higgs mass squared to vary independently . in section [ gauge ] \n we consider neutralino dark matter with non - universal gaugino masses , but with a universal soft scalar mass . in section [ scalargauge ] \n we consider _ both _ the effects of including an independent third family sfermion mass squared _ and _ non - universal soft gaugino masses . \n section [ conc ] concludes the talk . \n the cmssm has 4 free inputs : @xmath18 @xmath19 is a common scalar mass that sets the soft masses of the sfermion and higgs sectors . \n @xmath20 is a common gaugino mass . \n @xmath21 sets the soft susy breaking trilinear coupling . \n @xmath22 is the ratio of the higgs vevs . \n finally the requirement that the model provide radiative electroweak symmetry breaking determines the magnitude of the susy conserving higgs mass @xmath9 but leaves the sign as a free parameter . \n the mass and composition of the lightest neutralino is determined by diagonalising a mass matrix that depends upon the parameters @xmath23 at the electroweak scale . in the cmssm @xmath24 at the gut scale . as running effects mean that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , gaugino mass unification sets @xmath27 . therefore , \n unless @xmath28 , the lightest neutralino will be dominantly bino .    in fig . \n [ fig : cmssm ] we consider the @xmath29 plane of the cmssm parameter space with @xmath30 . across this parameter space \n @xmath6 is bino . \n this generally results in @xmath31 . \n however at low @xmath19 the @xmath32 becomes light . in the light ( green ) region @xmath33 and the region \n is ruled out as this would result in a charged lsp . along the edge of this region @xmath34 . \n this means that at the time of freeze out there would have been a large number density of @xmath32 alongside the @xmath6 , allowing many more annihilation channels than are open for neutralinos alone . \n this results in a significant decrease of the neutralino relic density . in the multicoloured strip that lies alongside the @xmath32 lsp region , this coannihilation process results in @xmath35 . \n the varying colours of this strip represent the value of @xmath36 , defined by the colour legend on the right . \n coannihilation occurs when the lsp and nlsp are close in mass . as a result \n , the efficiency of coannihilation processes is highly sensitive to the mass difference @xmath37 . \n if these masses are determined by separate parameters we would expect that a large degree of tuning would be required to fit the observed dark matter density . in the coannihilation strip of fig . \n [ fig : cmssm ] the nlsp is the stau . \n the stau mass is set at the gut scale by @xmath19 and the neutralino mass is set by @xmath20 . as these are independent parameters , we would expect the @xmath38 coannihilation region to exhibit considerable fine - tuning . \n the colour coding of the coannihilation strip shows a tuning of @xmath39 , considerably lower than would be expected if @xmath40 and @xmath41 were unrelated . \n the smallness of the tuning comes from the fact that along the coannihilation strip @xmath42 . \n the running of the right handed slepton masses are strongly dependent on @xmath7 . \n when @xmath19 is small , the dominant contribution to the low energy @xmath32 mass is via this running contribution from @xmath7 . \n thus in this region of the cmssm @xmath40 depends strongly on @xmath20 , resulting in a correlation of the masses of the neutralino and the stau at low energy . \n it is this correlation of the masses that results in the low tuning observed . \n though we do not show it here , we have also investigated the other regions of the cmssm that fit @xmath15 . for large @xmath19 @xmath9 becomes small and we have a bino / higgsino lsp . \n we find that such regions exhibit a tuning @xmath43 , less natural than the coannihilation strip . for large @xmath22 we can also access a region in which @xmath44 . \n this allows for neutralino annihilation via the production of an on - shell pseudoscalar higgs boson . \n we find such an annihilation channel to require a tuning @xmath45 . finally at large @xmath22 \n the running of the @xmath32 mass is no longer dominated by @xmath7 . \n this breaks the correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath40 at low energies and results in the coannihilation strip that requires a tuning @xmath46 . \n this bears out our expectations that coannihilation should require significant tuning to achieve in normal circumstances . \n our first move away from the universality of the cmssm is to relax the universality between the generations of sfermions , setting the soft masses to be : @xmath47    this allows us to vary the 3rd family sfermion and higgs mass squareds separately from the 1st and 2nd families . \n this allows us to have light 1st and 2nd family sfermions without violating lep bounds on the lightest higgs . \n in such a region we will also have a normal mass hierarchy ( nmh ) in which the 1st family sfermions are the lightest and the 3rd family sfermions are the heaviest , in contrast to the inverted mass hierarchy found in the case of universal soft scalar masses .    in fig . \n [ fig : scalar1 ] we display the @xmath29 plane for @xmath48 tev , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . by increasing the soft mass of the higgs bosons to @xmath51 \n the lep bound has moved down to @xmath52 . as before we have a coannihilation strip but as @xmath53 , the coannihilation here is with selectrons and smuons rather than the stau .    as before the coannihilation strip exhibits a tuning @xmath54 across much of its length . \n this drops to @xmath55 for @xmath56 . \n this decrease has two causes . \n firstly , for @xmath57 we can access @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , the mass of @xmath60 and @xmath61 \n are almost entirely determined by the running effects from @xmath7 resulting in a strong correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath41 . \n this decreases the tuning required to provide coannihilation . secondly , \n as we move to low @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we decrease the mass of the sleptons themselves , enhancing neutralino annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange . indeed at point s2 t - channel slepton exchange accounts for @xmath63 of the annihilation . \n the cross - section for t - channel slepton exchange varies slowly with the mass of the exchanged slepton and is relatively insensitive to other parameters . \n therefore it requires little or no tuning to achieve . by maximising annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange \n we minimise the required tuning . \n we now relax the constraint of universal gaugino masses . by allowing @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath64 to vary \n independently we can control the bino / wino mixture of @xmath6 . \n @xmath64 also has a strong effect on the running of the higgs masses so by keeping @xmath64 large we can avoid the lep bound on the lightest higgs .    in fig . \n [ fig : gauge1 ] we show the @xmath65 plane for @xmath66 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . \n in contrast to previous figures there are a large number of strips that agree with @xmath15 . \n the strip running from g2 to g3 is the stau coannihilation strip we have seen before . \n the tuning of this strip agrees with our previous findings in the case of the cmssm . \n the strip that runs from g3 through g4 corresponds to a well - tempered bino / wino neutralino . \n as this strip exhibits a tuning of order 30 we once again find that such `` well - tempered '' regions are less natural than coannihilation strips . at low @xmath7 \n there are two broken vertical lines . \n these correspond to neutralino annihilation via the production of an on - shell @xmath67 or @xmath68 . \n the @xmath68 resonance stretches to @xmath69 but is too thin for this plot to resolve . \n this channel requires tunings @xmath70 and so can not be considered natural . \n finally , the yellow region that incorporates the point g1 represents annihilation solely via t - channel slepton exchange . \n this region requires a tuning @xmath71 and represents supernatural dark matter . \n finally we relax both the universality of the gaugino masses and the universality between sfermion generations at the same time . \n this allows us to test the robustness of our findings in each case against further non - universality . \n it also allows us to study a region in which @xmath72 and the lightest neutralino is a `` maximally - tempered '' bino / wino / higgsino .    in fig . \n [ fig : scalargauge2 ] we show the @xmath65 plane with @xmath66 , @xmath73 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . at low @xmath7 \n we find the @xmath68 and @xmath67 resonances as before . \n the new feature is the line at @xmath74 that incorporates the point sg3 . throughout this region @xmath6 \n is a mix of bino , wino and higgsino . at point \n sg3 the wino and higgsino components are roughly equal resulting in a maximally - tempered neutralino . \n this region exhibits a low tuning @xmath75 , considerably below that required for either bino / wino or bino / higgsino neutralinos . \n we have studied the naturalness of the annihilation channels that allow mssm neutralinos to account for the observed dark matter density . within the four different sets of gut scale boundary conditions considered , these annihilation channels each display characteristic degrees of fine - tuning . \n the largest tunings ( @xmath36 up to @xmath76 ) appear for annihilation via on - shell production of higgs bosons . \n moderate tunings @xmath77 are required for `` well - tempered '' neutralinos or slepton coannihilation with uncorrelated masses . \n the most natural annihilation channel is annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange . \n we have also found that certain rge effects can result in surprising drops in the tuning for different channels . \n this is clearest in the case of slepton coannihilation for low @xmath19 and @xmath22 . in this case \n the mass of both particles is dominated by @xmath7 and the low energy masses are correlated . \n this results in almost natural coannihilation , which refutes the conclusions of @xcite . \n these results have recently been extended to the case of a type i string inspired model @xcite . \n in such a model the input parameters differ from those of the mssm and the characteristic tunings of different annihilation channels can vary . \n s.  f.  king and j.  p.  roberts , arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3831, "GeneratedTokens": 237, "SynthesizedBody": "the large abundance spread seen in the red giant branch ( rgb ) of @xmath0 cen has long been recognized as one of the unique features of this peculiar milky way globular cluster . \n recent photometric analyses of the @xmath0 cen rgb ( e.g. , lee et al .  1999 ; pancino et al . \n 2000 , pfbpz hereafter ; majewski et al .  2000a , \n m00a hereafter ) indicate a metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) stretching from [ fe / h]@xmath9 to perhaps as high as [ fe / h]=@xmath10 . \n this spread , together with clear evidence for a 2 - 4 gyr age spread ( hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) as well as other unusual characteristics relating to its large mass , elongated shape , and internal and external dynamics ( see summary in m00a ) , suggests that @xmath0 cen may represent an important transitional link between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies . \n here we revisit the m00a analysis of the @xmath0 cen mdf with the addition of new membership data for correcting sample contamination and an improved photometric metallicity calibration . \n we have imaged eight pointings of @xmath0 cen in the washington @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters with the swope 1-m telescope and a site ccd ( fig .  1 ) . \n the data were reduced using standard routines , and daophot ii and allframe ( stetson 1994 ) was used for psf photometry . \n our resulting catalogue of stars is not complete in the core ( see fig .  1 ) due to crowding and a conservative cut on stellar profile shape . \n analysis was further limited to stars with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mag , reducing the catalogue of 223,110 photometered stars to 52,923 stars . outside the core ( @xmath14 ) , our data are complete to past the main sequence turnoff ( fig .  2 ) . \n to create an @xmath0 cen mdf , we first isolate its upper giant branch ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to limit our analysis to where we have the greatest resolution in photometric metallicities , and to reduce contamination from asymptotic giant branch stars ( fig .  2 ) . \n this cut and the photometric error cut above combine to make the present analysis much more conservative than what we presented in m00a  our goal here is to search for mdf peaks that would tend to be washed out under the more liberal criteria used previously . \n while the selected cmd region is dominated by @xmath0 cen rgb stars , we want to remove contamination by milky way field stars . \n the @xmath3 filter samples the strength of the mgh+mgb feature at 5150 , which is greatly enhanced in dwarf stars ( fig .  3 ) . via the ( @xmath17 , @xmath5 ) \n diagram ( fig . \n 3b ) , we can eliminate most foreground dwarf stars from the giant star sample ( majewski et al . \n remaining field giants are removed statistically (  3 ) . \n our mdf is based on photometric metallicities derived for @xmath0 cen stars as shown in fig . \n 3 . to the extent that magnesium tracks iron \n , we can derive rough [ fe / h ] estimates for @xmath0 cen giant stars due to the secondary sensitivity of ( @xmath5 ) to metallicity . \n isometallicity curves in the two - color diagram ( fig . \n 3 ) are rgb loci from synthetic colors ( paltoglou & bell 1994 ) calibrated to fit stars with spectroscopically determined [ fe / h ] from suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) as discussed in majewski et al . \n ( 2000b ) . \n stars coded by these photometric metallicities are plotted in the rgb cmd of @xmath0 cen in fig . \n @xmath18 isochrones ( yi et al .  2001 ) for old ( 13 - 15 gyr ) giants , converted to the washington system by matching the output @xmath19 and log @xmath20 from @xmath18 to the corresponding values in the tabulated synthetic washington colors by bessell ( 2001 ) , are also provided for comparison ( fig . \n the initial mdf is constructed using these derived photometric metallicities ( fig . \n the @xmath18 isochrones shown in fig . \n 4 match metallicities that correspond to major mdf peaks in fig .  5 . \n in general , the derived photometric abundances for stars track the position of isochrones of corresponding metallicity in the cmd , but of course there is scatter . \n some scatter is due to inherent limitations of photometric abundances combined with observational errors , but a significant source of scatter may derive from the intrinsic 1 dex spread in [ mg / fe ] in @xmath0 cen giants ( smith et al . \n 2000 ) . nevertheless , we believe the data to be sufficiently reliable to reveal gross characteristics of the mdf . \n we could further limit the mdf to only known @xmath0 cen members , but these are a small fraction of our data set and , moreover , this smaller subsample is not unbiased with respect to [ fe / h ] . \n however , we can correct our mdf statistically by taking advantage of the available cluster membership data to scale each metallicity bin by the proportion of @xmath0 cen members found among stars in that bin having membership data ( fig . \n spectroscopic membership data are derived from suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) , norris et al . \n ( 1996 ) , and our own work . \n our spectra , centered on the calcium infrared triplet , were obtained with the las campanas dupont 2.5 m @xmath21 modspec ( see m00a ) and the ctio 4-m @xmath21 hydra / loral 3k . in total , we have obtained 68 new spectra of candidate rgb stars in the fig . 4 sample , among which we identify 49 members . \n additional membership data were obtained by matching our data to the proper motion catalogue of van leeuwen et al . \n ( 2000 ) , and adopting as members all stars with @xmath22 probabilities from that work . using all membership criteria , a total of 176 stars out of 215 stars in our fig . \n 4 sample were found to be @xmath0 cen members ( fig . \n the mdf corrected by fractional membership is shown in fig . \n 6 .    with the intention of reducing errors in derived [ fe / h ] \n , we have adopted a much more conservative sample selection here than we used in m00a . \n the result is an mdf that is less smoothly varying , with narrower , more defined peaks , than our previous mdf . \n no doubt the width of the peaks are still exaggerated by observational errors , but they have now been reduced sufficiently that the new corrected mdf ( fig . 6 ) shows three distinct peaks at [ fe / h ] = @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . \n these peaks agree well with peaks identified by pfbpz at [ fe / h]=@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , and by lee et al . \n ( 1999 ) at [ fe / h]=@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 , and the overall range of [ fe / h ] is consistent with the spread found by norris et al . \n ( 1996 ) . however , like lee et al . , while we also find evidence for @xmath0 cen members as metal rich as [ fe / h]@xmath27 , fig . \n 6 does not show an additional mdf _ peak _ at [ fe / h ] = @xmath10 , corresponding to the metal rich ,  rgb - a \" giant branch identified by pfbpz . \n surely some of the most metal rich rgb candidates from fig . 5 may have been accidentally  corrected out \" of the mdf in fig . \n 6 as a result of bad luck in finding no members among the statistically small number of stars with these metallicities available for the membership correction analysis . \n indeed , the impact that small number statistics can have on the correction process is demonstrated by the results of our previous analysis ( m00a ) in which we had found almost _ no _ @xmath0 cen members among any star with derived photometric [ fe / h ] @xmath28 , which resulted in a corrected mdf terminating near _ that _ abundance limit and completely eliminating the now obvious @xmath8 dex peak from that previous analysis . \n but even given the lesson of this experience , the more likely reason that we do not see as high a relative frequency of metal rich stars in the fig . \n 6 mdf compared to the frequency identified in the pfbpz survey is because , as these authors point out , their metal - rich  rgb - a \" stars are concentrated to the inner 6 arcmin of the cluster , a radius within which the present analysis faces severe incompleteness . \n however , we have found that in a less conservatively selected subsample that admits more stars in the cluster core we can see the  rgb - a \" in the cmd ( indeed , a trace of it can be seen in figs . 2 and 4 ) , \n and we have even confirmed radial velocity membership for eight of these metal - rich stars ( almost all within 9 arcmin )  unfortunately they are not admitted to the subsample under discussion here . \n thus , the mdf we have constructed in fig . \n 6 must not be taken to represent the mdf of the core of @xmath0 cen , but rather it more closely approximates the mdf outside the core . \n we note the existence of at least one further bias in our mdf , which relates to age / metallicity differences in the fractional lifetime of rgb stars beyond our @xmath17 color limit . \n we hope to address this in future work . \n it is well known that @xmath0 cen does not conform with most globular clusters in a variety of ways ( see m00a ) : it is the most massive cluster , it shows substantial rotation and flattening , and , of course , it has a large metallicity spread . \n several theories about the origin of @xmath0 cen have been proposed , including that it is a rare cluster that ( for some reason ) encountered substantial self - enrichment , that it is the product of the merger of two stellar systems , that it is the remains of a disrupted dwarf spheroidal , and even that it derived from some amalgam of these possibilities . \n that @xmath0 cen seems to have at least _ three _ primary enrichment peaks and an overall [ fe / h ] spread from at least @xmath290.4 to @xmath292.0 dex , coupled with claims for an age spread of up to 4 gyr in the cluster s main sequence turn - off ( hughes & wallerstein 2000 ) , makes a simple two cluster merger hypothesis unlikely ( see also norris et al . \n confronted by the difficulties of multiple metallicity populations and motivated by the relative spatial distributions of these populations , pfbpz propose a more complicated scenario  the merger of two systems with at least one of the systems having undergone self - enrichment and sinking into the center of @xmath0 cen . for the merged , self - enriched entity , which is intended to account for the two intermediate as well as the most metal rich populations , pfbpz propose a giant molecular cloud or a gas - rich protocluster . \n however , a number of aspects of @xmath0 cen lead one to suspect its closer association with dwarf galaxies . for example , the  peaky \" mdf of @xmath0 cen bears great resemblance to the burst - like , multiple populations seen in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( grebel 1997 ) . \n interestingly , the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy shows a similarly large ( and punctuated ) spread in [ fe / h ] to @xmath0 cen ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) . for a variety of reasons , including the similarity in mdfs as well as the fact that the mass of @xmath0 cen is comparable to that of the globular m54 , which appears to be the core of sgr , it has been proposed ( e.g. , lee et al .  1999 , m00a ) that @xmath0 cen may be the remnant nucleus of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy analogous to the sgr system . as pointed out by shetrone et al . \n ( 2001 ) , for this model of @xmath0 cen formation to work , the cluster would have to be a daughter product of a large dwarf galaxy like sgr , since the heavy - element abundance patterns of smaller , dsph systems like ursa minor , draco and sextans differ from that of @xmath0 cen , which shows a large enhancement of s to r - process elements with increasing metallicity ( smith et al . \n 2000 ) . on the other hand , the apparent greater concentration of more metal rich stars observed in @xmath0 cen by pfbpz mimics a trend seen in dwarf galaxies both great ( like fornax  grebel & stetson 1998 ) and small ( like sculptor  e.g. , majewski et al . \n 1999 ) . \n apart from the actual difficulty of two clusters merging , which requires relative velocities of @xmath30 km s@xmath31 ( thurl & johnston , this proceedings ) , the merger hypothesis suffers from at least one other unlikelihood : if @xmath0 cen were the result of the merger of two cluster - like systems , the parent clusters would _ each _ have to have been among the largest clusters in the galaxy , and even if only the metal poor part of @xmath0 cen began its life as a traditional cluster , it too would be at the extreme end of the galactic cluster mass scale . \n somehow it is easier to accept that the peculiar properties of @xmath0 cen are the _ result _ of its large mass , rather than that its large mass and other peculiar properties were accumulated as the result of a series of unlikely occurences . \n indeed , the present orbit of @xmath0 cen ( i.e. , barreling retrograde within and through the galactic plane \n dinescu et al . \n 1999 ) is one that undoubtedly subjects it to substantial tidal stripping . \n therefore , not only was @xmath0 cen almost certainly larger and even more like a dwarf galaxy in the past , but there is every expectation that it has led a battered life much like its sgr counterpart . \n evidence for tidal tails extending from @xmath0 cen have been reported by leon et al . \n ( 2000 ) . \n we have attempted to present a more accurate representation of the mdf for @xmath0 cen . however , as pointed out by majewski et al . \n ( 2001 ) , if a system has endured substantial mass loss over its lifetime , one must be wary of interpreting the presently observed mdf to represent the true enrichment history of that stellar system . \n older ( and more extended ) populations will have had more time to have been stripped , and especially in the case of @xmath0 cen , whose planar orbit has almost certainly evolved considerably , that mass loss rate may have been highly variable over the enrichment timescale . \n majewski , s. , patterson , r. , dinescu , d. , johnson , w. , ostheimer , j. , kunkel , w. , & palma , c. 2000a , in  the galactic halo : from globular clusters to field stars , ed . \n a. noels , et al . \n ( li ` ege : univ . li ` ege ) , 619 [ m00a ]", "StartTimeOffset": 3963465329288, "RequestID": "85468cd9ea784fb3acc27a7f9ce97cd9", "TotalTokens": 4068}

{"ContextTokens": 2517, "GeneratedTokens": 261, "SynthesizedBody": "by virtue of the no - hair theorem , black holes in general relativity are fully and uniquely characterized by only three parameters : their masses , spins , and electrical charges ( israel 1967 , 1968 ; carter 1971 , 1973 ; hawking 1972 ; robinson 1975 ; mazur 1982 ) . \n these objects are described by the kerr - newman metric ( newman et al . \n 1965 ) , which , in the case of astrophysical black holes , reduces to the kerr metric ( kerr 1963 ) , since any net charge quickly neutralizes .    the no - hair theorem , \n then , provides a means to test general relativity by verifying that black holes are indeed kerr black holes . \n several such tests have been suggested to date , which are based on observations of either gravitational waves ( see hughes 2010 for a review ) , electromagnetic emission from accretion flows ( johannsen & psaltis 2010a ) , pulsar - black hole binaries ( wex & kopeikin 1999 ) , the ephemeredes of stars around the supermassive black hole sgr  a * at the galactic center ( will 2008 ) , or of the quasar oj287 ( valtonen et al . 2011 ) .    while tests in the regime of weak gravitational fields can rely on a parameterized post - newtonian formulation ( e.g. , will 1993 ) , strong - field tests require a careful modeling of the black hole spacetime itself in terms of a parametric deviation from the kerr metric . \n these kerr - like spacetimes depend on one or more free parameters in addition to the mass and spin , and signatures of possible violations of the no - hair theorem can be studied as a function of the deviation parameters . \n several parametric deviations have been constructed so far ( e.g. , manko & novikov 1992 ; collins & hughes 2004 ; glampedakis & babak 2006 ; yunes & pretorius 2009 ; vigeland & hughes 2010 ; vigeland , yunes , & stein 2011 ; johannsen & psaltis 2011b ; yagi , yunes & tanaka 2012 ) . \n in this paper , i review the kerr - like black hole spacetime constructed by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) , which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon even for high values of the spin and large deviations from the kerr metric . \n this property makes this metric an ideal framework for strong - field tests the no - hair theorem with observations of the accretion flows of black holes . \n the kerr metric is a stationary , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat , vacuum solution of the einstein field equations and , due to the no - hair theorem , the only spacetime in general relativity that has all of these characteristics . \n kerr - like metrics retain as many of these properties in order to closely mimic the observational appearance of kerr black holes . \n all of them include the kerr metric as the limiting case if the deviation parameters are set to zero .    by construction , \n parametric deviations from the kerr metric are usually stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat . \n if such a metric is also a vacuum solution in general relativity , it either harbors a naked singularity or is plagued with pathological regions in the exterior domain where causality is violated ( see johannsen et al . \n some kerr - like metrics are valid only for small or intermediate values of the black hole spin ( e.g. , glampedakis & babak 2006 ; yunes & pretorius 2009 ) , while others are based on an expansion in the deviation parameters in order to remain a vacuum solution of the einstein equations under certain conditions ( e.g. , vigeland & hughes 2010 ) . \n depending on the desired application , additional metric properties can be important , such as its petrov type ( vigeland et al . \n 2011 ) or violations of parity ( yunes & pretorius 2009 ; yagi et al . \n 2012 ) . \n the metric by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) in boyer - lindquist - like coordinates is given by the line element @xmath0 \\left(1-\\frac{2mr}{\\sigma}\\right)dt^2 -\\frac { 4amr\\sin^2\\theta } { \\sigma } [ 1+h(r,\\theta)]dtd\\phi + \\frac { \\sigma[1+h(r,\\theta ) ] } { \\delta + a^2\\sin^2\\theta h(r,\\theta ) } dr^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sigma d\\theta^2 + \\left [ \\sin^2\\theta \\left ( r^2 + a^2 + \\frac { 2a^2 mr\\sin^2\\theta } { \\sigma } \\right ) + h(r,\\theta ) \\frac{a^2(\\sigma + 2mr)\\sin^4\\theta } { \\sigma } \\right ] d\\phi^2 , \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1    this metric is a stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat parametric deviation that describes an actual black hole for all values within the range of spins @xmath2 without relying on an expansion in the deviation parameters @xmath3 and that is regular , i.e. , it is free of any pathologies outside of the event horizon . \n possible nonzero lowest - order deviations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , of the kerr metric are ruled out by current solar - system tests of gravity and by the requirement that the above metric reduces to newtonian gravity far from the black hole . for simplicity \n , i will allow the leading - order coefficient @xmath5 to be the only nonvanishing deviation parameter .    with this choice \n , the shape of the event horizon depends on the values of the spin and the parameter @xmath5 . \n figure  [ properties ] shows the location of the horizon in the @xmath6-plane of a black hole with a value of the spin @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . while the event horizon of a kerr black hole is spherical , the horizon of a black hole in this metric is prolate for positive values of the parameter @xmath5 and oblate for negative values of the parameter @xmath5 . for high values of the spin and values of the parameter @xmath5 exceeding a maximum bound as shown in figure  [ properties ] \n , the central object turns into a naked singularity .    the properties of this spacetime \n make it ideally suited for tests of the no - hair theorem that involve observations of accretion flows . the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) \n is often taken to be the inner edge of geometrically thin accretion disks and can be arbitrarily close to the event horizon in the case of rapidly spinning black holes . since relativistic effects are most prominent in the immediate vicinity of black holes , it is critical that this region is properly modeled by a parametric deviation . since the metric by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) is regular everywhere outside of the horizon , the electromagnetic emission of accretion flows \n can be modeled self - consistently . \n figure  [ properties ] also shows the location of the isco as a function of the spin and the parameter @xmath5 . for increasing values of the spin and the deviation parameter , the radius of the isco approaches the event horizon \n accretion flows of black holes allow us to observe potential violations of the no - hair theorem across the electromagnetic spectrum ( johannsen & psaltis 2010a ) . \n observables include ( a ) the direct imaging of the event horizon with sgr  a * ( johannsen & psaltis 2010b ; johannsen 2012 ; johannsen et al . \n 2012b ) with the _ event horizon telescope _ , a planned global very - long baseline interferometer ( doeleman et al . \n 2009a , b ; fish et al . 2009 ) , ( b ) relativistically broadened iron lines ( johannsen & psaltis 2012 ) , ( c ) quasi - periodic variability ( johannsen & psaltis 2011a ;

silbergleit et al 2001 ) as a viable model of the quasi - periodic variability observed in both stellar - mass and supermassive black holes ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . \n the effects of potential violations of the no - hair theorem on iron line profiles and quasi - periodic variability may be observed with upcoming or future x - ray missions such as _ astro - h _ , _ athena _ and _ \n loft_.    tests of the no - hair theorem and of general relativity that are based on observations of the accretion flows of black holes require a carefully designed parametric deviation from the kerr spacetime . \n the metric by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) provides the necessary framework and is ideally suited for the description of rapidly - spinning black holes , which are mostly found in nature ( brenneman & reynolds 2009 ; mcclintock et al . \n observational tests of the no - hair theorem can be realized in the near future .", "StartTimeOffset": 3992989155473, "RequestID": "74bd3dff78ac4064a3181a31da3a6d33", "TotalTokens": 2778}

amplitude , gaussian random noise primordial density fluctuations to resolve the full range of length and mass scales necessary to form galaxies and the stars within them at the same time . \n we choose , instead , to focus here on an idealized model of structure formation which we can hope to resolve more accurately , thereby elucidating some of the most important aspects of the problem which may be relevant , as well , to more realistic initial conditions . \n we are particularly interested in studying the effects of nonspherical geometry and continuous cosmological infall on the problem of explosion - driven blow - out from galaxies during their formation . \n it is well - known that structure formation from gaussian random noise proceeds in a highly anisotropic way , favoring pancake and filament formation over the formation of quasi - spherical objects . \n our previous work ( @xcite,@xcite ) has demonstrated , however , that a cosmological pancake , modeled as the nonlinear outcome of a single plane - wave density fluctuation , is subject to a linear gravitational instability which results in the formation of filaments and lumps in the central plane of the pancake . \n the lumps of collisionless dark matter that form in this way are quasi - spherical and develop a universal density profile which is reminiscent of the universal profiles found from n - body simulations of 3d gaussian noise density fluctuations in hierarchical clustering models like the cdm model . as such , they provide an ideal test - bed for exploring the gas dynamics of structure formation and feedback effects without the troublesome complexity of gaussian random noise initial conditions . \n the pancake problem , moreover , is completely scale - free , once all lengths are expressed in units of the pancake wavelength @xmath1 , time is expressed in terms of the cosmic scale factor @xmath2 , divided by the scale factor @xmath3 at which the unperturbed pancake collapses to form density caustics in the dark matter and shocks in the gas , and the energy release is expressed in units of the total energy contained in a comoving cube of side @xmath1 . \n as such , each simulation of galaxy formation via 3d pancake gravitational instability serves to represent the generic behavior independent of the particular mass or collapse epoch of the object which forms . \n in order to preserve this universality and scale - free character of the problem , we will neglect radiative cooling in these first calculations . \n once the key features of this scale - free problem are delineated , we will later consider the scale - dependent effects of radiative cooling and photoheating . among the results we seek to quantify in this way \n are :    * the amount of energy release required to blow the gas out of a dark matter halo . * the efficiency for ejecting the fraction of gas which is initially responsible for receiving the energy release ( and , in the case of supernova explosions , the metallicity associated with the sn ejecta ) . \n * the distinction between `` blowout , '' in which the energy release results in the escape of some energy and gas into the surrounding igm but leaves the bulk of the gas in the object unaffected , and `` blowaway , '' in which most or all of the gas is ejected from the dark matter potential well . * the energy release rate required to shock - heat the entire igm by the overlapping effect of energy release from neighboring objects . \n we consider an einstein - de sitter universe ( density parameter @xmath4 , cosmological constant @xmath5 ) with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the contributions of baryons and dark matter to @xmath10 , respectively ) . \n the initial conditions correspond to the growing mode of a single sinusoidal plane - wave density fluctuation of wavelength @xmath1 and dimensionless wavevector @xmath11 ( length unit = @xmath1 ) . \n we adjust the initial amplitude @xmath12 such that a density caustic forms in the collisionless dark matter component at scale factor @xmath13 . \n we perturb this system by adding to the initial conditions two transverse , plane - wave density fluctuations with equal wavelength @xmath14 , wavenumbers @xmath15 pointing along the orthogonal vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and amplitude @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n we use the notation @xmath22 to designate a pancake perturbed by two such transverse perturbation modes . all results presented here \n refer to the case @xmath23 unless otherwise noted . \n the presence of the two perturbation modes will result in the formation of two perpendicular filaments in the plane of the pancake , with a dense , quasi - spherical cluster at the intersection of the filaments .      in 3d \n , our previous @xmath0 simulations of collisionless matter involving @xmath24 particles and @xmath25 grid cells in a comoving cubic box of side equal to @xmath1 , with gravitational softening parameter @xmath26  grid spacings demonstrated that the quasi - spherical lumps that form as one of the generic outcomes of pancake gravitational instability in 3d , evolve self - similar density profiles of universal shape ( @xcite,@xcite ) . \n the universal profile is well - approximated as a power - law @xmath27 over a large range of density , which flattens somewhat at small radii , a shape which is independent of the details of the initial perturbations to the pancake . \n this self - similar profile is similar to the universal profile found to fit the results of 3d n - body simulations of the collisionless dark matter in a cdm model @xcite . \n this suggests that this 3d instability of cosmological pancakes which leads generically to the formation of such quasi - spherical dark matter halos may be used as an alternative to the details of the cdm model with its gaussian random noise initial density fluctuations as a test - bed in which to study halo and galaxy formation further .    to illustrate the universal density profile associated with this pancake instability , we show in figure  1 results from @xcite and @xcite for one particular case , @xmath23 , for various values of the expansion factor , as well as a summary of results for several different perturbation modes , at @xmath28 \n galaxy formation which leads to star formation can be affected by feedback when stars evolve to the point of supernova ( sn ) explosions and the resulting shock - heating and outward acceleration of interstellar and intergalactic gas . \n previous attempts to model this effect have typically been along one of three lines , that which adopts a smooth initial gas distribution in a galaxy - like , fixed dark matter gravitational potential well ( e.g. @xcite ) , that which considers a single , isolated , but evolving , density fluctuation ( i.e. without merging , infall or the effects of external tidal forces ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that in which the galaxy forms by condensation out of gaussian random noise primordial density fluctuations such as in the cdm model ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . in the first case , the computational ability to resolve shocks which propagate away from the sites of explosive energy release is generally greater , while the last is perhaps more realistic in terms of the initial and boundary conditions , but the resolving of shocks is still generally quite poor . \n we compromise here between these two limits by using the pancake instability problem as the model of galaxy formation in which to explore the feedback effect of the explosive release of energy by sne inside a protogalaxy . \n this affords some of the benefit of greater ease of the first approach mentioned above in resolving the explosion - driven shocks which are the crucial element in blowing gas out and away . \n it also provides a self - consistent cosmological origin and boundary condition for a protogalaxy or cluster , including the important effect of anisotropic gravitational collapse and continuous infall .    sharing the initial conditions described above for the formation of a dark matter halo via 3d pancake instability mode @xmath23 is an additional component of baryon - electron gas . \n we model the explosive release of energy due to sne in terms of a single impulsive explosion which may represent a starburst or the collective effect of multiple sne . \n we initiate the explosion by waiting until the first gas particles at the center of our dark matter halo reach a density contrast relative to the average background density , @xmath29 , exceeding @xmath30 , at which point we suddenly multiply the thermal energy of these particles by a factor @xmath31 and share some of the explosion energy smoothly amongst their nearest neighbor particles via asph kernel smoothing as well . \n this occurs at @xmath32 . \n while we have performed a series of simulations for different values of @xmath31 , we shall report here only the results for two limiting cases : @xmath33 ( no explosion ) and @xmath34 ( blowaway regime ) . \n simulations end at an expansion factor @xmath35 . \n ( note : the proper , numerical prescription for depositing the energy of explosions in the interstellar gas surrounding the explosion site is a complicated question , dependent as it is on explosion details which are unresolvable by current numerical treatments . \n some recent discussion of this question is contained in @xcite and @xcite , including the question of the fraction of the energy of a given sn explosion which ends up as kinetic energy of the sn remnant rather than as thermal energy . however , since the simulations described here are adiabatic and neglect radiative cooling , it is self - consistent for us to deposit the entire explosion energy initially as thermal energy . ) \n all our gas dynamical simulations are based upon the new 3d version of our asph method ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , coupled to a @xmath0 gravity solver . \n the simulations reported here use @xmath36 gas particles , @xmath36 dark matter particles ( with unequal particle masses , @xmath37 ) , and a @xmath0 grid of @xmath24 cells with softening length @xmath26 grid spacings . \n in the absence of explosion , the simulation produces two orthogonal filaments within the pancake central plane at whose intersection is located a denser , quasi - spherical ball of gas which sits in the gravitational potential well of a dense , quasi - spherical dark matter halo like that in figure 1 . in the case with explosion , we found that away from the central object , the pancake and the filaments within it are hardly affected . \n however , gas has been blown out of the center and some exterior gas which was infalling along directions perpendicular to the pancake plane has been swept back out , as well , some as far as to the outer edge of the box .    in figure 2 , we show a shaded contour plot of the gas temperature at @xmath35 , in a plane perpendicular to the pancake and intersecting the center of the central cluster . \n the explosion is confined by the gas in the plane of the pancake ( seen edge - on on this figure ) outside the central object , with the hottest gas at the very center . \n the filaments are hardly affected , however , nor is the shocked pancake gas far from the central object . \n this edge - on view of the pancake reveals that a major blow - out has occurred in which the explosion , led by an outer shock , has propagated all the way to the edge of the box , half - way to the nearest neighbor pancake , and collided there with the explosion shock expanding away from the neighboring pancakes central object and toward the pancake in this box . \n the temperature plot reveals multiple shocks interior to the explosion , especially along the symmetry axis of the blow - out . \n although the central object in which the explosion took place was quasi - spherical , the existence of the pancake plane and of the filaments which intersect at the location of the central dark halo ensure that a highly anisotropic explosion results and serves to channel the energy and mass ejection outward along the symmetry axis . \n velocity arrows for the gas particles at @xmath35 are displayed in figures 3 and 4 . \n figure  3 shows a thin slice of the computational volume which contains the pancake central plane ( i.e. a top view looking down on the pancake central plane ) . \n figure  4 shows a slice perpendicular to the pancake ( that is , the same plane as in figure  2 ) . \n these show that outflow is restricted to the symmetry axis , while infall continues within the pancake plane and especially inward along the filaments . \n the effect of the explosion in blowing gas away is illustrated by figure 5 , in which different particle groups are distinguished according to their fate with and without the explosion . in the top panel , \n the solid dots show the particles which were the original recipients of the explosion energy and , by implication , the metal - enriched sn ejecta , which were previously located at the very center of the central dark halo at @xmath32 . \n gas initially outside this core region which was within the halo defined according to a mean overdensity @xmath38 but which did not receive the initial explosion energy or ejecta directly is shown as open dots . \n all of the gas originally inside the halo when the explosion occurred has been blown away by @xmath39 . \n the lower panel of figure 5 shows _ all _ those gas particles which were found to be inside the central halo with mean overdensity @xmath38 at @xmath35 in the case with _ no _ explosion but which are _ not _ inside this overdensity at @xmath39 in the case _ with _ the explosion . \n the effect of the explosion on the build - up of the gas mass of the `` galaxy '' by continuous infall is illustrated by the plot in figure 6 of the collapsed gas fraction in the box , defined as the gas of overdensity @xmath38 , for the cases with and without the explosion . with no explosion \n , the central mass grows continuously from @xmath40 to @xmath35 to encompass 10% of all the mass in the box . with the explosion , \n however , all the gas in the central halo is blown away shortly after the explosion occurs at @xmath32 , but by @xmath41 , unobstructed infall within the pancake plane and along the filaments starts to resupply the central halo with gas at a significant rate . \n * we find that blow - out and blow - away are generically anisotropic events which channel energy and mass loss outward preferentially along the symmetry axis of the local pancake and away from the intersections of filaments in the pancake plane . \n * this means that metal ejection from dwarf galaxies at high redshift due to explosive energy release is less likely to pollute the local filaments and pancake in which the dwarf galaxies reside and more likely to channel the metals away from those denser regions . * despite the complete blow - away of gas initially in the dark matter potential well of the `` galaxy '' by the large explosion simulated here , continuous infall is not completely halted in the directions away from the preferred direction of blow - out , so infall partially replenishes the gas which is blown - away . \n this work was supported by nasa grants nag5 - 2785 , nag5 - 7363 , and nag5 - 7821 , nsf grants phy-9800725 and asc-9504046 , and the high performance computing facility , university of texas .", "StartTimeOffset": 4020611163128, "RequestID": "10718d975ae448a5b45a944c587529fd", "TotalTokens": 3978}

radius relations in general relativity and in eibi with @xmath57 , where the shaded region surrounded by the broken line corresponds to the allowed region in mass - radius relation for eos with stiffness between fps and shen eoss , while the regions surrounded by the solid and dotted lines correspond to those in eibi with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from this figure , one can observe a large uncertainty in the mass - radius relation due to eos , compared with that due to the gravitational theory . in practice , \n even if @xmath58 , it might be difficult to distinguish the gravitational theory by using the measurements of stellar mass and radius . \n in this paper , as mentioned before , we focus on the stellar oscillations of the relativistic stars in eibi . for this purpose \n , we adopt the cowling approximation as a first step , i.e. , we neglect the metric perturbations as @xmath59 . the lagrangian displacement vector of matter element @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond to functions of @xmath64 and @xmath38 , while @xmath65 denotes the spherical harmonics . with such variables , \n the perturbation of four - velocity @xmath66 can be expressed as @xmath67 where the dot denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath64 . \n additionally , the perturbations of energy density and pressure are given by @xmath68    then , the perturbation equations in the cowling approximation can be derived from the variation of the energy -

radius relation shown in fig . \n [ fig : mr ] , one can observe that the frequencies depend weakly on the eos . \n this could be because that the @xmath37 mode oscillation , which is an acoustic wave , propagates inside the star with sound velocity associated with the stellar average density . \n in fact , it has been suggested in general relativity that the @xmath37 mode frequencies are written as a linear function of the stellar average density , which weakly depends on the adopted eos @xcite . from the left panel in fig . \n [ fig : l2 ] , one can obviously see that the @xmath37 mode frequencies in eibi with @xmath84 could be distinguished from those in general relativity , even if the uncertainty in frequencies due to eos would exist . \n that is , via the direct observations of @xmath37 mode oscillations , one could distinguish eibi from general relativity , if @xmath1 , independently of eos for neutron star matter . of course , \n if the eos for neutron star matter would be determined or constrained via the other astronomical observations and/or terrestrial unclear experiments , one might distinguish eibi even with @xmath4 from general relativity . on the other hand , with the uncertainty due to eos \n , it seems to be difficult to distinguish eibi with @xmath85 from general relativity via the observations of @xmath83 mode oscillations . \n eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity ( eibi ) attracts attention as a modified gravitational theory in the context of avoiding the big bang singularity . \n this theory completely agrees with general relativity in vacuum , but can deviate from general relativity in the region with matter . in this paper , \n we especially forces on the stellar oscillations in eibi , and examine the oscillation frequencies of neutron stars as changing the eddington parameter @xmath0 . for this purpose \n , we derive the perturbation equations with relativistic cowling approximation by linearizing the energy - momentum conservation law . as a result \n , we find that the @xmath37 and @xmath83 mode frequencies depend strongly on the eddington parameter . compared with the expectations in general relativity ( @xmath86 ) , the frequencies in eibi with negative @xmath0 become high and those with positive @xmath0 become low . \n additionally , in general , there exists an uncertainty in stellar models due to eos of neutron star matter , but we show that one could identify eibi with @xmath1 from general relativity independently of the adopted eos . \n furthermore , one might be able to distinguish eibi even with @xmath4 from general relativity , if the eos would be constrained from the astronomical observations and/or terrestrial nuclear experiments . in this paper , although we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation as a first step , we will do more complex analysis for gravitational waves radiated from neutron stars in eibi without such approximation somewhere . \n in fact , the damping time of gravitational waves is also one of the important information from the asteroseismological point of view . \n such an additional information must help us to constrain the gravitational theory more clearly . \n this work was supported by grants -

inelastic scattering , such as electron - phonon scattering ; spin scattering , such as scattering from magnetic impurities ; or spin - orbit scattering . \n each of these processes makes specific contributions to the resistance of the film and each changes in a specific way in the presence of a magnetic field . \n weak localization predicts the change in resistance of a metallic film in a perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath2 , due to weak localization effects to have the following dependence @xcite :    @xmath3\\label{eq : magnetoresistance}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the sheet resistance of the film and @xmath5 are characteristic fields given by    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 being characteristic fields corresponding to elastic , spin - orbit , spin , and inelastic scattering , respectively . \n the physical quantity of interest is the scattering time , @xmath13 , associated with each type of scattering process . \n the scattering times are related to the scattering fields by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the electron charge and @xmath16 is the diffusion constant in two dimensions . \n measurement of the magnetoresistance of a metal , then , allows one to determine the scattering times associated with the various scattering processes which the conduction electrons undergo . by simultaneously measuring the magnetoresistance of gold films with and without mn@xmath0-ac on the surface and computing how the characteristic scattering times change , one can determine the types of interactions taking place between the conduction electrons in the gold and the mn@xmath0-ac . \n in order to perform the magnetoresistance measurements , a thin film of au was made by thermal evaporation onto a room temperature silicon substrate with the native oxide layer and a 20@xmath17 ge adhesion layer . \n a shadow mask , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : au_pattern ] , was used to define a pattern consisting of a single current - carrying strip with eight voltage probes , four on each side of the strip . \n this setup allows a four - wire measurement of two different sections of the strip simultaneously and with some redundancy . by placing mn@xmath0-ac on half of the current carrying strip , the magnetoresistance with and without mn@xmath0-ac can be measured simultaneously using the same excitation current and magnetic field . \n theoretical fits are obtained using a least - squares fitting method to obtain the best set of the four fitting parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 . \n schematic of pattern used for au samples . ] \n mn@xmath0-ac was placed on the surface of the au film using a simple drop - and - dry technique , similar to the established dip - and - dry technique@xcite . \n a solution was made by dissolving 10  mg of mn@xmath0-ac powder in 10  ml of isopropyl alcohol . \n five drops of this solution were dropped onto half of the au film with ample drying time between drops . \n it was observed by afm ( see figure 1 , ref . ) that this is sufficient to ensure good coverage of the au with mn@xmath0-ac . \n samples were then mounted in a dilution refrigerator for measurement . \n results shown are from typical samples \n .    figure  [ fig:7.8nm_600mk ] shows the measured magnetoresistance for a 7.8  nm au film , with and without mn@xmath0-ac , at a temperature of 600  mk . in the dilution refrigerator used in these experiments , 600  mk \n was found to be an easy temperature to reach and stabilize , while lower temperature measurements did not seem to provide any substantial advantage . \n the solid curves are fits to the theory of weak localization using equation  [ eq : magnetoresistance ] . \n the fitting parameters , @xmath18 , used for the fits in figure  [ fig:7.8nm_600mk ] are listed in table  [ tab : characteristic - fields-78 ] . \n also listed are the characteristic scattering times calculated using equation  [ eq : h_tau ] . \n the elastic scattering time is increased by approximately a factor of two if mn@xmath0 is present . \n this indicates a decrease in the amount of elastic scattering , consistent with a change in the surface which reduces the amount of surface scattering . \n the inelastic and spin - orbit scattering are essentially unchanged , while the spin scattering time is reduced by around an order of magnitude . \n this indicates a significant increase in the amount of spin scattering taking place . \n the decrease in elastic scattering and increase in spin scattering are consistent with a picture in which electrons which would have scattered from the surface of the au film are instead entering the mn@xmath0-ac molecules and undergoing spin scattering , most likely from the mn atoms within the molecules . \n magnetoresistance of 7.8 nm au film at 600 mk . \n solid curves are fits to theory . ] \n .[tab : characteristic - fields-78]characteristic fields and scattering times for 7.8 nm gold film at 600 mk .

resonance gas ( hrg ) model has been quite successful in describing the hadron multiplicities data in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite , possibly with additional introduction of parameters to regulate deviations from full chemical equilibrium  @xcite .    in its simplest version \n the hrg is described as a gas of non - interacting hadrons and resonances . in a more realistic hrg model one \n has to take into account the attractive and repulsive interactions between hadrons . in this work \n we study the influence of short - range repulsive interactions between hadrons on thermal fits to hadron yield data . \n the repulsive interactions between hadrons are modeled via eigenvolume ( ev ) correction of the van der waals type @xcite . for a multi - component case \n there is more than a single way to model the eigevolume corrections . in our analysis \n we use two different formulations : the `` diagonal '' eigenvolume hrg model from  @xcite , and the `` crossterms '' ev model introduced in @xcite  ( see ref . \n @xcite for technical details ) . \n the `` diagonal '' model is simpler but it is not consistent with the 2nd order virial expansion of the equation of state of hard spheres . \n the `` crossterms '' model , on the other hand , while technically more involved , is consistent with that expansion .    in our analysis \n we include the established strange and non -

like and where all baryons have a fixed hard - core radius @xmath21  fm . \n as demonstrated in @xcite this parameterization yields a good description of lattice data on the pressure at least up to @xmath22  mev . \n it was also shown in  @xcite that it leads to an irregular @xmath16 profile of thermal fit to alice hadron yield data with wide double minimum structure in the 155 -

minimum structure in a wide 155 - 210  mev temperature range , with improved fit quality at global minimum . \n this change is attributed to a larger suppression of ( anti)deuteron yield at higher temperatures due to larger eigenvolume . \n it is remarkable that fit can be so sensitive to the properties of only single particle species . \n similarly , the inclusion of yields of @xmath24he and @xmath25h does not help to stabilise the fit , as seen in fig . \n [ fig : deuteron]b . \n this is so despite the remarkably large number of degrees of freedom @xmath34 . \n we therefore conclude that introduction of light nuclei into thermal fits leads to a further destabilisation of the fit as it requires non - trivial assumptions regarding their eigenvolumes . \n it is shown that thermal fits are very sensitive to the details of the modeling of the eigenvolume interactions . at given collision energy , the ev hrg model fits do not just yield a single @xmath19 pair , but a whole range of @xmath19 pairs , each with similarly good fit quality . \n the entropy per baryon , on the other hand , appears to be a robust observable : its extracted value depends weakly on the modeling of hadron eigenvolumes . \n finally , we explore the effect of including light nuclei into thermal fits and , somewhat surprisingly , find that results are even more sensitive to the assumptions regarding their eigenvolume parameters . \n 9 stoecker h , ogloblin a a and greiner w 1981 _ z. phys . _ a * 303 * 259", "StartTimeOffset": 4047031577299, "RequestID": "d8fcb182ed2e41398601c4c01de63359", "TotalTokens": 2911}
{"ContextTokens": 3694, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "recently there has been much interest in random growing networks review , review1,review2 , both from the point of view of theoretical modelling , as well as the empirical study of real networks . \n there is considerable evidence that while traditional erds - renyi random graphs have a poisson degree distribution @xcite , real graphs and random growing graphs have a power - law degree distribution .    of particular interest \n are directed networks , which can be used to model systems in which directed flow takes place . \n such networks include the world wide web @xcite , the phone - call graph @xcite and the citation graph 3 .    as a complement to computer simulations and exact solutions of simplified systems , \n thermodynamic formulations have been used to study a number of complex co - operative systems including granular media , econophysics , breaking phenomena and many others . in a recent paper @xcite , bianconi and \n barabsi ( bb ) mapped the different behaviour of random growing networks with fitness onto the thermodynamically distinct phases of a free bose gas . \n the fitness model predicts that , in the large network limit , the fittest node will have the most links . \n this is called the _ fit - get - rich _ ( fgr ) phase . unlike the scale - free model ( sfm ) , in which the degree distribution of the network is power - law , the fgr behaviour ( phase in the thermodynamic language ) has nodes with a very large degree which dominate the network . \n another phase revealed in @xcite is the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , when the fittest node acquires a finite fraction of the total degree . \n in contrast to bec , in the fgr phase the richest node is not an absolute winner , since its share of the links ( _ i.e. _ the ratio of its degree and the total degree of the network ) decays to zero for large system sizes , whereas in bec the winner maintains its share irrespective of system size .    in this case , the fact that this ratio is constant corresponds to the extensivity property of a bose gas , when the gas keeps a finite fraction of its particles in the ground state . in this paper \n we examine the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation , which was considered for an undirected graph in @xcite on the random directed growing network introduced in @xcite .    to do this we work with the model introduced in @xcite , introducing a dependence between the vertex fitness and an energy . \n as each vertex has two fitnesses ( for in - degree and out - degree ) then it is necessary to assign two different energy levels to represent each vertex . \n this is detailed in the first sub - section , together with the description of edges in terms of particles assigned to two energy levels . \n the necessary coexistence of two sub - systems forming the network and the formulation of an equilibrium condition in a formal way is discussed in detail in sections 3 and 4 . \n the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation , and its interpretation in a physical framework makes it possible to describe the directed network in terms of canonical concepts of statistical physics , such as a phase diagram and first and second order phase transitions . \n these are introduced in the following sections .    in the conclusions we emphasize the usefulness of this formulation in providing a clear and concise interpretation of different phenomena in networks . \n so , the possibility of coexistence of phases in which the in - degree distribution exhibits a clear winner whereas the out - degree shows scale free behaviour , or the simultaneous existence of two different winners ( bipolarity ) and the conditions for its existence are predicted in thermodynamic language . \n in bb @xcite , a correspondence between fitness @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 given by @xmath10was introduced . in our model \n the vertices have , in general , different fitnesses @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the addition of an in- or out - degree . as in er , here the model \n consists of the addition of bare vertices ( i.e. without edges , but with fitness @xmath11 for in - degree and @xmath12 for out - degree ) to the network with probability @xmath0 , and the creation of directed edges between vertices with probability @xmath13 .    a kinetic equation describing the process of directed networks must include the kinetics of both in - degree and out - degree simultaneously since they coexist and influence each other . \n then , the kinetic equation for the mean number of vertices with in - degree @xmath4 and out - degree @xmath5 is , as in er ,    @xmath14+\\frac{qb } { m_{2}}[jn_{i , j-1}-(j+1)n_{ij}]+p\\delta _ { i0}\\delta _ { j0}f(a , b ) .\\ ] ]    where the fitnesses @xmath2 are chosen from the fitness distribution @xmath15 . \n the normalisation factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath18and @xmath19the first term in the first square brackets of eq.(2 ) represents the increase in @xmath20 when vertices with in - degree @xmath21 and out - degree @xmath5 gain an incoming edge and the second term represents the corresponding loss . \n the second square brackets contain the analogous terms for outgoing edges and the last term ensures the continuous addition of new vertices with fitnesses @xmath22 . \n the translation of this problem into an energetic formulation is straightforward . \n we associate the addition of a vertex with fitnesses @xmath23 to the network with the creation of two energy levels ; one representing the fitness of the incoming edge and the other for the outgoing edge . \n this means that the edge can be mapped into two separate isolated sub - systems . \n then the creation of a directed edge corresponds to the creation of two particles , one in each sub - system , simultaneously . \n the particles are created in the energy levels corresponding to incoming fitness of the receiving vertex and the outgoing fitness of the emitter vertex , as fig . \n 1 illustrates . \n then , using the energy variables , rather that the fitness , we have @xmath24@xmath25and @xmath26+\\frac{% qe^{-\\beta _ { 2}\\varepsilon _ { 2}}}{m_{2}}[jn_{i , j-1}-(j+1)n_{ij}]+p\\delta _ { i0}\\delta _ { j0}f(\\varepsilon _ { 1},\\varepsilon _ { 2}).\\]]and the normalisations \n are re - written as @xmath27and @xmath28    as we distinguish between incoming and outgoing edges , and their respective fitnesses , when going to the energy representation the edges and their fitnesses must also be distinguished as belonging to different isolated sub - systems of the same system . \n let us denote the sub - systems as 1 and 2  so , the creation of a vertex in the network implies the simultaneous creation of an energy level in each sub - system , i.e. @xmath29and @xmath30 . \n the creation of an edge joining two vertices implies the simultaneous creation of one particle in each sub - system in the energy levels corresponding to the fitnesses of the vertices gaining an in- and out - degree , as fig.1 illustrates .    it should be noted that we are doing a simultaneous description of two isolated sub - systems which compose the whole system ( the network ) . \n these sub - systems do not exchange energy or particles , but are correlated in the sense that the creation of an energy level ( a particle ) in one of the sub - systems implies the simultaneous phenomenon in the other .    by definition of the model , \n the total number of particles increases linearly with time , so @xmath31    let us define the reduced moments @xmath32 and @xmath33 by @xmath34@xmath35and introduce @xmath36 as @xmath37    as shall be seen these magnitudes will be useful to calculate the characteristics of the network . \n then , following the procedure in @xcite , we can show that @xmath38and @xmath39 which determines @xmath40 and @xmath41 as functions of @xmath0 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      in this representation , \n as we already pointed out , the addition of a vertex means the creation of two energy levels , each corresponding to its fitness . when an edge joining two vertices is created , we add one particle in each corresponding level . \n the distribution of in- and out - degree then corresponds to the distribution of particles in systems 1 and 2    @xmath44    is the number of vertices with in - degree @xmath4 , and    @xmath45    is the number of vertices with out - degree @xmath5 . for large degree \n their asymptotic expressions are @xmath46and @xmath47where we have introduced @xmath48for @xmath49 and @xmath50 as _ chemical potentials_. unlike bb , the chemical potential is introduced here as an exact expression , not as an asymptotic one .      the equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be transformed by introducing the generating function @xmath51where @xmath52with @xmath53}\\]]and @xmath54}.\\]]then the equations for @xmath55 @xmath56 become @xmath57this means that @xmath58unlike bb , this is a new condition generated by the model . \n let us denote it as a _ generalized equilibrium condition_. a _ strong equilibrium _ \n condition implies that @xmath59and @xmath60this condition will be discussed later . in this formalism \n the occupation probability is , then , @xmath61for @xmath62 , representing the probability for a given edge to belong to a given vertex ( probability of a particle to belong to an energy level ) . \n if , now , the fitness distribution is separable then @xmath63and @xmath64separately for each system @xmath62 . in each case , @xmath65 is the solution of this equation , which depends on the density of states @xmath66 .      to illustrate , \n let us start with a particular case , when @xmath67 with @xmath68 . \n the normalisation @xmath69 as in bb .    then the integral in eq.(25 ) , @xmath70    but this integral reaches its maximum value when @xmath71 \n . then if for a given value of @xmath72 we have @xmath73 then we have a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . \n if we calculate the temperature for bec in this particular case , we obtain @xmath74    unlike bb , the factor @xmath75 appears here . if @xmath76 we recover bb result . \n even in this simple example , @xmath77 may be different for the sub - systems 1 and 2 , if the value of @xmath78 is different . in a more general form , we can state the condition for bose einstein condensation . then , as @xmath79for @xmath62 . , if @xmath80 then bec occurs . the conditions for bec depend on @xmath81      below @xmath77 there is bec . \n above it the phase is fit - get - richer as in bb1 , but here both phases must be considered for both systems . \n then , a phase diagram can be drawn with the temperatures @xmath82 = @xmath83 and @xmath84 = @xmath85 characterizing each sub - system ( fig . \n 2 ) .    imposing a given dependence of fitness with energy so that @xmath86means that the equilibrium is broken , ( i.e. in a computer simulation we would impose temperatures that do not satisfy eq . [ 26 ]  ) . then there can be a winner in one of the phases . \n one of the vertices accumulates , say , most of the in - degrees , coming from the other vertices . if both phases are in bec there is a vertex with most of the incoming and another with most of the outgoing edges . then both vertices will be highly correlated . \n though a more complicated situations are possible , let us illustrate the case @xmath87 . \n the point a represents that both sub - systems are in fgr phase . \n if , for example , we make the simulations with the parameters given by a1 then will be an fgr and a bec  phase coexisting , but not _ in equilibrium _ since one of them satisfies eq . \n [ 35 ] but not the other . \n there is a coexistence of phases out of equilibrium \n . we might call this an _ out of equilibrium first order phase transition_. the motion along aa1a2 ... leads to the region in which bec occurs for both phases . here is hard to speak about equilibrium unless a belongs to the line @xmath88 . \n all we know in bec region is that none of the sub - systems satisfies eq . \n 35    the concept of equilibrium in this model is purely formal since the sub - systems are not in contact , but it is a comfortable tool to make a map of directed networks into bose - einstein statistics .      if one of the systems is such that @xmath89 , then eq . ( \n [ 31 ] ) gives @xmath90then @xmath91with a corresponding expression for @xmath92 . \n if @xmath76 the scale free model is recovered with a degree distribution @xmath93 . thus the model with directed edges gives the possibility of a scale free phase for both in the in - degree and the out - degree .      if in fig . \n 3 we move in such a way as to cross into the bec region through the point b then bec occurs simultaneously for both phases . no coexistence of phases will occur , the system goes from fgr to bec or vice - versa instantly . \n this is a _ \n second order phase transition _ since the system as a whole changes its phase . \n then the point b is the _ \n critical point _ for the transition . \n bec is itself a second order phase transition since it effects the system as a whole , so that when sub - system 1 or 2 experiences bec , the sub - system itself suffers a second order phase transition , but our system contains both sub - systems 1 and 2 so that when they are in different phases we consider our whole system as composed of two phases . \n we have studied bose - einstein condensation in a random growing network model . in this model , with a formulation considering incoming and outgoing edges , a formal analogy can be adopted to describe the change in the behaviour of the directed edges in terms of bose statistics .    in this formulation , as in that of bb , the temperature plays the role of a dummy variable . \n real systems are characterised by the functional form of the distribution function of fitness and there is no @xmath94 to consider . \n it only emerges when we translate from the language of fitness to that of energies . \n but the formulation of networks in terms of quantum statistics and the introduction of temperature is an elegant and simple description of the behaviour of networks under different conditions . in this sense , \n the temperature plays its role in the simulations of the networks , determining the strength of the dependence between the fitness and its associated energy , and this dependence is reflected in the behaviour of the network by determining its position in the phase diagram . \n though phase diagrams and phase transitions are not exclusive to thermodynamic formulations ( see , e.g. dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite ) , such a formulation is a very powerful tool to describe different phases of random directed networks , where the presence of directed edges make the description in terms of fitness difficult . \n considering this network as a thermodynamic system , makes it simple to understand , provided we appropriately interpret the thermodynamic parameters . \n we would like to thank the royal society , london and the london mathematical society for their financial support . \n one of us ( o. s ) is greatly indebted to the staff of the department of mathematical sciences at brunel university for their warm hospitality . \n \\1 . correspondence between fitness and energy for directed networks .", "StartTimeOffset": 4062501439292, "RequestID": "4ef71f959bf64c45995055918548a205", "TotalTokens": 3848}
{"ContextTokens": 2624, "GeneratedTokens": 102, "SynthesizedBody": "the general problem of the fully automatic star detecting algorithms on the ccd images is the successful recognition of real star images or star - like sources in general from other types of objects and defects . \n these false objects originate from non - ideal characteristics of the ccd instrument ( noise , bad column and hot pixels ) or from the environment ( nebulae , galaxy or cosmic ray events known as cosmics ) . \n the frequent requirement is to find real star images on a diffuse background or in a crowded star field . \n therefore , the detecting algorithm can not use a simple intensity comparing principle , because the intensity of non - stellar objects can be comparable to star intensities .    a number of different methods for the automatic star detection on astronomical images has been used during the last two decades . for example , \n the method based on wavelet transforms applied to satellite rosat image processing was published by damiani  et  al . \n @xcite . the automatic search and classification \n were implemented in focas routine by valdes  et  al . \n @xcite . the pc  vista by trefers and richmod  @xcite is a package for photometry with a simple algorithm for star detection . the well - known program daophot by stetson  @xcite contains two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 and a highly robust algorithm for star detection . \n the determination of these parameters originates from specific characteristics of the sources on ccd images , but both parameters are not sensitive enough to resolve stars and cosmics on the ccd images exposed in focus of a space telescope and/or camera such as the omc experiment on - board integral ( hermsen and winkler  @xcite ) . \n the large part of the information describing the detected object is included in its intensity profile , but the profile varies widely with weather , telescope focus , etc . changes . \n the intensity distribution can not be described by an analytical function , because it depends on many non - controllable factors . \n fortunately , the real measured profiles are ( in the first approximation ) close to the two - dimensional gaussian profile both for the ground - based ( moffat  @xcite ) and space telescopes .    from this point of view \n , we can easy distinguish between the hot pixel ( a  single pixel with very different intensity compared to surrounding pixels ) and the real star . \n the star image with the gaussian profile is usually spread over several pixels . for illustration , \n the typical 1-dimensional profiles of the star and of the hot pixel are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . \n the maximum intensity of the object @xmath3 is at the pixel @xmath4 . \n the center of the star is at position @xmath5 where summations are evaluated over a small area around the central pixel @xmath4  for example over @xmath6 pixels . \n this notation is also used below . \n approximation of the observed intensity by the two - dimensional gaussian profile is the next step of our algorithm @xmath7/2 h^2 } + \\ , b\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath8 is the estimated maximum of the star profile , @xmath9 is the local sky background . \n the parameter @xmath10 is the width of the typical star and its numerical value must be known _ a priori_. the stars are axis - symmetrical objects according to this formula . \n note , that the @xmath8 parameter is equivalent to , but not quite identical with the stetson s \n parameter @xmath11 ( integer values are used for @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 ) . if we suppose that the statistical distribution of the observed intensity has a normal distribution , we can use the least square method @xmath14 for the estimation of the unknown @xmath8 and ( further unused ) @xmath9 . \n further , we can estimate the central intensity @xmath15 from the maximum intensity @xmath3 by subtracting the local background intensity @xmath16 from @xmath3 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 are arbitrary weights ) and compare its numerical value in parameter @xmath0 : @xmath20 the figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] indicate the typical values of this parameter . \n its value is in agreement with the inequality @xmath21 for the star and with @xmath22 for the hot pixel . \n we can hence deduce the range of the parameter @xmath0 as @xmath23 for the star . \n the cosmic ray events frequency on the ccd images exposed at a ground - based observatory is low and , moreover , its profiles are narrower than the star profiles \n . the image processing algorithm can then easily resolve the images of the stars and those of the cosmic - ray events . \n but ccd images from satellites contain a higher number of the cosmic - ray event tracks and the numerical value of the @xmath0 parameter , computed for the stars , is close to the numerical value for cosmics . \n the construction of the confidentiality test for its distinguishing with only the @xmath0 parameter is not possible . \n the star isophotes of the ideal images have the shape of concentric circles , but the cosmics or the bad columns are represented in general by ellipses with the major semi - axis at some angle to the @xmath24 coordinate . \n the mathematical description of an object in image is derived from this characteristics . \n the most effective way is the description of the object by its 2nd moments @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the summations are evaluated over the same small area around @xmath4 . \n now , we can compute the lengths of the object semi - axes as the eigenvalues problem . \n its lengths satisfy the equation @xmath27 resolving of this equations for @xmath28 gives the sizes of semi - axes as @xmath29\\ ] ] the numerical values of its parameters ( lengths of semi - axes ) are different for elongated object , but approximately the same for stars . \n with respect to their character we define the parameter @xmath30 the limits of this parameter are :    * @xmath31 , the star case * @xmath32 , the cosmics case * @xmath33 , the bad column case , @xmath1 parameter is then equivalent to the @xmath2 parameter of stetson  ( 1987 )    the parameter @xmath1 describes the shape of the object . \n the circular objects are interpreted this way as stars and the very elongated object as cosmic - ray events or bad columns . \n note , that the @xmath1 parameter represents direct generalization of the @xmath2 parameter described in stetson  ( 1987 ) . \n the @xmath2 parameter is capable of measuring elongation only parallel to rows or columns of the image . \n it was intended to identify bad rows or columns , not cosmics . \n = 1.0 cm    ( 8,8 ) ( 8,8 ) \n in this section we describe the use of the parameters mentioned in previous sections to analyze the simulated image of the star field . the image ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) \n is generated as the simulation of the field of view of the omc ( optical monitoring camera ) prepared for the esa satellite integral . \n the psf function of the stars in the image is defined as the two - dimensional gaussian profile with 70% of the light energy in the central pixel , according to the psf of the flight optics . \n this results in @xmath34 for the stars in the simulated image , while their centers are uniformly spread over the unit interval . \n there are also some other sources in the image , namely the bad column , hot pixels and a few cosmics ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] and table  [ tab ] ) . \n the image is critically under - sampled . \n the image left - bottom corner has coordinates @xmath35 and right - top one @xmath36 in pixels . \n the bad column is situated at @xmath37 . \n the hot pixels occupy positions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the centers of the three cosmics appear at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . \n all other sources represent real stars . \n the intensity of the sky is @xmath45 with the gaussian noise @xmath46 ( all intensities in arbitrary units ) . \n object no .  4 ( star ) and object no .  1 ( hot pixel ) were used for construction of the profiles shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] . \n the computed characteristics for the selected sources in the simulated image are listed in table  [ tab ] . \n the center of the object is at coordinates @xmath12 , see formulae ( [ e1 ] ) , the intensity peak at pixel @xmath4 is related to @xmath15 according to ( [ e2 ] ) . \n the moments computed from ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the parameter @xmath8 is obtained by minimization of the sum ( [ e5 ] ) . \n the last three columns contain the values of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath1 . \n the values of the numerical differences of the @xmath0 parameter for star and hot pixel are small because @xmath10 is small , but the upper bound at 1 separates stars and hot pixels to obviously different groups \n . the values of the @xmath2 parameter demonstrate small difference between cosmics and stars . on the contrary the values of the @xmath1 parameter of the stars ( or hot pixels ) and of the cosmics as well as that of the bad columns \n are clearly incompatible . \n .the parameters of objects in the simulated image ( legend : no . 1  hot pixel , no . 2  bad column , no . \n 3  cosmics , no . 4  star ) .

{"ContextTokens": 3077, "GeneratedTokens": 201, "SynthesizedBody": "multifibre technology now allows us to measure redshifts of millions of galaxies . the anglo - australian 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) measured redshifts for 230,000 galaxies selected from the apm catalogue . \n the survey is now complete and publically available . \n the median redshift of the 2dfgrs is @xmath1 , down to an extinction corrected magnitude limit of @xmath2 ( colless et al . \n a sample of this size allows large - scale structure statistics to be measured with very small random errors . in this review \n we summarize some recent results from the 2dfgrs on clustering and galaxy biasing . \n comprehensive recent reviews are given by colless ( 2003 ) and peacock ( 2003 ) . \n an initial estimate of the convolved , redshift - space power spectrum of the 2dfgrs has been determined ( percival et al . 2001 ) for a sample of 160,000 redshifts . on scales \n @xmath3 , the data are robust and the shape of the power spectrum is not affected by redshift - space or non - linear effects , though the amplitude is increased by redshift - space distortions . \n percival et al . \n ( 2001 ) , efstathiou et al . \n ( 2002 ) and lahav et al . \n ( 2002 ) compared the 2dfgrs and cmb power spectra , and concluded that they are consistent with each other . \n a key assumption in deriving cosmological parameters from redshift surveys is that the biasing parameter , defined as the ratio of of galaxy to matter power spectra , is constant , i.e. scale independent . on scales of @xmath4 \n the fluctuations are close to the linear regime , and there are theoretical reasons ( e.g. fry 1996 ; benson et al . \n 2000 ) to expect that on large scales the biasing parameter should tend to a constant and close to unity at the present epoch . \n this is supported by the derived biasing close to unity by combining 2dfgrs with the cmb ( lahav et al . \n 2002 ) and by the study of the bi - spectrum of the 2dfgrs alone ( verde et al . \n 2002 ) . \n the 2dfgrs power spectrum ( figure 1 ) was fitted in percival et al . \n ( 2001 ) over the above range in @xmath5 , assuming scale - invariant primordial fluctuations and a @xmath6-cdm cosmology , for four free parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the redshift space @xmath10 . \n the amplitudes of the linear - theory rms fluctuations are traditionally labeled @xmath11 in mass @xmath12 in galaxies , defined on @xmath13 spheres . assuming a gaussian prior on the hubble constant @xmath14 ( based on freedman et al . \n 2001 ) the shape of the recovered spectrum within the above @xmath5-range was used to yield 68 per cent confidence limits on the shape parameter @xmath15 , and the baryon fraction @xmath16 , in accordance with the popular ` concordance ' model ( e.g. bahcall et al . 1999 ) . for \n fixed ` concordance model ' parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and a hubble constant @xmath19 , the amplitude of 2dfgrs galaxies in redshift space is @xmath20 ( at the survey s effective luminosity and redshift ) . \n recently the sdss team presented their results for the power spectrum ( tegmark et al . \n 2003a , b ; pope et al . 2004 ) , and they found good agreement with the 2dfgrs gross shape of the power spectrum . \n pope et al . \n ( 2004 ) emphasize that sdss alone can not break the degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath8 because the baryon oscillations are not resolved given window function of the survey . \n solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino experiments have confirmed neutrino oscillations , implying that neutrinos have non - zero mass , but without pinning down their absolute masses . \n while it is established that the effect of neutrinos on the evolution of cosmic structure is small , the upper limits derived from large - scale structure could help significantly to constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino masses . \n elgary et al . \n ( 2002 ) used the 2dfgrs power spectrum ( figure 1 ) to provide an upper limit @xmath21 , i.e. approximately 0.7 ev for each of the three neutrino flavours , or phrased in terms of their contribution to the matter density , @xmath22 . \n the wmap team ( spergel et al . 2003 ) reported an improved limit of @xmath23 ( 95% cl ) . \n however , we point out that neutrinos with ev masses are basically indistinguishable from cold dark matter at the epoch of last scattering , and therefore they have little effect on the cmb fluctuations . \n the main neutrino signature comes from the 2dfgrs and the lyman @xmath24 forest which were combined with the wmap data . \n the contribution of wmap is that it constrains better the other parameters involved , e.g. @xmath25 ( see also hannestad 2003 and tegmark et al . \n 2003b for similar results from sdss+wmap ) . despite the uncertainties involved , \n it is remarkable that the results from redshift surveys give upper limits which are lower than those deduced from laboratory experiments , e.g. tritium decay . \n as the suppression of the power spectrum depends on the ratio @xmath26 , elgary & lahav ( 2003 ) found that the out - of - fashion mixed dark matter ( mdm ) model , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and no cosmological constant , fits the 2dfgrs power spectrum well , but only for a hubble constant @xmath29 . \n blanchard et al . ( 2003 ) reached a similar conclusion , and they also found that the cmb power spectrum could be fit well by the same mdm model if one allows features in the primordial power spectrum . \n it is intriguing ( and perhaps disappointing ) that the cmb and redshift surveys can not on their own ( i.e. without a strong prior on the hubble constant ) ` prove ' the existence a non - zero cosmological constant . \n another consequence of this is that excluding low values of the hubble constant , e.g. with the hst key project , is important in order to get a strong upper limit on the neutrino masses . \n madgwick et al . ( 2002 ) have utilized the method of principal component analysis ( pca ) to compress each galaxy spectrum into one quantity , @xmath30 . \n it turns out that @xmath31 is a useful indicator of the star formation rate in a galaxy ( madgwick et al . \n this allows us to divide the 2dfgrs into @xmath31-types , and to study e.g. luminosity functions and clustering per type . \n figures 2 and 3 show the bimodality in this spectral parameter and in the colour distribution ( peacock 2003 ) , respectively . \n bimodality is also seen clearly in the sdss photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data ( blanton et al . 2003 , kauffmann et al . 2004 ) . \n while the concept of two major galaxy populations in the universe was recognized long time ago by hubble and others , 2dfgrs and sdss provide quantitative measures of the frequency distribution using objective physical measures like spectral features and colours . \n the details of these distribution functions pose challenges to models of galaxy formation , in particular regarding the role of feedback mechanisms and the ` nature ' versus ` nurture ' question . \n although galaxy biasing was commonly neglected until the early 1980s , it has become evident that on scales @xmath32 different galaxy populations exhibit different clustering amplitudes , the so - called morphology - density relation ( e.g. dresser 1980 ; hermit et al . \n biasing on small scales is also predicted in the simulations of hierarchical clustering from cdm initial conditions ( e.g. benson et al . \n it is important therefore to pay attention to the scale on which biasing operates . \n norberg et al . \n ( 2002 ) found that for @xmath33 galaxies , the real space correlation function amplitude of @xmath31 early - type galaxies is @xmath34 higher than that of late - type galaxies . \n peacock et al . ( 2001 ) , hawkins et al . \n ( 2003 ) and madgwick et al . \n ( 2003b ) analysed the redshift space correlation function @xmath35 in terms of the line - of - sight and perpendicular to the line - of - sight separation for the entire galaxy populations , we well as for the most passively ( ` red ' ) and actively ( ` blue ' ) star - forming galaxies separately . \n the clustering properties of the two samples are quite distinct on scales @xmath36 . \n the ` red ' galaxies display a prominent ` finger - of - god ' effect and also have a higher overall normalization than the ` blue ' galaxies . \n figure 4 shows the real space correlation functions for the red and blue galaxies . while both are power laws , the slope is different , in accord with results for populations divided by colour in the sdss ( zehavi et al . \n understanding the difference in slope is another challenge for galaxy formation models . \n biasing could be non - linear and ` stochastic ' , in the sense that the number of galaxies predicted in a volume is not only a function of the mass fluctuation in that cell , but is possibly affected by other ` hidden variables ' ( dekel & lahav 1999 ) . \n wild et al . ( \n 2004 ) found recently evidence for a small amount stochasticity when considered a joint counts in cells of two galaxy populations defined by either colour or spectral type . \n the small amount of observed stochasticity supports the use of redshift surveys for measuring matter density fluctuations on large scales . \n however , the comparison with theory calls for better understanding of the ` hidden variables ' in models of galaxy formation ( e.g. blanton et al . 2000 ; somerville et al . \n the results presented above illustrate the power of redshift surveys to address fundamental issues in galaxy formation and cosmology . \n these are only a few examples of the results from the 2dfgrs . \n other results and papers are listed on the 2dfgrs website . \n overall , the results from 2dfgrs fit well into the ` concordance ' model which has emerged from various cosmological data sets . the @xmath6-cdm model with comparable amounts of dark matter and dark energy is rather esoteric , but it is remarkable that different measurements converge to the ` concordance model ' with parameters . \n perhaps the least accurate estimates on that list are for @xmath25 and @xmath11 ( e.g. bridle et al . \n 2003 , lahav & liddle 2003 ) . \n it is intriguing that an einstein - de sitter mixed dark matter model ( cold+hot dark matter ) without a cosmological constant can also fit the data , but it requires a low hubble constant and admittedly is at odds with the sn ia , cluster baryon fraction and other cosmic measurements . \n it is however an illustration that other yet unknown models may fit the data equally well \n .    it may well be that in the future the cosmological parameters will be fixed by the cmb , sn ia etc . \n then , for fixed cosmological parameters , one can use redshift surveys primarily to study galaxy biasing and evolution with cosmic epoch . \n i d like to thank joss bland - hawthorn and the ` tully 60 ' conference organisers for the hospitality in sydney . \n many of us are grateful to brent tully for his numerous original and inspiring contributions to the exploration of the local universe . \n i thank sarah bridle , ystein elgary , pirin erdogdu , darren madgwick , vivienne wild and members of the 2dfgrs and leverhulme quantitative cosmology teams for their contribution to the work summarized here . \n the 2df galaxy redshift survey was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff of the anglo - australian observatory . \n i also acknowledge a pparc senior research fellowship . \n peacock j.a . , 2003 , to appear in the proceedings of the 13th annual october astrophysics conference in maryland , ` the emergence of cosmic structure ' , eds . \n s. holt and c. reynolds ( aip ) , astro - ph/0301042", "StartTimeOffset": 4090239399769, "RequestID": "9a3f8a8c0eaa41a1ba1b18406df0c666", "TotalTokens": 3278}

flow@xcite . \n the rapidity dependence of directed flow is given in fig . \n [ flowy ] . \n in addition , pion data measured with the tracking arm in the wa98 experiment@xcite at midrapidity and data near midrapidity measured by the na49 collaboration@xcite are shown . \n the maximum flow is observed in the fragmentation regions , while it rapidly decreases near midrapidity . \n the data follow a gaussian distribution .    hence for a complete description of the rapidity distribution of the collective flow the formerly used slope at midrapidity ( e.g. @xmath15 ) is not sufficient . \n it is more reasonable to use the three parameters of the gaussian distribution to describe the data . \n the peak position reflects the beam momentum , the peak height gives the strength of the flow and the width of the distribution provides information on how much the participants and the spectators are involved in the collectivity . \n 99 j.  sollfrank et al . , nucl . \n * a638 * ( 1997 ) 147c m.  m.  aggarwal et al . , phys . \n * 81 * ( 1998 ) 4087 k.  werner , phys \n .  rep . \n * 232 * ( 1993 ) 87 x.  n.  wang , phys . \n * 81 * ( 1998 ) 2655 m.  m.  aggarwal et al . \n * 83 * ( 1999 ) 926 u.  a.  wiedemann and u.  heinz , phys . \n * c56 * ( 1997 ) 3265 s.  vrs , to be published in proceedings of quark matter 99 h.  appelshuser et al . , eur . \n .  j.  * c2 * ( 1998 ) 661 t.  peitzmann , to be published in proceedings of quark matter 99 \n d.  h.  rischke , nucl . \n * a610 * ( 1996 ) 88c h.  schlagheck , to be published in proceedings of quark matter 99 j.  barrette et al . , phys . \n 73 * ( 1994 ) 2532 a.  jahns et al . \n * 72 * ( 1994 ) 3464 s. nishimura , these proceedings . \n appelshuser et al . , phys . \n * 80 * ( 1998 ) 4136", "StartTimeOffset": 4097820186891, "RequestID": "372b85ac644646d6b0c21a452f54027a", "TotalTokens": 1914}
{"ContextTokens": 3186, "GeneratedTokens": 88, "SynthesizedBody": "the radiative return method @xcite ( look @xcite for a short introduction ) is a powerful tool in the measurement of @xmath6 , crucial for predictions of the hadronic contributions to @xmath7 , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , and to the running of the electromagnetic coupling from its value at low energy up to @xmath8 ( for recent reviews look @xcite ) . due to a complicated experimental setup , the use of monte carlo ( mc ) event generators @xcite , which includes various radiative corrections \n @xcite is indispensable . \n some more extensive analysis of that subject can be found also in @xcite . \n the most important hadronic mode , i.e. @xmath9 , is currently measured by kloe @xcite , and babar @xcite by means of radiative return method . \n this measurement can suffer from a background from the process @xmath0 , as suggested in @xcite , for at least two reasons : 1 . at present kloe measures only pions ( + missing momenta ) in the final state and for that particular measurement \n there is no difference between photon(s ) and pair production . \n 2 . the @xmath1 pair can escape detection , being lost outside a detector , e.g. in the beam pipe , or having energy below a detection threshold . again \n a monte carlo study is unavoidable , if one likes to know the actual value of the pair production contribution in a given experimental setup , as the analytical , completely inclusive , calculations might lead to misleading results . \n + 0.5 cm + 0.3 cm + 0.5 cm    in fig.[f00 ] different types of diagrams contributing to process @xmath10 are shown schematically . in the present version of the monte carlo program \n we include only two gauge invariant sets of diagrams from fig.[f00]a and [ f00]b . \n the former represents initial state radiation ( isr ) , and the latter final state radiation ( fsr ) , of an @xmath11 pair from @xmath12 production diagram . \n we use scalar qed ( sqed ) to model fsr @xmath11 pair emission and @xmath13 dominance model for @xmath14 coupling ( see @xcite for details ) . the diagrams from fig.[f00]c , representing pion pair emission from t  channel bhabha process , together with s - channel bhabha pion pair emission ( not shown in fig.[f00 ] ) , will be included in the new version @xcite of the presented generator , completing the discussion of this paper . \n the contribution from @xmath15 pion pair production process ( fig.[f00]d ) is negligible for da@xmath4ne energy @xcite , and as its interference with other diagrams does not contribute to the cross section integrated over charge symmetric cuts , these contributions are not relevant , at least for @xmath4factories .    for parametrisation of the phase space \n we use the following variables : @xmath16invariant mass of @xmath9 system , @xmath17invariant mass of @xmath1 system , polar and azimuthal angles of @xmath18 momentum , defined in the centre - of - mass ( cm ) frame of initial @xmath1 pair , polar and azimuthal angles of @xmath19 momentum , defined in @xmath20- rest frame and polar and azimuthal angles of @xmath21 momentum , defined in @xmath22- rest frame . \n all four vectors are boosted into the initial @xmath1 cm frame after being generated and all necessary cuts can be applied at this stage of the generation . \n channel variance reduction method was used to improve efficiency of the generator and all details will be given in a separate publication @xcite . \n we have performed a number of standard tests to ensure that the written fortran code is correct . \n gauge invariance of the sum of the amplitudes was checked analytically separately for set of diagrams from fig.[f00]a and [ f00]b . \n we use helicity amplitudes in ekhara to calculate square of the matrix element describing the @xmath10 process , but as a cross check , we have used also the standard trace technique to calculate the square of the matrix element , summed over polarisations of initial and final leptons . both results were compared numerically scanning the physical phase space , and the biggest relative difference between the two results found was at the level of @xmath23 . it was necessary to use quadrupole precision of the real numbers for the trace technique result , as one can observe severe cancellations between various terms . the phase space volume calculated by monte carlo program was cross checked with the gauss integration and the relative difference at the level of @xmath24 was well within the errors of the mc result , which were of the same order . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 \n cm    inclusive analytical formulae from @xcite provide additional , nontrivial tests of the implementation of the contributions from fig.[f00]a . \n formula ( 23 ) from @xcite provides @xmath25 differential cross section ( other variables are integrated over the whole allowed range ) valid for large @xmath25 . in fig.[f0]a \n , we compare the values of the integrals , over 10 equally spaced intervals of @xmath25 , obtained by means of mc program and one - dimensional gauss integration of the above mentioned analytical formula . \n the gauss routine , which we use , guarantees precision of 12 significant digits . \n one observes a relatively good agreement for values of @xmath26 and worse for @xmath25 nearby @xmath9 production threshold , as expected from the applicability of the analytical formula . \n ekhara results agree much better ( see fig.[f0]b ) with known analytically doubly differential cross section @xmath27 @xcite , integrated over the whole allowed range of @xmath28 and 10 equally spaced intervals of @xmath25 . \n the exact analytical result was integrated numerically , using recursively one - dimensional 8-point gauss procedure and dividing the region of integration into pieces small enough to guarantee the overall accuracy of 10 significant digits . from fig.[f0]b \n it is clear that a technical precision of ekhara of the order of 0.1% was achieved . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    for isr of @xmath1 pair ( fig.[f00]a ) , a factorisation similar to photon emission holds @xcite and adding isr pair production to isr photon production results just in a change of the radiator function , thus radiative return method still can be used @xcite . on the other hand , fsr of @xmath1 pair ( fig.[f00]b ) \n is model dependent , the same way as it is the emission of a real photon , and the question of its relative , to isr , contribution to the cross section is as important as for the photon emission . \n one can observe , that @xmath1 pair emission resembles a lot photon emission , with big contributions of fsr for inclusive configurations ( fig.[f1]a ) of a @xmath4factory , which can be easily reduced , by suitable cuts , to a negligible level ( fig.[f1]b ) . \n moreover , the cuts which reduce photon fsr reduces as well the @xmath1 pair fsr . in addition , analogously to photon fsr , @xmath1 pair fsr is completely negligible at @xmath5factories . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    the most relevant information , how big is the contribution of the process @xmath10 in comparison to the main process used in the radiative return method , mainly @xmath29 , is presented in fig.[f2 ] for da@xmath4ne energy , both without any cuts ( fig.[f2]a ) , and with cuts resembling kloe event selection @xcite ( fig.[f2]b ) . the results of @xmath29 cross section were obtained using phokhara 3.0 mc generator @xcite and in the following , whenever we refer to @xmath29 cross section we mean cross section obtained using phokhara 3.0 . as one can see from fig.[f2 ] , the contribution of the @xmath1 pair production is below 0.5% , independently on the cuts . \n it is @xmath25 dependant , being big for low @xmath25 values . \n even if it is small , this 0.5% contribution can become important , when aiming at the precision below , or of the order of 1% , for the @xmath30 cross section measurement . at @xmath5factories , the relative contribution of the pair production might be as big as 0.9% ( fig.[f4]a ) and it is again @xmath25 and cut dependent ( fig.[f4]b ) . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    -0.4 cm    -0.2 cm -0.2 cm \n -0.4 cm    as stated already , isr of electron pairs can be treated in a similar way as isr of photons resulting in the change of radiator function in the radiative return method . \n however , one can alternatively try to treat it as a background to the process with photon(s ) emission . in this case , the most natural way of reducing that background is to veto the electron ( positron ) in the final state . in fig.[f3 \n ] we show an example of such a procedure performed for @xmath4factory energy . \n we assume here that an electron or positron can be seen , and the event rejected , if its angle with respect to the beam axis is bigger then 20@xmath31 . \n fig.[f3]a shows that up to 50% of the events pass the rejection procedure , when no other cuts are applied . \n however , in the case of kloe event selection , which requires that the @xmath1 pair is emitted along the beam axis , one rejects only a small fraction of these events ( fig.[f3]b ) . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    the situation is completely different at @xmath5factories , where one can almost completely reduce the background coming from @xmath1 pairs ( fig.[f5 ] ) , by rejecting the events with at least one charged lepton , electron or positron , in the detector . \n we have constructed the monte carlo generator ekhara , which simulates the reaction @xmath0 based on initial and final state emission of a @xmath1 pair from @xmath2 production diagram . \n a detailed study of this process , as a potential background for @xmath3 measurement via radiative return method , shows that it can become important , when the experimental precision will reach 1% , or better . \n m.  davier , s.  eidelman , a.  hcker and z.  zhang , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 2549, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "recent experimental work  @xcite in ultracold molecule physics has formed fermionic dipolar molecules of @xmath0k and @xmath1rb in their rovibrational and hyperfine ground state . \n quantum degenerate dipolar systems have long been sought after because their long - range interactions makes them interesting for quantum computing applications and for understanding ordered phases that can arise from long range effects . \n these systems are both complicated , but tunable , because the long range , anisotropic dipolar interaction can be manipulated with an external electric field  @xcite , and should give rise to rich physics with variety of different ordered phases of matter  @xcite . \n the dipolar interaction is attractive if the dipole moments are aligned head to tail , and this can lead to undesirable recombination effects if the molecules have an exothermic reaction possible , as with @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules @xcite . \n this can be mitigated by confining molecules to a narrow two - dimensional layer , and setting a strong electric field perpendicular to this layer , so that the dipole moments of molecules are aligned with the external field and always align head - to - head and tail - to - tail . in this case , the inter - molecule interactions are always repulsive . \n note that we assume we can create a single isolated plane of dipoles , so there is no possibility to form superfluid pairing between planes , where the interactions are attractive again  @xcite . \n we assume the dipolar molecules are loaded onto a single square optical lattice with the molecules fully polarized perpendicular to the plane . \n since the @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules can be prepared in their lowest hyperfine nuclear spin state , the internal spin degree of freedom is effectively frozen out , and the molecules can be described as spinless fermions . \n previous studies of spinless fermion models  @xcite mostly focused on short range interactions and used the simplification of going to the limit of large spatial dimensions . \n these works show a rich phase diagram with charge - density - wave ordering and phase separation . \n there also has been some work in two dimensions focused on stripe physics  @xcite . \n more recent work , carried out in the context of ultracold dipolar molecules  @xcite , focused primarily on finding new exotic phases ( liquid crystal , smectic , or nematic ) , often achieved by tuning the direction of the external field with respect to the plane of molecules , but has not elucidated the details of the full phase diagram for the density - wave phases . \n the paper is organized as follows : first , in sec . \n [ sec : formalism ] we introduce the model and describe the possible density - wave orderings . \n [ sec : method ] provides the details of the mean - field - theory formalism and the numerical calculations . \n the results are presented in sec . \n [ sec : results ] , and they are further discussed in sec . \n [ sec : discuss ] , which are followed by the conclusions in sec . \n [ sec : conclude ] . \n we describe the rovibrational ground - state dipolar molecules in their lowest hyperfine state with the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator for a fermionic dipolar molecule at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the number operator , @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude between the adjacent sites , and @xmath9 is the long - range dipole interaction , with @xmath10 the position vector for the site @xmath11 . the lattice spacing is taken to be equal to one . with this model \n , we have assumed that the hopping occurs only between nearest - neighbor sites , and that the molecules are always in the lowest level of the periodic optical lattice potential ( this second assumption is not always true when the interaction between the molecules is too large ) . \n we have also assumed that the form for the dipole interaction is valid even when the distance between molecules is only one lattice spacing .    due to the bipartite nature of the square lattice , \n the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a particle - hole symmetric form and one can restrict to fillings that satisfy @xmath12 . \n since there is no spin degree of freedom in this model , it can only support molecule density wave spatial order . \n such order is described by its unit cell  a parallelogram spanned by the two fundamental translation vectors for a given density wave order . \n the area of the unit cell ( @xmath13 ) gives the number of sites with independent average molecule density which is modulated periodically as the unit cell is tiled across the lattice . \n the number of the independent order parameters for this density wave is equal to @xmath14 ( the average density , or filling , is not counted as an order parameter , and is fixed in the calculation ) . \n since there is only a finite number of non - equivalent unit cells of a given area on a square lattice , there is only a finite number of possible density wave orders . \n we have considered all such orders that have up to four different order parameters ( @xmath15 ) and hence this is a restricted phase diagram restricted to low - period phases only . \n the corresponding fundamental translation vectors and the unit cells for the twelve candidate phases are shown in fig .  [ \n tab : clusters ] . \n m1.6 in m1.6 in    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     & & 0.1 +    another , less direct way to observe spatial order is time - of - flight measurements that use the expansion of the molecular cloud to infer the initial momentum distribution of the molecules . \n however , the momentum distribution data do not show prominent differences amongst the different ordered phases , so using this approach to detect the ordering is difficult . \n the mft results show a diverse phase diagram with a number of distinct density - wave phases . \n however , the mft is an approximate method , which neglects fluctuations and favors ordered states . \n this brings to mind the question : _ how many of these density - wave phases are actually present in the exact solution _ ?    in the limit @xmath16 , the hamiltonian essentially describes a lattice gas model and can be solved numerically without approximation using classical monte carlo methods . \n preliminary results support the existence of the checkerboard ( 2b ) and 4d phases , although strongly suppressed in temperature and filling , compared to the mft result . \n since the mft neglects fluctuations , it is not surprising that the range of ordered phases is contracted in a more precise calculation . \n however , some higher - period phases become more prominent in the mft solution for intermediate values of @xmath17 , so their presence can not be entirely ruled out by this @xmath16 study \n . a more complete study will be the topic of further research . \n also , the phase separation needs to be reviewed using better approximation techniques . \n the presence of phase separation is tied to the existence of higher - period phases and the fact that the mft strongly stabilizes these phases at the corresponding commensurate fillings . \n thus , phase separation is promoted by the mft just like the corresponding ordered phases are . \n it is possible that including even higher order phases ( beyond 4 order parameters ) in a mft study would replace the phase - separated regions with higher - period ordered phases that are commensurate at the corresponding values of filling , yielding a devil s staircase - like structure . \n another possible alternative to phase separation is the formation of a wigner crystal like state . \n the reentrant behavior of the checkerboard phase at @xmath18 in the mft results is very likely an artifact of this method and should be reexamined using more precise techniques . \n it is notable that the mft results do not favor stripes that are aligned with the lattice ( corresponding to phases 2a , 3a , 4a or 5a ) . \n we found that these phases are either not stable or they are replaced by other phases with lower free energy . for small @xmath17 , good nesting of the fermi surface appears to be important to lower the energy of the system , while for large @xmath17 , strong repulsive interactions between adjacent sites prevents formation of such striped phases . \n we also see no evidence for any nematic or smectic `` liquid - crystal '' phases . \n another important question is , _ which of these density - wave phases can be reached and detected in experiment _ ? \n the mft results show large entropy per particle when the checkerboard state develops at half filling for large interaction , but unfortunately the entropy is severely overestimated in this study , as shown by preliminary monte - carlo results . \n the most easily observable features in experiment are the structure factors and the gap in the density of states at the commensurate values of filling . \n these features are most pronounced for the checkerboard phase . in a trap environment \n , a large gap at half filling should translate into large spatial regions of checkerboard order if the local density approximation is accurate . \n of course , it is not clear if phases that are seen in a homogeneous system are stabilized or destabilized by the trap environment . \n this is another question to be addressed in a future study . \n we have studied the ordering of ultracold diatomic gases on a two - dimensional square optical lattice . we have formulated a model , based on spinless fermions with long range dipole interactions , and solved it using mean field theory . \n we have found a number of possible density - wave orders that occur mostly around the corresponding commensurate values of filling and create gaps in the density of states at these values of the filling . \n the phase separation is also often seen between different ordered phases in the mft results . \n overall , the checkerboard phase is most stable near half filling and has the highest transition temperature . due to the lack of an energy scale associated with spin exchange , the transition temperatures increase with interaction strength . \n different density wave phases show characteristic and distinct structure factors . \n we have discussed the validity of these results and the limitations of the mft method used in this study . \n this work was supported by a muri grant from air force office of scientific research numbered fa9559 - 09 - 1 - 0617 and from a grant of hpc resources from the arctic region supercomputing center at the university of alaska fairbanks as part of the department of defense high performance computing modernization program . \n we also acknowedge support from the mcdevitt endowment fund . \n n.  g.  zhang and c.  l.  henley , phys . \n b * 68 * , 014506 ( 2003 ) ; n .- \n g .  zhang and c.  l.  henley , eur . \n j.  b * 38 * , 409 ( 2004 ) ; u.  hizi and c.  l.  henley , europhys . \n lett .  * 65 * , 228 ( 2004 ) ; s.  a.  cheong and c.  l.  henley , phys . \n b * 74 * , 165121 ( 2006 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 4121337202325, "RequestID": "182e3b742bd74416950dc262fb9dd457", "TotalTokens": 2724}

ray transient accreting pulsar , began a giant outburst in late november 2009 @xcite . \n the flux rose rapidly to nearly 6 crab in the 12 - 25 kev and 25 - 50 kev bands and about 2 - 3 crab in the 8 - 12 kev and 50 - 100 kev bands on december 10 , 2009 . \n the light curve of this outburst is shown in figure  [ a0535_giant ] . \n the 12 - 25 and 25 - 50 kev bands track each other closely and both agree well with swift / bat . \n the a0535 + 262 giant outburst is not detected in daily averages in the 100 - 300 kev band . since _ \n fermi _ was launched , a0535 + 262 underwent four normal outbursts prior to the giant outburst . \n figure  [ a0535_normal ] shows the comparison between gbm and swift / bat data for these outbursts . \n pulsations from a0535 + 262 are detected with the gbm pulsar monitoring technique @xcite . \n * h1417624 * is be / x - ray transient pulsar with a 17.5 s period @xcite that began a giant outburst in late october 2009 . \n gbm detects h1417624 in the 12 - 25 and 25 - 50 kev bands , which are summed and compared with swift / bat in figure  [ h1417 ] \n . considerable scatter is visible in the h1417624 light curve prior to the giant outburst . \n this is likely due to nearby nsources that undergo earth occultation at close to the same time as h1417624 . \n the pulsations from h1417624 are detected by the gbm pulsar monitoring technique @xcite . \n * xte j1752 - 223 * , a new black hole transient discovered on october 23 , 2009 , with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ \n figure  [ xtej1752 ] shows the gbm light curves in 5 energy bands , spanning 8 - 300 kev . \n this transient is one of seven sources detected with gbm above 100 kev @xcite . \n xte j1752223 rose to a plateau in all bands from 12 - 300 kev for about 30 days . \n then the source began brightening again . from examining the gbm light curves , this increase appears stronger in the 25 - 50 kev band than in the 12 - 25 kev range , suggesting possible spectral changes . \n * sco x-1 * is a bright z - source . \n gbm detects it easily in less than a day in the 8 - 12 , 12 - 25 , and 25 - 50 kev bands . \n sco x-1 is so bright that we have the potential to use single occultation steps for analysis . \n figure  [ scox1 ] shows daily average fluxes . \n * grs 1915 + 105 * is a microquasar . \n gbm detects grs 1915 + 105 on a daily basis in the 8 - 12 , 12 - 25 , and 25 - 50 kev , and 50 - 100 kev and on longer timescales in the 100 - 300 kev band @xcite . \n figure  [ grs1915 ] shows three lower energy bands . \n * cyg x-3 * is a probable black - hole system . \n gbm detects cyg x-3 on a daily basis in the 8 - 12 , 12 - 25 , and 25 - 50 kev bands . \n state changes are detected with gbm and agree well with swift / bat , as shown in figure  [ cygx3 ] .          using the earth occultation technique , \n we have monitored cen a since august 2008 . \n cen a is detected on a daily basis in the 12 - 25 kev band and over longer timescales in the 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , and 100 - 300 kev bands . \n see figure  [ cena ] and cherry et al . \n ( 2009 ) for more discussion . \n two additional extra - galactic sources , mrk 421 and 3c 454.3 have recently been added to the occultation catalog and monitoring is underway . \n as we iteratively improve our bright source list of x - ray binaries , we will be able to better investigate fainter sources such as active galaxies and search for flaring activity . \n the earth occultation technique can be applied to the higher energy bgo detectors on gbm , essentially using identical software as for the nai detectors . \n the bgo energy channel edges differ more significantly than the nai edges , so fluxes are computed for the bgo detectors separately . \n the lower energy bounds of the ctime channels are for bgo 0 : 0.18 , 0.34 , 0.97 , 2.1 , 4.6 , 9.8 , 21 , and 45 mev and for bgo 1 are : 0.10 , 0.38 , 0.93 , 2.1 , 4.8 , 10 , 22 , 46 mev . in addition , many of the sources that are very bright that must be considered as interfering sources in the nais , e.g. sco x-1 , are not at all bright in the bgos , so source interference must be addressed carefully as well . \n code to monitor sources using the bgos has just been developed . \n a light curve for the crab is shown in figure  [ crab_bgo ] for the 100 - 380 kev band in bgo 1 , to demonstrate that preliminary runs have been successful . \n the gbm earth occultation technique is working well . agreement with swift / bat is good in the 15 - 50 kev range . \n currently 64 sources are being monitored . of these \n , we have preliminary detections for 42 sources in at least one of the energy bands between 8 kev and 300 kev . \n future plans for the earth occultation project include monitoring sources using the bgo detectors , expanding the catalog to include more extra - galactic sources , and application of the technique to cspec data . \n the gbm earth occultation project is a funded fermi guest investigation . \n this paper uses quicklook results provided by the asm / rxte team and swift / bat transient monitor results provided by the swift / bat team .    9 e. beklen & m.h . \n finger , atel # 3276 ( 2009 ) . \n m. cherry et al . , proceedings of the fermi symposium , econf c091122 ( 2009 ) . \n harmon et al . \n apjs , 138 , 149 ( 2002 ) . \n harmon et al . \n apjs , 154 , 585 ( 2004 ) . \n finger et al . \n , proceedings of the fermi symposium , econf c091122 ( 2009 ) . \n c.b.markwardt et al . , atel # 2258 ( 2009 ) . \n meegan et al . , \n apj , 702 , 791 ( 2009 ) . \n wilson -

{"ContextTokens": 3917, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "fragmentation functions are important ingredient for understanding the structure of the hadrons , because they play a crucial role in analyzing the processes involving hadrons . for example \n , one needs the unpolarized fragmentation functions to analyze the semi - inclusive processes in the electron - positron scattering , deep - inelastic proton - proton scattering , and so on  @xcite . \n furthermore , to extract the chiral - odd transversity parton distribution of the nucleon one needs more complicated fragmentation functions , such as the polarized dihadron fragmentation functions and the collins fragmentation functions . because of their fundamental importance \n , those functions have been studied intensively for decades but still not fully understood yet . \n the unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath2 represents the probability for a quark @xmath3 to emit a hadron @xmath4 with the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath5 . \n it can be written with the light - cone coordinate as follows  @xcite : @xmath6|_{zk^-=p^-}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath7=@xmath8 and the correlation @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 indicate the four - momenta for the initial quark and fragmented hadron , respectively . \n furthermore , @xmath5 is the longitudinal light - cone momentum fraction possessed by the hadron and @xmath13 denotes a renormalization scale at which the fragmentation process is computed . \n all the calculations are carried out in the frame where the @xmath5-axis is chosen to be the direction of @xmath14 . consequently the transverse momentum of the initial quark @xmath15 is zero in this frame . on the other hand , @xmath16\\,\\bm{p}$ ] , defined as the transverse momentum of the initial quark with respect to the direction of the momentum of the produced hadron , is nonzero . \n the integrated fragmentation function satisfies the momentum sum rule : @xmath17 where @xmath4 represents all the fragmented hadrons . \n ( [ eq : sum ] ) means that all of the momentum of the initial quark @xmath3 is transferred into the momenta of the fragmented hadrons . \n empirically , information of @xmath18 has to be extracted from the available high - energy lepton - scattering data by global analysis with appropriate parameterizations satisfying certain constraints  @xcite .    from theoretical points of view \n , it is impossible to study fragmentation functions directly by lattice qcd because they are defined in minkowski space . \n nevertheless , there have been numerous works for the fragmentation functions based on the effective qcd models so far . in ref . \n @xcite , the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model has been used to calculate the fragmentation functions . \n monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations with supersymmetric qcd were also carried out to obtain the fragmentation function up to a very high energy in the center - of - mass frame @xmath19  @xcite . \n the collins fragmentation functions , which play an essential role in the transverse - spin physics , have been studied as well in the quark - pseudoscalar ( ps ) meson coupling model  @xcite . \n note that dihadron fragmentation functions have been investigated in the same theoretical formalism  @xcite . for brevity \n , we will simply call the unpolarized fragmentation functions as the fragmentation functions from now on .    in refs . \n @xcite , we have already employed the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nlchqm ) with the explicit flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking to calculate the elementary fragmentation functions . \n this instanton - motivated approaches were used for computing the quark distribution amplitudes , manifesting the nonlocal quark - pseudoscalar ( ps ) meson interactions  @xcite . \n nlchqm have been applied to determine various nonperturbative quantities and obtained the results which are in good agreement with experiments as well as lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations  @xcite . \n the elementary fragmentation functions calculated in refs . \n @xcite are the functions in eq.([eq : cor1 ] ) with the following approximation : @xmath20 here @xmath21 denotes the ps meson . in other words \n , we just calculate the one -
