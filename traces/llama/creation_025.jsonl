Now a French airplane manufacturer thinks it has a solution to keep those Americans comfortable when they take to the skies. According to NBC News, Airbus filed a patent application for a bench seat on Feb. 11. The patent shows three different seat-belt configurations that would allow three average-sized passengers, two obese passengers, or two adults with two small children to use the bench. The design also calls for various armrests that can pop down depending on the passenger configuration. The \"utilization of space available in a passenger cabin is of major economic importance,\" the patent application notes. And seating in an aircraft \"should be as flexibly, rapidly, and easily re-configurable as possible.\" The patent application doesn't specifically mention obese passengers, focusing instead on families, senior citizens, and passengers with mobility issues. But CBS reports it could be used to charge obese passengers more, as the bench would otherwise be able to accommodate three to four passengers. An Airbus spokesperson says the company isn't necessarily developing the bench, as it files \"hundreds of patents each year.\" But NBC notes the new design hasn't faced the quick online backlash usually seen by other proposed seating alternatives for obese passengers. However, there is one aspect to the new seats that could give all passengers pause: They don't recline.", "StartTimeOffset": 3772092432, "RequestID": "a56a34b929d34410893d1ebea2ebdb16", "TotalTokens": 1126}

The New York Times has details from Pantaleo's Nov. 21 grand jury testimony as described by his lawyer, Stuart London. London says the 29-year-old testified that he wasn't trying to use a chokehold, but rather a wrestling-style move he learned at the police academy: The intention was to hook one arm under Garner's arm, encircle Garner's torso with the other, and cause Garner to lose his balance and fall. Except Pantaleo says he got scared as the two struggled, and one arm shifted to Garner's neck. After the two went down, Pantaleo says he didn't yet move his arm because he was trying to get his own balance back and wanted to keep Garner from potentially biting arriving officers. London says Pantaleo did hear Garner say he couldn't breathe, and \"that's why he attempted to get off as quick as he could.\" But the Times points out that video from the scene shows \"Officer Pantaleo holding firm and not appearing to hurry to get off Mr. Garner.\" More: One lawyer speculates to the Times that the grand jury's decision was likely influenced by the autopsy report, which included obesity, a weak heart, and asthma as contributing factors along with the chokehold and chest compression: \"There were so many causes of death in the autopsy report.\" Thousands of protesters gathered at several locations in the city last night, including Times Square, for protests that remained largely peaceful, CNN reports. Demonstrators briefly blocked the West Side Highway, the Lincoln Tunnel, and the Brooklyn Bridge.

It's possible to get infected through contact with armadillos in the US, says one infectious-diseases specialist, but the risk is low. It's also possible to get infected through \"prolonged close contact\" with others who have the disease, though probably not through casual contact. Plus, an estimated 95% of people are naturally immune. California officials are not overly concerned about contagion, the Los Angeles Times reports, but the Press-Enterprise notes that the school saw a high number of absences after the diagnoses. A significant number of the estimated 6,500 people in the US with Hansen's disease were born in another country, and may have contracted it there; transmission is more common in some African, Asian, and South American countries. The disease is caused by a bacterium, and it can take two to 10 years before an infected person shows symptoms. As CBS LA notes, leprosy is commonly associated with peeling skin and sores. It can be easily treated with antibiotics, but if untreated, Hansen's disease can permanently damage the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes; it can even paralyze or blind sufferers. The children's school disinfected classrooms, but \"almost all of it will be overkill because this disease is not that contagious,\" says the specialist.

In a study titled, \"To pee or not to pee: urine signals mediate aggressive interactions in the cooperatively breeding cichlid,\" researchers explain that urination for the cichlid fish is not only a bodily function but also a form of communication, per Science. To figure that out, they injected the fish with a dye that turned urine blue, then measured a fish's urine while it was kept separate from other fish. Researchers then placed a larger cichlid and a smaller cichlid in the same tank, separated by a transparent barrier. When the fish spotted each other, they swam toward the barrier in an aggressive manner with fins raised and peed. Researchers say the fish clearly used their fins to communicate visually. But the fish also gave off a chemical signal with urine. In cases where the barrier had tiny holes allowing water to flow through, for example, the smaller fish appeared to get a signal from the larger fish to stop their attack since they were more likely to show aggression when the barrier was solid. Both the smaller and larger fish also peed more when presented with another fish than they did when alone, especially when the barrier between them kept them from receiving the other fish's signals.

The judgment represents three times the profit of $3.7 million Tiffany is said to have lost to Costco over the 2,500 or so rings sold through the warehouse club, plus $8.25 million in punitive damages awarded by a jury last year. Swain also barred Costco from selling any item with the name \"Tiffany\" on it, unless it's qualified by words such as \"setting,\" \"style,\" or \"set\" to make it clear it's not an official Tiffany product.

The band was criticized as insensitive for going ahead with their show after the between-sets death, but Armstrong says the band not only didn't know about the death, they didn't know there were acrobats performing between sets, Rolling Stone reports. \"All of us were in disbelief\" after the show when they heard about the death, Armstrong said. \"I don't know why the authorities chose not to tell us about the accident before our concert.\" \"What happened to Pedro is unthinkable,\" he said, adding that the band is \"heartbroken\" for his friends and family, and for anybody who had to witness the tragedy.", "StartTimeOffset": 352347882343, "RequestID": "613b619aad3445b4a48515596fe202f9", "TotalTokens": 1586}

What was ailing the nonagenarian turned out to be more horrifying than her family could have imagined, and now a judge has ordered the home to pay them $250,000 for wrongful death and for violating the Illinois Nursing Home Care Act, the Daily Herald reports. After a maggot was spotted moving in McCann's ear on Sept. 16, 2012, by a nursing home worker, she was whisked to a local hospital. There, her daughter watched as \"the larvae of flies crawled out of her mother's left ear\" as 57 maggots were removed, Chicago Tribune originally reported; it's thought that a fly landed in her ear and laid the eggs. McCann had been diagnosed with wax buildup a little over a week before the maggots were discovered and was prescribed eardrops, CBS News noted; Lutheran says she had received drops the night before her hospital visit. \"How can you put drops of medicine in an ear that has 57 maggots?\" the family's lawyer asked CBS in a November 2012 interview. After the maggots were taken out, the Herald notes, McCann lost her appetite, started humming, and died a few months later at another nursing home her family had moved her to. \"The maggot infestation in her left ear created this geriatric cascade that led to her death,\" their attorney notes to the Herald. The nursing home's administrator told the Tribune in 2012 what happened to McCann was simply \"a freak occurrence that has nothing to do with the care she was provided.\" (An Indian man reportedly had 50 maggots taken out of his nose and sinuses.)", "StartTimeOffset": 354758443584, "RequestID": "56052cd74016408cb598c79ed4bd9790", "TotalTokens": 1500}

Earlier studies found dogs could identify a face they knew from one they didn't, but the latest research suggests they actually recognize emotions, Smithsonian reports.

But, a new study shows sexting can be a part of a healthy, satisfying sex life and is far more common than you might think. In a survey of 870 adults between the ages of 18 and 82, a whopping 88% of respondents reported that they've engaged in sexting\u2014for purposes of the study defined as sending or receiving sexually explicit material via text\u2014while 82% said they had sexted in the past year. Nearly 75% of people reported sexting within the bounds of a committed relationship, and NPR reports there were similar levels of sexting between men and women. The research was released at the American Psychological Association's annual convention this week. \"Given the possible implications, both positive and negative, for sexual health, it is important to continue investigating the role sexting plays in current romantic and sexual relationships,\" says a co-author, per a press release. For example, the study shows greater levels of sexting corresponded with greater overall sexual satisfaction and greater relationship satisfaction for couples. While researchers aren't sure whether more sexting results in better sex lives or better sex lives result in more sexting, they are hopeful sexting\u2014with further research\u2014could become a part of helping couples in therapy, NPR notes.

The belief goes that, when it comes to mates, rich men care about physical attractiveness more than any other attribute (like level of education or success), while attractive women care more about money than anything else (like physical appearance). But researchers found, when looking at a nationally representative sample of couples, \"handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women,\" says sociologist and lead author Elizabeth McClintock. She also found that it's fairly rare for an attractive woman from a lower social class to move upward via marriage, according to the press release\u2014and, in fact, men are just as likely to do so, New York reports. \"High-status men\" do, on average, have more attractive wives, McClintock notes, but that's because the men themselves are also considered more attractive than their less successful counterparts.

Specifically, Netherlands researchers found that death rates in developed countries rose for people 40-44 and 70-74 as the GDP ticked up. Every 1% rise in the GDP translated into an increase in the death rate for both groups of about 0.36%. So what's going on?

The New York Times reports on the six, ranging in age from 16 to 18, gunning for the $99,636-a-year post. The influx of minors into the race is a result of the state's rules not imposing any age restrictions, which has led local lawmakers to lobby for an age mandate to avoid in the future what the Times deems \"a carnival-like note.\" Specifically, a state House bill is in motion to require all candidates to have been residents in Kansas for at least four consecutive years, and to be of voting age in Kansas. \"As soon as they turn 18, if they want to run for the legislature, knock yourself out,\" bill sponsor Rep.

Using mice for a study published online in Nature, the researchers found one set of about 200 neurons that release two different neuropeptides that help brain cells talk to each other (and those same peptides are especially active in the part of the human brain that influences breathing). Another set of 200 neurons excited by the peptides made the animals' breathing rate jump from 40 sighs an hour to 400 sighs an hour. If one peptide set was blocked, the mice sighed only half as much; both sets blocked meant sighing ceased. (Popular Science notes the animals' regular breathing remained unchanged.) Not good, as scientists say sighing is a \"life-sustaining reflex.\" Increased oxygen brought in by sighing is needed to reinflate the lungs' alveoli sacs, which occasionally collapse. \"The only way to pop [the alveoli] open again is to sigh, which brings in twice the volume of a normal breath,\" study co-author Jack Feldman says in the release. \"If you don't sigh, your lungs will fail over time.\" This is probably why humans sigh about 12 times an hour, animals even more, Popular Science notes. But researchers still aren't sure how the emotional component of sighing\u2014Nature points out that people tend to sigh when they're sad, relieved, or tired\u2014plays into the process, the Guardian reports. \"It may be that neurons in the brain areas that process emotion are triggering the release of the sigh neuropeptides, but we don't know that,\" Feldman says. Being able to control the sigh rate in the future could potentially allow scientists to help people with certain disorders: For example, those with anxiety disorders who sigh a lot may benefit from decreased sigh rates, while people with breathing issues may get relief from more sighing, NPR notes.

The complaint says the statement is defamation that has exposed her to \"hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame,\" Politico reports. Cohen made the remark in February when discussing a $130,000 payment he said he had made to Daniels out of his own funds before the 2016 election Cohen, who denies Trump had an affair with Daniels in 2006, says he has the right to claim $20 million from her for violating a nondisclosure agreement. Sources tell the AP that Trump, who has publicly remained silent on Daniels, boasted to guests at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend that she owes another $1 million every time she talks and the interview makes the total $21 million. Friends of Trump tell the Washington Post that the president is \"not in a punch-back mode\" because he has little to gain from firing back, though they say the allegations have put strain on his marriage. White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said Monday that the president has \"strongly, clearly, and consistently\" denied the claims.

The carjacker shot the driver twice, then was confronted by two armed bystanders, one of whom opened fire, police say. \"He is a hero,\" witness Brian Adams tells KING5. \"This guy could have taken out more people, wounded or killed.\" The bystander who killed the carjacker then got a medical kit and began helping the wounded driver. By most accounts, including in the Olympian, the carjacker was attempting to steal a third vehicle when he was fatally shot. While the incident was unfolding, people inside the Walmart fled outside, believing a shooter was inside the building.

Singh said 14 other students and four teachers were rescued, with six of them hospitalized in critical condition. The fire broke out near the door of the boys' dormitory, trapping the victims as it was the only entrance and the windows have grills, fire department senior official Abu Obaidat Mohamad Saithalimat said. He said the cause was believed to be an electrical short-circuit. A witness says she saw hands reaching out through the grilled windows and heard boys crying and screaming for help, but the fire was too strong for her to do anything, the AP reports.

As such, the mutilation charges against two Michigan doctors have been dismissed. Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, who allegedly performed the surgery, and Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, who allegedly allowed his Livonia clinic to be used, were defendants in America's first female genital mutilation case, which involves 9 alleged victims. Lawyers for the doctors argued the constitutionality point, and US District Judge Bernard Friedman found \"FGM is a 'local criminal activity' which, in keeping with long-standing tradition and our federal system of government, is for the states to regulate, not Congress.\" The Detroit Free-Press explains the federal law was passed under the Commerce clause; Friedman determined there was \"nothing commercial or economic\" about the mutilation, while the prosecution argued interstate commerce can be at play, as when parents drive their girls across state lines to undergo the procedure. As for state regulation, 27 states ban it, and Michigan is included in that list. But its law was passed subsequent to Nagarwala's April 2017 arrest, reports the AP; as such, it can't be applied to the doctors, and so prosecutors were relying on the federal law, which carries a sentence of up to five years. Prosecutors say they will decide whether to appeal the ruling. Nagarwala isn't off the hook, however, and faces conspiracy and obstruction charges that carry a sentence of up to 20 years if she's convicted. The trial is set to begin in April.

Highlights: Grading Trump: Podesta didn\u2019t hold back on his opinion of Trump\u2019s White House.

It wasn\u2019t just the hacking and the release of the information. It was the production and distribution, the trolling, the bots, the churn of fake news that was ostensibly coming out of the emails.\u201d Comey\u2019s dismissal: He asserted that the White House\u2019s original reasoning for dismissing FBI Director James Comey was a \u201ccomplete misreading of reality.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s laughable,\u201d he said, \u201creally laughable that Donald Trump would fire Jim Comey because of his interference which damaged Hillary Clinton.

The AP reports Horace Roberts was released from prison Oct. 3 and fully exonerated Monday in the death of Terry Yvette Cheek, the co-worker with whom he was having an affair. Her strangled body was found alongside a highway in Riverside County, Calif., in April 1998, next to what seemed like telltale clues: Roberts' truck and a Lorus wristwatch believed to be his.

Per the BBC, health officials in the UK have set new guidelines regarding the bacterial infection Mycoplasma genitalium, or MG, out of fear improper treatment could lead to antibiotic resistance. Huffington Post UK reports the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) wants the public and healthcare providers to be aware of MG because it's not one of the infections sexual health officials commonly test for and, if untreated, it can lead to serious and lasting problems, especially in women. For them, untreated MG can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which can in turn make it difficult to get pregnant. Men can experience discharge and inflammation of the urethra. It is not known whether MG affects a man's fertility. Scientists have known about MG since the 1980s, however it wasn't until 2015 that the bacteria was shown to be transmitted sexually between partners. While rare (only around 2% of people in Britain are believed to carry it), MG is difficult to treat and often has no symptoms. Britain's new guidelines specify that healthcare providers should use a nucleic acid amplification test to diagnose MG and that, should testing not be possible, a patient should be treated as if they do have the disease. Per the Telegraph, the guidelines stipulate that MG is to be treated with a week-long course of the antibiotic doxycycline followed by a second antibiotic course with azithromycin.

He tried to clarify his stance to the Japan Times on Thursday, saying that while he is against Nazism and does believe the Nazis killed people, he does not think \"toxic gas\" was employed at Auschwitz. In an interview with Reuters, he also emphasized that he thought the death tolls in both instances were inflated, \"a stance common among Japanese ultra-nationalists,\" per Reuters. He says, \"What I wanted to say was that it is said that 6 million or 7 million were killed [in the Holocaust], but was that not several tens of thousands?\" The Times notes Takasu is a widely known cosmetic surgeon in Japan, in part because he appears in TV commercials that run almost daily.

JAB is better known for the growing stable of brands it owns or has a big stake in, including Peet's Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee, Keurig Green Mountain, and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. Rumors of a deal for Panera have been swirling for days, with Starbucks one of the companies reportedly interested.

The driver of the vehicle, who thought he'd been cut off, began tailing Munoz and honking his horn, Munoz tells the Yuma Sun. What happened next was caught on Munoz's GoPro. With Munoz stopped at a red light, the driver, identified as Lee Schismenos, 51, stepped out of his car and approached the couple. \"You got a problem?\" Munoz asked. \"Yeah, I got a f****** problem,\" Schismenos responded, before appearing to punch Munoz in the face.

Behind him, a huge screen showed a \"Les Deplorables\" poster. Aaron Blake at the Washington Post notes that while Trump and others have commented about disarming Clinton's bodyguards before, by talking about what would happen, Trump took a comment \"that was worn and not all that interesting and spun it forward with just a few extra words, giving it new life by painting a more violent picture.\" The Miami Herald reports that Trump appears to have mastered the city's complicated politics: His Friday visit included promises to Cuban, Venezuelan, and Haitian-Americans.

An Aurora city official tells the Sun-Star that a doctor was sent to the girl's home after health officials heard that relatives wouldn't bury her because she was alive. According to news.com.au, the doctor used a cardiac monitor to confirm her death, then advised her parents to bury the body soon to prevent the spread of disease\u2014and the Aurora city official confirms to the Sun-Star that she was laid to rest yesterday. The girl had suffered from a severe fever for several days last week and was pronounced dead (the first time) on Saturday, according to the Aurora police chief.

Kerry, speaking after meetings with British Foreign Secretary William Hague, said Assad \"could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week\u2014turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow the full and total accounting.\" But he's not exactly holding his breath, saying Assad \"isn't about to do it.\" He also said any military strikes against Syria would be \"unbelievably small,\" notes Politico, for which he's now taking more heat from critics of the White House's handling of the situation.

The 25-year-old former Army reservist was sent home from Afghanistan in 2014 after being accused of sexually harassing a female soldier, the AP reports. Bradford Glendening, the military lawyer who represented him, says the woman sought a protective order to keep Johnson away from her and her family. The Army sent Johnson stateside, recommending an \"other than honorable discharge.\" \"In his case, it was apparently so egregious, it was not just the act itself,\" Glendening says. \"I'm sure that this guy was the black sheep of his unit.\" He says Johnson was set to be removed from the Army in September 2014 because of the incident, but inexplicably got an honorable discharge months later. In other developments: Johnson had no criminal history, according to authorities. Local court records show his parents were divorced in 1996. He was believed to have shared a two-story tan brick home in Mesquite, a Dallas suburb, with family members. He graduated from John Horn High School in Mesquite, where he was a ROTC member, school district officials say. The military says that for six years starting in 2009, Johnson served in the Army Reserve as a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry. Friends say Johnson didn't seem interested in politics, but his Facebook page suggests otherwise: He liked an assortment of black militant groups, his profile photo showed him wearing a dashiki and raising his fist over the words \"Black Power,\" and his cover shot carried the red, black and green Pan-African flag. One of the groups Johnson liked on Facebook, the African American Defense League, posted a message earlier in the week encouraging violence against police in response to the killing in Louisiana. Another group he liked was the New Black Panther Party, whose leaders have \"long expressed virulently anti-white and anti-Semitic opinions,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Johnson's Facebook page also contained information on Public Enemy member Professor Griff, a fierce critic of police violence who rejected any link to the Dallas shootings. \"'No Mr white officer I do not train snipers to kill cops.'\" he tweeted. A family friend who knows Johnson's mother through church says Johnson was a changed man when he came back from Afghanistan. \"He was withdrawn, didn't want to talk to people anymore, didn't believe in God anymore,\" 62-year-old Myrtle Booker tells the Dallas Morning News. She says he was more interested in guns. \"But all that hating white people\u2014no, we didn't know any of that.\" The Morning News reports that starting in 2015, Johnson worked at Touch of Kindness, an agency that helps children and adults with learning disabilities. He is also believed to have worked for defense contractor General Dynamics at some point, though employees there say they have been told not to speak to the media. Israel Cooper, a friend who played often basketball with Johnson, says he had a \"cool vibe\" and didn't seem violent at all. \"It's the quiet ones that just do the most devastating stuff. You never see it coming. But then it's more expected, like 'I should have known,'\" he says.

The short answer, according to National Geographic: It's not clear. The rhesus macaques in the video are shown at a train station in India, where one of them was apparently shocked by wires and fell unconscious on the tracks. A companion is shown poking it, dragging it around, and even pouring water on it for about 20 minutes before the first monkey eventually revives. The video refers to the monkey giving its pal \"CPR,\" but an expert says we can't know for sure what was really going on or whether the monkey's actions were intentional. \"In this particular case, does the male shaking the body of the injured individual know that by shaking it and dropping it in water, it can reanimate it?\" she asks. Though the answer is not clear, she adds, the video is \"an amazing representation of the complexity of primate behavior.\" She says that not much research has been done into how nonhuman primates react to death, but that scientists have sometimes seen them \"shaking the body of the dead animal, as not accepting its immobility, and also reacting by rough behaviors seemingly aimed at reanimation.\"", "StartTimeOffset": 2060009028721, "RequestID": "3a8435409f4e4113b45462fe2ab60239", "TotalTokens": 1328}

Whether that has anything to do with the shooting, however, remains very much unclear. Details: Recent transactions: Law enforcement sources tell NBC News that Paddock recently made several large gambling transactions. However, it wasn't clear whether they were wins or losses, and \"large\" isn't defined. A regular: Brother Eric Paddock of Florida tells the Washington Post that Stephen was a retiree and seemingly well off, and he loved to spend time at casinos. \"My brother is not like you and me. He plays high stakes video poker. He sends me a text that says he won $250,000 at the casino.\" Eric says he knows of no gambling debts and showed the FBI three years of texts from his brother, none of which mentioned money trouble. Bank robber dad: Paddock's father was a bank robber who was once on the FBI's most-wanted list, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Benjamin Hoskins Paddock escaped from prison in Texas in 1968 when he was eight years into a 20-year sentence. He, too, was described as a frequent gambler. The elder Paddock wasn't re-captured until 1978, in Oregon. He died in 1998. Old habit: Stephen Paddock owned a home in a community for 55-and-older residents in Brevard County, Florida, from 2013-15, though neighbors say he wasn't there much. \u201cHe seemed normal, other than that he lived by gambling,\" says one former neighbor, per TCPalm. \"He was very open about that.\" Paddock also lived in a retirement community in Reno, Nevada, for several years with girlfriend Marilou Danley, and neighbors there recall him as \"reclusive\" and gone frequently on gambling trips. (Danley has been cleared in the shooting.) Apartments: Brother Bruce Paddock says Stephen also made money through apartments he owned with his mother. And in the late 1980s, he worked as \"internal auditor\" for a predecessor of Lockheed Martin, per NBC News. The company says it is cooperating with authorities about his work there. Lawsuit? A man named Stephen Paddock sued the Cosmopolitan hotel and casino in Vegas in 2012, alleging that he slipped on the floor and suffered injuries, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The suit was dismissed two years later when both sides dropped the matter", "StartTimeOffset": 2086043345228, "RequestID": "e03b6c01ed5e4eecb75b72520dce633d", "TotalTokens": 2661}
